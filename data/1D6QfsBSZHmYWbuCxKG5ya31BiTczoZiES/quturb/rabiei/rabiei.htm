      <p>She's fluent in three languages. She's studied everywhere from
        Tehran to Tokyo to Cambridge, Mass. And she's invented a
        space-age material so light and strong that it could
        revolutionize everything from vehicle bumpers to armor to
        biomedical devices. </p>
      <p>The ultra-high-strength composite metal foam created by Afsaneh
        Rabiei is a highlight of a well-traveled career during which the
        researcher has tried to learn everything she can about advanced
        materials. The result: a brand new material that can save energy
        and lives. </p>
      <p>"Basically, it is a new material for all sorts of safety
        devices," said Rabiei, associate professor of mechanical and
        aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University. </p>
      <p>Rabiei's invention isn't the first metal foam, but she says
        it's the strongest. The main weakness of existing metal foams is
        the varying sizes of their cells --- tiny pockets of space
        inside the material. Instead, Rabiei used cells of standard
        sizes and combined them with a metallic matrix to support the
        cell walls. </p>
      <p><b>A light, strong material</b> </p>
      <p>Rabiei has been working on high-performance materials for more
        than 20 years. She studied materials science and engineering
        while getting her undergraduate degree at Sharif University of
        Technology in Tehran, Iran, in 1986. After spending some time in
        industry --- getting more experience in casting, welding and
        materials testing --- she returned to academia and obtained her
        Ph.D. in 1997 from The University of Tokyo. Her work on the
        metal foams began when she was a post-doctoral researcher at
        Harvard University. </p>
      <p>Along the way, she's become fluent in English, Japanese and
        Persian and written four books and dozens of other publications.
        The National Science Foundation awarded her a CAREER award in
        2003, and her goal with the funding was to develop a light,
        strong material that could be used saving lives and energy in
        the aerospace, medical, automotive and other industries. </p>
      <p>After five years of work --- with a group of her students ---
        she has the results. Rough traffic accident calculations show
        that by inserting two pieces of her composite metal foam behind
        the bumper of a car traveling 28 mph, the impact would feel the
        same to passengers as impact traveling at only 5 mph. </p>
      <p><b>Applications: airplanes, boats</b> </p>
      <p>The results are most striking when the material is tested in a
        lab. The test itself is exciting: a high-powered machine smashes
        a piece of steel foam straight down into the base plate of the
        machine, and then does the same thing with a piece of bulk
        steel. </p>
      <p>When she examines the base plates under both samples,
        there&amp;rsquo;s a clear indentation left under the bulk steel
        sample, while the plate under the foam shows no indentation. The
        test shows how the foam absorbed the energy and protected the
        plate, while the steel simply transferred it to the base plate
        with no protection. </p>
      <p>And since the bulk steel is three times heavier than the steel
        foam, it's easy to see how the foam could attract car
        manufacturers looking for a bumper that will improve safety and
        gas mileage. </p>
      <p>Rabiei sees plenty of uses for her invention, including in
        airplanes, boats, and structures that need impact protection
        with maintaining low weight. It's this high strength-to-density
        ratio --- defining a material that's both strong and light ---
        that makes Rabiei's foam unique. </p>
      <p>"This material showed a much higher strength-to-density ratio
        than any metal foam that has ever been reported," she said.<br>

      <p>Researchers at NCSU are joining forces with innovative
        companies to introduce new and enhanced products to the
        marketplace. Research and the commercialization of emerging
        technologies are key synergies of NCSU's mission. In support of
        that mission, the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) promotes
        collaboration with industry partners to move university
        discoveries from the laboratory to the marketplace. We are
        pleased to promote and foster beneficial relationships between
        academia and industry. NCSU is currently seeking an industry
        partner to license a series of new methods for creating
        high-strength, ultra-light composite metallic foams that show 5
        to 6 times greater strength to density ratio and over 7 times
        higher energy absorption than that of currently available
        metallic foams. </p>
      <p>Researchers at NC State have developed, processed, and tested a
        new high-strength ultra-light material that combines the
        advantages of metal matrix composites with metallic foams. Dr.
        Afsaneh Rabiei has produced a new generation of metal foams
        showing 5 to 6 times greater strength to density ratio and over
        7 times higher energy absorption than that of currently
        available metallic foams. As a result, the energy absorption of
        these materials is estimated to be over 80 times greater than
        the bulk material from which the foam is made. Dr. Rabiei was
        interested in maintaining the advantages of metallic foams
        (excellent rigidity/ weight ratio, durability, isotropic
        absorption of energy at low and constant stress) while improving
        the mechanical properties under cyclic compression loading. The
        performance advantages of this metal foam are based on improving
        foam cell structure and reinforcing the cells with a metallic
        matrix. The resulting novel, closed-cell, metallic foam
        composite is made from preform hollow metallic spheres and
        exhibits a strength of over 130 MPa in compression. The
        densification for the new foam occurs at strains of
        approximately 50-65%. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>- Improved strength (over 5 to 6 times higher strength to
        density ratio than that of currently <br>
        available foams) <br>
        - Greater energy absorption (at 50% strain over 65 MJ/m3, which
        is at least 7 times greater than <br>
        that of other foams made from the same materials through
        different techniques) <br>
        - Greater uniformity of cell structure, leading to controlled,
        predictable product deformation under loading <br>
        - Potential for further strengthening the foam through adding
        reinforcements into the matrix <br>
        - Higher capability for manufacturing through machining,
        welding, and joining without the need for adding sandwich
        panels. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> ---&nbsp; The present invention is directed to
        composite metal foams comprising hollow metallic spheres and a
        solid metal matrix. The composite metal foams show high
        strength, particularly in comparison to previous metal foams,
        while maintaining a favorable strength to density ratio. The
        composite metal foams can be prepared by various techniques,
        such as powder metallurgy and casting. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] The present invention is directed to composite metal
        foams and methods of preparation thereof. The composite metal
        foams generally comprise hollow metallic spheres and a solid
        metal matrix. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] Metallic foams are a class of materials with very low
        densities and novel mechanical, thermal, electrical, and
        acoustic properties. In comparison to conventional solids and
        polymer foams, metal foams are light weight, recyclable, and
        non-toxic. Particularly, metal foams offer high specific
        stiffness, high strength, enhanced energy absorption, sound and
        vibration dampening, and tolerance to high temperatures.
        Furthermore, by altering the size and shape of the cells in
        metal foams, mechanical properties of the foam can be engineered
        to meet the demands of a wide range of applications. </p>
      <p>[0005] Various methods are presently known in the art for
        preparing metallic foams. According to one method, metal powders
        are compacted together with suitable blowing agents, and the
        compressed bodies are heated above the solidus temperature of
        the metal matrix and the decomposition temperature of the
        blowing agent to generate gas evolution within the metal. Such
        "self-expanding foams" can also be prepared by stirring the
        blowing agents directly into metal melts. Metallic foams can
        also be prepared as "blown foams" by dissolving or injecting
        blowing gases into metal melts. Metallic foams can also be
        prepared by methods wherein gasses or gas-forming chemicals are
        not used. For example, metal melts can be caused to infiltrate
        porous bodies which are later removed after solidification of
        the melt, leaving pores within the solidified material. </p>
      <p>[0006] Metallic foams have been shown to experience fatigue
        degradation in response to both tension and compression. Plastic
        deformation under cyclic loading occurs preferentially within
        deformation bands, until the densification strain has been
        reached. The bands generally form at large cells in the
        ensemble, mainly because known processes for producing these
        materials do not facilitate formation in a uniform manner. Such
        large cells develop plastically buckled membranes that
        experience large strains upon further cycling and will lead to
        cracking and rapid cyclic straining. As a result, the
        performance of existing foams has not been promising due to
        strong variations in their cell structure (see Y. Sugimura, J.
        Meyer, M. Y. He, H. Bart-Smith, J. Grenstedt, &amp; A. G. Evans,
        "On the Mechanical Performance of Closed Cell Al Alloy Foams",
        Acta Materialia, 45(12), pp. 5245-5259). </p>
      <p>[0007] In the production of closed cell metallic foams, one
        obstacle is the inability to finely control cell size, shape,
        and distribution. This makes it difficult to create a
        consistently reproducible material where the properties are
        known with predictable failure. One method for creating a
        uniform closed cell metallic foam is to use prefabricated
        spheres of a known size distribution and join them together into
        a solid form, such as through sintering of the spheres, thereby
        forming a closed cell hollow sphere foam (HSF). </p>
      <p>[0008] Hollow metal spheres, such as those available from
        Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing and Advanced Materials
        (Dresden, Germany), can be prepared by coating expanded plastic
        spheres (e.g., polystyrene) with a powdered metal suspension.
        The spheres are then placed into a mold and are heated to
        pyrolize the polystyrene and powder binder, and to sinter the
        metal powder into a dense, solid shell. Metal foams previously
        prepared through sintering of such hollow metal spheres are
        plagued by low strength. Foams prepared by sintering metal
        spheres made of stainless steel, when under compression, have
        been shown to undergo densification at a stress of approximately
        2 to 7 MPa, reaching a strain of over 60%. </p>
      <p>[0009] Accordingly, it is desirable to have metallic foams
        wherein cell size, shape, and distribution are controllable, and
        wherein high strength is exhibited. Such goals are achieved by
        the composite metal foams of the present invention and the
        methods of preparation thereof. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0010] The present invention is a composite metallic foam
        comprising hollow metal spheres and a solid metal matrix. The
        foam exhibits low density and high strength. Generally, the
        composite metallic foam is prepared by filling in the spaces
        around the hollow metallic spheres, thus creating a solid
        matrix. Such preparation can be by various methods, including
        powder metallurgy techniques and casting techniques. The
        composite metallic foams of the invention have unique properties
        that provide use in multiple applications, such as marine
        structures, space vehicles, automobiles, and buildings. The
        foams are particularly useful in applications where weight is
        critical and vibration damping, as well as energy absorption,
        are useful, such as blast panels for military applications and
        crumple zones for automotive crash protection. The application
        of the foams can also be extended into biomedical engineering as
        medical implants and even to civil engineering for earthquake
        protection in heavy structures. </p>
      <p>[0011] The composite metal foams of the invention, partly due
        to their controlled porosity (through use of preformed hollow
        metallic pieces) and foam cell wall support (through addition of
        a metal matrix surrounding the hollow metallic pieces), exhibit
        highly improved mechanical properties, particularly under
        compression loading. Accordingly, the strength of the inventive
        composite metal foams is many times higher than other metallic
        hollow sphere foams. Furthermore, the energy absorption of the
        inventive foams is much greater than the bulk material used in
        the foams (on the order of 30 times to 70 times greater), while
        the inventive foams also maintain a density well below that of
        the bulk materials. </p>
      <p>[0012] In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a
        composite metal foam comprising a plurality of hollow pieces
        (preferably hollow metallic pieces) and a metal matrix generally
        surrounding the hollow pieces. The hollow pieces and the matrix
        can be comprised of the same or different materials. In one
        embodiment, the hollow pieces are metallic spheres comprising
        steel, and the metal matrix comprises steel. In another
        embodiment, the metal matrix comprises aluminum, while the
        hollow spheres comprise steel. </p>
      <p>[0013] According to another aspect of the invention, there is
        provided a method of preparing a composite metallic foam
        comprising placing a plurality of hollow metallic pieces in a
        mold and filling the spaces around the hollow metallic pieces
        with a metal matrix-forming material. The method can be carried
        out through the use of various techniques, such as powder
        metallurgy or metal casting. </p>
      <p>[0014] In one particular embodiment according to this aspect of
        the invention, the method comprises the following steps:
        arranging a plurality of hollow metallic pieces in a mold;
        filling the spaces around the hollow metallic pieces with a
        matrix-forming metal powder; and heating the mold to a sintering
        temperature, thereby forming a solid metal matrix around the
        hollow metallic pieces. Various packing techniques, such as
        vibrating the mold according to a specific frequency, or varying
        frequencies, can be used for maximizing packing density of the
        metallic pieces within the mold. Further, such techniques can
        also be used during the step of filling the spaces around the
        hollow metallic pieces to facilitate movement of the metal
        powder through the mold and around the hollow metallic pieces. </p>
      <p>[0015] The method can further comprise applying pressure to the
        hollow metallic pieces and the matrix-forming metal powder
        within the mold, as would commonly be done in powder metallurgy
        techniques. Such compression within the mold can be carried out
        for the duration of the sintering step of the method. </p>
      <p>[0016] According to another embodiment of the invention, the
        method comprises the following steps: arranging a plurality of
        hollow metallic pieces in a mold; casting a matrix-forming
        molten metal into the mold, thereby filling the spaces around
        the hollow metallic pieces; and solidifying the liquid metal,
        thereby forming a metal matrix around the hollow metallic
        pieces. As noted above, various packing techniques, such as
        vibrating the mold, can be used for maximizing packing density
        of the metallic pieces within the mold. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0034] The invention now will be described more fully
        hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
        which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. These
        embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be
        thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the
        invention to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the invention may
        be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed
        as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these
        embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy
        applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification, and
        in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", "the",
        include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates
        otherwise. </p>
      <p>[0035] The composite metallic foam of the present invention
        combines the advantages of metal matrix composites with the
        advantages of metallic foams to provide higher strength metallic
        foams of controlled porosity. The inventive metal foams
        generally comprise a plurality of hollow metallic pieces and a
        metal matrix filling the spaces around the metallic pieces. </p>
      <p>[0036] Metal matrix composites are generally understood to be
        metals that are reinforced with various materials. Such
        materials can include natural or synthetic fibers or particulate
        matter. Materials particularly useful include boron, silicon
        carbide, graphite, alumina tungsten, beryllium, titanium, and
        molybdenum. Fibers may be continuous filaments or discontinuous
        fibers. Examples of natural discontinuous fibers include hair or
        whiskers. The reinforcements, of which the above are only
        non-limiting examples thereof, can be chosen for specific
        purposes, such as increasing stiffness, strength, heat
        resistance, and wear resistance. Combining the advantages of
        metal matrix composites with the advantages of metal foams
        results in the composite metal foams of the invention, which
        exhibit increased strength, as well as additional beneficial
        properties as discussed herein. </p>
      <p>[0037] The composite metal foams of the invention comprise
        hollow pieces. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the
        hollow pieces are spherical in shape (i.e., "hollow spheres").
        While such a shape is particularly useful, the hollow pieces
        comprising the metal foam can also take on other geometric
        shapes as could be beneficial for imparting improved properties
        to the finished composite metal foam. For simplicity, the hollow
        pieces used in the invention are described herein by the
        particular spherical embodiment. However, description of the
        hollow pieces as spheres is not intended to limit the scope of
        the hollow pieces, which can take on other shapes. </p>
      <p>[0038] The hollow spheres used in the composite metal foams of
        the invention can comprise any material that would be useful for
        providing strength in an overall composite foam of the invention
        and can withstand the preparation process, such as powder
        metallurgy or casting, as described herein. In one preferred
        embodiment, the hollow spheres are metallic. </p>
      <p>[0039] Hollow metallic spheres, according to the invention, can
        comprise any metal generally recognized as being useful for
        preparing metal foams, metal matrix composites, or other metal
        components useful in various industries, such as automotive,
        aerospace, construction, safety materials, and the like.
        Particularly useful are metals commonly used in applications
        where lightweight materials, or materials exhibiting relatively
        low density, are desirable. For example, the hollow spheres can
        comprise iron (and alloys thereof), aluminum, titanium, nickel,
        ceramics, such as alumina and silica carbide, and the like. The
        metals comprising the hollow spheres can be a single,
        essentially pure metal; however, the term metal, as used herein
        to describe the components of the composite metal foams of the
        invention, can also refer to metal mixtures, including alloys,
        intermetallic compounds, such as titanium aluminide, and the
        like. Further, the metals can include trace components as would
        be recognizable as being beneficial, as well as non-detrimental
        trace impurities. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the
        hollow metallic spheres are comprised of steel, such as
        stainless steel or low carbon steel. The composition of one type
        of low carbon steel and one type of stainless steel (316L
        stainless steel) useful in particular embodiments of the
        invention are provided in Table 1. TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1
        Exemplary Metal Compositions for Hollow Metallic Spheres Type
        Composition Low Carbon Steel: &lt;0.007% carbon and 0.002%
        oxygen; remaining balance iron 316L Stainless Steel: 0.03%
        carbon, 0.3% oxygen, 17% chromium, 13% nickel, 0.9% silicon,
        0.2% manganese, 2.2% molybdenum, and remaining balance iron </p>
      <p>[0040] The average size of the hollow metallic spheres can vary
        depending upon the desired physical properties of the finished
        composite metal foam. Average size of the spheres is generally
        evaluated in terms of sphere diameter. When considering the
        physical properties of the finished composite metal foam,
        though, sphere wall thickness must also be considered.
        Accordingly, assuming sphere wall thickness remains unchanged,
        the use of spheres having a greater average diameter would be
        expected to result in a finished composite metal foam of lower
        density than if spheres of smaller average diameter are used.
        The average diameter is also limited by the size and dimensions
        of the finished composite metal foam. For example, if the
        desired finished composite metal foam is a metal sheet having a
        25 mm thickness, the hollow metallic spheres would necessarily
        need to have an average diameter of less than 25 mm. </p>
      <p>[0041] The hollow metallic spheres used in the invention
        generally have an average diameter of about 0.5 mm to about 20
        mm. Preferably, the spheres have an average diameter of about 1
        mm to about 15 mm, more preferably about 1.5 mm to about 10 mm,
        still more preferably about 2 mm to about 8 mm, most preferably
        about 2.5 mm to about 6 mm. In one particular embodiment, hollow
        metallic spheres having an average diameter of about 3 mm to
        about 4 mm (nominally about 3.7 mm) have been used to prepare
        the composite metal foam of the invention. Depending upon the
        desired properties of the composite metal foam, other sphere
        sizes can also be used. </p>
      <p>[0042] As noted above, sphere size is also described by the
        sphere wall thickness, which similarly affects the physical
        properties of the finished composite metal foams. For example,
        assuming sphere average diameter is unchanged, the use of
        spheres having a lesser average wall thickness would be expected
        to result in a finished composite metal foam of lower density
        than if spheres of greater average wall thickness are used.
        Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, it is desirable
        to minimize wall thickness. If wall thickness is too minimal,
        though, strength of the finished composite metal foams can be
        compromised. It is therefore beneficial to use spheres wherein
        the ratio of wall thickness to average sphere diameter is in a
        range where density of the finished composite metal foam is
        minimized but overall strength of the composite metal foam is
        not appreciably sacrificed. </p>
      <p>[0043] The hollow metallic spheres of the invention generally
        have an average wall thickness that is about 1% to about 30% of
        the average diameter of the spheres. Preferably, the average
        sphere wall thickness is about 1% to about 15% of the average
        sphere diameter, more preferably about 1.5% to about 10%, still
        more preferably about 2% to about 8%, and most preferably about
        2.5% to about 7% of the average sphere diameter. In one
        particular embodiment, the average sphere wall thickness is
        about 5% of the average sphere diameter. A cross-section of a
        hollow metallic sphere, such as useful according to the
        invention is shown in FIG. 1 (note that the sphere in the figure
        has not been cut through the diameter of the sphere). As seen in
        the Figure, the sphere walls have a generally uniform thickness.
        This is particularly advantageous in that composite metal foams,
        according to the invention, can be prepared to uniform porosity,
        said porosity being easily adjustable by use of hollow metallic
        spheres of a desired average diameter and average wall
        thickness. </p>
      <p>[0044] Preferentially, the percentage and size of porosities in
        the sphere walls are minimized to increase stability of the
        spheres during processing of the foams. For example, when
        casting techniques are used in preparing the composite metal
        foams, minimizing sphere wall porosity decreases the possibility
        of the matrix-forming molten metal penetrating the cavities of
        the spheres. Such penetration should be avoided as filling of
        the cavities could reduce the overall pore volume of the
        composite metal foam, unnecessarily increasing the overall
        density of the foam. In one embodiment, sphere wall porosity is
        less than about 12%. Preferably, sphere wall porosity is less
        than about 10%, more preferably less than about 8%, most
        preferably about 5% or less. </p>
      <p>[0045] In addition to the hollow metallic pieces, the composite
        metal foam of the invention also comprises a matrix surrounding
        the hollow metallic pieces. The matrix generally comprises a
        metal, and the type of metal comprising the matrix can be varied
        depending upon the technique used in preparing the composite
        metal foam of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0046] According to one embodiment, the metal comprising the
        matrix can be the same metal type comprising the hollow metallic
        pieces. According to another embodiment, the metal comprising
        the matrix is a different metal type than that comprising the
        hollow metallic pieces. Preferably, the metal matrix includes a
        metal that is generally lightweight but still exhibits good
        strength attributes. The use of such metals is beneficial for
        maintaining a high strength to density ratio in the finished
        composite metal foam of the invention. As before, the metal
        comprising the metal matrix can be an essentially pure single
        metal or can be a mixture of metals. In one particular
        embodiment, the metal matrix comprises steel. In another
        embodiment, the metal matrix comprises aluminum. </p>
      <p>[0047] Matrix composition may at least partially be dependant
        upon the method of preparation of the composite metal foam. The
        composite metal foams of the invention can be prepared through
        various techniques known in the art. While the use of such
        techniques would not be readily apparent for preparing metal
        foams, one of skill in the art, with the benefit of the present
        disclosure, could envision similar techniques which could be
        used in preparing the composite metal foams of the invention.
        Such further techniques are also encompassed by the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0048] According to one embodiment of the invention, there is
        provided a method for preparing a composite metal foam by powder
        metallurgy. According to this method, the hollow metallic
        spheres are first placed inside a mold. At this point, it should
        be noted that the composite metal foam can be prepared directly
        in the final desired shape through use of a mold designed to
        provide the desired shape. Alternately, the composite metal foam
        may be prepared as a "stock" piece (e.g., a large rectangle) and
        then be cut to the desired final shape. The size of the
        composite metal foam prepared according to this embodiment of
        the invention is generally limited by the size of the mold. </p>
      <p>[0049] The metallic spheres are preferentially arranged in the
        mold to be in a specific packing arrangement. Desirably, the
        packing arrangement is such that the metallic spheres are in
        their most efficient packing density (i.e., most closely
        packed). As such, the open space between the spheres is
        minimized, and the number of spheres arranged in the mold is
        maximized. In this packing arrangement, the porosity of the
        finished composite metal foam is maximized, which correlates
        into a minimized density. </p>
      <p>[0050] The arrangement of the metallic pieces in the mold can
        be facilitated through mechanical means, such as vibrating the
        mold. In embodiments where metallic spheres are used, vibration
        is particularly useful as the spheres tend to "settle" into a
        most preferred packing density. For example, such vibration can
        be performed using an APS Dynamics model 113 shaker and an APS
        model 114 amplifier with a General Radio 1310-B frequency
        generator. Vibrating at specific frequencies may be beneficial
        for facilitating a closest packing density or for minimizing the
        time necessary to obtain such a packing density. Vibrating time
        may vary depending upon the size of the mold, the average size
        of the hollow metallic pieces, the average size of the metal
        powders, and the frequency of the vibration. Generally,
        vibrating can be performed for a period of time up to about 12
        hours, although longer or shorter time periods may be necessary
        or sufficient. In one particular embodiment, vibrating is
        performed for a period of time ranging between about 30 seconds
        and about 4 hours, preferably about 1 minute to about 3 hours,
        more preferably about 5 minutes to about 2 hours. </p>
      <p>[0051] Similarly, other mechanical means can be used for
        facilitating packing density. Computer modeling could also be
        used to determine optimum packing techniques, including
        establishing sphere sizes most useful for optimum packing
        densities in light of mold size and shape. Where computer
        modeling is used, automated packing of the spheres could be
        beneficial for arranging the spheres in a maximized packing
        density. Further, in embodiments where hollow metallic pieces
        having a non-spherical geometry are used, different mechanical
        means could be used for establishing the most efficient packing
        density of the metallic pieces given their geometries. </p>
      <p>[0052] Once the hollow metallic spheres have been arranged in
        the mold, a matrix-forming metal powder is introduced into the
        mold, filling the spaces around the hollow metallic spheres.
        Again, mechanical means, such as vibrating, can be used to
        facilitate movement of the metal powder around the hollow
        metallic spheres, preferentially completely filling any voids
        within the mold. Multiple rotations of adding powder and
        applying mechanical means to move the powder into the voids
        between spheres within the mold could be used to ensure complete
        filling of the mold. Further, it may be beneficial, particularly
        when filling large molds, or molds of complex shape, to
        alternate introduction of the spheres and the matrix forming
        powder into the mold to ensure complete filling of the spaces
        between the hollow metallic pieces. </p>
      <p>[0053] As previously noted, the metal powder used in the powder
        metallurgy process can comprise various different metals, the
        metal being the same metal type or a different metal type as the
        metal comprising the hollow metallic spheres. In one embodiment,
        the composite metal foam comprises hollow steel spheres and
        aluminum powders. In another preferred embodiment, the composite
        metal foam comprises hollow steel spheres and steel powder.
        Particular, non-limiting examples of materials useful as a metal
        matrix, according to certain embodiments of the invention, are
        316L stainless steel, Ancorsteel-1000C steel, and aluminum 356
        alloy, the compositions of which are provided in Table 2.
        TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Exemplary Metal Powder Matrix-Forming
        Compositions Type Composition 316L stainless steel: 0.03%
        carbon, 0.3% oxygen, 17% chromium, 13% nickel, 0.9% silicon,

        remaining balance iron Pure Aluminum: 99.9% Al </p>
      <p>[0054] Choice of metal powder can depend upon the desired
        physical properties of the composite metal foam. Further, choice
        of metal powder can be limited by such characteristics as
        particle size and flow characteristics. For example,
        electrostatic interactions can limit the flow of some powder
        types leading to agglomeration and incomplete filling of the
        voids between the hollow metallic spheres. </p>
      <p>[0055] Choice of metal powder can also be limited by chemical
        and physical changes in the matrix material brought about by
        sintering. For example, it is known that the strength of
        sintered steel increases with increasing carbon content, up to a
        bout 0.85% carbon (see ASM Metals Handbook, 9.sup.th Edition,
        Vol. 7, "Powder Metallurgy", American Society for Metals, 1984,
        which is incorporated herein by reference). Beyond this, a
        network of free cementite begins to form at the gain boundaries.
        Additionally, it has been shown that for similar sintering
        conditions, shrinkage decreases with increasing carbon content
        up to 8%, at which no shrinkage was noted (see, N. Dautzenberg,
        Powder Metallurgy International, vol. 12, 1971 and Dautzenberg
        and Hewing, Powder Metallurgy International, vol. 9, 1977, both
        of which are incorporated herein by reference). </p>
      <p>[0056] Further considerations in choosing the metal
        matrix-forming powder arise from the possible formation of
        unsuitable intermetallic compounds during sintering. Such
        formation can be prevented, to some extent, by controlling
        sintering conditions. For example, when using an aluminum powder
        matrix-forming material with hollow steel spheres, diffuision of
        matrix material into the spheres and the formation of a brittle
        intermetallic phase may occur, particularly with slow process
        and prolonged exposure of the combination of iron and aluminum
        at higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0057] The metal powder is preferentially of a particle size
        capable of achieving a favorable packing system for maximizing
        matrix density. For example, in one embodiment, aluminum powder
        is used, the powder being a 98% pure mixture of the following
        components: 75% H-95 Al powder (about 100 micron particle size);
        14% H-15 Al powder (about 15 micron particle size); and 11% H-2
        Al powder (about 2 micron particle size). Such powders are
        available commercially from vendors, such as Valimet, Inc.
        (Stockton, Calif.). A powder composition, such as described
        above, is close to the ideal 49:7:1 ratio to achieve an optimum
        trimodal packing system for greater matrix density. In another
        embodiment, Ancorsteel-1000 C iron powder is used. The powder is
        sieved to 81.3% -325 mesh (44 micron) powder and 18.7% -400 mesh
        (37 micron) powder. Ancorsteel-1000 C powder is commercially
        available from ARC Metals (Ridgway, Pa.). In further
        embodiments, powders of an essentially uniform particle size, or
        of various particles sizes, can be used for maximizing matrix
        density. For example, powders having particle sizes most
        favorable for achieving an optimum bimodal packing system could
        also be used. </p>
      <p>[0058] In one embodiment, the metal powders used as a
        matrix-forming metal powder in the invention have an average
        particle size of about 1 .mu.m to about 200 .mu.m. Preferably,
        the metal powder has an average particle size of about 10 .mu.m
        to about 100 .mu.m, more preferably about 15 .mu.m to about 75
        .mu.m, most preferably about 20 .mu.m to about 50 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>[0059] Metal powders, such as those described above, can be
        used alone as the matrix forming metal powder. Alternately,
        further additional components can be combined with the metal
        powder. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the
        metal powder further includes carbon in the form of -300 mesh
        crystalline graphite to further increase the strength of the low
        carbon steel matrix, as described above. </p>
      <p>[0060] Further reinforcement agents can also be added to the
        metal powder prior to introduction of the powder into the mold.
        For example, natural or synthetic fibers or particulate matter
        could be mixed with the metal powder, or added into the mold, to
        provide additional benefits, such as increased strength or heat
        resistance. </p>
      <p>[0061] Once the spaces around the hollow metallic spheres have
        been filled with the matrix-forming metal powder, the mold is
        heated to a sintering temperature, the appropriate temperature
        being dependant upon the composition of the powder and the
        composition of the metallic spheres. Where the metal powder has
        a sintering temperature well below the sintering temperature of
        the metallic spheres, the lower temperature may be used, thereby
        sintering the metal powder and forming a solid metal matrix
        around the hollow metallic spheres. When the metallic spheres
        and the metal powder comprise the same metal, or different
        metals having similar sintering temperatures, the metal powder
        and, to some extent, the metallic spheres are sintered, thereby
        forming a solid metal matrix around the hollow metallic spheres.
      </p>
      <p>[0062] In one embodiment, the metal powder is sintered with the
        contents of the mold under pressure, such as in a hot press.
        Pressure values can vary depending upon the mechanical and
        physical properties of the spheres. Further, sphere size can
        also affect the applied pressure range. Acceptable pressure
        ranges can be calculated based upon the yield strength of the
        hollow sphere and the permissible load that can be applied to
        the spheres without any permanent deformation of the spheres. </p>
      <p>[0063] According to one embodiment, sintering is conducted
        without application of external pressure. In this embodiment,
        thermal expansion of the spheres during sintering and the
        resulting localized pressure around the spheres were used to
        facilitate pressing of the powder into the spaces between the
        spheres. The results show minimal porosity in the matrix of the
        composite metal foam after sintering. </p>
      <p>[0064] Sintering temperature can vary depending upon materials
        used in the spheres and, particularly, in the matrix-forming
        metal powder. In one embodiment, where hollow steel spheres and
        aluminum powder are used, the sintering is performed at a
        temperature of about 630.degree. C. In another embodiment, where
        hollow steel spheres and steel powder are used, the sintering is
        at a temperature of about 1200.degree. C. Preferably, sintering
        is performed at a temperature sufficient to exceed the solidus
        temperature of the metal matrix-forming powder but remain below
        the liquidus temperature of the powder. Further, preferably, the
        sintering temperature does not exceed the solidus temperature of
        the hollow metallic spheres. In one particular embodiment,
        sintering is performed at a temperature of between about
        500.degree. C. and about 1500.degree. C., preferably between
        about 550.degree. C. and about 1400.degree. C., more preferably
        between about 600.degree. C. and about 1300.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0065] Sintering time can also vary depending upon the
        materials used in the hollow metallic spheres and the metal
        matrix-forming powder. Sintering time also varies, however,
        based upon the relative size of the mold (and therefore the size
        of the sample being prepared). Larger molds obviously require a
        longer sintering time to ensure sintering completely through the
        thickness of the sample. Likewise, smaller molds requires a
        lesser sintering time. Size considerations in relation to
        sintering time generally follow guidelines similar to those
        previously provided in relation to powder metallurgy processes.
      </p>
      <p>[0066] Sintering conditions are preferably optimized to achieve
        improved mechanical properties. In one preferred embodiment, a
        duplex cycle is used to provide improved mechanical properties
        due to different sintering mechanisms taking place at each
        temperature. Such a method generally comprises cycling
        temperature increase phases with temperature hold phases. In one
        particular embodiment, where a composite metal foam is prepared
        using steel spheres and steel powder, the sample is heated at 10
        .degree. C./minute, held for 30 minutes at 850.degree. C.,
        heated at 5.degree. C./minute, held for 45 minutes at
        1200.degree. C., and cooled to room temperature at 20.degree.
        C./minute. In such cycles, the lower temperature portion assists
        in the removal of oxides and impurities and helps bring the mold
        to thermal equilibrium to avoid gradient properties. Surface
        transport effects are most prevalent at lower temperature, so
        the bonds between particles are strengthened without
        densification of the matrix. At higher temperatures, strength is
        increased greatly as a result of the higher sintering rate due
        to greater atomic motion. For both temperatures, rapid increases
        in strength are noted for times up to 30 minutes, where the rate
        begins to decrease. </p>
      <p>[0067] FIG. 2 provides an optical, cross-sectional image of a
        hollow metallic foam according to the invention prepared by
        powder metallurgy using hollow steel spheres of 3.7 mm average
        diameter and a sintered steel powder matrix. FIGS. 3 and 4
        provide scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a composite
        stainless steel foam prepared using a powder metallurgy
        technique, as described above. FIG. 3 shows the cross-section of
        intact spheres, and FIG. 4 shows the sintered powder matrix
        completely filling the space between the spheres. The bonding
        between the spheres and the matrix is seen to be strong with no
        voids at the interface. </p>
      <p>[0068] Returning to FIG. 2, the hollow metallic spheres show
        some signs of uniform packing; however, it is desirable to
        further increase the uniformity and density of the packing of
        the spheres to create metal foams exhibiting more uniform
        properties and even lower densities. The benefits of improving
        uniformity and density of packing are further illustrated in
        FIGS. 5 and 6. </p>
      <p>[0069] FIG. 5 provides a SEM image of a cross-section of two
        spheres in contact with one another. FIG. 6 provides a SEM image
        of a cross-section of two spheres not in contact, but with the
        metal matrix filling the space between the spheres. Increasing
        packing density of the spheres increases the contact between the
        spheres reducing the amount of free space between the spheres.
        Consequently, increased packing density reduces the amount of
        metal matrix present in the foam, which generally leads to lower
        densities, without sacrificing strength. FIGS. 5 and 6 further
        illustrate the ability to reduce the density of the composite
        metal foam by using hollow metallic spheres having lesser wall
        thicknesses. This is particularly illustrated in FIG. 5, wherein
        the sphere in the lower portion has a noticeably thinner wall
        than the sphere in the upper portion of the figure. The presence
        of the metal matrix surrounding the hollow metallic spheres
        allow for reducing the wall thickness to lower density of the
        composite metal foam without sacrificing strength. </p>
      <p>[0070] According to another embodiment of the invention, there
        is provided a method for preparing a composite metal foam by
        casting. In one embodiment, which is described below, the
        composite metal foam is prepared by permanent mold gravity
        casting; however, various other casting methods, as would be
        recognizable by one of skill in the art, could be used.
        Accordingly, the present invention is not limited by the
        permanent mold casting method described herein but rather
        encompasses all casting methods that could be recognizable as
        useful. </p>
      <p>[0071] In one embodiment of a casting method according to the
        invention, the hollow metallic spheres are first placed inside
        the mold. The hollow spheres are preferably arranged inside the
        mold, such as through vibrating, to pack the spheres into a best
        attainable close packed density. Vibration methods and
        apparatus, as described above in relation to powder metallurgy
        methods, would also be useful according to this aspect of the
        invention. Once the spheres are packed in the mold, a
        matrix-forming liquid metal is cast into the mold, filling the
        spaces around the hollow metallic spheres. The liquid metal is
        then solidified to form a solid metal matrix around the hollow
        metallic spheres. </p>
      <p>[0072] One embodiment of a mold useful in the casting method of
        the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, which show a
        three-dimensional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively,
        of an open atmosphere gravity feed permanent mold. The mold
        incorporates a sprue, runner, melt filter, and overflow riser.
        Carbon steel is a particularly preferred material for the mold
        allowing for repeated exposure to molten metal and high
        pre-heating temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0073] In a mold, such as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, liquid metal
        is poured into the sprue. The liquid metal then travels through
        the runner, rises up through a slide gate and melt filter, fills
        the spaces between the hollow metal spheres, and flows up into
        the over-flow riser. Such a "bottom-up" filling approach allows
        the liquid matrix-forming metal to push out the air as the metal
        fills the interstitial space between the hollow metallic
        spheres. The slide gate allows for easy de-molding after
        solidification, and the melt filter serves to remove any solid
        impurities or oxides in the melt. The overflow riser feeds any
        shrinkage during aluminum solidification. </p>
      <p>[0074] In one particular embodiment, prior to introduction of
        the matrix-forming liquid metal, the mold and hollow spheres are
        pre-heated. Preferably, the pre-heat temperature is at least
        about equal to the casting temperature of the matrix-forming
        liquid metal. For convenience, the matrix-forming metal can be
        liquefied in the same furnace used for pre-heating the mold and
        spheres. The temperature of the mold and spheres should be at
        least about equal to the casting temperature of the
        matrix-forming liquid metal in order to prevent premature
        solidification of the matrix before complete filling of the
        mold, including the spaces between and around the spheres. The
        pre-heat temperature can be greater than the casting temperature
        of the matrix-forming liquid metal so long as the temperature
        does not approach the solidus temperature of the spheres. </p>
      <p>[0075] In this method, the hollow metallic spheres and the
        matrix-forming metal comprise different metal compositions, the
        compositions being distinguished by a difference in their
        melting temperatures. Since the matrix-forming metal is
        introduced to the mold in a molten state, it is necessary that
        the hollow metallic spheres comprise a metal composition having
        a melting temperature greater than the melting temperature of
        the matrix-forming metal composition. This avoids the
        possibility of melting of the hollow metallic spheres during
        pre-heating or during introduction of the matrix-forming liquid
        metal melting into the mold. </p>
      <p>[0076] Where the metal compositions comprise essentially pure
        single metals, the transition from solid to liquid generally can
        be described as a single melting temperature. Where metal
        mixtures are used, however, the state transition becomes more
        complex and can be described with reference to the solidus
        temperature and the liquidus temperature. When an alloy is
        heated, the temperature at which the alloy begins to melt is
        referred to as the solidus temperature. Between the solidus and
        liquidus temperatures, the alloy exists as a mixture of solid
        and liquid phases. Just above the solidus temperature, the
        mixture will be mostly solid with some liquid phases therein,
        and just below the liquidus temperature, the mixture will be
        mostly liquid with some solid phases therein. Above the liquidus
        temperature, the alloy is completely molten. </p>
      <p>[0077] The metal composition used as the matrix-forming liquid
        metal of the invention should have a melting point (or a
        liquidus temperature) that is below the melting point (or
        solidus temperature) of the metal composition comprising the
        hollow metallic spheres. Preferably, the melting temperature of
        the matrix-forming liquid metal is at least about 25.degree. C.
        less than the solidus temperature of the metal composition
        comprising the hollow metallic spheres, more preferably at least
        about 40.degree. C. less, most preferably at least about
        50.degree. C. less than the solidus temperature of the metal
        composition comprising the hollow metallic spheres. </p>
      <p>[0078] In one embodiment, the hollow metallic spheres are
        comprised predominately of steel and the matrix-forming liquid
        metal is aluminum or an aluminum alloy. For example, the hollow
        metallic sphere could comprise low carbon steel or 316L
        stainless steel, such as according to the compositions
        exemplified in Table 1. Likewise, the matrix-forming liquid
        metal could comprise aluminum 356 alloy, such as according to
        the composition exemplified in Table 2. Aluminum 356 alloy is
        particularly useful due to its low density, high strength and
        stiffness, and ease of casting of the material. </p>
      <p>[0079] Further reinforcement agents can also be added to the
        matrix-forming liquid metal prior to casting. For example,
        natural or synthetic fibers or particulate matter could be mixed
        with the liquid metal, or added into the mold, to provide
        additional benefits, such as increased strength or heat
        resistance. </p>
      <p>[0080] Preferentially, the matrix-forming liquid metal is cast
        into the mold in such a manner as to facilitate complete filling
        of the voids around the hollow metallic spheres while avoiding
        disturbance of the hollow metallic spheres arranged within the
        mold. In some embodiments, it may be useful to use screens, or
        other similar means, for maintaining the arrangement of the
        spheres within the mold. In addition to gravity casting, the
        mold may be subject to pressure differentials during the cast
        process. For example, in one embodiment, the mold may be
        pressurized. In another embodiment, the mold may be under a
        vacuum. </p>
      <p>[0081] Once the matrix-forming liquid metal has been cast into
        the mold, the liquid metal is solidified to form a solid metal
        matrix around the hollow metallic spheres. Such solidification
        is generally through cooling of the mold, which can be through
        a.mu.mospheric cooling or through more controlled cooling
        methods. </p>
      <p>[0082] A composite metal foam, according to one embodiment of
        the invention, prepared by casting an aluminum metal matrix
        around hollow low carbon steel spheres, is shown in FIG. 9. As
        can be seen in the figure, the closest packing arrangement of
        the hollow spheres is somewhat disturbed by the inflow of the
        liquid metal matrix. Nevertheless, strong bonding between the
        metal matrix and the hollow spheres is achieved. </p>
      <p>[0083] Bonding between the foam components is more clearly
        evident in FIGS. 10-11 which provide SEM images of a cast metal
        foam according to the invention comprising hollow low carbon
        steel spheres surrounded by an aluminum metal matrix. As can be
        seen in FIG. 10, the aluminum metal matrix fills the
        interstitial space between the hollow steel spheres with
        consistent bonding to the surfaces of the spheres. FIG. 11
        provides a detailed view of the sphere wall interaction with the
        aluminum matrix. Very little evidence of influx of aluminum
        matrix into the walls of the hollow steel spheres is seen in
        FIG. 11 indicating low porosity in the wall of the hollow steel
        spheres. </p>
      <p>[0084] SEM images of a cast metal foam according to another
        embodiment of the invention are provided in FIGS. 12(a) and
        12(b). While it is preferable for the interstitial space between
        the spheres to be completely filled by the metal matrix, as can
        be seen in FIG. 12(a), voids can be present, particularly at an
        interface between two spheres. Using geometrical calculations,
        the void space at the interface of two spheres can be calculated
        according to an estimated void angle, and the resulting void
        volume (V.sub.void) per contact point of two spheres can be
        calculated according to the following
        equation:V.sub.void=3.16.times.10.sup.-2(R.sup.3) (1) in which R
        is the outer radius of the spheres used in the foam (see
        Sanders, W. S. and Gibson, L. J., Mater. Sci. Eng. A A347, 2003,
        p. 70-85). Projecting this into a face-centered cubic (FCC)
        arrangement of spheres with four spheres per unit cell, and
        knowing that in a random loose condition, there are three
        contacts per unit cell, the total volume percentage of voids per
        unit cell can be estimated as: V.sub.vf=(3.16
        .times.10.sup.-2R.sup.3.times.12)/22.627R.sup.3 (2) in which
        V.sub.vf, is the volume fraction of voids. In one particular
        composite metal foam according to the invention prepared by
        casting molten aluminum around hollow low carbon steel spheres,
        the volume percentage of voids calculated according to equation
        (2) was 1.68%. However, the actual matrix porosity is expected
        to be even less, given there are less than four spheres in each
        unit cell of the random arrangement and not all contacts have a
        void space. In one embodiment of the invention, the void volume
        percentage is less than 1.5%, preferably less than 1.25%, more
        preferably less than 1%. </p>
      <p>[0085] As can be seen in FIG. 12(b), multiple different phases
        are present in the aluminum matrix. Scanning electron microscope
        energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM EDX) compositional
        analysis was performed on an Al--Fe composite metal foam
        according to one embodiment of the invention prepared by
        casting, and the compositional analysis is provided below in
        Table 3. TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Compositional Analysis (atomic
        %), t = trace Al Si Fe Mg Mn Cu Al matrix generally 97.9 1.5 t t

        97.1 .ltoreq.3 t t t 1.0 </p>
      <p>[0086] As can be seen in FIG. 12 and Table 3, the Al matrix
        typically comprises three different phases. The Al matrix
        generally comprises approximately 98% Al. The phase designated
        the light gray phase is a ternary alloy of Al, Si, and Fe
        (estimated to be Al.sub.4FeSi) and is typically found in two
        different shapes, plates and needles. The phase designated the
        dark gray phase has a composition that is close to the
        composition of the Al matrix generally but also includes copper.
      </p>
      <p>[0087] The composite metal foams of the invention (whether
        prepared through casting or powder metallurgy) are particularly
        characterized in that they exhibit high compressive strength and
        energy absorption capacity while maintaining a relatively low
        density. Of course, actual density of the finished composite
        metal foam can be calculated using the measured sample weight
        and structural dimensions. It is also possible, however, to
        determine an estimated density based on component properties and
        packing properties of the spheres in the mold. </p>
      <p>[0088] Sphere packing density is a measure of the relative
        order of the arrangement of spheres, such as in a mold. It is
        desirable to achieve a maximum density of spheres in order to
        maintain a lowest possible density for the prepared composite
        metal foam and have a uniform distribution of spheres, thus
        contributing to isotropy of mechanical properties. It is
        generally recognized that there are three types of packing
        arrangements for spheres: ordered packing, random dense packing,
        and random loose packing (See, German, Particle Packing
        Characteristics, Metal Powder Industries Federation, Princeton,
        N.J., 1989). The highest order is represented by the
        face-centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonal closed packed (HCP)
        structure, with a 74% packing density of spheres, assuming
        mono-sized spheres. A random dense arrangement has a packing
        density of 64%. This is achieved by vibrating an initially
        random arrangement to the best attainable packing density.
        Random loose packing has a fractional density of 56%-62.5%, with
        an average reported fraction density of 59% and a three-point
        contact per sphere. </p>
      <p>[0089] As previously noted, in one preferred embodiment of the
        invention, after the hollow metal spheres are loaded into a mold
        (in either a casting or powder metallurgy technique), the mold
        with the spheres is vibrated to achieved increased packing
        density, which ultimately leads to reduced overall density for
        the prepared composite metal foam of the invention. In one test,
        hollow spheres were poured in bulk into an acrylic box.
        Isopropyl alcohol was then poured into the box as a testing
        replacement for the matrix material to determine the volume
        needed to fill the box. With this random placement, sphere
        packing density was measured as 56%. In a second run, the
        spheres were manually vibrated prior to introduction of the
        isopropyl alcohol. The vibrated spheres exhibited a packing
        density of 59%. </p>
      <p>[0090] The density of a composite metal foam according to the
        invention can be estimated as a function of component density
        according to the following equation:
        .rho..sub.CF=.rho..sub.SV.sub.fs+.rho..sub.mV.sub.fm (3) in
        which .rho..sub.CF is the density of the composite metal foam,
        .rho..sub.s is the density of spheres, V.sub.fs is the volume
        fraction of spheres (the packing density of the spheres),
        .rho..sub.m is the density of the matrix, and V.sub.fm is the
        volume fraction of the matrix. Considering the effect of
        porosity in the wall thickness of metal spheres, equation (3)
        can be altered to:
        .rho..sub.CF=.rho..sub.metal[1-(V.sub.in/V.sub.out)]V.sub.fs(1-V.sub.fp)+-
.rho..sub.mV.sub.fm




        (4) in which .rho..sub.metal is the density of the metal used in
        the hollow metal spheres (e.g., steel), V.sub.in/V.sub.out is
        the ratio of inner volume to outer volume of the metal spheres,
        and V.sub.fp is the volume fraction of porosities in the wall
        thickness. As previously noted, the porosity of the walls of the
        hollow metal spheres can vary and is preferably less than about
        12%. </p>
      <p>[0091] As previously noted, the composite metal foams of the
        invention are particularly useful in that they provide a
        material that combines strength with light weight. In
        particular, the composite metal foams generally have a density
        that is less than the density of the bulk materials used in the
        composite metal foams. For example, steel is generally
        recognized as having a density in the range of about 7.5
        g/cm.sup.3 to about 8 g/cm.sup.3. A composite metal foam
        prepared according to the present invention using hollow steel
        spheres and a steel metal matrix would exhibit a density well
        below these values. </p>
      <p>[0092] The composite metal foams according to the present
        invention preferably have a calculable density of less than
        about 4 g/cm.sup.3. Preferably, the composite metal foams of the
        invention have a density of less than about 3.5 g/cm.sup.3, more
        preferably less than about 3.25 g/cm.sup.3, and most preferably
        less than about 3.0 g/cm.sup.3. In one embodiment of the
        invention, there is provided a composite metal foam comprising
        hollow steel spheres surrounded by an aluminum metal matrix, the
        composite foam having a density of less than about 2.5
        g/cm.sup.3. In another embodiment of the invention, there is
        provided a composite metal foam comprising hollow steel spheres
        surrounded by a steel metal matrix, the composite foam having a
        density of less than about 3.0 g/cm.sup.3. </p>
      <p>[0093] The metal foam of the invention can also be evaluated in
        terms of relative density. By analysis of this parameter, it is
        possible to compare the level of porosity of the metal foam (or
        the level of foaming) with the level of porosity of the bulk
        material. According to one embodiment of the invention, the
        inventive composite metal foam has a relative density (compared
        to bulk steel) of between about 25% and about 45%. </p>
      <p>[0094] The usefulness of the composite metal foams according to
        the invention is particularly characterized by their favorable
        strength to density ratio. As used herein, strength to density
        ratio is determined as the plateau stress of the metal foam
        under compression (measured in MPa) over the density of the
        metal foam. The composite metal foams of the invention typically
        exhibit a strength to density ratio of at least about 10.
        Preferably, the composite metal foams of the invention exhibit a
        strength to density ratio of at least about 15, more preferably
        at least about 20, still more preferably at least about 25, and
        most preferably at least about 30. </p>
      <p>[0095] The composite metal foams of the invention are further
        characterized by improved energy absorption. Energy absorption
        capability can be characterized in terms of the amount of energy
        absorbed by the material over a given level of strain. As used
        herein, energy absorption is defined as the energy absorbed (in
        MJ/m.sup.3) up to 50% strain. The composite metal foams of the
        invention typically exhibit energy absorptive capability of at
        least about 20 MJ/m.sup.3. Preferably, the composite metal foams
        of the invention exhibit energy absorptive capability of at
        least about 30 MJ/m.sup.3, more preferably at least about 50
        MJ/m.sup.3, most preferably at least about 75 MJ/m.sup.3. </p>
      <p>[0096] As detailed above, the composite metal foams of the
        invention are further particularly beneficial in that they
        provide improved mechanical properties under cyclic compression
        loading. Further, microstructural, mechanical, and physical
        properties show noticeable improvement over previous metal foams
        through analysis by optical microscopy, scanning electron
        microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and
        compression test and strain mapping during monotonic compression
        loading. </p>
      <p>[0097] Any method or apparatus recognizable as useful by one of
        skill in the art for obtaining and analyzing the above-noted
        properties could be used and is fully envisioned by the present
        invention. For example, SEM images can be obtained through use
        of a Hitachi S-3200N environmental SEM equipped with energy
        dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Of course, other SEM equipment,
        as would be recognized as suitable by the skilled artisan, could
        also be used in accordance with the invention. </p>
      <p>[0098] One particular method of analysis of the mechanical
        properties of the composite metal foams according to the
        invention is through monotonic compression testing and
        compression fatigue testing. Exemplary equipment useful in such
        testing is a MTS 810 FLEXTEST.TM. Material Testing System
        (available from MTS Systems Corporation). According to one
        testing procedure, monotonic compression testing is performed
        using a MTS 810 loading machine with a 220 kip load cell.
        According to another testing procedure, compression fatigue
        testing is performed using a MTS 810 loading machine with a 220
        kip load cell having a fixed R-ratio
        (R=.sigma..sub.min/.sigma..sub.max) of 0.1 at a frequency of 10
        Hz and an applied maximum stress of 37.5 MPa. </p>
      <p>[0099] FIG. 13 provides a side-by-side comparison of three
        foams prepared according to the invention. FIG. 13(a) is a
        cross-section of cast metal foam comprising hollow low-carbon
        steel spheres (3.7 mm mean diameter) and an aluminum matrix.
        FIG. 13(b) is a cross-section of a metal foam prepared by powder
        metallurgy comprising hollow low-carbon steel spheres (3.7 mm
        mean diameter) and a metal matrix prepared from powdered low
        carbon steel. FIG. 13(c) is a cross-section of a metal foam
        prepared by powder metallurgy comprising hollow low-carbon steel
        spheres (1.4 mm mean diameter) and a metal matrix prepared from
        powdered low carbon steel. </p>
      <p>[0100] Monotonic compression testing of all three samples from
        FIG. 13 demonstrated the typical behavior of an elastic-plastic
        foam under compression. There is an initial linear elastic
        region, which is followed by an extended region of deformation
        at a relatively constant level of stress. Unlike most foams,
        however, the foams prepared according to the present invention
        do not exhibit a level plateau stress. Rather, the material
        densifies at a slowly increasing rate, and there is no distinct
        point at which full densification occurs. As used herein,
        plateau stress is understood to refer to the average stress
        between the yield point and the point at which 50% strain (i.e.,
        deformation) has been achieved. All three composite metal foams
        shown in FIG. 13 reached a minimum of 50% strain before reaching
        a point of full densification. </p>
      <p>[0101] FIG. 14 shows stress-strain curves of composite metal
        foams according to various embodiments of the invention under
        monotonic compression. Sample 1 is taken from an embodiment
        formed through powder metallurgy using 3.7 mm hollow low carbon
        steel spheres and low carbon steel powder. Sample 2 is taken
        from an embodiment formed through casting an aluminum matrix
        around 3.7 mm hollow steel spheres. Sample 3 is taken from an
        embodiment formed through powder metallurgy using 1.4 mm hollow
        low carbon steel spheres and low carbon steel powder. Sample 4
        is taken from an embodiment formed through powder metallurgy
        using 2.0 mm hollow stainless steel spheres and stainless steel
        powder. After 50% strain, the composite metal foams begin to
        approach densification as the hollow spheres are completely
        collapsed and the material begins to heave like a bulk material.
      </p>
      <p>[0102] The compression test results, as well as further
        physical properties of the embodiments of the inventive
        composite metal foam corresponding to the four samples discussed
        above in relation to FIG. 14, are shown below in Table 4. As a
        comparative, the physical properties of previously known metal
        foams made of hollow spheres alone are also provided.

        The comparison in Table 4 indicates the composite foams of the
        invention have a noticeably increased strength while maintaining
        a comparable strength to density ratio. Further, the inventive
        composite foams show improved energy absorptive properties
        making the composite foams particularly useful in the various
        applications described herein. </p>
      <p><b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> </p>
      <p>[0104] The present invention is more fully illustrated by the
        following examples, which are set forth to illustrate the
        present invention and are not to be construed as limiting. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p><b>Composite Metal Foam Prepared by Powder Metallurgy</b> </p>
      <p>[0105] A composite metal foam was prepared using stainless
        steel spheres and stainless steel powder according to the
        specifications provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The
        stainless steel spheres had an outside diameter of 2.0 mm and
        sphere wall thickness of 0.1 mm. The spheres were cleaned in a
        solution of 3.0 mL HCl and 97 mL water to remove oxides, rinsed
        in acetone, and dried. A permanent mold made of 304 stainless
        steel and having interior dimensions of 5.1 cm.times.5.1
        cm.times.10 cm was used. The mold was prepared by coating its
        surfaces with a boron nitride mold release. The spheres were
        placed in the mold and vibrated for 5 minutes using an APS
        Dynamics model 113 shaker and an APS model 114 amplifier with a
        General Radio 1310-B frequency generator. The powder was added
        and the mold was further vibrated to completely fill the spaces
        between the spheres. Total vibration time was 30 minutes at
        15-20 Hz. </p>
      <p>[0106] The mold was placed in a vacuum hot press during
        sintering. Although no pressure was applied, the mold cap was
        held in place by the press, and the thermal expansion of the
        spheres was used to create internal pressure to aid in the
        sinter of the powder. The powder and spheres were sintered using
        a 10.degree. C./minute heating rate, held for 30 minutes at
        850.degree. C., further heated at a rate of 5.degree. C./minute
        and held for 45 minutes at 1200.degree. C. The mold was then
        cooled at a rate of 20.degree. C./minute. The finished composite
        steel foam was then removed from the mold for testing. </p>
      <p>[0107] Optical microscopy was performed using a Buhler Unitron
        9279 optical microscope equipped with a Hitachi KP-M1 CCD black
        and white digital camera. SEM images were taken with a Hitachi
        Ss-3200N environmental SEM equipped with EDX to determine the
        microstructure and chemical composition of the metal foam.
        Monotonic compression testing was performed using an MTS 810
        with a 980 kN load cell and a crosshead speed of 1.25 mm/minute.
      </p>
      <p>[0108] The composite metal foam had a density of 2.9 g/cm3 (37%
        relative density) and reached a plateau stress of 113 MPa from
        10-50% strain and began densification at around 50% strain.
        These and further analytical results are provided in Table 4
        (wherein the metal foam from this example is shown as Sample 4).
        FIG. 15 shows a comparison of the stainless steel composite
        metal foam (a) before compression testing and (b) after
        compression testing with 60% strain. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p><b>Composite Metal Foam Prepared by Casting</b> </p>
      <p>[0109] A composite metal foam was prepared by casting using low
        carbon steel hollow spheres and a matrix-forming liquid aluminum
        356 alloy according to the specifications provided in Tables 1
        and 2, respectively. The steel spheres had an outside diameter
        of 3.7 mm and sphere wall thickness of 0.2 mm. An open
        atmosphere gravity feed permanent mold casting system made of
        carbon steel was used, the mold cavity having dimensions of 121
        mm.times.144 mm.times.54 mm. The mold was partially preassembled
        after coating with a boron nitride powder spray to prevent
        oxidation to mold surfaces during preheating and for providing
        easy release of the sample after cooling. The spheres were
        placed in the mold with a stainless steel mesh to hold them in
        place and vibrated for 10 minutes to pack the spheres into a
        random dense arrangement. The mold used was similar to that
        illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8. </p>
      <p>[0110] The aluminum alloy was melted in a high temperature
        furnace (3300 series available from CM Furnaces) at a
        temperature of 700.degree. C. At the same time, the mold with
        the hollow spheres inside was pre-heated in the furnace to
        700.degree. C. to prevent instant solidification of the aluminum
        upon contact with the spheres while casting. The fully liquid
        aluminum alloy was then poured in the sprue tube of the heated
        mold. The liquid aluminum fills out the cavity while pushing the
        air out from the cavity. The filled mold was allowed to air
        cool, and the mold was disassembled and the composite metal foam
        removed. Testing was performed on the cast composite metal foam
        as described in Example 1. </p>
      <p>[0111] The cast composite metal foam had a density of 2.4
        g/cm.sup.3 (42% relative density). During monotonic compression,
        the composite metal foam reached an average plateau stress of 67
        MPa up to 50% strain before it began densification at around 50%
        strain. These and further analytical results are provided in
        Table 4 (wherein the cast metal foam from this example is shown
        as Sample 2). Optical and SEM observation indicated the Al
        matrix had nearly filled all of the interstitial spaces between
        the steel spheres (see FIG. 12(a)). The void space due to
        incomplete filling of the interstitial space at the sphere point
        contacts with the Al matrix was calculated to be less than 1%. </p>
      <p>[0112] The cast composite metal foam was tested to calculate
        maximum cyclic stress. Testing methods are fully described by
        Banhart, J. and Brinkers, W., "Fatigue Behavior of Aluminum
        Foams", J. Material Science Letters, 18(8), 1999, p. 617-619,
        and Lehmus, D., et al., "Influence of Heat Trea.mu.ment on
        Compression Fatigue of Aluminum Foams", Journal of Material
        Science, 37, 2002, which are incorporated herein in their
        entirety. The average yield strength calculated, using the 0.2%
        offset method, was 29 MPa. The maximum stress was chosen to be
        85% of the reference strength. The fatigue was continued with
        this maximum stress for 250,000 cycles with no apparent
        deformation. The maximum stress was then increased to 37.5 MPa
        (the stress at 5% strain from the stress-strain curve). FIG. 16
        shows the curve for the compression fatigue test as the relation
        between strain and the number of cycles. </p>
      <p>[0113] The cast composite foam deformed by an initial
        progressive shortening, followed by collapse of the spheres
        starting at certain regions with possible defects like holes or
        cracks, causing the subsequent failure of the neighboring
        spheres leading to the formation of macroscopic collapse bands.
        Visual observation of the deformed fatigue cast foam revealed
        that extensive fatigue failure had occurred within the crush
        bands. The S-N curve (FIG. 16) shows the initial progressive
        fatigue damage at the onset of an abrupt strain jump. The cast
        foam sample had endured 1,440,000 cycles before the end of the
        fatigue test. Optical images of the cast foam taken before and
        during the fatigue test are shown in FIG. 17. </p>
