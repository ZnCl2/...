      <div align="center"><b> ' IROLENE ' -- YOUNG GIRL'S DISCOVERY A
          REVOLUTION IN MOTORING.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The new motor fuel, 'Irolene,' which is said to be four times as
      powerful as petrol, and which it is expected to produce at a cost
      of something like a penny a quart, was submitted to exhaustive
      tests in Paris recently by a body of experts.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacture of this remarkable petrol substitute was made
      possible by Irene Laurent, a girl of fifteen, who, having watched
      her father's fruitless efforts to find a solvent for the explosive
      irol, experimented on her own account, and succeeded where her
      father had failed. M. Laurent, by way of proving the qualities of
      'Irolene,' invited a company of ten expert motorists and engineers
      to put it to a test. First they examined his motor car, and found
      that the only change made to adapt it for the consumption of
      'Irolene' was the affixing of a small metal cylinder near the
      carbureter. Asked if he needed a special tank for his fuel, the
      inventor said this was not necessary, and by way of proving it he
      filled up his radiator with 'Irolene' instead of water. He then
      started up his engine, running it on petrol until it was warm,
      after which two of the experts present themselves shut off the
      petrol supply. From that point the engine ran entirely on
      'Irolene,' which' in its liquid form is not explosive, and can
      only be fired after transformation by heat into gas. The car then
      started, with M. Laurent driving and five passengers. Several
      tests demanded by the experts were satisfactorily carried out, one
      of them in particular proving the extraordinary flexibility of the
      new fuel. This car, while running on top gear, was slowed down to
      three miles an hour, turned on its own ground, and was then let
      out to full speed, and all without changing gear.<br>
      <br>
      'It means a revolution in motoring,' said a well-known motor
      manufacturer, according to the London 'Daily Telegraph,' and
      several of his colleagues agreed with him.<br>

              the thought that obtrudes when one reads that a French
              chemist has perfected a motor fuel twice as efficient,
              bulk for bulk, as petrol, and of fractional cost; a fuel,
              furthermore, that does not heat the engine nor corrode the
              cylinders. Just how the miracle of heatless explosion is
              accomplished, is not stated in the report and some other
              details may perhaps be taken with a certain allowance for
              enthusiasm. Here they are: —<br>
              <br>
              Seeing is believing, and Camille Laurent, a French
              chemist, has eye-witnesses to prove that he was able to
              drive a twenty five-horsepower car from Paris to Dieppe, a
              distance of about 125 miles, at a cost of five francs,
              plus twenty-five for oil which in English money in About
              six shillings. <br>
              <br>
              His source of power was a new explosive substance known as
              irol, which was first discovered in powder form by the
              French chemist Muller in 1893. The chief difficulty to be
              overcome was that irol in its primitive form, was an
              explosive impossible to handle. Laurent, after many
              trials, succeeded in transforming this raw product into
              crystals which proved to be slightly radio-active.<br>
              <br>
              Laurent next conceived the idea of reducing these crystals
              to a liquid form for use in explosive motors. His efforts
              met with success. Irol was transformed into gas, and
              already Lauront has encompassed the means necessary for
              utilising it in driving a car for a distance in excess of
              3,000 miles.<br>
              <br>
              In its liquid form iroline is said to be non-inflammable,
              exploding only in the form of gas. Neither the heat of the
              sun nor dampness nor movement affects it in any way. The
              claim is made that its composition is such that it can be
              obtained in any quantities in France at a cost almost
              nominal. However, it is claimed that to start up the motor
              it is necessary to use' petrol, but when the engine is
              sufficiently warm iroline is atomised and operates without
              further assistance.<br>

            <br>
            The invention described below relates to the composition and
            application of catalyst bodies to obtain the low water vapor
            the temperature of dissociation into its constituent
            elements of hydrogen and oxygen and its transformation into
            a fuel fluid may be <br>
            employed for heating including 'the steam engine boilers,
            lighting, and the power to all internal combustion engines
            or internal combustion.<br>
            <br>
            By this proceeds the water is used as a combustible.&nbsp;
            It is known that water vapor [ steam ] heated above 1100
            [deg] is dissociated into its components H and 0 which do
            not recombine by cooling but give in contact with the
            electric spark an explosion with formation of water. The
            catalyst which is the main subject for this dissociation or
            transformation of the water vapor in its entirety not
            recombine by cooling.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            This catalyst consists of the mixture in any proportions of
            three different body:<br>
            <br>
            1. A body-friendly metal poisons such as arsenic salts,
            mercury, phosphorus, barium, sulfur, selenium, tellurium,
            boron, cyanides, oxalales, etc.<br>
            <br>
            2. A carbon such as graphite, coal, coke, etc.<br>
            <br>
            3. A salt. metallic lead, zinc, tin, antimony, bismuth, or
            derivative thereof, or alumina, silica, magnesia, etc.<br>
            <br>
            The author of the invention has achieved good results with
            the following mixture:<br>
            <b><br>
            </b><b> 10% As2 S5 or As2S2 [ Realgar or Orpiment ]</b><b><br>
            </b><b>30% C</b><b><br>
            </b><b>60% PbCO3 [ Lead Carbonate ]</b><br>
            <br>
            or<br>
            <br>
            <b>8% HgI2 [ Mercury Iodide ]</b><b><br>
            </b><b>32% C</b><b><br>
            </b><b>60% SbCl5 [ Antimony Chloride ]</b><br>
            <br>
            compressed into balls.<br>
            <br>
            This mixture is used in a form such that the gas mixture to
            catalyze can easily pass therethrough, for example it can
            form a mass consisting of little balls or a porous mass in
            the form of briquettes or blades. .<br>
            <br>
            The dissociation or transformation of the water vapor by the
            different catalysts occurs especially if the steam is mixed
            with a small amount of carbon material, such as gasoline,
            alcohol, benzene, acetylene gas lighting in general any
            hydrocarbon or any flammable gas.<br>
            <br>
            Said carbonaceous body is preferably added to water vapor as
            gaseous fluid prior to its passage over the catalyst.<br>
            <br>
            Then it form higher hydrocarbons and the resulting mixture
            may, with or without the addition of air burn freely, and be
            used for heating or lighting; or after being compressed,
            explode in the same way as any hydrocarbon with added air.<br>
            <br>
            By way of example, described below and shown in the
            accompanying drawing an embodiment of a motor supply device
            to blast with a mixture of steam and hydrocarbon, all
            catalyzed.<br>
            <br>
            On the intake pipe 1 of the engine 2 is disposed a chamber 3
            containing the catalyst.<br>
            <br>
            A water reservoir 4 feeds a coil 5 disposed inside the
            exhaust pipe 6 and opening at the inlet of the catalyst
            chamber 3.<br>
            <br>
            A liquid fuel reservoir 7 having a pipe 8 which also leads
            to the entrance beyond the catalysis chamber 3 and a feeding
            tube 9 a carburetor nozzle 10, the tube 11 opens into the
            intake pipe of the motor.<br>
            <br>
            The valves 12 and 13 are respectively disposed on the intake
            pipe 1 going to the catalysis chamber 3 and the opening in
            the open air above the nozzle 10 carburetor disposed on the
            pipes 9 and 8 of the fuel tank 7 and that of the water tank
            4.<br>

            </div>
            <br>
            The engine operates as follows:<br>
            <br>
            The start is done with the valve 12 closed., The open valve
            13 and the valve 14 that is to say the start is done with
            the liquid fuel as in ordinary engines.<br>
            <br>
            When the exhaust gas warmed sufficiently the coil 5 the
            valve 12 is opened and valves 15 and 16, the water
            evaporates in this coil and the saturated water vapor gas
            dissociates in the catalysis chamber 3 .<br>
            <br>
            It then closes the essence of arrival carburaratéur 14 and
            the valve 13 to adjust the air supply.<br>
            <br>
            The catalyzed mixture rich in hydrogen form a hydrocarbon
            well above those usually employed and, more or less admixed
            with air, allows a very smooth engine.<br>
            <br>
            Gasoline can be replaced with any other hydrocarbon, also by
            acetylene, gas lighting; alcohol, benzene, oil and even pure
            hydrogen, and the same result is obtained.<br>
            <br>
            The author of the invention obtained a proper functioning in
            an ordinary combustion engine and was able to keep the
            engine power by supplying it with a gaseous mixture of 50%
            to 80% water.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a fuel formed of a properly
      balanced mixture of acetylene gas from the calcium carbide, water
      vapor and atmospheric air to serve as fuel for all internal
      combustion engines or combustion such as gas engines, petrol
      engines, &amp;c.<br>
      <br>
      This mixture replaces oil, lean gas or coal gas, benzole,
      petroleum spirit, alcohols and hydrocarbons and all employees to
      date for the operation of internal combustion engines without
      exception.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can be easily realized by supplying pure and simple
      three fluids acetylene, air and steam in predetermined proportions
      and under constant pressure to the orifice 'of the suction pipe of
      the engine, the only precaution being necessary to take the one
      hand, to prevent flame back on, an ignition of the mixture
      surprising within the portion of the intake pipe for mixer and
      secondly to avoid condensation of water vapor in said piping...<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An engine with liquid or gaseous fuel feed, with or without water
      vapor mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The invention described below relates to a gasified fuel supply
      device, or combustible fluids, with or without steam, can adapt to
      all internal combustion engines and mainly to automobile engines.<br>
      <br>
      This device consists essentially of a heated cylinder or chamber
      located above or in the interior of -the exhaust conduit of hot
      gases from the explosion of the engine as close as possible flames
      exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      This cylinder, or chamber, is filled with globular body.<br>
      <br>
      At the rear end of the cylinder relative to the engine opens a
      pipe provided with a nozzle of the fuel used, oil, fuel oil,
      gasoline, alcohol, or a gas inlet valve when employing gas,
      acetylene gas lighting; pure hydrogen or fuel gas...<br>
      <br>
      Water dissociation or catalysis permits to use with economy
      lourds- 60% of fuel oil, fuel oil, alcohol, vegetable or mineral
      oils or even gas as acetylene gas coal, all or derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel economy is more or less according to the beads employed
      and ranges from 3 to 50 o/o.<br>
      <br>
      These bodies are to exercise phenomenal catalytic actions; it is
      still unclear how the body and various mixtures of substances are
      able to perform this catalysis.<br>
