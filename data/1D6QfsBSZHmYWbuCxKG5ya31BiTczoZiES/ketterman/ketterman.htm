      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] Briefly, this invention comprises in a watercraft having
      propulsion means extending below the water line comprising a pair
      of flexible fins each having a leading edge and a trailing edge
      and adapted to oscillate through an arcuate path in a generally
      transverse direction with respect to the central longitudinal
      dimension of said watercraft, and means operatively associated
      with said propulsion means for applying input force to said
      propulsion means whereby as input force is applied said flexible
      fins can twist to form an angle of attack for providing forward
      thrust with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the
      watercraft while moving in both directions along said arcuate
      path;<br>
      <br>
      [0005] the improvement wherein each of said fins is provided with
      essentially square top ends to provide enhanced fin twist and more
      efficient propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In another aspect, this invention comprises in a watercraft
      having propulsion means extending below the water line comprising
      a pair of flexible fins each having a leading edge and a trailing
      edge and adapted to oscillate through an arcuate path in a
      generally transverse direction with respect to the central
      longitudinal dimension of said watercraft, and means operatively
      associated with said propulsion means for applying input force to
      said propulsion means whereby as input force is applied said
      flexible fins can twist to form an angle of attack for providing
      forward thrust with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the
      watercraft while moving in both directions along said arcuate
      path;<br>
      <br>
      [0007] the improvement wherein each of said fins has generally
      square top and a generally peripheral area which is a harder, less
      flexible rubber than the inner area whereby the cordwise stiffness
      of the fin increases in the direction of the trailing edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The inner area is preferably of a sawtooth configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Still further, this invention comprises in a watercraft
      having propulsion means extending below the water line comprising
      a pair of flexible fins each having a leading edge and a trailing
      edge and adapted to oscillate through an arcuate path in a
      generally transverse direction with respect to the central
      longitudinal dimension of said watercraft, and means operatively
      associated with said propulsion means for applying input force to
      said propulsion means whereby as input force is applied said
      flexible fins can twist to form an angle of attack for providing
      forward thrust with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the
      watercraft while moving in both directions along said arcuate
      path;<br>
      <br>
      [0010] the further improvement wherein each of said fins is
      provided with means at its trailing edge to provide adjustable
      tensioning of the trailing edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This invention further comprises in a watercraft having
      propulsion means extending below the water line comprising a pair
      of flexible fins each having a leading edge and a trailing edge
      and adapted to oscillate through an arcuate path in a generally
      transverse direction with respect to the central longitudinal
      dimension of said watercraft, and means operatively associated
      with said propulsion means for applying input force to said
      propulsion means whereby as input force is applied said flexible
      fins can twist to form an angle of attack for providing forward
      thrust with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the
      watercraft while moving in both directions along said arcuate
      path;<br>
      <br>
      [0012] the more specific improvement wherein each of said fins is
      provided with threaded means at the clew of its trailing edge to
      provide adjustable tensioning of the trailing edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention pertains to an improved pedaled kayak
      propelled by the action of two transversely oscillating fins or
      sails. As the force on the pedals is increased, the less
      restrained end of the fins or sail twists to assume a propeller
      like shape. As the fins or sails oscillate, they change pitch or
      shape upon reaching the end of their arcuate movement, viz, when
      they simultaneously reverse direction of movement at the opposite
      ends of their arcuate pathway. This sail action is somewhat
      similar to what happens when tacking in a sailboat in that the
      sails exert, in both of their directions of movement, a forward
      thrust component.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The kayak has a generally elongated hull having a cockpit,
      a seat located such that the hip of the user is substantially
      fully below the upper deck of the kayak. The cockpit also contains
      a set of pedals adapted to be pushed, first one and then the
      other, by the user's feet. The hull is also provided with a rudder
      and tiller.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The pedals are operatively connected by pedal shafts to the
      propulsion means which extends through two vertically disposed
      compartments in the center of the bottom of hull, the upper
      compartment being somewhat larger than the lower compartment. The
      bottom of the lower compartment has an opening.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The fins of this invention are of unique structure. While
      the maximum spanwise length from the base to the top of the fin
      and the cordwise length from the leading edge to the trailing edge
      is similar to prior fins, the configuration and composition by
      area are significantly different. The fins of this invention have
      essentially square top ends as contrasted with the more nearly
      triangular top ends of prior fins. This results in a somewhat
      greater average spanwise length. Thus, in fins of this invention
      have increased cord area near and at the top end of the fin.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The fin is oscillated from a pivot point near the base of
      its mast. This motion induces a velocity field perpendicular to
      the fin that increases in strength proportional to the distance
      from the base. In order to achieve efficient lift (avoid stall and
      operate near optimal Lift Coefficient), the fin must twist in a
      manner proportional to the increased perpendicular flow speed. It
      has been found that having a wider cord length at the tip,
      (essentially square-top design) creates the desired fin twist and
      thus more efficient propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Optimized cord-wise flexibility of the fin for more
      efficient lift generation. Just as proper cord-wise hydrodynamic
      foil shape is important on an airplane wing, or the sail shape on
      a sailboat, having an efficient lifting surface is necessary for
      the fin to operate efficiently. Lifting foils typically have a
      cross-section where the maximum thickness, (or in the case of a
      sail, maximum outward curve) is located about [1/3] of the local
      cord length back from the leading edge. Like a sail, and unlike
      most commercial foil sections, the fin of U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,249
      is flexible. This flexibility requires that the fin stiffness and
      shape, combined with the surrounding flow-field, determine the
      shape of the foil during operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the present invention, an innovative geometry and
      multiple material molding process creates a cord-wise flexibility
      that results in an efficient fin shape during operation. In the
      fins of this invention, the cord-wise stiffness of the fin
      increases in the aft direction, that is, in the direction of the
      trailing edge, despite the overall thickness of the fin gradually
      decreasing in the direction of the trailing edge due to the
      peripheral stiffer material used in the sub-mold as further
      described hereinbelow. We have found that the sawtooth pattern
      increases the cordwise stiffness near the trailing edge while
      minimizing spanwise stiffness. This construction significantly
      enhances performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The reference to "fin" herein is generally synonymous with
      flapper or foil.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The present invention provides an adjustable "mainsheet",
      that is, fin tensioning device to allow for customized peddling
      resistance for various operators and optimized hydrodynamic
      performance for different vessel lengths. The fin is analogous to
      a sailboat sail in several ways. One way is the attachment and
      tension of the corner of the fin located aft and near the base.
      The tension on this corner affects the shape and therefore
      performance of the fin much like the mainsheet tension does on a
      sail. Increasing the tension of this corner (mainsheet tension)
      increases the angle of attack of the fin meeting the water which
      creates more lift and more resistance. The mainsheet adjusting
      device located on the aft corner of the fin is easily adjusted by
      the user. Larger, stronger operators, operators that wish to
      peddle at a slower cadence, or fins used on longer, faster vessels
      may prefer to operate with more mainsheet tension. Those who
      prefer to peddle at a higher frequency, less powerful peddlers, or
      operators of shorter and slower boats may prefer less mainsheet
      tension.<br>

        EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0030] The oscillating fin 10 has a mast 12 on its or in proximity
      to its leading edge 13. The base is affixed to and carried by base
      or clew member 14. The top of the fin 10 has two squared off,
      nearly right angled, corners 16 and 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The trailing edge 20 of the fin 10 has an adjustable
      tensioning means 22 at the base or clew 14 of the fin 10. The
      tensioning means comprises threaded lead screw 24 rigidly attached
      to the base 14. A thumb nut 26 is threadably received on lead
      screw 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The lead screw 24 and thumb nut 26 set in cutout 28 in the
      fin 10. The exposed free face or end 30 of thumb nut 26 and the
      cutout 28 are such that as the thumb nut 26 is digitally rotated
      on the lead screw 24, the exposed face or end 30 of thumb nut 26
      comes into abutting contact with the exposed edge 31 of the cutout
      28 in fin 10. As the thumb nut 26 is then further advanced on the
      lead screw 24 in the direction of the top of the fin 10, the face
      30 of thumb nut 26 exerts increased pressure on the exposed edge
      31 of cutout 28. The tension in the trailing edge 20 is thereby
      increased. It will be understood then that as the thumb nut 26 is
      turned in the opposite direction so that it no longer applies
      force or pressure to the edge 31 of the cutout 28, the tension in
      the trailing edge 20 of fin 10 is lessened so that the trailing
      edge of fin 10 becomes more flaccid.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The body of the fin 10 presently has two distinct areas.
      The generally peripheral area is an undermolded area 32 which is
      pre-formed of a harder, stiffer, less flexible rubber, preferably
      have a Shore A Hardness Scale of about 50 to about 90 and more
      preferably about 70. The undermolded area 32 forms the periphery
      or edges at the top and the leading and trailing edges of the
      fins. The part forming the undermolded area is then placed in a
      mold and a composition forming a softer rubber, having a Shore A
      Hardness Scale of about 30 to about 50, and more preferably about
      40, is then overmolded to form the inner sawtooth area 34 to yield
      a unitary foil, as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As shown in FIG. 7, the fin is thicker at the leading edge
      13 than at the trailing edge 20. However, there is a relatively
      large area of stiffer peripheral rubber material 32 as the
      trailing edge 20 is approached. This provides increasing cordwise
      stiffness in the fin itself in the direction from leading edge to
      trailing edge even as the fin becomes gradually thinner. Cordwise
      stiffness can, if desired, be further increased at the trailing
      edge by advancing thumb nut 26 on lead screw 26.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The sawtooth configuration of the softer rubber material at
      34 is preferred. However, other similar shapes of the softer area
      can be devised by those skilled in the art to provide the same fin
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The base 14 includes inner member 36 having a through hole
      for receiving the shaft 38 on which the base carrying the fin 10
      rotates in oscillating fashion. Integrally formed at the center of
      the outer surface of inner member 36 is sprocket 40 over which
      passes a chain (not shown). The entire mechanism shown in the
      drawings of this patent is received in the bottom of the lower
      compartment 45 of a kayak and extends downwardly through the
      opening in the lower compartment 45 into the water as shown in
      FIG. 2. The chain drives the base with fin 10. The base has
      attached thereto fairings 42 and 44.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] It is to be understood that there are two fins 10, each
      with its own base, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>

      having handle bar, passenger seat and pedal, much like a bicycle,
      with propulsion being provided through a gear train to a rotary
      propeller; Fanelli U.S. Pat. No. 4,511,338 pertains to a
      detachable device for converting a said board into a water
      bicycle; Guiboche U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,422 discloses a pedal boat

      <br>
      The Boston Globe, May 13, 1997, reports on a mechanically powered
      propulsion system for ships undergoing development at
      Massachusetts Institute Of Technology which employs as the
      ultimate propulsion means a pair of flappers said to mimic the
      flapper motion of a penguin described as being like holding ones
      arms straight down with the hands open, then bringing the arms
      together in a clapping motion while rotating one's hands. The
      system includes four different motors to produce the flapping and
      twisting functions, all guided by a computer and complex
      circuiting.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</span><br

      path.<br>
      <br>
      This invention is applicable to watercraft generally, including
      kayaks, boats, catamarans, and the like. The watercraft may, but
      not necessarily, include a hull having a keel.<br>

      <br>
      One preferred embodiment is a pedaled kayak propelled by the
      "penguin" like action of two transversely oscillating flappers or
      sails. As the force on the pedals is increased, the less
      restrained end of the flapper or sail twists to assume a propeller
      like shape. As the flappers or sails oscillate, they change pitch
      or shape upon reaching the end of their arcuate movement, viz,
      when they simultaneously reverse direction of movement at the
      opposite ends of their arcuate pathway. This sail action is
      somewhat similar to what happens when tacking in a sailboat in
      that the sails exert, in both of their directions of movement, a
      forward thrust component.<br>
      <br>
      Turning to the drawings in more detail, the drawings illustrate an
      embodiment of the invention in the form of a kayak having a
      generally elongated hull 10 made, for example, by rotomolding from
      a plastic such as polyethylene. The cockpit 12 has a seat 14
      located such that the hip of the user is substantially fully below
      the upper deck 16 of the kayak. The cockpit 12 also contains a set
      of pedals 18 and 20 adapted to be pushed, first one and then the
      other, by the user's feet. The hull 10 is also provided with a
      rudder 22 and tiller 24.<br>
      <br>
      The pedals 18 &amp; 20 are operatively connected by pedal shafts
      26 and 28, respectively, to the propulsion means which extends
      upwardly through two vertically disposed compartments 30 and 32 in
      the center of the bottom of hull 10, the upper compartment 30
      being somewhat larger than the lower compartment 32. The bottom of
      the lower compartment 32 has an opening 34.<br>
      <br>
      The drums 36 and 38 are rotatable about the fixed longitudinal
      steel shaft 40 which is carried in the lower compartment 32.<br>
      <br>
      The rotatable drums 36 and 38 carry radially extending rigid masts
      42 and 44, respectively. The masts project in a generally
      downwardly direction so that they always remain in the water and
      do not contact the underside of the hull. The masts support the
      sails or flappers 46 and 48, respectively, at their leading edges.
      Each of the sails is rotatable about its mast, so that the edge of
      the flapper opposite the leading edge can move from one side to
      the other with respect to the longitudinal center line of drums 36
      and 38. This action results in both flappers exerting of forward
      force or push on the watercraft in both directions of transverse
      movement of the flappers, providing superior efficiency and speed.
      The extent of travel or movement of the trailing edges is limited
      by the adjustment provided by main sheet tensioners 50 and 52.<br>
      <br>
      The sail or flapper support arm (mast) 42 is attached to the front
      of front drum and second Sail or Flapper support arm 44 is
      attached to the front of rear drum 38. At the rear of each sail or
      flapper, the main sheet tensioner connects to its respective drum
      and is adjustable in its reach or length to alter the tension in
      each of the sails or flappers 46 and 48.<br>
      <br>
      The two drums 36 and 38 are normally in the water. The drums 36
      and 38 are preferably made of an engineered plastic such as
      Delron. When the drums 36 and 38 rotate on the fixed longitudinal
      steel shaft 40, the inside of the Delron drums and the outside of
      the steel shaft form a bearing.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, when the two sail or flapper support arms (masts) 42
      and 44 are in the same plane with each other, the pedal shafts 26
      and 28 are in the same plane with each other, although, of course,
      these two planes are perpendicular to each other. Perpendicularity
      is not important to the function of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1 to 7 show the most preferred embodiment of the means for
      providing propulsive force where cable connections are used
      exclusively. This embodiment has a total of five cables, three
      cables, 54, 56 &amp; 58, at the front (front being in the
      direction of the bow of the kayak), and two cables, 60 and 62, at
      the back. The small pulley, 64, which is at the front with its
      cable 58 helps reduce excessive tension on the two rear cables.<br>
      <br>
      Except for the cable 58 running over the small pulley, 64, the
      other 4 cables each run from one of the metal upper members,
      referred to as pedal support and cable guides, 66 and 68, each of
      which carry a pedal shaft, 26 and 28, to one of the Delron drums
      36 or 38. Thus, two cables 54 and 60 run from one metal pedal
      support and cable guide 66 to front and rear Delron drums, 36 and
      38, respectively. The other two cables 56 and 62 run from the
      second upper pedal support and cable guide 68 to the Delron drums
      36 and 38. These cables have swaged ends which are countersunk
      into the Delron drums 36 and 38, as shown in FIG. 6. The flanges
      70 on the pedal support and cable guides, 66 and 68, act as cable
      restrainers and serve to keep the cables in place over the guides.<br>
      <br>
      The pedals and their shafts 26 and 28 are connected to pedal
      support and cable guides 66 and 68. The pedal support and cable
      guides 66 and 68 have Delron inserts so that pedal shafts and
      pedal support and cable guides can rotate back and forth on
      stationary transverse or cross shaft 72 which is fixably welded to
      the upper part of the coat hanger shaped support structure 74, the
      lower part of said support structure 74 carrying the longitudinal
      shaft 40, which, in turn, carries the two Delron drums 36 and 38
      to which the sail or flapper arms (masts) are attached.<br>
      <br>
      The holes 76 on each pedal shaft are provided with slidable pins
      which can be pulled in and out of the holes 78 which are arrayed
      across top of each of the metal pedal support and cable guides 66
      and 68 to adjust for and accommodate different human leg lengths.
      This provides a very simple and effective adjustment mechanism to
      allow for different lengths of the human body. The pedals can be
      pinned in one of 5 locations to make adjustments.<br>
      <br>
      The small front pulley rotates 64 on fixed shaft 80 which shaft is
      held by uprights 82 welded to the coat hanger shaped support
      structure 74 with screws. The small front pulley 64 preferably is
      polyethylene but Delron can be used. The nylon washers act as
      spacers to keep front pulley 64 in position.<br>
      <br>
      Several cable systems can be used. A system which allows all four
      cables 54, 56, 60 and 62 to be adjusted independently by
      tightening or loosening of threaded ends 84 seems to work the
      best. Tuning the exact amount of flapper and pedal travel, and the
      size and stiffness of the flappers is a function of the watercraft
      characteristics and can be carried out by those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 8 and 9 show an alternate embodiment in which there is no
      front pulley and hence just 4 cables, three of which 86, 88, and
      90, can be seen in FIGS. 8 and 9. These cables are connected to
      chains 94 which run over sprockets 96 and turn the metal drums
      (instead of Delron) 98. Except as noted, the embodiment of FIGS. 8
      and 9 is the same in construction and operation as the first
      embodiment discussed hereinabove with respect to FIGS. 1 to 7.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also includes the case where the cables are replaced
      by a gear train.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 9 show how the device is joined to the body
      of the kayak by T-bolts 100.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention produces a lot of speed out of a kayak with
      little effort. The present invention provides watercraft which are
      more fun to use. The device is also highly utilitarian in that it
      can be easily removed from one watercraft and placed in another.
      The stability of the kayak is also improved with the flappers in
      the water.<br>
      <br>
      It is usually not necessary to achieve more than one side-to-side
      cycle of the flappers through the arcuate pathway for every back
      and forth cycle of the pedals. When the ratio of the rotation of
      the flappers versus the cycle of the pedals is increased to a
      ratio of 3:1, the pedals move 14" while the flappers move through
      about 200 degrees of rotation. At this ratio, the resistance on
      the pedals is large and thus the cadence is low. Generally, the
      higher ratio permits the use of smaller flappers.<br>
      <br>
      The flappers can be made in a fiberglass mold which makes a two
      sided fiberglass sail. The flexing and twisting characteristics
      are ideal. Similar sails could be vacuum formed in production. The
      flappers can also be made from flexible plastic or rubber. By
      using a flexible plastic, it is possible to eliminate the need for
      a separate mast. Instead, the flappers can be in the form of fins
      that can articulate or twist to form an angle of attack for
      providing forward thrust or propulsion.<br>
