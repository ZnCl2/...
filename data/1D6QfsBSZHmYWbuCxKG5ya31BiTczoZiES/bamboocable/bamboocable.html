      <div align="center"><b>Bamboo cable, comparable to steel in
          tensile strength was being used at minimum 2000 years ago.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Marco Polo&nbsp; described how the Chinese used and manufactured
      bamboo cables for towing boats.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers experimenting for the Whangpoo Conservancy Board found
      out that these twisted and plaited bamboo cables were made with
      material taken from the outer layer of the bamboo (which was only
      1/8 inch or 3 mm thick). They estimated that the working stress
      was about 20,000 pounds per square inch, which was of the same
      order as normally taken by steel wires of the same size.<br>
      <br>
      The breakages were very few with bamboo cables. Moreover, while
      hempen ropes lose some 25 percent of their strength when wet, the
      tensile strength of plaited bamboo cables increases about 20
      percent when they are fully saturated with water. Bamboo cables
      were available in lengths up to a quarter mile.<br>
      <br>
      Bamboo cables were the earliest structural element in the history
      of engineering to be used for suspension bridges, which originated
      in western China and the Himalayas.<br>
      <br>
      Primitive bridges made of bamboo cables droop across gorges with
      one end fixed lower than the other. Bamboo tubes greased with yak
      butter slide down the cables, with a cradle hanging from them in
      which people and animals side. Of great strength, a bamboo cable
      of 2 inch diameter could support 4 ton, these ancient bridges
      spanned distances up to 76 meters without central supports.<br>
      <br>
      Later on, various designs combined whole bamboo culms, woven
      slats, and cables braided of workable species such as Gigantochloa
      apus, which was a favorite for bridges in Java.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Anlan Bridge</b><b><br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img src="anianbridgebamboo.jpg" alt="Anlan
            Bridge" width="525" height="394"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The remarkable Anlan bridge on the Min River in China was first
      constructed around 300 AD. Historians consider this bridge one of
      the engineering marvels of the ancient world.<br>
      <br>
      Bamboo cables have a tensile strength of up to 26,000 pounds per
      square inch, while hemp rope can only carry a stress of 8,000
      pounds.<br>
      <br>
      The Anlan suspension bridge spans the 1,000-foot wide Min River,
      is 9 feet wide, and was built entirely of bamboo cables resting on
      seven supports fixed equidistant in the bed of the stream. The
      floor of the bridge rested across 10 bamboo cables, each 21 inches
      in circumference, and five similar cables on each side form the
      rails.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the silica-containing outer surface is very resistant to
      wear, e.g., against rock surfaces, which is naturally important
      both in towing and bridge cables.<br>

      </b><b>How to Plait or Braid Bamboo Cables?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bamboo cables are made by first splitting bamboo canes over their
      entire length into thin strips. Once the strips are obtained, the
      soft inner layer needs to be removed from the silica-rich outer
      layer. A Nicaraguan bamboo basket maker demonstrates how to
      separate the inner from the outer layer in the video below.<br>

        </b>METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING COMPRESSED AND HARDENED BODY OF
        BAMBOO FIBRES, AND COMPRESSED AND HARDENED BODY OF BAMBOO FIBRES
        MANUFACTURED BY SAID METHOD</b><br>
      <p class="printAbstract" lang="en">Provided is a method for
        manufacturing a compressed and hardened body of bamboo fibres,
        said body exhibiting homogeneous mechanical strength and
        excellent design properties, as a result of a new bamboo fiber
        crushing technique and the adhesion effect associated with the
        capillarity of a thermosetting resin.ã€€A bamboo fibre aggregate
        is obtained by roller pressing cut bamboo pieces and separating
        some part of the cut bamboo pieces' fibres, and a non-separated
        fibre bamboo piece aggregate is obtained with remaining narrow
        bamboo pieces. A bamboo fibre mixture is then obtained by
        bringing together without separation the bamboo fibre aggregate
        of cut bamboo pieces and the non-separated fibre bamboo piece
        aggregate of narrow bamboo pieces to form one body. The bamboo
        fibre mixture is then subjected to processes such as: dry
        distillation, drying, immersion in a thermosetting resin,
        drying, compression molding, thermosetting to manufacture a
        compressed and hardened body of bamboo fibres.</p>

      </b><b>Processes for the treatment of plant materials in the
        preparation of fibres</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      In obtaining fibres from fibrous tissues such as flax, hemp,
      sisal, ramie, and bamboo, the materials are subjected to the
      action of a 0.1-0.5 per cent solution of a neutral salt of one of
      the alkali metals or of ammonium. Neutral tartrates, citrates,
      oxalates, sulphates, and phosphates, which precipitate the
      alkaline earth metals with which the pectinous substances are
      associated, are preferred. As applied to ramie ribbons which
      should be comparatively fresh, the ionic exchange treatment may be
      effected with a 0.1-0.5 per cent ammonium sulphate solution at 1-2
      atmospheres pressure for 60-20 minutes, and, after the removal of
      the pectinous complexes, the material is heated in an autoclave
      with a suitable alkaline solution, such as a 2-4 per cent caustic
      soda solution under a pressure of 6-10 atmospheres for 20-60
      minutes in order to remove fats, waxes, cutaneous substances and
      resins impregnating or adhering to the fibres. The chlorophyll
      remaining is removed by bleaching and there is thus obtained a
      product consisting of the ultimate fibres. The alkali treatment
      may be repeated for a shorter period after bleaching and a strong
      lustrous product is obtained comparable in appearance with
      artificial silk but much stronger. Bamboo may be depectinized and
      then submitted to alkali treatment for a shorter period than
      ramie, and if while still moist, the softened outer layer or skin
      is removed, a product is obtained of great length and strength,
      suitable as a substitute for hemp, jute and the like in rope and
      sack manufacture. The fibre may be bleached, but this may occasion
      mechanical weakening. In treating flax straw, the material is
      boiled in a 0.1-0.5 per cent solution of ammonium sulphate at a
      pressure of 1-2 atmospheres for 60-20 minutes. The insoluble
      pectose is converted into soluble pectin. The straw is expressed,
      washed and dried, and then scutched &amp;c. as is usual. The
      reagent may be used repeatedly until its colour is so dark that
      staining of the fibre begins after which it may be used for
      manure.<br>

      </b><b>Manufacture process for recombined bamboo </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention discloses a manufacture process for recombined
      bamboo. Raw materials are loaded and stacked. The manufacture
      process includes the following steps that A, the raw materials are
      dried, wherein the raw materials are placed under negative
      pressure to be dried till the moisture content is lower than 15%;
      B, high-temperature pyrolysis is conducted, wherein the
      temperature rises to 170-240 DEG C, vertical air flow with the
      wind speed being 2-10 m/s is formed in an accompany manner in a
      pyrolysis kiln, and the pressure inside and outside the pyrolysis
      kiln is kept equal by discharging gas till the pressure inside and
      outside the pyrolysis kiln is naturally equal; C, dipping is
      conducted; D, dipping drying is conduced, wherein the raw
      materials are placed under negative pressure to be dried till the
      moisture content is 7%-15%; E, management is conducted, wherein
      the raw materials are managed into bundles, and when the pressure
      which is perpendicular to the fiber direction, same in force
      application direction and same in magnitude is borne, the distance
      between thicknesses of all force application points on each single
      bundle of raw materials is smaller than 5%; and F, pressing
      solidification is conducted. The manufacture process has the
      beneficial effects that the utilization rate of the raw materials
      is high, the mechanical strength of manufactured recombined bamboo
      square stock is large, the production efficiency is high, and the
      one-time yield is high.<br>
