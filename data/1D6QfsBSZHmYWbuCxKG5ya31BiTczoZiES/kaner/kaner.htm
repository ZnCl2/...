      The rapid development of miniaturized electronic devices has
      increased the demand for compact on-chip energy storage.
      Microscale supercapacitors have great potential to complement or
      replace batteries and electrolytic capacitors in a variety of
      applications. However, conventional micro-fabrication techniques
      have proven to be cumbersome in building cost-effective
      micro-devices, thus limiting their widespread application. Here we
      demonstrate a scalable fabrication of graphene
      micro-supercapacitors over large areas by direct laser writing on
      graphite oxide films using a standard LightScribe DVD burner. More
      than 100 micro-supercapacitors can be produced on a single disc in
      30?min or less. The devices are built on flexible substrates for
      flexible electronics and on-chip uses that can be integrated with
      MEMS or CMOS in a single chip. Remarkably, miniaturizing the
      devices to the microscale results in enhanced charge-storage
      capacity and rate capability. <b>These micro-supercapacitors
        demonstrate a power density of ~200uW/cm-3</b>, which is among
      the highest values achieved for any supercapacitor.<br>

      micro-supercapacitor. A GO film supported on a PET sheet is placed
      on a DVD media disc. The disc is inserted into a LightScribe DVD
      drive and a computer-designed circuit is etched onto the film. The
      laser inside the drive converts the golden-brown GO into black LSG
      at precise locations to produce interdigitated graphene circuits
      (a). Copper tape is applied along the edges to improve the
      electrical contacts, and the interdigitated area is defined by
      polyimide (Kapton) tape (b). An electrolyte overcoat is then added
      to create a planar micro-supercapacitor (c). (d,e)<b> This

      </b><b>Abstract :</b> The energy of ionic thermal motion presents
      universally, which is as high as 4 kJ\bullet kg-1\bullet K-1 in
      aqueous solution, where thermal velocity of ions is in the order
      of hundreds of meters per second at room temperature1,2. Moreover,
      the thermal velocity of ions can be maintained by the external
      environment, which means it is unlimited. However, little study
      has been reported on converting the ionic thermal energy into
      electricity. Here we present a graphene device with asymmetric
      electrodes configuration to capture such ionic thermal energy and
      convert it into electricity. An output voltage around 0.35 V was
      generated when the device was dipped into saturated CuCl2
      solution, in which this value lasted over twenty days. A positive
      correlation between the open-circuit voltage and the temperature,
      as well as the cation concentration, was observed. Furthermore, we
      demonstrated that this finding is of practical value by lighting a
      commercial light-emitting diode up with six of such graphene
      devices connected in series. This finding provides a new way to
      understand the behavior of graphene at molecular scale and
      represents a huge breakthrough for the research of self-powered
      technology. Moreover, the finding will benefit quite a few
      applications, such as artificial organs, clean renewable energy
      and portable electronics. <br>

      While the demand for ever-smaller electronic devices has spurred
      the miniaturization of a variety of technologies, one area has
      lagged behind in this downsizing revolution: energy-storage units,
      such as batteries and capacitors.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Now, Richard Kaner, a member of the California NanoSystems
      Institute at UCLA and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry,
      and Maher El-Kady, a graduate student in Kaner's laboratory, may
      have changed the game.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The UCLA researchers have developed a groundbreaking technique
      that uses a DVD burner to fabricate micro-scale graphene-based
      supercapacitors —&nbsp; devices that can charge and discharge a
      hundred to a thousand times faster than standard batteries. These
      micro-supercapacitors, made from a one-atom–thick layer of
      graphitic carbon, can be easily manufactured and readily
      integrated into small devices such as next-generation pacemakers.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The new cost-effective fabrication method, described in a study
      published this week in the journal Nature Communications, holds
      promise for the mass production of these supercapacitors, which
      have the potential to transform electronics and other fields.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "The integration of energy-storage units with electronic circuits
      is challenging and often limits the miniaturization of the entire
      system," said Kaner, who is also a professor of materials science
      and engineering at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and
      Applied Science. "This is because the necessary energy-storage
      components scale down poorly in size and are not well suited to
      the planar geometries of most integrated fabrication processes."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "Traditional methods for the fabrication of micro-supercapacitors
      involve labor-intensive lithographic techniques that have proven
      difficult for building cost-effective devices, thus limiting their
      commercial application," El-Kady said. "Instead, we used a
      consumer-grade LightScribe DVD burner to produce graphene
      micro-supercapacitors over large areas at a fraction of the cost
      of traditional devices. Using this technique, we have been able to
      produce more than 100 micro-supercapacitors on a single disc in
      less than 30 minutes, using inexpensive materials."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The process of miniaturization often relies on flattening
      technology, making devices thinner and more like a geometric plane
      that has only two dimensions. In developing their new
      micro-supercapacitor, Kaner and El-Kady used a two-dimensional
      sheet of carbon, known as graphene, which only has the thickness
      of a single atom in the third dimension.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Kaner and El-Kady took advantage of a new structural design during
      the fabrication. For any supercapacitor to be effective, two
      separated electrodes have to be positioned so that the available
      surface area between them is maximized. This allows the
      supercapacitor to store a greater charge. A previous design
      stacked the layers of graphene serving as electrodes, like the
      slices of bread on a sandwich. While this design was functional,
      however, it was not compatible with integrated circuits.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In their new design, the researchers placed the electrodes side by
      side using an interdigitated pattern, akin to interwoven fingers.
      This helped to maximize the accessible surface area available for
      each of the two electrodes while also reducing the path over which
      ions in the electrolyte would need to diffuse. As a result, the
      new supercapacitors have more charge capacity and rate capability
      than their stacked counterparts.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Interestingly, the researchers found that by placing more
      electrodes per unit area, they boosted the micro-supercapacitor's
      ability to store even more charge.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Kaner and El-Kady were able to fabricate these intricate
      supercapacitors using an affordable and scalable technique that
      they had developed earlier. They glued a layer of plastic onto the
      surface of a DVD and then coated the plastic with a layer of
      graphite oxide. Then, they simply inserted the coated disc into a
      commercially available LightScribe optical drive — traditionally
      used to label DVDs — and took advantage of the drive's own laser
      to create the interdigitated pattern. The laser scribing is so
      precise that none of the "interwoven fingers" touch each other,
      which would short-circuit the supercapacitor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "To label discs using LightScribe, the surface of the disc is
      coated with a reactive dye that changes color on exposure to the
      laser light. Instead of printing on this specialized coating, our
      approach is to coat the disc with a film of graphite oxide, which
      then can be directly printed on," Kaner said. "We previously found
      an unusual photo-thermal effect in which graphite oxide absorbs
      the laser light and is converted into graphene in a similar
      fashion to the commercial LightScribe process. With the precision
      of the laser, the drive renders the computer-designed pattern onto
      the graphite oxide film to produce the desired graphene circuits."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "The process is straightforward, cost-effective and can be done at
      home," El-Kady said. "One only needs a DVD burner and graphite
      oxide dispersion in water, which is commercially available at a
      moderate cost."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The new micro-supercapacitors are also highly bendable and
      twistable, making them potentially useful as energy-storage
      devices in flexible electronics like roll-up displays and TVs,
      e-paper, and even wearable electronics.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The researchers showed the utility of their new laser-scribed
      graphene micro-supercapacitor in an all-solid form, which would
      enable any new device incorporating them to be more easily shaped
      and flexible. The micro-supercapacitors can also be fabricated
      directly on a chip using the same technique, making them highly
      useful for integration into micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
      or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      These micro-supercapacitors show excellent cycling stability, an
      important advantage over micro-batteries, which have shorter
      lifespans and which could pose a major problem when embedded in
      permanent structures — such as biomedical implants, active
      radio-frequency identification tags and embedded micro-sensors —
      for which no maintenance or replacement is possible.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      As they can be directly integrated on-chip, these
      micro-supercapacitors may help to better extract energy from
      solar, mechanical and thermal sources and thus make more efficient
      self-powered systems. They could also be fabricated on the
      backside of solar cells in both portable devices and rooftop
      installations to store power generated during the day for use
      after sundown, helping to provide electricity around the clock
      when connection to the grid is not possible.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "We are now looking for industry partners to help us mass-produce
      our graphene micro-supercapacitors," Kaner said.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Kaner's micro-scale graphene-based supercapacitor research is
      supported by Maxwell Technologies Inc., a global leader in
      manufacturing carbon-based supercapacitors and other energy
      storage devices.<br>
