      <br>
      After about four years of planning and development through trial
      and error - including about a year-and-a-half creating the designs
      on paper - Bob Kostoff has reached his goal. He now owns the
      patent on the technology to prove it. The result was 'The Gravity
      Powered Machine.<br>
      <br>
      ' The self-sustaining engine provides as little as 10 foot-pounds
      of torque or as much as hundreds, Kostoff said, adding how its
      cost is less than half of a small wind turbine. <br>
      <br>
      The machine - which only requires a little bit of start-up juice
      before it creates enough power to sustain itself - works much like
      a teeter-totter, using a series of sliding weights that, with the
      help of the earths gravitational pull, force the unit to continue
      spinning around in a circle. <br>
      <br>
      Install a series of magnets in the unit and tens of thousands of
      watts of electricity can be produced, an amount that depends on
      the size of the actual machine. <br>
      <br>
      “You can get off the hydro grid with one of these,” Kostoff told
      The Lindsay Post. <br>
      <br>
      So far, about five of the units have been made. Once he got the
      concept down, he said he began fine-tuning the more cosmetic
      aspects of the machine, such as reducing noise. <br>
      <br>
      “Once you figure it out, it's just about perfecting it,” he said.
      <br>
      <br>
      The machines can be used in a variety of applications, Kostoff
      said, because they produce electricity at no cost. <br>
      <br>
      For example, he said the units can be used to generate the power
      needed for electrolysis, a process that creates hydrogen, a “free
      fuel” that could be used to power your personal vehicle. <br>
      <br>

      video of it in action, visit www.newsourceofenergy.com. [ defunct
      website ]<br>
      <br>
      This engine is a self sustaining gravity powered unit. It produces
      all the energy needed to run a generator large enough to provide
      power for all the hydro and heat needed for your home. <br>
      <br>
      This patented system can be as small as producing 10 foot pounds
      of torque or as much as over 300 foot pounds of torque. <br>
      <br>
      Each unit is approximately 8 feet by 4 feet by 6 feet tall and is
      totally enclosed for safely protection against moving parts.<br>

      <br>
      A rotor rotates about a spindle and has one or more sliders which
      are movabl e between two stop points. An actuator is activated by
      pressurized fluid and causes th e slider or sliders to move back
      and forth between the stop points. The back and forth movement
      causes the spindle to rotate and the rotational energy of the
      spindle is harnessed to produce electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to an apparatus for converting one form of
      energy to another and more particularly to an apparatus for
      converting the energy from fluids under pressure to electrical
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In mines and at construction sites, pressurized fluid is the usual
      source of energy for driving heavy machinery such as drills, power
      shovels and buckets. On farms, pressurized fluid is used in a wide
      variety of machines. It is used for example to raise and lower
      heavy machinery such as the cutting heads of combines, ploughs,
      mowers and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Fluid under pressure is usually produced by compressors powered by
      gas, diesel fuel or gasoline. In most circumstances it is more
      economical to compress fluid on a continuous basis rather than
      periodically when it required. Where the pressurized fluid is
      produced continuously however, pressure tanks are required to
      store it until it is required for use. If the pressurized fluid is
      stored for relatively long periods of time, its pressure will
      dissipate and it will become unusable during those long periods
      and the fuel used to pressurize such fluid will be wasted.
      Accordingly, for the most efficient use of the fuel, the fluid
      should be used immediately after it is compressed.<br>
      <br>
      I have invented an apparatus for converting the energy of
      pressurized fluid such as air and water to electrical energy.
      Unused pressurized fluid need not be stored in pressure tanks for
      long periods but may be converted to a form of energy which is a
      much more versatile than pressurized fluid. Since in most
      workplaces, there is a constant need for electricity, the
      electricity produced by my apparatus will be used immediately.
      There will be no need to store it and moreover, when it is used,
      there will a reduction in the use of electricity from other
      sources with resulting savings in the cost of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Briefly, the apparatus of my invention includes a spindle
      rotatable about a horizontal axis and a slider adapted to rotate
      about the axis. The slider is movable between two stop points on
      opposite sides of the axis. The apparatus also includes an
      actuator activated by pressurized fluid for causing the slider to
      move back and forth between the stop points. Also included are
      means for controlling the back and forth movement such as to cause
      the slider to rotate. Means is also included for harnessing the
      rotational energy of the spindle for the production of
      electricity.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With reference to Figure 1, the apparatus of the invention,
      generally 10, includes a rotor 12, a slider 14 and an actuator 16.
      The rotor is mounted to spindle 18 and revolves about a horizontal
      axis of rotation 20-20. The rotor has a longitudinal axis 12a-12a
      which passes through the axis of rotation.<br>
      <br>
      A fluid such as oil is store in a tank 19 and when required, flows
      to a motor and pump, generally 20. The pump pressurizes the fluid
      and causes it to flow through an internal passageway in the
      spindle. The fluid flows from openings in the spindle to the
      actuator. The actuator is described below. The fluid may being
      either in the form of a gas such as air or a liquid such as oil or
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The spindle is connected to speed accelerating apparatus,
      generally 22 for increasing the rate of rotation of the input
      shaft of a turbine generally 24. The apparatus is described below.
      The rate of rotation of the spindle is controlled by the
      combination of a governor, generally 26 and brake generally 28.
      The governor and brake are conventional and are well known to
      those familiar with the art.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 2, the slider is formed of a single sheet
      of steel or other relatively heavy material and is composed of a
      pair of terminal plates 30, 32 interconnected by an elongated
      coupling 34. The two terminal plates are of equal weight and shape
      and are spaced apart an equal distance from the centre 34a of the
      coupling. The slider is symmetrical about the centre of the
      coupling.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figures 1- 4, an array of rollers, generally 36
      is formed on the under- side of each terminal plate 30,32. The
      rollers travel in elongated grooves 38a,b formed on the outer wall
      of the rotor. <br>
      <br>
      The grooves are aligned with each other and each groove receives a
      separate array of rollers.<br>
      <br>
      The grooves have aligned longitudinal axes 39 which lie on the
      longitudinal axis 12a-12a of the rotor so that the terminal plates
      travel in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis.<br>
      <br>
      A pair of spaced outer and inner end plates 40a, 40b, respectively
      is formed adjacent to one end of the rotor while outer and inner
      end plates 42a, 42b, respectively are formed at the opposite end
      of the rotor. Each outer end plate is attached to the rotor and is
      connected to a separate inner end plate by four coil springs 44.
      The inner end plate is not attached to the rotor but is free to
      move toward and away from the outer end plate. The springs bias
      the inner and outer end plates apart.<br>
      <br>
      The slider is free to slide in grooves 38a,b whose ends define two
      stop points of travel. The coil springs cushion the force of
      impact of the slider on the inner end plates at each stop point.
      That force can be considerable when the rotor and slider are
      rotating rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the cylinder 16a of actuator 16
      is pivotally attached to one end of the rotor. The ram 16b of the
      actuator is pivotally connected to one end of a rod 52. A pin 54
      pivotally connects the centre of the rod to the ear 12a of the
      rotor. The other end of the rod is pivotally connected to coupling
      34 at its centre 34a. The point of connection is on the axis of
      symmetry of the slider.<br>
      <br>
      The actuator acts to cause the slider to move radially back and
      forth in grooves 38a,b. When the ram retracts from the position
      illustrated in Figure 2, rod 52 rotates clockwise about pin 54
      with resulting radial movement of the slider to the left toward
      inner end plate 40b. When the ram extends, terminal plate 32
      slides radially outward and into contact with inner end plate 42b.
      A conventional control 55 directs the operation of the actuator.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 5, as previously indicated, rotor 12
      revolves around a horizontal axis of rotation 20-20. The rotor
      revolves clockwise and its upper end 12a has passed the highest
      point of its travel during each revolution. The actuator has
      caused the terminal plate 32 of the slider to contact inner end
      plate 42b. The other terminal plate 30 is adjacent to the axis of
      rotation of the rotor and is at its greatest distance from the
      other stop point defined by inner end plate 40b.<br>
      <br>
      The two terminal plates 30, 32 are of equal weight and they are
      spaced an equal distance from the axis of symmetry or centre of
      the slider. The upper plate 32, being farther from the axis of
      rotation 20-20 of the rotor, exerts a greater moment than the
      lower plate which is closer to the centre of rotation with
      resulting acceleration in the rate of clockwise rotation.<br>
      <br>
      The moment or turning effect of terminal plate 32, being farther
      from the axis of rotation is greater than the moment of terminal
      plate 30. The preferred location of terminal plate 30 is not as
      shown in Figure 5 but rather at the axis of rotation where one
      half of its weight is on one side of the axis and the other half
      is on the other side. In that location, its moment will be
      approximately zero since one half of its weight will cause turning
      of the rotor in one direction while the other half will cause
      turning in the opposite direction. As a result, terminal plate 30
      will have essentially no turning effect on the rotor while
      terminal plate 32, by contrast, will be the sole cause of turning
      disregarding of course the effect of inertia on the movement of
      the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The position of terminal plate 30 illustrated in Figure 5 is less
      desirable than that just described because it will exert a turning
      effect opposite to that of terminal plate 32. It will accordingly
      tend to work against the other terminal plate in causing the rotor
      to rotate.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 12 described below shows the desirable location of terminal
      component 30 (num- bered 92b in Figure 12). In the embodiment
      illustrated in Figure 12, the two terminal components are not
      connected but the operation of the rotor is similar to that
      illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 6, end 12a which was previously the upper end of the
      rotor has now become the lower end. As the end approaches its
      lowest point in a revolution, terminal plate 32 continues to
      contact stop point 42b.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 7, end 12b of the rotor approaches its highest point and
      the ram of the actuator begins to retract thereby causing the
      slider to move upward. In Figure 8, the ram is fully retracted and
      terminal plate 30 contacts the stop point defined by inner end
      plate 40b. The momentum of the rotor carries it past the point at
      which its upper end 12b is vertically above the axis of rotation
      20- 20. Once past that point, the moment produced by terminal
      plate 30 will cause the rate of rotation of the rotor to again
      accelerate.<br>
      <br>
      With reference again to Figure 1, the speed accelerating apparatus
      22 is composed by a driving pulley 60 which is attached by a
      spline to spindle 18 for rotation. A belt interconnects pulley 60
      to first and second conventional arrays of belts and pulleys of
      unequal diameter, generally 62, 64 for increasing the rate of
      rotation of the output from the spindle. The output from the
      second array is connected by belt 66 to turbine 24. The turbine is
      of conventional construction and functions to generate electrical
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 9, the rotor generally 70 is trihedral
      having three arms 72a,b and c. The angle between each arm and the
      adjacent arm on either side of it is 120 degrees. The arms have an
      elongated grooves 74 for receipt of sliders 76a,b and c. The
      sliders are movable between inward and outward stop points 78, 80
      respectively. The stop points are defined by the inner and outer
      ends of the groove. It will be observed that the inner stop point
      is adjacent to the axis of rotation 82 of the rotor while the
      outer stop point is adjacent to the outer wall of the arm.<br>
      <br>
      An actuator 90 is pivotally connected to an L-shaped support 92
      attached to the outer wall of each arm. The ram 90a of the
      actuator is pivotally connected to a first link 94 which in turn
      is pivotally connected to a second link 96. the latter link being
      pivotally connected to the slider.<br>
      <br>
      Sliders 76 operate in a way similar to slider 14 of the previous
      drawings. As the rotor revolves, each slider is drawn radially
      outward by the actuator to which it is attached as the arm reaches
      it uppermost position on the rotor. The actuator draws the slider
      radially inward when the slider reaches the lowermost position on
      the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 10, the innermost position of slider 76c
      as arm 72c rotates about the axis of rotation 82 of the rotor is
      illustrated in broken lines. In that position, the slider is at
      the same elevation as the axis of rotation.<br>
      <br>
      As the rotor completes each revolution, each slider will slide
      into and out of the in- nermost position once. Depending on the
      shape of the sliders, they may collide with and foul each other as
      they move into and out of this position. To avoid this, the walls
      of the grooves are constructed such that the slider in each groove
      travels in a path that traces out an imaginary disc but the discs
      of the three sliders are horizontally spaced apart from each
      other. Figure 11 illustrates the paths that the three sliders
      follow.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 11a, slider 76a is adjacent to the centre of rotor 12 as
      it revolves around axis 82. In Figure 11 b, slider 76b is spaced
      apart from the rotor by a space 80 which is slightly greater than
      the thickness of slider 76a and in Figure 11 c, slider 76c is
      spaced apart from the rotor by a space 82 which is slightly
      greater than the thickness of sliders 76a and 76b. The sliders
      being spaced apart in this manner will not contact each other as
      they move into and out of the innermost position on the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 12 rotor 90 is similar to rotor 12 of
      Figure 1. The slider is how- ever different. Rotor 90 is provided
      with two sliders 92a,b which are not connected to each other. Each
      slider is of the same weight as the other and each travels on
      rollers in a separate groove 94a,b. The rollers and grooves are of
      the same construction as rollers 36 and grooves 38 in Figure 1. A
      separate actuator 96a,b activates each slider. Pivotally
      interconnected links 98, 100 interconnect the ram of each actuator
      and a separate slider. The operation of the rotor and sliders of
      Figure 12 is similar to the rotor and slider of Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 12, slider 92 is at located at its outer stop point
      while slider 92b is at the inner stop point. Preferably the weight
      of slider 92b is evenly distributed on opposite sides of an
      imaginary line 100 which lies normal to the longitudinal axis
      102a-102a of the rotor and which intersects the axis of rotation
      104 of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 13, the rotor, generally 110, has a
      trihedral shape like the rotor of Figure 9. On each arm 112 of the
      rotor are two parallel lines of rollers 114 which define the path
      along which slider 116 travels. The path radiates outwardly from
      spindle 118 about which the rotor revolves and is oriented
      approximately 120 degrees apart from the paths of the other two
      sliders. Each slider is movable between radially inner and
      radially outer stop points at opposite ends of its travel. The
      slider is at its inner stop point when the end wall of slot 22
      formed in the slider contacts spindle 118. The slider is at its
      outer stop point when the slider contacts end plate of arm 112.<br>
      <br>
      An actuator 130 at the outer end of each arm causes the slider to
      move radially inward and outward in its respective path. The
      radial movement is controlled such that as each slider rotates
      toward an upper point 134 at which the slider is vertically above
      the spindle, the slider travels radially outwardly in its path.
      Conversely as each slider rotates toward a lower point 136 at
      which the slider is below the axis, the slider travels radially
      inward in its path.<br>
      <br>
      Each actuator has a ram or piston rod 138 which is connected to a
      separate slider for imparting radial movement to the slider. The
      piston rod extends and retracts in a direction 140-140 which is
      collinear with the direction of radial movement of the slider. The
      direction of movement of the piston rod in this Figure is to be
      contrasted with the direction of movement of the piston rods in
      Figure 9. In the latter Figure, the piston rods extends and
      retracts in a direction which is spaced apart from the direction
      of radial movement of the sliders.<br>
