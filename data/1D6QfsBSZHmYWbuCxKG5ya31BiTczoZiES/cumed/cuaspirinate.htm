        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      The first recorded medical use of copper is found in the Smith
      Papyrus, one of the oldest books known. The Papyrus is an Egyptian
      medical text, written between 2600 and 2200 B.C., which records
      the use of copper to sterilize chest wounds and to sterilize
      drinking water. Other early reports of copper's medicinal uses are
      found in the Ebers Papyrus, written around 1500 B.C. The Ebers
      Papyrus documents medicine practiced in ancient Egypt and in other
      cultures that flourished many centuries earlier. Copper compounds
      were recommended for headaches, "trembling of the limbs" (perhaps
      referring to epilepsy or St. Vitus' Dance), burn wounds, itching
      and certain growths in the neck, some of which were probably
      boils. Forms of copper used for the treatment of disease ranged
      from metallic copper splinters and shavings to various naturally
      occurring copper salts and oxides. A "green pigment" is spoken of
      which was probably the mineral, malachite, a form of copper
      carbonate. It could also have been chrysocolla, a copper silicate,
      or even copper chloride, which forms on copper exposed to
      seawater. In the first century A.D., Dioscorides, in his book De
      Materia Medica, described a method of making another green pigment
      known as verdigris by exposing metallic copper to the vapors of
      boiling vinegar. In this process, blue-green copper acetate forms
      on the copper surface. Verdigris and blue vitriol (copper sulfate)
      were used, among other things, in remedies for eye ailments such
      as bloodshot eyes, inflamed or "bleary" eyes, "fat in the eyes"
      (trachoma?), and cataracts.<br>
      <br>
      In the Hippocratic Collection (named for, although not entirely
      written by, the Greek physician Hippocrates, 460 to 380 B.C.),
      copper is recommended for the treatment of leg ulcers associated
      with varicose veins. To prevent infection of fresh wounds, the
      Greeks sprinkled a dry powder composed of copper oxide and copper
      sulfate on the wound. Another antiseptic wound treatment at the
      time was a boiled mixture of honey and red copper oxide. The
      Greeks had easy access to copper since the metal was readily
      available on the island of Kypros (Cyprus) from which the Latin
      name for copper, cuprum, is derived.<br>
      <br>
      By the time the Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus began
      practicing medicine, during the reign of Tiberius (14 to 37 A.D.),
      copper and its derivatives had been firmly established as an
      important drug in the medical practitioner's pharmacopoeia. In
      Celsus' series, De Medicina, books one through six list many
      purposes for which copper was used together with the preparation
      and the form of copper most effective for each ailment. For the
      treatment of venereal disease, for example, Celsus prescribed a
      remedy consisting of pepper, myrrh, saffron, cooked antimony
      sulfide, and copper oxide. These were first pounded together in
      dry wine and when dry, once again pounded together in raisin wine
      and heated until dry. For a non-healing chronic ulcer, treatment
      consisted of copper oxide and other ingredients including enough
      rose oil to give a soft consistency.<br>
      <br>
      Pliny (23 to 79 A.D.) described a number of remedies involving
      copper. Black copper oxide was given with honey to remove
      intestinal worms. Diluted and injected as drops into nostrils, it
      cleared the head and, when taken with honey or honey water, it
      purged the stomach. It was given for "eye roughness," "eye pain
      and mistiness," and ulceration of the mouth. It was blown into the
      ears to relieve ear problems.<br>
      <br>
      In the New World the Aztecs also used copper for medical purposes.
      Don Francisco de Mendoza commissioned two learned Aztec Indian
      physicians to record the pharmacological treatments known by the
      Aztecs at the time of the Conquest. For the treatment of "Faucium
      Calor" (literally, heat of the throat, or, sore throat) they
      prescribed gargling with a mixture of ingredients containing
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      Copper was also employed in ancient India and Persia to treat lung
      diseases. The tenth century book, Liber Fundamentorum
      Pharmacologiae describes the use of copper compounds for medicinal
      purposes in ancient Persia. Powdered malachite was sprinkled on
      boils, copper acetate as well as and copper oxide were used for
      diseases of the eye and for the elimination of "yellow bile."
      Nomadic Mongolian tribes treated and healed ulcers of venereal
      origin with orally administered copper sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      Turning to more modern times, the first observation of copper's
      role in the immune system was published in 1867 when it was
      reported that, during the cholera epidemics in Paris of 1832, 1849
      and 1852, copper workers were immune to the disease. More recently
      copper's role in the immune system has been supported by
      observations that individuals suffering from Menke's disease (an
      inherited disease in which there is defective copper absorption
      and metabolism) generally die of immune system-related phenomena
      and other infections. Further, animals deficient in copper have
      been shown to have increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens
      such as Salmonella and Listeria. Evidence such as this has led
      researchers to suggest strongly that copper compounds not only
      cure disease but also aid in the prevention of disease.<br>
      <br>
      In 1885, the French physician, Luton, reported on using copper
      acetate in his practice to treat arthritic patients. For external
      application he made a salve of hog's lard and 30% neutral copper
      acetate. For internal treatment, he used pills containing 10 mg.
      of copper acetate. In 1895, Kobert published his review of the
      pharmacological actions of copper compounds. Copper arsenate had
      been used to treat acute and chronic diarrhea as well as dysentery
      and cholera. A variety of inorganic copper preparations were found
      to be effective in treating chronic adenitis, eczema, impetigo,
      scorphulosis, tubercular infections, lupus, syphilis, anemias,
      chorea and facial neuralgia. An organic complex of copper
      developed by Bayer was shown to have curative powers in the
      treatment of tuberculosis. Copper treatment for tuberculosis
      continued until the 1940s, and various physicians reported on
      their success in using copper preparations in intravenous
      injections.<br>
      <br>
      In 1939, the German physician, Werner Hangarter, noticed that
      Finnish copper miners were unaffected by arthritis as long as they
      worked in the mining industry. This was particularly striking
      since rheumatism was a widespread disease in Finland, and workers
      in other industries and other towns had more rheumatic diseases
      than did the copper miners. This observation led Finnish medical
      researchers plus the Germans, Hangarter and Lübke, to begin their
      now classic clinical trials using an aqueous mixture of copper
      chloride and sodium salicylate. They successfully treated patients
      suffering from rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, neck and
      back problems, as well as sciatica.<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, just as in Pliny's time, the medical profession
      used copper sulfate as a means to clinically induce vomiting. This
      is based on the fact that one of the body's natural physiological
      responses to prevent copper intoxication is vomiting. A Manual of
      Pharmacology and its Applications to Therapeutics and Toxicology,
      published by W. B. Saunders Company in 1957 recommends the use of
      0.5 gram of copper sulfate, dissolved in a glass of water, in a
      single dose, or three doses of 0.25 gram fifteen minutes apart,
      for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1934, it has been known that individuals suffering from such
      diseases as scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, arthritis,
      malignant tumors and lymphogranulomas exhibit an elevation of
      copper in their blood plasma. Since then, the list of maladies
      bringing about such elevation has been extended to fever, wounds,
      ulcers, pain, seizures, cancers, carcinogenesis, diabetes,
      cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, and irradiation and
      tissue stresses, including restricted blood flow. This suggests
      that this redistribution of copper in the body has a general role
      in responding to physiological, disease, or injury stress. On the
      other hand, the elevation of copper in the affected organ has led
      some to postulate that it was this excess of copper that caused
      the disease. Nonetheless, this elevation of copper in diseased
      states is suggested to account for the natural synthesis of
      copper-dependent regulatory proteins and enzymes in the body
      required for biochemical responses to stress. It may be that these
      natural copper complexes expedite the relief of stress and the
      repair of tissues. Thus, it appears that in addition to the
      anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of inorganic copper
      compounds as recognized by the ancients, metallo-organic complexes
      of copper have medicinal capabilities that are fundamental to the
      healing process itself.<br>
      <br>
      Copper is known to be an essential element in human metabolism.
      However, copper does not exist in the body in measurable amounts
      in ionic form. All measurable amounts of copper in the body exist
      in tissues as complexes with the organic compounds of proteins and
      enzymes. Therefore, it has been concluded that copper becomes and
      remains intimately involved in body processes. Some copper
      complexes serve to store copper, others to transport it, and yet
      others play important roles in key cellular and metabolic
      processes. Studies into the roles that these copper complexes play
      and the mechanisms of these roles have further confirmed that
      copper enters into the prevention and control of a number of
      disease states in the body. As will be discussed below, the key to
      the effective use of copper-based pharmaceuticals is not the use
      of inorganic compounds of copper, as used by the ancients, but
      rather the use of metallo-organic complexes or chelates of copper.
      The process of chelating metals allows them to be smuggled in the
      transport process across the intestinal wall and thereby enter
      into the mainstream of nutrient flow and usage in the body.<br>
      <br>
      The first modern research on the subject of copper medicinal
      substances was by Professor John R. J. Sorenson, of the University
      of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, who, in
      1966, demonstrated that copper complexes have therapeutic efficacy
      in the treatment of inflammatory diseases using doses that are
      nontoxic. Since then, copper metallo-organic complexes have been
      used to successfully treat patients with arthritic and other
      chronic degenerative diseases. More than 140 copper complexes of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (aspirin and ibuprofen, for
      example) have been shown to be more active than their parent
      compounds. Copper aspirinate has been shown not only to be more
      effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis than aspirin
      alone, but it has been shown to prevent or even cure the
      ulceration of the stomach often associated with aspirin therapy.
      Based on these experiences, the work of Professor Sorenson and
      other researchers around the world has progressed into the
      medicinal benefits of organic complexes of copper in a number of
      disease states. This work, thus far mainly based on animal
      research, has opened a whole new vista both into the understanding
      of copper's many-fold role in the body and in the practicality of
      using supplementary copper in the treatment of wound healing and
      inflammation-related disease states. Some of these potential
      indications are:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ulcer and Wound-Healing
        Activities of Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      It has been demonstrated that copper complexes such as copper
      aspirinate and copper tryptophanate, markedly increase healing
      rate of ulcers and wounds. For example, copper complexes heal
      gastric ulcers five days sooner than other reagents. Further, it
      has been shown that, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, such as ibuprofen and enefenamic acid suppress wound
      healing, copper complexes of these drugs promote normal wound
      healing while at the same time retaining anti-inflammatory
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticonvulsant Activities of
        Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The brain contains more copper than any other organ of the body
      except the liver, where copper is stored for use elsewhere. This
      fact suggests that copper plays a role in brain functions. With
      reports of seizures in animals and humans following the protracted
      consumption of copper-deficient diets, it was reasoned that copper
      has a role to play in the prevention of seizures. It was
      subsequently discovered that organic compounds that are not
      themselves anti-convulsants exhibit anticonvulsant activity when
      complexed with copper. Further, it was found that copper complexes
      of all anti-epileptic drugs are more effective and less toxic than
      their parent drugs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticancer Activities of Copper
        Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As early as 1912, patients in Germany were treated for facial
      epithelioma with a mixture of copper chloride and lecithin.
      Success of such treatment suggested that copper compounds have
      anticancer activity. Work at the University of Liverpool in 1913
      demonstrated that subcutaneous and intravenous injections of a
      copper salt or colloidal copper softened and degenerated
      carcinomas transplanted into mice. In 1930, work in France
      indicated that injections of colloidal copper mobilized and
      expelled tumor tissue. Recent work with mice in the USA has shown
      that, indeed, treatment of solid tumors with non-toxic doses of
      various organic complexes of copper markedly decreased tumor
      growth and metastasis and thus increased survival rate. These
      copper complexes did not kill cancer cells but caused them to
      revert to normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticarcinogenic Activity of
        Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Based on work in the treatment of cancers using copper complexes,
      researchers have found that these same complexes may prevent or
      retard the development of cancers in mice under conditions where
      cancers are expected to be induced.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radiation Protection and
        Radiation Recovery of Copper Complexes</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ionizing radiation, such as that used in the treatment of cancer,
      has been shown to induce massive systemic inflammation. Ideally,
      such radiation-induced injury might be prevented or ameliorated by
      chemical repair mechanisms in the body. Thus, pharmacological
      approaches to the repair of radiation-damaged tissue are needed.
      As early as 1984, copper metallo-organic complexes have been shown
      to have radiation protection and radiation recovery activities.
      They are capable of causing rapid recovery of immunocompetence and
      recovery from radiation induced tissue changes. The mechanism of
      this activity appears to be tied to the ability of certain copper
      complexes to deactivate the superoxide, or "free," radicals
      liberated by ionizing radiation. In addition, since radiation has
      the capability of breaking the bonds of natural copper enzymes in
      the body, supplementing these with non-toxic doses of
      pharmaceutical copper complexes restores the lost tissue-repair
      capability. Since these complexes may also have anticarcinogenic
      activity, it is suggested that there would be merit in using
      copper complexes in the treatment of cancer and in particular,
      treating patients undergoing ionizing radiation therapy for their
      cancer, accidental exposure to radiation, and astronauts
      undertaking space travel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Heart Disease and Copper
        Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Numerous studies have drawn attention to the relationship between
      copper deficiency and heart disease. First observed in rats in
      1936, this effect has now been traced to both a deficiency in
      copper and an imbalance in the copper-to-zinc ratio in the body.
      Work by Dr. L.M. Klevay at the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
      Human Nutrition Research Center in 1973 has led to the postulation
      that copper has a direct effect on the control of cholesterol. In
      continuing work published in 1975, he theorized that a metabolic
      imbalance between zinc and copper - with more emphasis on copper
      deficiency than zinc excess - is a major contributing factor to
      the etiology of coronary heart disease. Subsequent work by other
      investigators has shown that copper complexes also can have a
      valuable role in the minimization of damage to the aorta and heart
      muscle as oxygenated blood reperfuses into tissues following
      myocardial infarction. This action is based on the
      anti-inflammatory action of copper complexes. These and other
      studies suggest the use of copper dietary supplements as a means
      of preventing and controlling such diseases as atherosclerosis (a
      form of arteriosclerosis), coronary heart disease, aortic
      aneurysms and myocardial infarction. It has been speculated that
      the reason that the heart attack rate in France is lower than in
      the rest of Europe is because of the French practice of drinking
      red wine. Red wine has a higher copper content than white wine
      because it is prepared with the skin of the grape intact. The
      copper originates in the wine from the copper fungicides used on
      the grapes in the field.<br>
      <br>
      Based on an abundance of historical data such as the foregoing,
      many researchers anticipate that copper will become an
      increasingly important component of tomorrow's medical treatments.<br>

      <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation</span><br>
      <br>
      Copper aspirinate can be prepared by several methods. In one route
      of preparation, an excess of acetylsalicylic acid is dissolved in
      aqueous sodium carbonate. Sodium hydroxide is not suitable for
      this purpose, because it will hydrolyse acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
      into salicylic acid and sodium acetate.<br>
      <br>
      2 HC9H7O4 + Na2CO3 ? 2 NaC9H7O4 + CO2? + H2O<br>
      <br>
      The resulting solution is then filtered to remove any undissolved
      acetylsalicylic acid and is mixed with a solution containing Cu2+
      cations (copper(II) sulfate is suitable), precipitating bright
      blue crystals of copper aspirinate immediately. The crystals can
      then be filtered from solution, washed, and dried. An excess of
      acetylsalicylic acid is used in the first step, because it
      eliminates the possibility of unreacted carbonate anions
      precipitating the copper in this step.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Medicinal Use</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Copper aspirinate has been proven effective as a treatment for <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">rheumatoid arthritis</span>.[1] The
      studies on animal models suggest that copper aspirinate is very
      promising in treating against <span style="font-weight: bold;">thrombotic










        diseases</span> and it has all the prospects of success in
      becoming an antithrombotic drug that prevents and treats
      thrombotic diseases in humans.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other uses</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The use of copper aspirinate as a pigment in PVC and Polystyrene
      has also been investigated.[3]<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Disclaimer:</span> The following
      is a summary of the procedure I used to make copper aspirinate. I
      offer it here for informational purposes to show that copper
      aspirinate can be made with commonly available materials and
      equipment. A similar procedure is typically done by second-year
      college chemistry students as a laboratory exercise in a setting
      supervised by a professional instructor. I do NOT recommend that
      people do this at home. Some aspects of these procedures are
      hazardous, and the typical home kitchen simply has too many
      distractions and interruptions for a student to carry out these
      procedures safely. Your wife ( or mom) will also be furious if you
      get copper sulfate stains on her kitchen counter!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Copper Aspirinate synthesis
        (kitchen method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. Saturated copper acetate solution. See procedure below.<br>
      <br>
      2. Pure aspirin crystals. See procedure below.<br>
      <br>
      3. Ethanol&nbsp; (95%; liquor store ethanol like Everclear (190
      proof, UPC 088352100036) is what was used here.<br>
      <br>
      4. Vacuum filtration facilities (Büchner funnel, coarse and medium
      porosity filter paper, aspirator, filter flask, seals, tubing,
      clamps, stand, etc. These common lab tools are not absolutely
      necessary, but can speed things up considerably.)<br>
      <br>
      5. Containers for liquid such as Rubbermaid 24 fl. oz. servin'
      saver tm (used here as a "beaker").<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Add 1 fl. oz. of saturated copper acetate solution to a beaker.<br>
      <br>
      2. Dissolve 1 tsp (teaspoon) pure aspirin crystals in about 1 fl.
      oz. of ethanol (95%) in another beaker<br>
      <br>
      3. Pour the aspirin solution into the copper acetate solution.
      Stir occasionally.<br>
      <br>
      4. Dark blue crystals will gradually form on the sides and bottom
      of the beaker. The initial layer will form immediately if the
      beaker has been freshly cleaned and scoured. The layer will
      gradually thicken and become bluer and darker. This process may
      take several hours. The endpoint is reached when the liquid has
      turned a light blue and no more blue crystals are forming on the
      walls of the beaker. (You can verify the endpoint by siphoning the
      clear liquid, evaporating it in a separate container, and checking
      the residue. The residue should be mostly aspirin crystals.)<br>
      <br>
      This procedure requires no heating. If you heat the liquid to
      increase the reaction rate, be aware that aspirin can hydrolyze
      into acetic and salicylic acids in a moist or liquid environment.
      If that happens, the liquid will turn dark green, and the yield
      of&nbsp; copper aspirinate will be greatly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      5. Cool the mixture in a refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      6. Scrape the crystals off the sides and bottom of the beaker.
      Then vacuum filter the whole mixture. (Save the first filtrate in
      a separate container if you do ethanol solvent recycling.)<br>
      <br>
      7. Wash the blue powder on the filter with cold distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      8. Dry the powder and filter paper in an oven at about 120F. Store
      the dry powder in a small dark bottle with a label identifying the
      contents and the date of creation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Alternative Procedure</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Substitute isopropanol (99%)&nbsp; for the ethanol in step #2 and
      use 1/2 teaspoon, instead of 1 teaspoon, of aspirin crystals and
      1/2 fl. oz. isopropanol instead of 1 fl. oz of ethanol. After
      several hours of initial crystallization,&nbsp; add 1/2 fl. oz. of
      distilled water and place the beaker in the refrigerator and wait
      a few more hours for more crystals. This variation gives about the
      same results as the ethanol procedure. Its advantages are that it
      uses less excess aspirin and a less expensive alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Aspirin purification (kitchen
        method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. One bottle of 1000 commercial aspirin tablets (preferably the
      uncoated kind).<br>
      <br>
      2. A pint or two of isopropyl alcohol (99%). This is usually
      available from a hardware store. Sometimes it can be found in a
      drugstore (UPC: 341226909730 ) Isopropanol is extremely flammable,
      so be very careful not to expose vapors to hidden or unexpected
      ignition sources.<br>
      <br>
      3. A couple of gallons of deionized or distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      4. Three, 24 fl. oz.&nbsp; wide-mouthed polypropylene containers
      with covers, such as Rubbermaid servin' saver tm.<br>
      <br>
      5. Oven thermometer (easily read dial type is best)<br>
      <br>
      6. Modified turkey baster (see construction procedure below)<br>
      <br>
      7. One kitchen (with sink, refrigerator, oven, etc)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure:</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Dump a few hundred aspirin tablets into a wide-mouthed
      container.<br>
      <br>
      2. Add distilled water to the container and stir. This will break
      up the aspirin tablets and dissolve the hydroxypropyl
      methycelluose coating that is usually used to coat aspirin
      tablets. Let the mixture settle for an hour or so in the
      refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      3. Siphon most of the water out with a modified turkey baster.<br>
      <br>
      4. Repeat steps #2 and #3 a total of three to five
      times.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will largely get rid of the methycellulose
      coating, which tends to clog filters. You might not need to repeat
      these steps if you&nbsp; use uncoated aspirin.<br>
      <br>
      5. Vacuum filter the mixture from #4 and dry the powder in air.
      (Caution: aspirin tends to decompose when heated in a moist
      environment).<br>
      <br>
      6. Add the powder to a quart container. Add about a half-cup of
      isopropyl alcohol (99%). Stir. This will dissolve part, but not
      all, of the aspirin. Let the mixture settle.<br>
      <br>
      7. Vacuum filter the above mixture using medium porosity filter
      paper. Pour the filtrate into a clear glass container for
      inspection. If the filtrate is not clear, re-establish vacuum on
      the filter, and filter it again. (Sometimes simply letting the
      mixture settle and then siphoning the clear liquid with a turkey
      baster is more effective than filtration; the latter, however, may
      be faster.)<br>
      <br>
      8. Pour the clear filtrate containing the dissolved aspirin into
      the second container, cover it,&nbsp; and place it in the freezer
      (about 5 F or so). After an hour or so the aspirin will
      crystallize out of solution. Return the powder on the filter to
      its original quart container.<br>
      <br>
      9. After the aspirin crystals have formed,&nbsp;&nbsp; remove the
      container from the freezer. Carefully decant the liquid back into
      the first container that contains the impure aspirin powder. Then
      scrape out the pure aspirin crystals into a third container.<br>
      <br>
      10.&nbsp; Cover this first container (impure aspirin powder and
      recovered isopropanol) and let it warm to room temperature.
      Agitate it occasionally so that more aspirin will again dissolve.<br>
      <br>
      11. Repeat steps 7 through 10 until you have recovered all the
      aspirin, and the filter paper has only a thin layer of the
      excipients (typically calcium phosphate, starch, talc, etc. These
      impurities are added to the tablets to help them break up in
      water). Discard the filter paper. Dump the isopropanol down the
      drain, and wash it down with some tap water.<br>
      <br>
      12. Using new&nbsp; filter paper (medium porosity),&nbsp; filter
      any remaining isopropanol from the recovered aspirin crystals
      (third container).&nbsp; Rinse the third container with distilled
      water and wipe it dry. Dump the filtered crystals back into the
      third container and cover them with cold distilled water.
      Re-establish vacuum on the filter and filter the crystals again.
      This will rinse off any remaining isopropanol. Discard the liquid.
      (Repeat the procedure if you can still smell isopropanol on the
      crystals).<br>
      <br>
      13. Finally, gently dry the aspirin crystals. (I dried mine in an
      oven at 120 F. If you do this, BE SURE you have rinsed the
      crystals well enough so that there are no isopropanol vapors
      present. Isopropanol forms explosive vapors with air, and allowing
      these to accumulate in a confined space is a recipe for serious
      trouble. Also, aspirin tends to decompose when heated, especially
      in hot water, so I use only a warm temperature setting. )<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Copper acetate synthesis
        (kitchen method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. Copper sulfate pentahydrate 99%. This is usually available from
      a hardware store in the form of a product used to kill tree roots
      in sewers and septic tanks, such as Roebic K-77.<br>
      <br>
      2. Arm and Hammer Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).<br>
      <br>
      3. A couple of quarts of distilled vinegar (5% acetic acid).<br>
      <br>
      4. A Pyrex casserole dish (22 x 11 x 6 cm or similar)<br>
      <br>
      5. Vacuum filtration facilities.<br>
      <br>
      6. Various clean, quart containers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of filtered copper
        sulfate solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Dissolve 3/4 cupful of copper sulfate crystals in about a quart
      of warm distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      2. Vacuum filter the solution through coarse porosity filter
      paper. This will filter out suspended solids (metal flecks,
      "dirt", etc.). Pour the filtrate off into a clear inspection
      container. Vacuum filter the solution again with medium porosity
      paper until it is clear blue. Note that the filtrate may still
      contain significant impurities (lead, arsenic, cadmium, etc.) at
      this point. Remember that this product is normally used in sewers.<br>
      <br>
      3. Save the clear blue solution for later use.<br>
      <br>
      (4. If you want higher purity copper sulfate, you can
      re-crystallize it at this point.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of sodium carbonate
        solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Pour a cup full of sodium bicarbonate into a Pyrex casserole
      dish. Add distilled water sufficient to dissolve it.<br>
      <br>
      2. Heat the solution in an oven to about 200F. This will cause the
      bicarbonate to decompose into the carbonate with the evolution of
      carbon dioxide.&nbsp; The end result will be a solution of sodium
      carbonate.<br>
      <br>
      3. Let the solution cool to room temperature. Carbonates are
      somewhat less soluble than bicarbonates; add more distilled water
      if necessary to keep the material in solution.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of copper carbonate</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. In a large container, gradually combine the copper sulfate
      solution with the sodium carbonate solution. A blue-green
      precipitate will immediately form along with the vigorous release
      of carbon dioxide. Let the precipitate settle out.<br>
      <br>
      2. At this point the liquid portion will have either an excess of
      sodium carbonate or of copper sulfate. If you add a drop of sodium
      carbonate and see some precipitate form, then the bulk mixture
      needs more sodium carbonate solution added. Likewise, if you add a
      drop of copper sulfate and see a precipitate, then the bulk
      mixture needs more copper sulfate solution added. Make these
      adjustments as necessary until there is no longer an unambiguous
      formation of the blue-green precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      3. Vacuum filter the mixture with a coarse porosity paper filter.
      Discard the liquid. Wash with cold distilled water and then
      refilter. This will wash out any excess sodium carbonate or copper
      sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of copper acetate
        solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      4. To a quart container, add the still moist copper carbonate
      powder from the previous step. Then slowly pour vinegar into the
      container. Carbon dioxide will evolve and copper acetate will
      form. The solution will gradually become a deep blue color. A
      blue-green precipitate may also settle to the bottom of the
      container.<br>
      <br>
      5. Let the solution settle out. If there is a substantial amount
      of blue-green precipitate at the bottom of the container, add more
      vinegar. Try to dissolve most, but not all, of this precipitate.
      An excess of vinegar is harder to remove than a little of the
      precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      6. Using coarse paper, vacuum filter the resulting copper acetate
      solution. Repeat until clear. Discard the paper. Save the blue
      filtrate.<br>
      <br>
      7. Slowly evaporate the blue filtrate in a Pyrex casserole dish in
      an oven (150F) for several hours. Periodically scrape down the
      sides of the dish to prevent a build up of crystals. Continue the
      evaporation until some blue-black crystals of copper acetate begin
      to form (and do not redissolve). The mixture may also have some
      blue-green "pond scum" in it too.<br>
      <br>
      8. Cool and filter the dark blue solution. Store it in a clear
      glass container for observation (a one quart vinegar bottle works
      fine). This is the saturated copper acetate solution that will be
      used to make copper aspirinate.<br>
      <br>
      9. If you want to make copper acetate crystals, continue the
      evaporation process until blue-black crystals form. This will
      require evaporating most, but not all, of the solution. Impurities
      (and excess vinegar) tend to remain in solution instead of
      crystallizing out. Hence, it is necessary to discard a small
      portion of the original solution. Collect the crystals on the
      vacuum filter and discard the leftover liquid. Wash the blue-black
      crystals with a little bit of cold distilled water. Then dry and
      store them in a labeled container.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Conversion of Aspirin to
        Salicylic acid (kitchen method)</span><br style="font-style:
        italic;">
      <br>
      1. Put about 4 tsp of pure aspirin crystals (see above) and 1/2
      cup distilled water into a small, clean&nbsp; jar (such as one
      used for canning pickles or olives).<br>
      <br>
      2. Place jar on a hot pad in a shallow pan in an oven set to about
      225F.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the aspirin hydrolyze into acetic and
      salicylic acids for an hour or two. (Add a little more water if
      all the crystals have not dissolved in the hot liquid.)<br>
      <br>
      3. Cool the liquid in the refrigerator. You should see needle-like
      crystals.<br>
      <br>
      4. Vacuum filter and wash the crystals with cold distilled water.
      This will remove acetic acid residue.<br>
      <br>
      5. Dump the crystals out of the filter and air dry them. (they
      usually come out as a mat of fine needles). Store in a properly

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Conversion of Salicylic acid to
        Phenol</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Phenol (carbolic acid) is an important disinfectant and germicide,
      as well as an important organic reagent.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Merck Index (10th ed.), salicylic acid sublimes
      at 76 C, melts at 159 C,&nbsp; and will decompose into phenol and
      carbon dioxide when rapidly heated at atmospheric pressure.<br>

        (kitchen method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. In a small custard dish, dissolve 1/4 tsp of sodium bicarbonate
      (baking soda) in a few of teaspoons of distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      2. Add about 1/2 tsp of the salicylic acid crystals recovered from
      the conversion described above. Mixture will fizz a little. Stir
      until all the crystals dissolve.<br>
      <br>
      3. Test the pH. Add more salicylic acid or bicarbonate to get pH
      of about 6 (slightly acid). This is now a solution of sodium
      salicylate.<br>
      <br>
      4. Add copper sulfate solution drop by drop. An ugly green
      precipitate&nbsp; (copper salicylate) will form.<br>
