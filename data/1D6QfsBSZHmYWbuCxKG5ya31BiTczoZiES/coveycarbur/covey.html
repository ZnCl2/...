      </b><b>A History of Vapor Carburetors</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
        by Robert Felix</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ... The inventor Ray Covey solved the problem by leaving the
      conventional carburetor attached to the engine and placing the
      vaporizer in series with it connected by a heat insulated tube.
      The engine could be started from the regular carburetor and then
      switched over to vapor mode once the heat exchanger had reached
      the proper temperature by use of a two way electric solenoid
      switch in series with the carburetor fuel line...<br>
      <br>
      Weld a catalytic converter in series between the exhaust manifold
      of the gasoline engine and the exhaust input to the heat
      exchanger/vaporizer that is described in the patents cited. The
      catalytic converter acts as a heat amplifier and its output is at
      a much higher temperature than its input.<br>
      <br>
      The thermal conductivity of steel is lower than that of copper or
      brass, but this will compensate. Ray Covey (USP #4611567) used
      this with his system, as building a heat exchanger of 1/8 or 1/4
      inch dia. brass plate is very expensive...<br>
      <br>
      Other patents cited here may or may not run on the principle of
      thermo catalytic cracking of gasoline, (pyrolysis) or the
      inventors might have hidden this information in the patent
      application for legal reasons.<br>
      <br>
      The late Ray Covey (US Patent 4611567) observed this process in
      his device but was unaware of exactly what was happening - more
      than just vaporization of the fractions of gasoline was
      occurring...<br>

      <br>
      A vaporizer unit has an enclosing casing including a plurality of
      tubes therein, defining a fuel passage therethrough, including the
      tubes. The tubes have coiled wire screen therein. An auxiliary
      carburetor is positioned at the inlet end of the fuel passage, and
      an outlet passage leads to the main carburetor of the automobile.
      The casing also defines an exhaust passage therethrough,
      transversely of the fuel passage, providing heat transfer between
      the exhaust gases and the tubes. The temperature of the resulting
      vaporized fuel is sensed for varying the flow of the exhaust gases
      and thereby controlling the temperature of the vaporized fuel,
      which is maintained at 250 DEG F. to 260 DEG F. An electric
      crystal is used for breaking down the heavy ends of the fuel. The
      rate of flow of air to the main carburetor is varied for
      correspondingly varying the rate of intake of vaporized fuel from
      the vaporizer unit. Automatic and manual controls are both
      utilized selectively, each without interfering with the other.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention resides in the general field of vaporizing liquid
      petroleum fuel for internal combustion engines, the most common
      example of which is in the case of automobiles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A broad object of the invention is to provide apparatus and method
      in connection therewith, for vaporizing fuel, forming a complete
      and unified unit specially adapted for application to an engine,
      without requirement for predesigning the engine for that purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to provide the foregoing apparatus, having the
      following features and advantages:<br>
      1. It includes a novel vaporizer unit especially effective for
      performing the vaporizing step.<br>
      2. It maintains the temperature of the vapor produced at such
      level as to provide most efficient combustion.<br>
      3. It provides a vaporizing step and produces the vapor in such
      quantity as to provide sufficient fuel for the engine in all
      instances, such as and particularly at high speeds and in climbing
      hills.<br>
      4. The apparatus is extremely simple in manufacture and in
      applying it to the engine, and effective in utilizing the
      facilities of the engine in the operation thereof.<br>
      <br>

      Referring in detail to the accompanying drawings, attention is
      directed first to FIG. 1 where the automobile engine is indicated
      at 10, having the usual radiator 12 included in a coolant system
      including fluid lines i4, 16, and the usual cooling fan 18.<br>
      <br>
      The engine 10 includes an intake manifold 20 in which the vacuum
      is developed and sensed for performing certain operations referred
      to hereinbelow. The engine includes a main carburetor 22 and the
      usual fuel tank 24 from which the fuel is drawn through a main
      fuel line 26 in which is a fuel pump 28. The main fuel line 26
      continues to a two-way valve 30 and from this valve leads a first
      branch fuel line 32 leading to the main carburetor 22, and a
      second branch fuel line 34 leading to the vaporizer unit 36, this
      unit constituting a principal component of the invention. The
      valve 30 as will be explained hereinbelow is operative for
      directing the fuel selectively through the branch lines 32, 34 and
      thus to the main carburetor 22 and the vaporizer unit 36
      respectively in accordance with a certain sequence of operations
      referred hereinbelow. The vaporizer unit 36 includes an auxiliary
      carburetor 38 into which the second branch fuel line 34 leads. A
      vapor outlet line 40 leads from the vaporizer unit 36 to the main
      carburetor 22.<br>
      <br>
      The engine 10 includes the usual exhaust pipe 42 in which a
      muffler 44 is included, and an exit tail pipe 46. A branch exhaust
      pipe 48 leads from the main exhaust pipe 42 at a juncture 50,
      leading to the vaporizer unit 36.<br>
      <br>
      Attention is next directed to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 showing the details
      of the vaporizer unit 36. The vaporizer unit includes an outer
      casing or shell 52 having a main chamber 54 therein, divided into
      two end chambers 54a and 54b by a tube structure 56 which includes
      a plurality of tubes 58, in this case six, leading between the
      chambers 54a, 54b. These tubes are mounted in end plates 60 which
      enclose the space 62 surrounding the tubes. The two end spaces
      54a, 54b, and the tubes, constitute a longitudinal fuel passage
      through the unit, and the space 62 constitutes a transverse
      exhaust gas passage through the unit. The exhaust gases in that
      exhaust passage are in heat transfer relation to the tubes, for
      heating the fuel passing through the tubes, and vaporizing the
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably mesh elements 64 are placed in the tubes 58 these mesh
      elements being for example screen wire rolled into spirals and
      fitted into the tubes. The mesh units provide substantial open
      space for the fuel to pass therethrough, but the elements of the
      mesh also provide a great surface area for the particles of the
      atomized fuel to engage, greatly assisting the vaporization of the
      fuel. The fuel stream at this location is a mixture of atomized
      liquid fuel mixed in and carried by an air stream, produced by the
      auxiliary carburetor 38, and the engagement of the fuel particles
      with the elements of the screen mesh provide a dwell in the
      passage of the fuel therethrough, with greater effectiveness in
      vaporizing it. The vaporizer unit 36 normally assumes a position
      adjacent the horizontal, in the normal operation of the
      automobile, despite travel on inclines and the structure is such
      that the tubes 58 are inclined downwardly in direction opposite
      the direction of flow of fuel. In this instance (FIG. 2) the fuel
      flows generally from left to right, and the left ends of the tubes
      are lower than the right ends, enabling any liquid fuel that has
      not been vaporized to flow back, to be picked up by following
      increments of the air stream.<br>
      <br>
      The auxiliary carburetor 38 of FIG. 2 is of known and standard
      type, operably associated with an air cleaner 68. The second
      branch fuel line 34 leads into a chamber 70 of the carburetor,
      from which the fuel then flows in atomized form through a nozzle
      72 in the air passage 74 of the carburetor. A throttle body 76 is
      provided in the carburetor and manually set to a desired position,
      by means of a cable 77 having a manual knob 79 on the dashboard.<br>
      <br>
      An electric crystal 78 is mounted at the inlet from the
      carburetor, for vaporizing the heavy ends of the fuel, vibrating
      at a frequency of in the neighborhood of one million vibrations
      per second. This crystal is actuated by a 12 volt current,
      provided by the usual battery of the automobile.<br>
      <br>
      The auxiliary carburetor 38 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 has a vertical
      outlet, and is positioned on top of the vaporizer unit, but a side
      outlet carburetor may be utilized instead, such as the carburetor
      80 of FIG. 3, having an outlet leading into the chamber 54a. In
      the construction of the vaporizer unit of FIG. 3, cross vanes 82
      (FIG. 4) are placed in the space 54a for directing the fuel more
      effectively into the tubes 56. In FIG. 3 also, the electric
      crystal 78 is utilized. FIG. 3 is a horizontal transverse
      sectional view and shows the branch exhaust line 48 (FIG. 1)
      connected to a manifold 84 which leads into the transverse exhaust
      passage 62, and leading from the latter is an outlet pipe 86 which
      may be provided with a muffler 88 and leading to the exterior at
      90. FIG. 3 also shows the outlet vapor tube 40 which leads from
      the chamber 54b to the main carburetor 22.<br>
      <br>
      A temperature sensing element 92 is positioned in the outlet pipe
      86 and another temperature sensing element 94 is positioned in the
      vapor outlet pipe 48, and a flapper exhaust control 95 is provided
      in the exhaust line 86, and moved by a lever 96, as referred to
      hereinbelow, these elements being utilized for controlling the
      temperature of the exhaust vapor. The two-way valve 30 (FIG. 1)
      includes a solenoid 97 for actuating it, this controlled through
      the sensing element 92 in a known manner, directing the fuel to
      the vaporizer unit upon the exhaust gases reaching a predetermined
      temperature. If desired, the valve may be controlled manually by a
      Boden cable 99 (FIG. 1) having a knob 101 at the dashboard.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show an optional vapor tube heater 98, for use in
      such as winter climates, for providing additional heat to the
      vaporized fuel, being placed in the vapor outlet line 40 between
      the vaporizer unit and the main carburetor 22. It includes an
      outer tubular casing 100 and a resistance heater element 102
      therein, in an electrical circuit which includes a ground 104 and
      a thermostat 106. A temperature sensing element o probe 108 is
      positioned in the unit for sensing the temperature of the fuel
      vapor therein and connected with a temperature indicating gauge
      110, the temperature gauge and thermostat being operably
      interconnected in a known manner, for varying the resistance of
      the element for controling the temperature of the resulting fuel
      vapor.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5, includes the main carburetor 22 and an air cleaner 111,
      the latter having an air inlet tube 112. The tube 112 has a choke
      valve 114 for varying the flow of the inlet air therethrough, this
      choke valve being operated by an arm 116 to which is connected a
      Boden cable 118 leading to the dashboard 120 and having a manual
      knob 122 thereon at that location. FIG. 5 also shows means for
      controlling the proportioned amount of exhaust gases flowing from
      the main exhaust pipe 42 (FIG. 1) to the branch exhaust pipe 48.
      At the juncture 50 of these lines is a flapper control valve 124
      actuated by a lever 126, and leading from the lever is a Boden
      cable 128, continuing to the dashboard 120 where it is provided
      with a manual knob 130. These two manually actuated components may
      be provided in conjunction with automatically controlled
      components, as will be referred to hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 also shows the temperature probe 94 (FIG. 3) in the vapor
      outlet line 40, and the probe 92 in the outlet exhaust pipe 86,
      and conductors 132, 134, leading from those probes to a two-way
      switch 136 on the dashboard 120, and an additional conductor 138
      leading from the switch to a temperature indicating gauge 140 also
      on the dashboard. The operator may turn the switch to either of
      its two opposite positions, for observing the temperature of the
      vaporized fuel in the vapor outlet line 40, or the exhaust gases
      in the outlet pipe 86, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      It is found that the best operating temperature of the vaporized
      gas is approximately 250 DEG F., although it may be slightly
      higher than that, such as between 250 DEG F. and 260 DEG F. Upon
      observing the temperature of the vaporized fuel, by the
      temperature gauge 140 (FIG. 5) the driver may adjust, if need be,
      the passage of the outlet flow of exhaust gases through the pipe
      86 (FIG. 3) by means of the flapper valve 95. A Boden wire 142
      leads from the lever of the flapper valve to the dashboard 120
      where a manual knob 144 is affixed thereto.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows an arrangement for automatically controlling the
      temperature of the fuel vapor. This figure shows the vaporizer
      unit 36 including the outlet exhaust gas pipe 86. In this outlet
      pipe 86 is a choke control 146 biased to closed position by a
      tension spring 148, and it is moved in opening direction by a unit
      indicated in its entirety at 150. This unit includes a line 152
      connected with the intake manifold 20 (FIG. 1) at 154, and in this
      line is a check valve 156, the line 152 leading to a vacuum unit
      158. Leading from the unit 158 is an air line 160 which continues
      through an air control valve 162 and then to a vacuum motor 164 of
      known kind, having a diaphragm actuated by air pressure. Connected
      to the diaphragm is an actuating rod 166, itself connected with an
      arm 168 on the choke control valve 146. The air control valve 162
      is controlled by a thermostat 169 including the sensing element 94
      (FIG. 3) in the vapor outlet line 40. Upon the temperature of the
      vaporized gas going above or below the predetermined values, as
      referred to above, the air control valve 162 is opened for
      controlling the vacuum condition which operates the motor 164. The
      vacuum in the engine, through the intake manifold, is transmitted
      through the line 152, releasing the check valve 156, producing a
      vacuum in the unit 158 which maintains a vacuum, or partial
      vacuum, at all times. Upon transmission of the vacuum from that
      unit through the line 160 as controlled by the air control unit
      162, the vacuum is transmitted to the motor 164 and the external
      air pressure actuates the diaphragm of the motor, pulling the
      actuating rod 166 to the right, opening the choke control, that
      is, in response to a high vacuum, the motor is actuated a greater
      amount and opens the choke control and in response to a low
      vacuum, the choke control 146 closes or tends to close. This
      action may be start/stop or gradual as desired. As the choke
      control is opened or closed, the pressure of the exhaust gases in
      the vaporizer unit 36 is reduced or increased, respectively, with
      consequent variation of the temperature of the fuel mixture,
      including the vapor therein, produced by the exhaust gases.<br>
      <br>
      Attention is directed next to FIG. 8 which shows a portion of a
      device for automatically controlling the flow of air into the main
      carburetor 22 (FIG. 1). The tube or air arm 112 is provided with a
      second choke valve 170 for controlling the flow of air into the
      air cleaner which flows in the direction indicated by the arrow
      172. It assumes a full open position as indicated at 170a which is
      adjacent the horizontal, and another position adjacent fully
      closed, is indicated at 170b, being limited in the latter
      direction by suitable means such as stop screws 174. Secured to
      the choke valve 170 is a lever arm 176, and secured to the latter
      is the actuating rod 166 of FIG. 7, of the unit 150, which is the
      same as that of FIG. 7. In the present case, FIG. 8, in response
      to high vacuum in the vacuum line 152, the choke valve is moved
      toward open position, and conversely, in response to low vacuum,
      it is moved toward closed position. The operation of the
      arrangement is such that as the choke 170 is moved toward closed
      position, the air through the air cleaner and into the main
      carburetor is restricted, and as a consequence, the draw on the
      vaporized fuel is greater. Hence this control means is effective
      for controlling the quantity of vaporized fuel to the engine,
      which is important in such cases as climbing steep hills.<br>
      <br>
      The act of mixing the fuel by the auxiliary carburetor 38 may be
      termed a first carburetion, and that of mixing the fuel mixture
      from the vaporizor unit 36, with air, by the main carburetor 22,
      may be termed a second carburetion.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, both manual control and automatic control may be
      utilized for performing the same function--for example the manual
      control of FIG. 8, can both be utilized without interference with
      each other; similarly a manual control for the valve 95 (FIG. 3)
      for controlling the outlet exhaust vapor, and the automatic
      control of FIG. 7, can both be utilized for that function, without
      either interfering with the other.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9-13 show an alternate form of vaporizer unit,
      semi-diagrammatic form. Referring first to FIGS. 9 and 10, the
      vaporizer unit is indicated at 180, and includes an outer casing
      182 with two vertical plates 184, 186, forming a fore chamber 188
      and a rear chamber 190. Tubes 192 are mounted in the plates,
      arranged in parallel, communicating between the chambers 188, 190,
      and arranged in three vertically spaced, horizontal rows. A
      divider or baffle 194 divides the fore chamber into an upper sub
      chamber 188a and a lower sub chamber 188b, the upper sub chamber
      enclosing the front ends of the tubes, in the top row, and the
      lower sub chamber enclosing the front ends of the tubes in the two
      lower rows. A divider or baffle 196 divides the rear chamber into
      sub chambers 190a and 109b, the former enclosing the ends of the
      tubes in the upper two rows and the latter forming a passage
      between the tubes of the lower row to the vapor outlet line 198
      leading to the main carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      The auxiliary carburetor 200, of the side outlet type, leads at
      the side to the upper sub chamber 188a. The fuel mixture flows
      into the upper sub chamber forwardly (to the right, FIG. 9)
      through the tubes of the upper row, into and through the sub
      chamber 190a, then rearwardly through the tubes of the middle row,
      into and through the sub chamber 188b, and forwardly through the
      tubes of the lower row, and then through the sub chamber 190b and
      vapor outlet line 198.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes 192 are preferably constructed as shown in FIG. 13,
      where a spiral copper insert or screw 200 is fitted in the tube.
      The tubes may be about 1/2" in internal diameter, and 8" long,
      these dimensions being examples.<br>
      <br>
      The spaces between the tubes form a transverse exhaust passage
      202, communicating between the engine exhaust pipe 204 and an
      outlet pipe 206.<br>
      <br>
      This unit 180 of FIGS. 9 and 10 includes twelve tubes 192, but
      this number is determined by the capacity desired, such as nine in
      FIG. 11, or eighteen as in FIG. 12, for different sized
      automobiles.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows an alternate arrangement of feeding the vapor to the
      engine. The vapor outlet line 198 leads to the bottom of the main
      carburetor 22, then through the carburetor and a conduit 208 to
      the intake manifold 20.<br>

      A vaporizer unit has an enclosing casing including a plurality of
      tubes therein, defining a fuel passage therethrough, including the
      tubes. The tubes have coiled wire screen therein. An auxiliary
      carburetor is positioned at the inlet end of the fuel passage, and
      an outlet passage leads to the main carburetor of the automobile.
      The casing also defines an exhaust passage therethrough,
      transversely of the fuel passage, providing heat transfer between
      the exhaust gases and the tubes. The temperature of the resulting
      vaporized fuel is sensed for varying the flow of the exhaust gases
      and thereby controlling the temperature of the vaporized fuel,
      which is maintained at 250 DEG F. to 260 DEG F. An electric
      crystal is used for breaking down the heavy ends of the fuel. The
      rate of flow of air to the main carburetor is varied for
      correspondingly varying the rate of intake of vaporized fuel from
      the vaporizer unit. Automatic and manual controls are both
      utilized selectively, each without interfering with the other.<br>

      Referring in detail to the accompanying drawings, attention is
      directed first to FIG. 1 where the automobile engine is indicated
      at 10, having the usual radiator 12 included in a coolant system
      including lines 14, 16, and the usual cooling fan 18.<br>
      <br>
      The engine 10 includes an intake manifold 20 in which the vacuum
      is sensed for performing certain operations referred to
      hereinbelow. The engine includes a main carburetor 22 and the
      usual fuel tank 24 from which the fuel is drawn through a main
      fuel line 26 in which is a fuel pump 28. The main fuel line 26
      continues to a two-way valve 30 and from this valve leads a first
      branch fuel line 32 leading to the main carburetor 22, and a
      second branch fuel line 34 leading to the vaporizer unit 36, this
      unit constituting a principal component of the invention. The
      valve 30 as will be explained hereinbelow is operative for
      directing the fuel selectively through the branch lines 32, 34 and
      thus to the main carburetor 22 and the vaporizer unit 36
      respectively in accordance with a certain sequence of operations
      referred hereinbelow. The vaporizer unit 36 includes an auxiliary
      carburetor 38 into which the second branch fuel line 34 leads. A
      vapor outlet line 40 leads from the vaporizer unit 36 to the main
      carburetor 22.<br>
      <br>
      The engine 10 includes the usual exhaust pipe 42 in which a
      muffler 44 is included, and an exit tail pipe 46. A branch exhaust
      pipe 48 leads from the main exhaust pipe 42 at a juncture 50,
      leading to the vaporizer unit 36.<br>
      <br>
      Attention is next directed to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 showing the details
      of the vaporizer unit 36. The vaporizer unit includes an outer
      casing or shell 52 having a main chamber 54 therein, divided into
      two end chambers 54a and 54b by a tube structure 56 which includes
      a plurality of tubes 58, in this case six, leading between the
      chambers 54a, 54b. These tubes are mounted in end plates 60 which
      enclose the space 62 surrounding the tubes. The two end spaces
      54a, 54b, and the tubes, constitute a fuel passage through the
      unit, and the space 62 constitutes a transverse exhaust gas
      passage through the unit. The exhaust gases in that exhaust
      passage are in heat transfer relation to the tubes, for heating
      the fuel passing through the tubes, and vaporizing the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably mesh elements 64 are placed in the tubes 58 these mesh
      elements being for example screen wire rolled into spirals and
      fitted into the tubes. The mesh units provide substantial open
      space for the fuel to pass therethrough, but the elements of the
      mesh also provide a great surface area for the particles of the
      atomized fuel to engage, greatly assisting the vaporization of the
      fuel. The fuel stream at this location is a mixture of atomized
      liquid fuel mixed in and carried by an air stream, produced by the
      auxiliary carburetor 38 and the engagement of the fuel particles
      with the elements of the screen mesh, provide a dwell in the
      passage of the fuel therethrough, with greater effectiveness in
      vaporizing it. The vaporizer unit 36 normally assumes a position
      adjacent the horizontal, in the normal operation of the
      automobile, despite travel on inclines, and the structure is such
      that the tubes 58 are inclined downwardly in direction opposite
      the direction of flow of fuel. In this instance (FIG. 2) the fuel
      flows generally from left to right, and the left ends of the tubes
      are lower than the right ends, enabling any liquid fuel that has
      not been vaporized to flow back, to be picked up by following
      increments of the air stream.<br>
      <br>
      The auxiliary carburetor 38 of FIG. 2 is of known and standard
      type, having an air cleaner 68. The second branch fuel line 34
      leads into a chamber 70 of the carburetor, from which the fuel
      then flows in atomized form through a nozzle 72 in the air passage
      74 of the carburetor. A choke valve 76 is provided in the air
      passage, and manually set to a desired position.<br>
      <br>
      An electric crystal 78 is mounted at the inlet from the
      carburetor, for vaporizing the heavy ends of the fuel, vibrating
      at a frequency of in the neighborhood of one million vibrations
      per second. This crystal is actuated by a 12 volt current,
      provided by the usual battery of the automobile.<br>
      <br>
      The auxiliary carburetor 38 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 has a vertical
      outlet, and is positioned on top of the vaporizer unit, but a side
      outlet carburetor may be utilized instead, such as the carburetor
      80 of FIG. 3, having an outlet leading into the chamber 54a. In
      the construction of the vaporizer unit of FIG. 3, cross vanes 82
      are placed in the space 54a for directing the fuel more
      effectively into the tubes 56. In FIG. 3 also, the electric
      crystal 78 is utilized. FIG. 3 is a transverse sectional view and
      shows the branch exhaust line 48 (FIG. 1) connected to a manifold
      84 which leads into the transverse exhaust passage 62 and leading
      from the latter is an outlet pipe 86 which may be provided with a
      muffler 88 and leading to the exterior at 90. FIG. 3 also shows
      the outlet vapor tube 40 which leads from the chamber 54b to the
      main carburetor 22.<br>
      <br>
      A temperature sensing element 92 is positioned in the outlet pipe
      86 and another temperature sensing element 94 is positioned in the
      vapor outlet pipe 48, and a flapper exhaust control 95 is provided
      in the exhaust line 86, and moved by a lever 96, as referred to
      hereinbelow, these elements being utilized for controlling the
      temperature of the exhaust vapor. The two-way valve 30 (FIG. 1)
      includes a solenoid 97 for actuating it, this controlled through
      the sensing element 92 in a known manner, directing the fuel to
      the vaporizer unit upon the exhaust gases reaching a predetermined
      temperature. If desired, the valve may be controlled manually by a
      Boden wire 99 having a knob 101 at the dashboard.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show a vapor tube heater 98, for use in certain
      circumstances, such as in winter climates, for providing
      additional heat to the vaporized fuel, being placed in the vapor
      outlet line 40 between the vaporizer unit and the main carburetor
      22. It includes an outer tubular casing 100 and a resistance
      heater element 102 therein, in an electrical circuit which
      includes a ground 104 and a thermostat 106. A temperature sensing
      element or probe 108 is positioned in the unit for sensing the
      temperature of the fuel vapor and connected with a temperature
      indicating gauge 110, the temperature gauge and thermostat being
      operably interconnected in a known manner, for varying the
      resistance of the element for controlling the temperature of the
      resulting fuel vapor.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 includes the main carburetor 22 and the air cleaner 68, the
      latter having an air inlet tube 112. The tube 112 has a choke
      valve 114 for varying the flow of the inlet air, this choke valve
      being operated by an arm 116 to which is connected a Boden cable
      118 leading to the dashboard 120 and having a manual knob 122
      thereon at that location. FIG. 5 also shows means for controlling
      the proportioned amount of exhaust gases flowing from the main
      exhaust pipe 42 (FIG. 1) to the branch exhaust pipe 48. At the
      juncture 50 of these lines is a flapper control valve 124 actuated
      by a lever 126, and leading from the lever is a Boden cable 128,
      continuing to the dashboard 120 where it is provided with a manual
      knob 130. These two manually actuated components may be provided
      in conjunction with automatically controlled components, as will
      be referred to hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 also shows the temperature probe 94 (FIG. 3) in the vapor
      outlet line 40, and the probe 92 in the outlet exhaust pipe 86,
      and wires 132, 134 leading from those probes to a two-way switch
      136 on the dashboard 120, and an additional conductor 138 leading
      from the switch to a temperature indicating gauge 140 also on the
      dashboard. The operator may turn the switch to either of its two
      opposite positions, for observing the temperature of the vaporized
      fuel or the exhaust gases, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      It is found that the best operating temperature of the vaporized
      gas is approximately 250 DEG F., although it may be slightly
      higher than that, such as between 250 DEG F. and 260 DEG F. Upon
      observing the temperature of the vaporized fuel, by the
      temperature gauge 140 (FIG. 5) the driver may adjust, if need be,
      the passage of the outlet flow of exhaust gases through the pipe
      86 (FIG. 3) by means of the flapper valve 95. A Boden wire 142
      leads from the lever to the dashboard 120 where a manual knob 144
      is affixed thereto.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows an arrangement for automatically controlling the
      temperature of the fuel vapor. This figure shows the vaporizer
      unit 36 including the outlet exhaust gas pipe 86. In this outlet
      pipe 86 is a choke control 146 biased to closed position by a
      tension spring 148, and it is moved in opening direction by a unit
      indicated in its entirety at 150. This unit includes a line 152
      connected with the intake manifold 20 (FIG. 1) at 154, and in this
      line is a check valve 156, the line 152 leading to a vacuum unit
      158. Leading from the unit 158 is an air line 160 which continues
      through an air control valve 162 and then to a vacuum motor 164 of
      known kind, having a diaphragm actuated by air pressure. Connected
      to the diaphragm is an actuating rod 166, itself connected with an
      arm 168 on the choke valve 146. The air control valve 162 is
      controlled by a thermostat 169 including the sensing element 94
      (FIG. 3) in the vapor outlet line 40. Upon the temperature of the
      vaporized gas going above or below the predetermined values, as
      referred to above, the air control valve 162 is opened for
      controlling the vacuum condition which operates the motor 162. The
      vacuum in the engine, through the intake manifold, is transmitted
      through the line 152, releasing the check valve 156, producing a
      vacuum in the unit 158 which maintains a vacuum, or partial
      vacuum, at all times. Upon transmission of the vacuum from that
      unit through the line 160 as controlled by the air control unit
      162, the vacuum is transmitted to the motor 164 and the external
      air pressure actuates the diaphragm of the motor, pulling the
      actuating rod 166 to the right, opening the choke control, that
      is, in response to a high vacuum, the motor is actuated a greater
      amount and opens the choke control and in response to a low vacuum
      the choke control closes or tends to close. This action may be
      start/stop or gradual as desired.<br>
      <br>
      Attention is directed next to FIG. 8 which shows a portion of a
      device for automatically controlling the flow of air into the main
      carburetor. The tube or air arm 112 is provided with a second
      choke valve 170 for controlling the flow of air into the air
      cleaner which flows in the direction indicated by the arrow 172.
      It assumes a full open position as indicated at 170a which is
      adjacent the horizontal, and another position adjacent fully
      closed, is indicated at 170b, being limited in the latter
      direction by suitable means such as stop screws 174. Secured to
      the choke valve 170 is a lever arm 176, and secured to the latter
      is the actuating rod 166 of FIG. 7, of the unit 150, which is the
      same as that of FIG. 7. In the present case, FIG. 8, in response
      to high vacuum in the vacuum line 152, the choke valve is moved
      toward open position, and conversely, in response to low vacuum it
      is moved toward closed position. The operation of the arrangement
      is such that as the choke 170 is moved toward closed position, the
      air through the air cleaner and into the main carburetor is
      restricted, and as a consequence the draw on the vaporized fuel is
      greater. Hence this control means is effective for controlling the
      quantity of vaporized fuel to the engine, which is important in
      such cases as climbing steep hills.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, both manual control and automatic control may be
      utilized for performing the same functioning--for example the
      manual control of the choke valve 114 of FIG. 5 and the automatic
      control of FIG. 8, can both be utilized without interference with
      each other; similarly a manual control for the valve 94 (FIG. 3)
      for controlling the outlet exhaust vapor, and the automatic
      control of FIG. 7, can both be utilized for that function, without
      either interfering with the other.<br>

      The fuel flows to the usual carburetor, initially, and when the
      engine heats up, the fuel is directed to a vaporizer, continuing
      through a line in the vaporizer, and then, as vapor, to the
      carburetor. In the vaporizer, the exhaust gasses flow over and
      around the fuel line and heat the fuel and vaporizes it. A two-way
      valve responds to the heat of the exhaust gasses and controls the
      flow of the fuel to the carburetor or the vaporizer. A single
      carburetor is used for both the unvaporized fuel and the vaporized
      fuel. A surge tank is included in the vapor line between the
      vaporizer and the carburetor. An alternate form utilizes the
      coolant of the engine for vaporizing the fuel.<br>

      <br>
      Referring in detail to the accompanying drawings, attention is
      directed first to FIG. 1 showing the apparatus in its entirety as
      applied to the engine of an automotive vehicle, showing the
      various components thereof, as well as various components of the
      automobile, partially in diagrammatic form.<br>
      <br>
      A principal feature of the invention is its great adaptability to
      retrofitting to an automobile. The disclosure herein includes
      certain basic and standard components of an automobile, and the
      components of the apparatus of the invention applied to the
      vehicle with virtually no change to those standard components, or
      a minimum of such change.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 includes the engine 12 of the vehicle having a diaphragm
      carburetor 14, an intake manifold 16 and an exhaust manifold 18.
      The arrangement also includes a valve cover 20, all of the
      foregoing elements being of known kind. The automobile includes
      the usual gasoline tank 22 from which a main fuel line 24 leads,
      the line including a fuel pump 26.<br>
      <br>
      While the system of the invention is applicable to various
      automotive vehicles utilizing petroleum fuel, the most common
      example of such a vehicle is the automobile and for convenience
      the following description is somewhat keyed to that feature,
      although it is to be understood that the invention is not limited
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The present apparatus includes a two-way valve 28 of suitable kind
      such as operated by an electric solenoid, the fuel line 24 leading
      to this valve and the valve being utilized for selectively
      directing the fuel to the carburetor incorporated in the vehicle,
      or to the vaporizer apparatus of the invention. Leading from the
      two-way valve 28 is a first extension fuel line 30 preferably
      containing a fuel filter 32 and continuing to the usual carburetor
      14 referred to above. A fuel lock 34 may be incorporated in this
      line.<br>
      <br>
      Also leading from the two-way valve 28 is a second extension fuel
      line 36 leading to the vaporizer component of the invention, which
      is indicated in its entirety at 35. The two-way valve 28 is
      controlled by a valve element 37 controlled by an electrical
      control 38, itself controlled by a heat sensor element 39 located
      in the exhaust gas line at a suitable location. Upon the
      temperature of the exhaust gasses reaching a predetermined point,
      the valve element 37 is moved to position for directing the fuel
      to the vapor unit. It also may be activated manually, as referred
      to below. The fuel line 36 preferably also has a fuel filter 40
      and a manually adjustable fuel pressure regulator 41 of known
      kind. The line 36 continues and includes a suitable check valve 42
      and then continues to a vaporizer unit 44 to be described in
      detail hereinbelow. The vaporizer unit includes a fuel inlet end
      46 to which the fuel line 36 is connected, and a fuel outlet end
      48 from which a fuel line 50 leads, this line leading to a surge
      tank or supply tank 52. The fuel vapor is directed to the surge
      tank 52 and provides a supply for the demands of the engine, and
      from this surge tank a vapor line 54 leads to the carburetor, and
      includes a vapor adapter 56 applied directly to the carburetor and
      constitutes the means for directing the vapor into the carburetor.
      Preferably the vapor line 54 includes a safety screen 58 (see also
      FIG. 5) to prevent the propagation of any flash into the vapor
      line.<br>
      <br>
      The vaporizer unit 44 is supplied with exhaust gasses for
      vaporizing the fuel, and for this purpose, a hose or tube 60 leads
      from the engine exhaust manifold at 62 and continues to another
      tube which may be in the form of a metal pipe 64 having two inlet
      segments 64a and 64b leading through the vaporizer unit 44. The
      vaporizer unit includes an outlet element or casing 66 which leads
      to another tube or hose 68 which in turn is connected with muffler
      means 70 and then to the exterior.<br>
      <br>
      Reference to FIG. 5 is made to show the construction of the vapor
      adaptor 56, which includes a tubular ring 72 having apertures 74
      directed into the carburetor inlet 75, the vapor thus flowing
      through this ring and the apertures 74 downwardly into the
      carburetor. Upon operation of the engine and the usual intake
      draft, the fuel vapor is drawn into the engine as indicated by the
      arrow 76.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows details of the vaporizer unit 44 and associated
      elements shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 2 includes the pressure regulator
      41 and check valve 42, and the fuel line 36 leading to the
      vaporizer unit 44. The vaporizer unit includes a casing or shell
      78 generally closed and forming an exhaust gas chamber 79 therein,
      but the casing has openings specifically referred to. Mounted in
      the casing 78 is a coil 80 of suitable size according to the
      capacity desired, for accommodating the necessary fuel. This coil
      may be referred to as a vaporizer fuel line. The coil is of steel
      tubing of in the neighborhood of 1/2" diameter and of for example
      12 to 20 feet of linear length. The fuel line 36 and vapor line 50
      are of course sealed to the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel passing through the fuel coil 80 is vaporized by the
      heated exhaust gasses, these gasses flowing, as indicated above,
      through the exhaust line 64 into the interior or the casing or
      shell in heat exchange contact with the coil, which thereby
      vaporize the fuel. The amount of fuel vaporized, i.e., the amount
      of vapor produced is controlled by the amount or volume of exhaust
      gasses flowing through the unit 44. The exhaust gasses may be
      controlled at either the inlet side, or the outlet side, of the
      unit, selectively. An arrangement for controlling them at the
      outlet side is shown in FIG. 2, while an arrangement for
      controlling them at the inlet side is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      Referring first to the arrangement of FIG. 2, the outlet element
      66 referred to above is shown in this figure, and positioned
      therein is a control valve 82 which may be in the form of a choke
      having a wafer. This control valve controls the flow of exhaust
      gasses through the vaporizer unit, controlling both the volume and
      rate thereof. This control valve is controlled by an automatic
      electrical control module 84, controlled by a heat sensor element
      86 mounted in the outlet element 66 of the casing, in heat sensing
      engagement with the exhaust gasses flowing therethrough.
      Electrical wires 88 lead from the sensor element to the module,
      and other electrical wires 90 lead from the module to a servo
      motor 92 which actuates an arm 94 connected at 95 with the control
      valve 82. The arrangement of this heat sensing component just
      described is such that upon the temperature reaching a certain
      predetermined maximum, the valve is shut down, or partially
      closed, and conversely when it reaches a certain minimum, the
      valve is opened. These steps control the evaporation of the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrangement of FIG. 3, a valve 95, which may be of the same
      kind as the valve 82, is placed in the inlet line as referred to
      above, instead of in the outlet line. The control instruments 84,
      86, 94, described above, are utilized in this instance. The
      location of the heat sensor element 86 is not limited to the
      outlet as represented in FIG. 2, but it may be located at any of
      various places in the exhaust line, either before or after the
      unit 44, or in the casing 78 of that unit itself.<br>
      <br>
      The outlet element 66 or other element in which the heat sensor
      element 86 is positioned is preferably at least 3" in diameter, to
      accommodate a heat sensor element of desired length, which is
      preferably 3" or more in length.<br>
      <br>
      In the normal operation of the engine and the apparatus, the valve
      82, or95, is first left open, so that exhaust gasses will flow
      therethrough as the engine is started, and the vaporizer apparatus
      will normally operate in every use of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      It is desired that certain manual controls be provided in addition
      to the automatic controls. Reference is made to FIG. 4 showing
      certain of these controls. For example, a cable element 96,
      preferably in the form of a boden wire is connected with an arm 97
      of the control valve 82 and leads to the dash 98 of the automobile
      where a manually controlled member or knob 100 is located,
      enabling the driver to manually control the valve 82. FIG. 4 also
      shows the two-way valve 28 and a manually actuatable member 102
      acting through a boden wire 104. Various other manual control
      elements may be mounted on the dash for manually controlling
      various other elements of the apparatus. Preferably, a manually
      controlled fuel pump 106 is provided in the fuel line 30, as an
      added feature.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated that the scope of the invention is such as
      to cover the vaporization of the fuel by the heated engine
      coolant. FIG. 7 represents such an arrangement, where the coolant
      flows from the engine through an inlet line 108 into the casing of
      the vaporizer unit 44, and out through an outlet line 110, in
      return to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      In the operation of the apparatus, the vapor is drawn into the
      engine through the carburetor, and at a rate controlled by the
      carburetor as actuated by the driver.<br>

      <br>
      A vaporizer chamber includes a coil therein, the coil having
      extensions extending into the exhaust pipe of the engine, the
      exhaust gases passing through the coil and heating the interior of
      the chamber. Fuel is delivered to the vaporizer chamber, and
      vaporized there when the exhaust gases are heated. A thermostat
      unit is mounted on the exhaust pipe, and when heated, shifts a
      valve to direct the fuel to the vaporizer chamber, instead of to
      the carburetor. This shifting is gradual. A throttle controls the
      flow of vaporized fuel to the outlet of the carburetor. The usual
      accelerator pedal is operative for controlling the throttle for
      the vaporized fuel in unison with the usual throttle provided in
      the carburetor. When starting the engine cold, it is fed atomized
      fuel from the carburetor, and when the engine warms up, the fuel
      to the carburetor is reduced, and that to the vaporizer chamber is
      increased, until only vaporized fuel is so fed, and in each case
      the delivery of fuel to the engine is controlled by the
      corresponding throttle in response to actuation of the same
      accelerator pedal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention resides in the field of supplying fuel to a gasolene
      engine, the most common example of which is the case of the
      automobile. The invention further resides in the field of reducing
      the amount of fuel required for given power, and hence obtaining
      more miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A main and broad object of the invention is to provide a device
      and method for reducing the amount of fuel required for a gasolene
      engine for a predetermined amount of power.<br>
      <br>
      Another broad object is to provide a device and method of the
      foregoing character which utilizes vaporized, as distinguished
      from liquid, fuel, but such used in conjunction with the usual
      atomized liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object is to provide a device and method of the
      foregoing character having the following features and advantages:<br>
      <br>
      1. It can be applied to an automobile engine virtually without
      altering the engine, and particularly without interfering with the
      carburetor incorporated as a standard accessory to an engine,
      except that when the engine is warmed up, the device of the
      present invention renders the carburetor ineffective, and supplies
      vapor to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      2. The fuel is vaporized by the heat from the exhaust gases from
      the engine.<br>
      <br>
      3. The feed of the vaporized fuel to the engine is controlled by
      the same mechanism, such as the accelerator pedal, that normally
      controls the standard carburetor, and with the further refinement
      that such accelerator pedal control is continuous through the
      transition from feed of atomized fuel to the feed of vaporized
      fuel to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      4. It includes means for developing pressure by the radiator
      cooling air for assisting in controlling the feed of fuel vapor to
      the engine.<br>
      <br>
      5. It includes a novel arrangement for pumping liquid fuel by the
      usual fuel pump, provided in an automobile, to a vaporized
      chamber, and for return of excess liquid fuel from the vaporizer
      chamber to the fuel pump.<br>
      <br>
      6. The device is extremely simple, in materials required for
      making it, in fabrication of it, and in its functioning.<br>

      The invention will find ready adaptability to automobiles, but it
      is not limited thereto and can be applied to any internal
      combustion engine. Moreover, the device will be found most
      applicable, at least from a practical standpoint, to the use of
      gasolene as a fuel, but it is also applicable to other fuels. For
      convenience, in the present instance, the invention will be shown
      as applied to an automobile, with the above understanding as to
      the scope thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Referring in detail to the drawings, a vaporizer chamber 10 is
      shown in large scale, in section as applied to an automobile
      engine. The engine is shown diagrammatically at 12 in FIG. 3, and
      includes a cooling radiator 14, and a cooling fan 16, the radiator
      and fan being standard items, the fan producing a stream of air,
      in its cooling operation, which is utilized for a specific
      purpose, as will be referred to again hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      The engine includes a usual exhaust pipe 18, a carburetor 20 and a
      fuel pump 22. A fuel supply is indicated at 24. All of the
      foregoing elements or components are standard, and in the usual
      operation, the fuel pump 22 draws liquid fuel (gasolene) from the
      supply 24 through a fuel line 26 leading to the inlet of the fuel
      pump, and then through a fuel line 28 leading from the outlet of
      the pump. In the standard operation of the engine, the fuel
      continues through a fuel line 30 to the carburetor 20. Excess
      fuel, not utilized through the carburetor, returns through a first
      return line 32 to the inlet of the fuel pump, communicating with
      the supply 24. In the present instance a control valve 34 is
      provided in accordance with the principles of the present
      invention, and is interposed between the fuel lines 28, 30. The
      carburetor 20 has an outlet line 36 carrying atomized fuel to the
      engine, as indicated also in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      The carburetor 20, a standard and known component, has an air
      inlet line 40 through which air from atmosphere is carried thereto
      as controlled by a throttle 42, here identified a first throttle
      for mixture with the atomized gasolene for forming the combustible
      mixture required. The throttle 42 is controlled in the usual
      fashion, by means of an accelerator pedal 44 (FIG. 4) as will be
      referred to in again hereinbelow. The device of the invention
      includes another throttle 46, referred to for convenience as the
      second throttle, for controlling the vaporized fuel. The two
      throttles are interconnected by a link 48, which is directly
      actuated by the accelerator pedal 44 through a mechanism indicated
      diagrammatically at 50. The throttles 42, 46 are actuated in
      unison, by the accelerator pedal, and both in the same sense, that
      is, both opened or both closed.<br>
      <br>
      The vaporizer chamber 10 includes a housing or tank 52 closed to
      the exterior except with respect to certain elements, as referred
      to again. The housing includes a cover 54, and it includes a
      bottom element 55, forming a well or pit 56, secured to the
      housing and surrounding an opening 58 in the bottom of the
      housing.<br>
      <br>
      A tubing coil 60 is positioned in the chamber and has terminal
      extensions 62, 64 leading through to the exterior of the chamber,
      and extending into the exhaust pipe 18. The exhaust gases flow
      through the exhaust pipe as indicated by the arrow 66, and the
      first terminal extension 62 has a forwardly turned end element 68,
      forming a scoop for receiving a portion of the exhaust gases which
      are then forced into and through the coil 60 and then out through
      the other extension 64 where they are emitted through an end
      element 70 in the exhaust pipe. Thus a portion of the exhaust
      gases continuously flow through the coil 60 heating the vaporizer
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Leading from the valve 34 (FIG. 1) referred to above, is another
      outlet fuel line 72, carrying fuel therethrough as determined by
      the setting of the valve 34. The line 72 continues to a "T"
      fitting 74 having arms 76 and each provided with a nozzle or jet
      78, extending into the interior of the vaporizer chamber.
      Preferably the outlet ends of the nozzles are provided with a fine
      screen 80, of in the neighborhood of 100 mesh size. The mesh forms
      a spray or mist, indicated at 82, of the fuel, assisting the
      vaporizing action. The fuel thus delivered to the vaporizer
      chamber is vaporized by the heat from the exhaust gases, under
      conditions referred to hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      Leading from the vaporizer chamber is a vapor feed line 84 in
      which is a control valve 86 which includes the second throttle 42
      identified above. Continuing from this valve 86 is a feed line 88
      which leads to the outlet of the carburetor, indicated at 90 as
      communicating with the outlet line 36 forming a standard element
      of the carburetor. The vapor from the vaporizer chamber flows
      through the feed lines 84, 88 and to the line 36, and then to the
      engine, in a manner referred to again hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      In the normal operation, a certain portion of the fuel, i.e., the
      excess fuel, or that not needed for immediate use, in the
      vaporizer chamber, condenses and forms a liquid body 92 in the
      well 56. The temperature at which this condensation takes place
      may vary according to different factors, including pressure. A
      second, liquid fuel return line 94 leads from the well to the fuel
      line 26 at the intake of the fuel pump. The return of this liquid
      fuel from the vaporizer chamber is controlled by a needle valve 96
      which in turn is controlled by a float 98 pivoted at 100 in the
      chamber. Upon the level of this liquid body 92 rising to a
      predetermined level, the needle valve opens and the liquid fuel
      returns to the inlet of the fuel pump, by means of pressure
      developed in the vaporizer chamber, and in certain circumstances,
      by means of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure in the vaporizer chamber, referred to above, is
      developed by the delivery of the fuel into the chamber, but a
      small portion is also provided by a funnel or scoop 102 connected
      with a line 104 leading to the vaporizer chamber, and particularly
      at a point therein adjacent the bottom of the well 56, and in the
      body 92 of the liquid fuel. The funnel 102 is mounted in position
      as indicated in FIG. 3 where it scoops a portion of the air stream
      produced by the fan 16. Preferably a screen 106 is placed over the
      inlet of the funnel. This pressure thus developed in the vaporizer
      chamber, from the fan, is in proportion to the speed of the
      cooling fan 16, and thus in proportion to the speed of the engine.
      This pressure may be as low as 1/2 lb. psi, and it may rise to in
      the neighborhood of 6-8 lbs. psi. This arrangement results in the
      introduction of a certain amount of air into the vaporizer fuel,
      but this air, from the fan, is only a small portion of the air
      utilized in forming the combustible mixture, being on the order of
      1%-2% thereof. The remaining air is provided through the
      carburetor, under the usual control of the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      The valve 34 is controlled by a thermostatic unit 108 which is
      mounted on the exhaust pipe 18, and includes a heat sensing
      element 110 extending into the interior of the exhaust pipe for
      sensing the temperature of the exhaust gases. The unit 108 is
      provided with a link or element 112 leading to the valve 34 for
      actuating the latter. When the exhaust pipe is cool, the unit 108
      acts to shift the valve 34 to a first position for directing fuel
      from the line 28 to the line 30 and thereby to the carburetor. In
      this condition the engine operates as if the device of the present
      device is not applied thereto. When the exhaust gases reach a
      predetermined temperature, the unit 108 serves to shift the valve
      34 toward and to a second, and opposite, position, directing the
      fuel from the line 28 through the line 72 and to the vaporizer
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In the operation of the apparatus, and assuming first a cold
      condition, when the engine is started, the valve 34 directs the
      fuel to the carburetor, and it is there atomized and delivered to
      the engine in the usual manner. In this stage of operation there
      is no vaporized fuel developed. The engine is under the control of
      the accelerator pedal 44 which actuates the throttle 42 of the
      carburetor in the usual manner, allowing less, or more, fuel to
      the engine. Actuation of the accelerator pedal also controls the
      second throttle 46, at the same time, but at this stage, no fuel
      has been vaporized and the fuel lines 84, 88 are empty.<br>
      <br>
      As the engine warms up consequent to running, and the exhaust
      gases heat up, these exhaust gases, in passing through the coil
      60, heat up the coil, and thus the interior of the chamber.
      Simultaneously therewith, pursuant to the heating up of the
      exhaust gases, the thermostatic unit 108 functions to switch the
      valve 34, toward its second position, whereby the fuel is directed
      from the fuel line 28 through the line 72 and to the vaporizer
      chamber. The valve 34 is preferably of gradually closing/opening
      character, so that as it moves from its first position in which it
      directs fuel to the carburetor, to its second position in which it
      directs fuel to the vaporizer chamber, it does so slowly. As a
      consequence the fuel to the carburetor is gradually reduced and
      the fuel to the vaporizer chamber is gradually increased. Thus the
      engine starts on the atomized fuel, and continues on both the
      atomized fuel and vaporized fuel in a gradual transition step,
      that is, at the first portion of that step, the fuel is entirely
      atomized, and that fuel gradually lessens and the vaporized fuel
      gradually increases, so that there is a mixture of the two
      conditions or phases of the fuel between the extremes until all of
      the atomized fuel is shut off, and only the vaporized fuel flows
      to the engine. All through this phase, both throttles 42, 46 are
      actuated in unison as mentioned above, and even though they both
      are so actuated, the fuel that is delivered to the engine is
      controlled by the one that is in the stream of fuel. While the
      valve 34 moves toward its second position and shuts off fuel to
      the carburetor, the throttle 42 remains open, according to the
      actuation of the accelerator pedal 44 so that the throttle 42
      permits sufficient air for producing proper combustible mixture
      with the vaporized fuel from the line 88. Although the fuel to the
      carburetor is shut off, and the carburetor does not function in
      controlling the flow of fuel, it does however remain operative in
      controlling the flow of air for mixture with the vaporized fuel.<br>
      <br>
      It is also within the scope of the invention to vaporize the fuel
      from the heat of the engine coolant, instead of from the exhaust
      gases. Such an arrangement is shown in FIG. 5, which includes the
      engine 12, radiator 14, fan 16 and the vaporizer chamber 10. This
      arrangement includes a tube 114 for carrying the coolant from the
      engine to the radiator, and a return line 116. The hot coolant
      from the line 114 also is carried by a line 118 to the inlet
      extension 62 of the vaporizer chamber and a line 120 from the
      outlet extension 64 to the cool return line 116.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the invention is sufficiently broad to cover any kind
      of external heater, including an electric heater element. FIG. 6
      shows such an electric heater 122 in the vaporizer chamber 10,
      connected with conductors 124 leading from a suitable source such
      as the battery 126 in the automobile.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the operator performs the operating steps, for
      driving the engine, in exactly the same manner as he would without
      the apparatus of the present invention applied thereto. In other
      words he actuates the accelerator pedal 44, and the fuel delivered
      to the engine is of atomized form, or vaporized form, according to
      the condition of the engine itself, that is, the temperature
      thereof, and there is no requirement for a special manipulation
      required because of the change of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      In order to apply the apparatus of the invention to an ordinary
      engine, there is an absolute minimum of adaptation required. The
      apparatus is simply applied to the engine, and the engine and
      related components are not in any way affected from the standpoint
      of constructional features. The coil terminal extensions 62, 64 do
      however extend through the holes in the exhaust pipe, as does the
      thermostatic unit 108, but these holes are minimal, and it is also
      within the scope of the invention to provide a fitting containing
      these elements that may be simply interposed as a section in the
      exhaust pipe.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature at which the switch-over from atomized fuel to
      vaporized fuel may be as desired, such for example as between 110
      DEG F. and 160 DEG F. in the vaporizer chamber. This temperature
      is determined of course by pre-selecting elements of the desired
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have proved that standard automobiles now on the road,
      provided with the device of the invention, have obtained greatly
      improved mileage.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is relatively small, and can be easily accommodated
      under the hood of most automobiles. In the case where space is at
      a premium, the apparatus may be re-designed to the particular
      space available. As an example of the approximate size of the
      apparatus, the vaporizer chamber 10 may be on the order of 7" in
      diameter, and the main housing 5" deep, in axial direction. The
      well 56 may be for example 2" in axial direction. Obviously these
      dimensions are not considered limiting, but merely as examples.
      The vaporizer chamber constitutes the largest component of the
      apparatus, and from that, and the relative sizes of the other
      components, can be visualized that a very small space is required
      for the entire apparatus.<br>

        </b><b>FUEL VAPORIZING SYSTEM</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      A system for providing an air-fuel vapor mixture to an engine for
      improving completeness of combustion and also reducing emissions.
      The system includes a vaporizer within which a series of baffles
      are disposed such that air and fuel pass along a tortuous
      passageway defined within the vaporizer. Exhaust gases provide
      heat to the vaporizer, and as air and fuel pass along the
      passageway of the vaporizer, a homogenous air-fuel vapor mixture
      is produced, with the homogenous mixture exiting the vaporizer
      being supplied to the engine by way of an adapter plate assembly.
      When used with a carburetor, the adapter plate is disposed between
      the carburetor and the engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to fuel systems, and particularly to fuel
      systems which heat the fuel such that the fuel enters an engine as
      a vapor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Discussion of the Background</b><br>
      <br>
      It is constantly a goal to improve the performance of engines,
      particularly in automobiles and other motor vehicles. Due to the
      competitiveness of the industry as well as environmental
      constraints, motor vehicle engines must operate as efficiently as
      possible while minimizing emissions and providing satisfactory
      power performance. Toward these goals, one focus has been upon the
      ability to provide most efficient and complete combustion of the
      fuel consumed by the engine. In order to improve combustion of the
      fuel, one approach has been to heat the fuel to a vapor before the
      fuel enters the engine.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in my earlier U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,616, a fuel system
      is disclosed in which the fuel passes from the fuel tank to an
      auxiliary carburetor, with the auxiliary carburetor providing an
      air and fuel mixture to a vaporizer unit. The vaporizer unit then
      heats the mixture such that the fuel is vaporized, and the vapor
      is then fed to the main carburetor of the engine. Although the
      system utilizes the concept of providing vaporized fuel to an
      engine, the system has been less than optimal from a power
      performance standpoint.<br>
      <br>
      Other attempts to provide improved engine performance, emissions
      and economy utilizing vaporized fuel have also suffered from a
      number of shortcomings. Some attempts have suffered from the
      inability to adequately control the vapor and achieve full engine
      power in all driving conditions. In other attempts, the vapor
      produced condensed as it was traveling from the vaporizer toward
      the engine, somewhat defeating the purpose of the vaporizer.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an improved fuel delivery system is desired which
      provides a more optimal and effective fuel and air mixture to the
      engine. Such a system should be capable of providing an air and
      fuel mixture in a vaporized state such that fuel efficiency is
      increased while emissions are decreased. Preferably, the system
      should be adaptable to retrofit installation a well as for
      manufacture with the original equipment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      fuel heating system which provides an air-fuel vapor mixture to an
      engine to increase the fuel efficiency and decrease emissions.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a
      vaporizer for a fuel system which can be installed on a retrofit
      basis, and which also can be incorporated in the original
      equipment when the engine is manufactured.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a
      vaporizer for a fuel delivery system in which the fuel and air
      pass along a convoluted or tortuous passageway such that the fuel
      is fully vaporized and mixed with air, thereby providing a
      homogenous air-fuel vapor mixture to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a fuel
      delivery system in which a homogenous air and fuel vapor mixture
      is formed which does not condense when traveling from the
      vaporizer toward the engine.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fuel
      supply system which includes a vaporizer, and which can be
      utilized in an engine having a carburetor as well as a fuel
      injected engine.<br>
      <br>
      It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a
      vaporizing fuel supply system which can be utilized when
      conditions are appropriate, with the system switchable to the
      standard carburetor or fuel injection system at other times.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals
      designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several
      views, FIG. 1 illustrates the vaporizer fuel system of the present
      invention in which the vaporizer includes an inner housing 2
      formed preferably of red brass, with the housing sufficiently
      sealed such that the air and fuel being mixed and vaporized within
      the housing do not escape therefrom, and so that exhaust gases
      which circulate between a steel outer housing 4 and the inner
      housing 2 do not enter the inner housing 2. I have found red brass
      to be the best in handling high temperatures associated with the
      vaporizer fuel system. The outer housing 4 is welded or soldered
      (silver solder) to the exhaust in and out pipes, and can also be
      welded to the bottom plate 6. The housing 4 may also be tightly
      fitted into a groove 8a of the upper plate, thereby allowing for
      disassembly, while preventing leakage when assembled. The outer
      housing can also be seated in a precisely cut groove (6a) in the
      bottom plate 6. Additional end plates 10, 12 are also provided,
      with high temperature gaskets 14, 16 sandwiched between the
      plates. The vaporizer structure is also held together by bolts 18,
      which also allow for mounting the vaporizer upon a suitable
      support 20 on the vehicle. The inner housing is preferably welded
      or soldered (silver solder) to an end plate 15, with the other end
      received in groove 17 of plate 8 when the arrangement is assembled
      and tightened via bolts 18. Silver solder can be used for fixing
      the inner housing to the upper and lower plates.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of FIG. 1 is advantageous in that it allows for
      easy assembly and disassembly of the various components, thereby
      allowing for inspection, repair or modification. Disassembly can
      also allow for cleaning, for example utilizing a conventional
      carburetor cleaner. However, it is to be understood that
      disassembly may not be essential in mass-produced versions, and
      therefore instead of a bolted arrangement, an overall welded
      construction may suffice, or a construction in which only the top
      is removable. In both the bolted and welded constructions, it may
      also be desirable to provide a drain (not shown) in the bottom to
      allow draining of any cleaning materials.<br>
      <br>
      An inlet pipe 22 provides a source of heat for the vaporizer. In
      the preferred form of the invention, the exhaust pipe or conduit
      22 is connected to the exhaust system of the vehicle. For example,
      the conduit 22 can be connected to the exhaust manifold, or to a
      location downstream of the exhaust manifold. The exhaust enters
      the conduit or pipe 22 and circulates within the outer housing and
      about the inner housing, and then exits through the exhaust outlet
      conduit or pipe 24. A temperature sensing probe 26 extends into
      the space between the inner and outer housing to thereby provide
      an indication of the temperature of the exhaust gases in order to
      determine when the temperature is sufficient for proper operation
      of the vaporizer. Preferably, the probe is contained within a red
      brass tube 26a to prolong the life of the probe. The probe 26
      connected to a temperature gauge and/or control 28 which is
      displayed on the dash of the vehicle. The temperature gauge can be
      utilized by the operator to determine when the exhaust
      temperatures are sufficient such that the vaporizer is
      operational, and thereafter, the heat is controlled by an AC/DC
      vacuum solenoid, solenoid, vacuum storage and vacuum element
      together with a thermostat. An example of a suitable exhaust
      temperature control is disclosed in my earlier U.S. Pat. No.
      4,883,616, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      The choke plate 30 pivots by way of a bolt 32 which is rotated by
      a vacuum element 34. The vacuum element is connected to the bolt
      32 by a suitable link such as piano wire 36. The vacuum element
      34, in turn, is connected to a vacuum solenoid valve 38 by line
      37. The vacuum solenoid valve 38 selectively places the line 37 in
      communication with a vacuum line 39 connected to a vacuum storage
      location 40. The vacuum solenoid valve 38 is operated by the
      thermostat, which preferably includes an electric temperature
      control dial 35 located on the dash to allow the thermostat
      temperature to be varied. The choke plate 30 is shown in the open
      position in FIG. 1, and when rotated 90 DEG, the plate 30 is in
      the closed position. The vacuum storage 40 can be approximately
      two inches by four inches and is connected to the engine vacuum as
      indicated by arrow 41, with a one-way check valve 42 provided to
      prevent loss of the vacuum in the vacuum storage 40 (see also the
      connection 160 to the engine vacuum in FIG. 9). Although the size
      of the various elements can depend on a number of parameters, for
      example the size of the engine to which fuel is being supplied,
      the size of the outer housing can be, for example, on the order of
      3-4 inches for automobiles. The inner red brass housing can be,
      for example, 1/2-2 inches in diameter and 12-16 inches in length.
      Preferably, the entire outer housing is insulated as represented
      schematically at 4a.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel is supplied to the inner housing by way of a fuel inlet
      conduit 50. Fuel travels from a variable on/off valve 52 which
      includes an arm 54 for actuating the valve 52, with a suitable
      control 58 (FIG. 5) provided on the dash of the vehicle. The
      control 58 can be, for example, an adjustable push-pull knob, with
      the control connected to arm 54 by a cable, such as an aircraft
      bowden cable. For example, one type of knob, which is commercially
      available, provides adjustment when the knob is in the out
      position by rotating the knob, which in turn is associated with a
      screw. The knob can also be pushed in for an immediate cut-off,
      for example in an emergency. Of course, other types of knobs or
      switches could be implemented within the scope of the present
      invention. Generally, the valve 52 will not be adjusted often, and
      typically only one adjustment or long term periodic adjustments
      are necessary for a particular engine. However, adjustment may
      also be necessary where operating conditions or loads change
      dramatically. Particularly in more automatic designs, adjustment
      of the valve 52 from under the hood (rather than from the dash)
      may be sufficient. A one-way check valve 60 is disposed in the
      fuel inlet conduit 50, thereby preventing any backflow or back
      pressure from the interior of the inner housing.<br>
      <br>
      Referring briefly to FIG. 10, a switching/valving arrangement is
      provided to allow for operation of an engine via the vaporizer, or
      by the standard carburetor or fuel injector. The FIG. 10
      arrangement is upstream of the valve 52 and includes a two-way
      valve 100, preferably a two-way solenoid. Fuel is supplied via
      line 102 and filter 104, with an electric actuator switch 106
      operating the valve 100 such that the fuel from line 102 passes
      either to the vaporizer as indicated by arrow 108, or to the
      standard carburetor/fuel injector as shown at 110. Once the
      exhaust temperature gauge indicates the exhaust temperatures are
      sufficiently high (e.g., 550 DEG F. minimum), the operator can
      utilize the electric switch to change from standard operation to
      operation by fuel from the vaporizer. When operation by the
      vaporizer is desired, the operator flips the switch 106, which is
      electrically coupled (107) to the solenoid 100. The switch 106
      actuates solenoid 100 such that flow is discontinued to the
      carburetor and fuel begins flowing to the vaporizer.
      Alternatively, the control switch 106 could include an automatic
      control arrangement or automatic switchover such that the fuel is
      delivered to the vaporizer (i.e., to the interior of the inner
      housing 2) automatically when the exhaust temperatures are
      sufficient. However, even where the control of the fuel flow to
      the inner housing 2 is automatically controlled, a manual override
      should be provided such that the operator can discontinue fuel
      supply via the vaporizer when desired.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the exhaust temperature should be 550 DEG-700 DEG F. to
      operate the engine with the vaporizer, however, the temperature
      can vary dependent upon the type of fuel being vaporized.<br>
      <br>
      As should be readily apparent from FIG. 1, the fuel supply conduit
      50 enters a first end of the vaporizer and inner housing through
      the plates 8, 12 and the gasket 16, with the fuel inlet conduit
      extending from a first end, designated generally at 3, and toward
      a second end, designated generally at 5, of the vaporizer and
      inner housing. As a result, the fuel begins to be heated as it
      passes through the inner housing within the fuel inlet conduit. At
      the terminating end of the fuel inlet conduit 50, a nozzle portion
      62 is provided. Preferably, the nozzle portion 62 includes a
      plurality of small outlet holes 64 disposed in the side walls of
      the conduit 50. The outlet holes are on the order of 10-20
      thousandths of an inch and thereby disperse the fuel as it exits
      (as illustrated at 64a) the nozzle portion and is released into
      the interior of the inner housing 2. The size of the outlet holes
      64 can also vary with engine size. The end of the conduit or fuel
      inlet 50 is preferably closed such that the fuel is released only
      via ports or holes 64. Although the fuel inlet 50 is illustrated
      as substantially a single continuous conduit, it is to be
      understood that the high temperature materials (e.g., brass) for
      conduit portions extending into the inner housing need not be
      utilized for the entirety of the conduit 50.<br>
      <br>
      An air inlet conduit or line 66 is also provided for supplying air
      to the inner housing for mixing with the fuel. Air enters the
      conduit 66 from the ambient atmosphere, and passes through a
      filter 68 and one-way check valve 70. In addition, an adjustment
      device, such as an adjustable screw device 72 is provided in order
      to adjust the amount of airflow from the ambient to the inner
      housing of the vaporizer, e.g. for various engine sizes. In
      addition, a source of compressed air 73 may optionally be
      provided, which can be selectively placed in communication with
      the conduit 66. The operation of the vaporizer with compressed air
      may be desirable in certain high-power operations, such as in
      climbing a steep hill and/or carrying a heavy load. However, under
      most conditions, it will be sufficient to operate the vaporizer
      with the conduit 66 open to ambient air, since the movement of the
      air and fuel through the inner housing will cause the air to be
      drawn from the ambient through the air inlet conduit 66. In fact,
      in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, I have
      recognized that by simply providing the air inlet open to ambient,
      the mixture formed by the vaporizer is superior to introduction by
      known methods such as an auxiliary carburetor or compressed/forced
      air, under most operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      A small amount of water may also (optionally) be pumped into the
      air inlet conduit 66 as illustrated at 75. This can include an
      automatic electronic water injection system 75 available at parts
      stores. The water becomes steam in the vaporizer and even further
      reduces emissions of the engine to near zero. The steam can also
      help the interior of the inner housing stay clean. With the
      vaporized fuel delivery system of the present invention, emissions
      have been reduced to 3-8% of that of standard carburetor/fuel
      injection operation without the use of water. The emissions
      reduction is enhanced by the addition of water to near zero. For
      wintertime operation, the water can be a windshield washer type
      fluid which includes alcohol to prevent freezing.<br>
      <br>
      The air enters the inner housing at the second end (5) of the
      inner housing such that it is mixed with fuel exiting the fuel
      inlet conduit 50. As the fuel exits through the nozzle portion 62,
      it is mixed with air and vaporization of the fuel begins within
      the heated inner housing 2. In order to ensure complete
      vaporization of the fuel, and mixing with air, the air and fuel
      travel along a convoluted or tortuous passageway indicated by the
      arrows 72.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of the interior of the inner housing is an
      extremely important aspect of the present invention. As discussed
      earlier, one problem with previous vaporization arrangements has
      been that the vapor at least partly condenses as it travels from
      the vaporizer to the engine. However, in accordance with the
      present invention, complete vaporization of the fuel occurs in the
      vaporizer, and further, the vapor is mixed with air such that a
      uniform homogenous air and fuel vapor mixture is provided. Testing
      has revealed that the vapor mixture provided by the vaporizer of
      the present invention has been able to maintain its vapor
      condition for as long as 20-25 minutes after exiting the vaporizer
      before condensing again. Accordingly, problems associated with
      condensation of the vapor as it travels from the vaporizer to the
      engine are avoided, since the vaporizer provides a superior
      homogeneous air-fuel vapor mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The passageway for the air and fuel is defined by a number of
      baffles 74 (preferably red brass) disposed along the interior of
      the inner housing 2. For convenience, it is preferable that the
      baffles 74 be mounted (e.g., with silver solder) upon a center rod
      76 which extends through the housing. With such a construction,
      the baffles can be conveniently removed for repair, cleaning or
      inspection merely by removing the top plate of the vaporizer and
      removing the rod 76 having the baffles mounted thereon. A number
      of pads 78 may also be disposed along the passageway defined
      between the baffles, with the pads 78 formed of a brass wool or
      mesh. The brass wool pads 78 increase the effectiveness or
      completeness of the vaporization of the fuel, since the fuel must
      come in contact or pass very closely adjacent to the strands of
      the brass pads, which become hot when the vaporizer is in use. The
      brass wool pads also make the passageway even more tortuous,
      thereby improving vaporization and homogeneity of the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Once the fuel and air has passed along the passageway defined
      within the inner housing 2, the fuel has become completely
      vaporized and the homogenous air-fuel vapor mixture exits the
      vaporizer through a vapor outlet 80, and into a vapor conduit 82.
      A vapor temperature probe 83 can also be provided, with a vapor
      temperature gauge 85 mounted on the dash. The vapor conduit 82
      should be insulated (not shown) along its length to assist
      maintaining the vapor state.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a top view of the vaporizer unit. Although the unit
      is illustrated in a vertical orientation (FIG. 1), it is to be
      understood that the vaporizer may also be disposed underneath a
      hood of a vehicle such that the vaporizer extends horizontally. A
      horizontal arrangement may be advantageous in providing a more
      compact design, however, a vertical arrangement can provide for
      easier access to the interior of the vaporizer by removing the
      plate 12 from the bolts (allowing for inspection, repairs or
      modification through testing). As shown in FIG. 2, the exhaust
      enters conduit 22, circulates between the inner and outer
      housings, and exits through conduit 24. The fuel travels through
      the fuel inlet conduit 50 through valve 52, and continues to
      travel through the conduit 50 via one-way check valve 60 and into
      the interior of the inner housing 2, with the homogenous air-fuel
      (and water or steam) vapor exiting through vapor outlet conduit
      82.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a side view of the top or first end (3) portion of the
      vaporizer unit of FIGS. 1 and 2. A bowden cable 57 operates a
      valve arm 54 for the valve 52. The valve arm is movable between an
      off position 54a and a full on position 54b to vary the amount of
      fuel passing along conduit 50 to the interior of the inner housing
      2.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly referring to FIGS. 4A-D, the baffles include a plurality
      of circular plates 74, preferably formed of red brass, with a
      sector of each plate missing as shown at 74a, to thereby define
      the passageway for the air and fuel vapor along the inner housing.
      For clarity, the fuel inlet conduit 50 is omitted from FIGS. 4A-D,
      however, it is to be understood that at least some of the baffles
      will include an aperture through which the conduit 50 extends. As
      shown in FIGS. 4A-D, the baffle plates 74 are angularly offset
      with respect to one another, such that the removed sectors of
      adjacent baffles are not axially aligned with one another. For
      example, a first plate may have an orientation as shown in FIG.
      4A, with an adjacent plate oriented as shown in FIG. 4B, and
      subsequent plates arranged as shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D. As a
      result, a convoluted or tortuous passageway is defined within the
      inner housing, thereby promoting complete vaporization of the fuel
      and also promoting homogeneity of the fuel and air mixture. In
      addition, the baffles promote a regular and controlled or confined
      flow of the air and fuel, since without the baffles, the fuel
      would expand quite rapidly upon entering the inner housing or
      vapor tube 2, and would explode in all directions without
      developing a homogenous air-fuel mixture in which the fuel is
      fully vaporized. Still referring to FIGS. 4A-D, it will be noted
      that the removed sectors are offset in a clockwise direction with
      respect to one another when the successive baffles of FIGS. 4A-D
      are compared. In order to provide an even more tortuous
      passageway, the baffles are preferably arranged such that
      subsequent baffles are offset counterclockwise with respect to one
      another. As a result, during some portions of the passageway along
      the inner housing, the air and fuel vapor will travel along a
      somewhat helical path in a first direction, with the helix then
      reversing in another direction.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the baffles inside of the inner housing promote flow of the
      air and fuel mixture toward the vapor outlet 80, and also promote
      complete vaporization and homogeneity of the mixture. The vapor
      leaves the inner housing via vapor conduit 82, has its temperature
      taken via probe 83 and gauge 85, and is supplied to the engine as
      shown in FIG. 5. Preferably, an adjustment screw 84 is disposed
      along the vapor conduit 82 to thereby adjust the flow along the
      conduit, with the screw 84 as close as possible to the throttle
      120. Preferably, the screw 84 includes a lock-nut to maintain the
      adjusted position of the screw. For an automobile, the vapor
      conduit is on the order of 1/2-1 inch, with the actual size
      depending upon the size of the engine. In order to ensure that the
      engine is not simultaneously fed fuel from the vapor conduit 82
      and through the carburetor at the same time, a pintle valve 86 is
      also disposed between the vapor conduit 82 and an adapter plate
      assembly 122 which is disposed beneath the engine carburetor.
      Alternatively, a solenoid valve could be utilized instead of a
      pintle valve, however, high temperature solenoid valves can be
      quite costly. The pintle valve 86 includes a slide member 88 which
      is operated by, e.g., a push-pull Bowden airplane knob 90 located
      on the dash, such that when the slide member 88 is moved inwardly,
      flow through the valve is cut off, and when the slide member 88 is
      pulled out, the air-fuel vapor flow passes through the valve and
      to the engine. Preferably, a rod extending out of the slide member
      88 is threaded and includes an adjustment member 88a, such that
      the amount of air-fuel vapor mixture passing through the pintle
      valve in the open condition can be varied. In addition, as
      schematically illustrated by the broken lines 91, an exit portion
      of the pintle valve is tapered, thereby providing a throttling
      action or increase in the flow velocity, or for an emergency
      cut-off.<br>
      <br>
      The air-fuel vapor mixture enters the adapter plate assembly and
      is then sprayed through spray bars or rings 93 having a plurality
      of holes 95 therein, such that the air-fuel vapor mixture is
      sprayed into the engine. As shown in FIG. 5, a portion of the
      rings 93 protrudes slightly inwardly, such that a vaccuum pressure
      is created. A throttle 120 is also mounted upon the adapter plate
      assembly 122, with the throttle connected to the existing linkage
      of the carburetor, such that the throttle for the vapor mode is
      controlled by operation of the foot pedal as in the standard
      carburetor/fuel injection mode.<br>
      <br>
      Still referring to FIG. 5, it will be seen that the adapter plate
      assembly is disposed beneath a conventional carburetor 200 of an
      engine, with air entering through the air throttle of a carburetor
      201 in the same manner as during regular operation of the engine
      with the carburetor. Thus, the air throttle or butterfly valves
      201 are opened and closed corresponding to movement of the foot
      pedal in the same manner as during operation of the engine without
      the vaporizer. The adapter plate assembly 122 is of a hollow
      construction, with a pair of plates 124 sandwiching end plates
      126. The assembly is shown bolted together, however a welded
      construction may also be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      The homogenous air and fuel vapor mixture from the vaporizer
      enters the throttle 120, and from the throttle 120, enters the
      adapter plate assembly 122 into the hollow chamber 122a therein. A
      plurality of holes 95 in the spray rings or spray bars 93 allow
      the air and fuel vapor mixture to pass from the interior of the
      adapter plate assembly such that the mixture is further mixed with
      air passing from the carburetor air throttle as the air from the
      carburetor passes through the spray rings. Thus, the air and fuel
      vapor mixture from the vaporizer is mixed with air from the
      carburetor and enters the engine for combustion.<br>
      <br>
      The spray rings may have a variety of designs, however spray rings
      which are often utilized by propane companies have been found to
      be suitable, and typically will include adjustment features to
      vary the amount of communication (i.e., opening sizes through
      holes 95) from the interior of the adapter plate assembly through
      the spray rings 93. It should be noted that the size of the
      adapter plate assembly 122 is somewhat exaggerated in FIG. 5 for
      illustrative purposes. The size will vary in accordance with the
      particular engine application, however for an automobile engine,
      the thickness of the adapter plate assembly will be on the order
      of one-half inch total, with the plates 124 each on the order of
      one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch. A gasket 128 is provided
      between the adapter plate assembly and the carburetor, with the
      gasket formed of a suitable material to prevent damage to the
      carburetor as a result of high operating temperatures. As
      indicated generally at 130, the vapor mixture throttle 120 is
      controlled by suitable linkage to the existing throttle linkage of
      the carburetor, such that the vapor throttle 120 is also operated
      by the foot pedal of a vehicle (or other fuel control mechanism,
      dependent upon the vehicle or engine application).<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 6, the throttle 120 is connected to the
      existing linkage of the carburetor 131 by the linkage 130, which
      includes threaded portions 130a, 130b, which are received by an
      internally threaded cover or collar 130c, thereby allowing for
      adjustment of the relationship between the throttle 120 (and
      linkage 130) and the existing carburetor linkage 131. Although not
      shown in FIG. 6, the carburetor is set above the area which
      includes the spray rings 93 with the bolts provided at positions
      corresponding to the positions of the carburetor bolt holes. As
      discussed earlier, a high temperature gasket material is provided
      between the carburetor and the adapter assembly to prevent damage
      to the carburetor. Operation of the foot pedal thereby controls
      the amount of air-fuel vapor mixture which passes from the conduit
      82 through the throttle 120 and into the adapter plate assembly.
      The air-fuel vapor mixture then exits through spray holes 95 of
      the spray bars or spray rings 93, with air from the carburetor
      also passing through the interior of the spray rings for mixing
      with the air-fuel vapor mixture. The two spray rings 93 correspond
      to a two barrel carburetor. Four rings 93 would be provided for a
      four barrel carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows an additional view of the throttle 120 which is
      connected to the linkage of the carburetor, and further with an
      adjustment screw 135 provided to adjust the amount of air-fuel
      vapor mixture during idling. Although a linkage connection is
      shown between the throttle 120 and the existing carburetor
      linkage, it is to be understood that a cam-type arrangement may
      also be desirable in providing a non-linear relationship between
      the operation of the throttle 120 and movement of the existing
      carburetor linkage 131.<br>
      <br>
      Although the foregoing example illustrates the present invention
      for use with a carburetor, it is to be understood that the present
      invention is equally applicable to fuel injected engines. In a
      fuel injected engine, the adapter plate assembly is disposed
      beneath the air carburetor, with the vapor throttle connected to
      the air throttle of the fuel injection system. When the switch is
      utilized to change operation from fuel injection to vapor, the
      high pressure fuel pump (30 or more pounds pressure) is also
      cut-off, with a standard 5-7 pound electric fuel pump utilized in
      the fuel line to supply fuel to the vaporizer (e.g. in use with a
      fuel injector, a standard fuel pump can be provided between the
      two-way solenoid of FIG. 10 and the vaporizer). The changeover
      switch also turns off the fuel injectors.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, an alternate arrangement of the vaporizer
      is shown. Such an arrangement is most probably more adaptable for
      use in an arrangement in which the vaporizer is part of the
      original engine equipment. However, it would also be possible to
      install such an arrangement on a retrofit basis. As shown in FIG.
      8, a plurality of outlets 140 are provided which connect the outer
      housing 4' of the vaporizer to the exhaust manifold 100 of an
      engine 102. A butterfly valve 30' is disposed in the exhaust gas
      outlet of the outer housing 4' (for controlling exhaust
      temperatures in the outer housing), with the exhaust then
      returning to the exhaust system 142 of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      As also shown in FIG. 8, the air and fuel inlet conduits 50', 66'
      can enter the same end of the inner housing, however the location
      at which the air and fuel exit their respective conduits and enter
      into the inner housing should be at least approximately at the
      same location, such that the air and fuel form a homogenous
      mixture as they pass along the tortuous passageway of the inner
      housing 2' and exit through the vapor-out conduit 82'. In
      addition, both the air and fuel inlet conduits can extend from a
      first end of the housing toward a second end (i.e., such that the
      air and fuel pass along the conduit extending through the interior
      of the inner housing before leaving their respective conduits).
      Referring back to the FIG. 1 arrangement, this may allow for
      easier maintenance, since the air and fuel connections can both be
      provided at the top or first end 3 of the inner housing.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 9, the overall operation will be described.
      Some parts (e.g., exhaust in-out) have been omitted from FIG. 9
      for improved clarity. When the engine is initially started, the
      exhaust temperatures are too low for effective operation of the
      vaporizer 1. Once a sufficient exhaust temperature is sensed by
      the probe 26, the fuel is shut off to the carburetor, and is
      directed to the vaporizer 1 (with the switching either manual or
      automatic, via the arrangement shown in FIG. 10). The temperature
      required for operation of the vaporizer 1 depends upon the fuel
      being utilized. Fuels in use today will become vaporized with
      vapor temperatures of 380 DEG-420 DEG F., possibly higher or lower
      depending upon refining procedures utilized by the various oil
      companies. The vacuum element 34 will control the butterfly valve
      30 to maintain the appropriate exhaust temperature, which can be
      500 DEG-650 DEG F., possibly as high as 700 DEG F. The vapor
      temperature should not exceed 10 DEG F. above the vaporization
      temperature of the fuel in order to avoid the light ends of
      gasoline from self-destruction at excessively high temperatures. A
      return spring 30a is provided for controlling the butterfly valve
      in conjunction with the vacuum element 34. As discussed earlier,
      the vacuum valve is connected to a vacuum storage 40 which is
      connected to the engine vacuum via line 160.<br>
      <br>
      Although fuel supply to the carburetor is discontinued, a short
      amount of time is still required for the fuel to run through the
      carburetor. Accordingly, in order to avoid an excessively rich
      fuel supply to the engine, the air-fuel vapor mixture from the
      vaporizer is prevented from entering the engine until the engine
      runs out of fuel entering through the carburetor. Thus, the pintle
      valve 86 remains in a closed position until the engine runs out of
      fuel, and then is either manually or automatically (via
      temperature sensor) opened such that the mixture from the
      vaporizer enters the engine via throttle 120 and adapter plate
      assembly 122. The pintle valve is opened when the operator senses
      that the engine is running out of fuel, or may be operated
      automatically by a sensor which recognizes when the engine is
      running out of fuel. Such sensors could include, for example, rpm
      sensors, exhaust sensors, etc., or combinations of sensors and
      servo type electrical-mechanical systems. Operation of the engine
      then continues on the mixture from the vaporizer, with the
      operator controlling the fuel delivery by the foot pedal of the
      vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Although the FIG. 9 arrangement illustrates an automobile, it is
      to be understood that the fuel delivery system in accordance with
      the present invention is applicable to a wide range of engines and
      vehicles. For example, the fuel delivery system could be utilized
      in boats, jet skis, or other engines for which fuel economy and
      low emissions are desirable.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present
      invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is
      therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended
      claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as
      specifically described herein.<br>
