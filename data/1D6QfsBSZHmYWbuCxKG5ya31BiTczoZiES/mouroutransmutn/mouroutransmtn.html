          from "a million years to 30 minutes," says Nobel laureate</b><br>

      Gérard Mourou has already won a Nobel for his work with fast laser
      pulses.<br>
      <br>
      If he gets pulses 10,000 times faster, he says he can modify waste
      on an atomic level.<br>
      <br>
      If no solution is found, we're already stuck with some 22,000
      cubic meters of long-lasting hazardous waste.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever one thinks of nuclear energy, the process results in tons
      of radioactive, toxic waste no one quite knows what to do with. As
      a result, it's tucked away as safely as possible in underground
      storage areas where it's meant to remain a long, long time: The
      worst of it, uranium 235 and plutonium 239, have a half life of
      24,000 years. That's the reason eyebrows were raised in Europe —
      where more countries depend on nuclear energy than anywhere else —
      when physicist Gérard Mourou mentioned in his wide-ranging Nobel
      acceptance speech that lasers could cut the lifespan of nuclear
      waste from "a million years to 30 minutes," as he put it in a
      followup interview with The Conversation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Who is Gérard Mourou?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mourou was the co-recipient of his Nobel with Donna Strickland for
      their development of Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) at the
      University of Rochester. In his speech, he referred to his
      "passion for extreme light."<br>
      <br>
      CPA produces high-intensity, super-short optical pulses that pack
      a tremendous amount of power. Mourou's and Strickland's goal was
      to develop a means of making highly accurate cuts useful in
      medical and industrial settings.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out CPA has another benefit, too, that's just as
      important. Its attosecond pulses are so quick that they shine a
      light on otherwise non-observable, ultra-fast events such as those
      inside individual atoms and in chemical reactions. This capability
      is what Mourou hopes give CPA a chance of neutralizing nuclear
      waste, and he's actively working out a way to make this happen in
      conjunction with Toshiki Tajima of UC Irvine. As Mourou explains
      to The Conversation:<br>
      <br>
      "Take the nucleus of an atom. It is made up of protons and
      neutrons. If we add or take away a neutron, it changes absolutely
      everything. It is no longer the same atom, and its properties will
      completely change. The lifespan of nuclear waste is fundamentally
      changed, and we could cut this from a million years to 30 minutes!<br>
      <br>
      We are already able to irradiate large quantities of material in
      one go with a high-power laser, so the technique is perfectly
      applicable and, in theory, nothing prevents us from scaling it up
      to an industrial level. This is the project that I am launching in
      partnership with the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy
      Commission, or CEA, in France. We think that in 10 or 15 years'
      time we will have something we can demonstrate. This is what
      really allows me to dream, thinking of all the future applications
      of our invention."<br>
      <br>
      While 15 years may seem a long time, when you're dealing with the
      half-life of nuclear waste, it's a blink of an eye.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>An idea for nuclear waste</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The one that is particularly close to my heart is the treatment of
      radioactive waste with our laser techniques. Let me explain: take
      an atomic nucleus: it is composed of protons and neutrons, if you
      put an extra neutron or if you remove one, it changes absolutely
      everything. It is no longer the same atom, its properties will
      then totally change. The lifespan of this waste is fundamentally
      changed: it can be reduced from a million years to 30 minutes!<br>
      <br>
      We are already able to irradiate a lot of material with a
      large-flow laser at once, so the technique is perfectly applicable
      and theoretically nothing opposes industrial-scale use. This is
      the project I am launching in collaboration with the AEC. We
      believe that in 10 or 15 years we will be able to show you
      something.<br>
      <br>
      This is really what continues to make me dream: all the future
      applications of our invention. When we work, it is the passion
      that drives us, not the hopes of Nobel Laureates. It's our
      curiosity that we have to satisfy. After my prize, I'm going to
      keep going!<br>

        <b>Arrangement for generating a proton beam and an installation
          for transmutation of nuclear wastes&nbsp; <br>
          [ <a href="US10049778B2.pdf" ">PDF</a> ]<br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an arrangement for generating a proton
      beam and an installation for transmutation of nuclear wastes,
      particularly from nuclear reactors.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the transmutation of nuclear wastes from nuclear
      reactors needs to deposit a large amount of neutrons and gamma
      photons on hazardous nuclear isotopes. The conventional approach
      is to use fast neutrons generated by fast breeding reactors or a
      dedicated high power and high energy accelerator to bombard a
      spallation heavy weight target to produce high flux of neutrons
      which will induce transmutation of these isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      A conventional arrangement for transmutation of nuclear wastes has
      the short-comings that it is very bulky and expensive. Its size
      may exceed the one of the nuclear reactor itself.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has the object to overcome these shortcomings.<br>
      <br>
      For reaching this object, the arrangement proposed by the
      invention is characterized in that it is constituted by a laser
      driven accelerator of protons adapted to produce a beam of
      relativistic protons of 0.5 GeV to 1 GeV with a current in the
      order of tens of mA, such as a current of 20 mA.<br>
      <br>
      According to a feature of the invention, the arrangement is
      characterized in that it comprises a laser pulse source adapted to
      produce a beam of short pulses having a duration of hundreds of
      femtoseconds and an intensity greater than 10&lt;23 &gt;W/cm&lt;2
      &gt;with a high-average power of the order of tens of MW and a
      proton target on which the laser beam is focused on.<br>
      <br>
      According to another feature of the invention, the arrangement is
      characterized in that the duration of the laser pulses is in the
      order of 30 femtoseconds.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature of the invention, the
      arrangement is characterized in that the high-average power is in
      the order of 20 MW.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature of the invention, the
      arrangement is characterized in that it comprises a laser pulse
      oscillator producing ultra-short pulses having a duration in the
      order of tens of femtoseconds and an energy in the order of
      nanojoules and a single mode optical fiber amplifier device into
      which the produced laser pulses are fed in, comprising a multitude
      of optical fibers in view to form a coherent amplification network
      system.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature of the invention, the
      arrangement is characterized in that said coherent amplification
      network system comprises a series of successive amplifier stages
      each comprising a bundle of single mode fiber amplifiers, in which
      the fibers are spaced from one another in view to allow passage of
      a cooling medium there between, the bundle of one stage comprising
      fibers which have been obtained by splitting of the fibers of the
      preceding stage bundle.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature of the invention, the
      arrangement is characterized in that in the downward end the
      portion of the coherent amplification network, each fiber
      comprises two fiber sections, an amplifying fiber section
      belonging to the last amplifier stage in which the fibers are
      separated from one another for cooling reasons and a transport
      fiber section made of very low loss fiber, the transport fibers
      allowing to transform the great diameter bundle of the amplifier
      stage into a small diameter output bundle where the fibers are
      kept as close as possible from each other to make the overall
      output pupil diameter as reduced as possible.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature of the invention, the
      arrangement is characterized in that the proton target is a solid
      target formed by a film of a substance such as hydrogen, helium or
      carbon.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another feature, the laser pulses source is
      adapted to produce laser pulses having a repetition rate in the
      order of Khz, such as 10 KHz.<br>
      <br>
      The installation for transmutation of nuclear wastes is
      characterized in that it comprises the arrangement for producing
      the beam of relativistic protons and a spallation target for
      producing a beam of neutrons of 0.5 GeV to 1 GeV, which is
      directed towards nuclear waste, said spallation target being
      irradiated by the ultra-relativistic proton beam.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance to an advantageous feature, the spallation target is
      a liquid target of Pb—Bi.<br>
      <br>
      According to another feature, the installation is characterized in
      that the spallation target comprises an entrance window of
      high-stress steel and a cylindrical tube filled by a liquid of
      Pb—Bi alloy, the liquid alloy being used as cooling medium.<br>
      <br>
      Other features and advantageous of the invention will become
      apparent from the description given below which only serves as an
      example and is in no way limiting the scope of the invention, with
      references to the attached drawings, wherein:<br>
      <br>

      of nuclear waste, according to the invention;<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a view of an arrangement for producing a high-intensity
      and high-average beam of protons, according to the invention;<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a schematic cross-section view of the optical fibers
      architecture of the transport fiber assembly along the line IV-IV
      of FIG. 2; and<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows an installation according to the invention for
      transmutating nuclear waste.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be described below in its application to
      transmutation of nuclear waste. This application however serves
      only as a non-exclusive example. It is to be noted that the
      invention covers all applications using a beam of relativistic
      protons obtained by the laser based method proposed by the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      As shown on FIG. 1, an installation for transmutating nuclear
      waste such as waste from nuclear reactors comprises an
      ultra-relativistic intensity pulse-laser source 1 susceptible to
      produce a laser beam 2 of ultra-short laser pulses having a
      duration of for instance 30 femtoseconds (fs) and an intensity
      greater than 10&lt;23 &gt;W/cm&lt;2 &gt;with high-average power of
      the order of 20 MW, a proton target 3 on which the laser beam 2 is
      focused on and from which a beam of relativistic protons 4 of 0.5
      GeV to 1 GeV with a current for instance of the order of 20 mA is
      produced. The latter irradiates a spallation target 5, for
      instance a liquid target of Pb—Bi where neutrons 6 of 0.5 to 1 GeV
      are spallated from. The neutrons are directed towards the nuclear
      waste 7 to be transmutated, such as spent nuclear fuel, in order
      to transmute the waste's radioactive isotope, i.e. lower
      actinides, into much safer materials or elements with
      significantly shorter half-lives.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIGS. 2 to 4, the ultra-relativistic intensity
      pulse-laser source 1 will be described here-below in a detailed
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen on FIG. 2, the source 1 comprises an oscillator 8
      adapted to produce short pulses of for instance femtoseconds (fs)
      duration and energy in the order of nanojoule (nJ). The produced
      laser-pulse is fed into a single mode optical fiber amplifier
      arrangement comprising a multitude of optical fibers in view to
      form a coherent amplification network (CAN) system providing
      simultaneous high-peak and high-average powers with high
      efficiency greater than 30%, i.e. the laser beam 2 shown on FIG. 1
      which may have an intensity greater than 10&lt;23
      &gt;W/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the coherent amplification network system reference is
      made to the publication “Euronnac, May 2012 Meeting CERN”, IZEST,
      Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau of Gerard Mourou and Toshiki
      Tajima, and to the publication “Coherent Beam Combining of 1.5 μm
      Er Yb Doped Fiber Amplifiers”, Fiber and Integrated Optics, 27(5)
      (2008) of S. Demoustier, C. Bellanger, A. Brignon and J. P.
      Huignard, and of “Collective Coherent Phase Combining of 64
      fibers” Opt. Express, 19, Issue 18, 17053-17058 (2011) of J.
      Bourderionnet, C. Bellanger, J. Primot and A. Brignon.<br>
      <br>
      More precisely, the laser-pulse produced by oscillator 8 passes
      through a pair of diffraction gratings 10 which are represented in
      form of a boxes the structure of which is precised beneath and
      which stretch it by about 10&lt;5 &gt;times in a manner known per
      se. The stretching separates the various components of the stretch
      pulse, producing a rainbow in time. The pulse after stretching is
      at the millijoule (mJ) level.<br>
      <br>
      The stretched pulses are coupled in a first amplifier stage 13 to
      a multiplicity of for instance 10 to 100 fibers 14, each
      constituting a single mode fiber amplifier. Each fiber will
      amplify the input pulse to the millijoule level. The amplified
      fibers are kept to form a bundle wherein the amplifying fibers are
      at a relatively large distance from one another in order to allow
      efficient cooling by an appropriate cooling medium for evacuating
      heat produced by the fibers.<br>
      <br>
      The same operation is repeated in a second amplifier stage 15
      where each fiber amplifier of the first stage 13 feeds a
      multiplicity of for instance 10 to 100 single mode amplifiers 16
      of the same type as the ones of the first stage. Each fiber will
      amplify the input, which is a corresponding part of the output of
      the fiber from which it is obtained by splitting, to the
      millijoule level.<br>
      <br>
      The same process is repeated in successive series of amplifier
      stages, one of which is furthermore shown in 17 on FIG. 2 which
      comprises a larger diameter bundle of fibers 19 spaced from one
      another for enabling efficient cooling of the fibers.<br>
      <br>
      It results from the foregoing that by splitting and branching each
      single “seed” pulse a matrix of thousands of lasers is obtained.
      In each stage of the successive series of amplifier stages, the
      phase of each pulse is preserved.<br>
      <br>
      The very great number of fibers of the last stage, on FIG. 2 the
      stage 17, are combined and phased with one another so as to form a
      single pulse, which is compressed by a pair of gratings in a
      manner known per se. The pulse energy can be now of tens of
      Joules, the pulse duration corresponding to the initial pulse
      duration of 30 femtoseconds of the present example.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the arrangement of the fibers in the region of the
      downward end of the fiber architecture. As can be seen, each fiber
      is realized in two sections, an amplifying section 19 and a
      transport section 20 made of very low loss fiber 21. The fiber
      amplifying sections 19 which constitute the last amplifier stage
      are arranged in a manner to form a great diameter bundle wherein
      the different sections are sufficiently separated from one another
      to ensure efficient cooling by means of an appropriate cooling
      medium. The fiber transport sections 20, since they are very low
      loss fibers which need no particular cooling allow to transform
      the great diameter bundle in a small diameter output bundle 21
      where the fibers are kept as closed as possible from each other to
      make the overall output pupil diameter as reduced as possible.<br>
      <br>
      The individual laser beams which get out at the ends of the small
      diameter fibers form a beam 22 of single pulse, after having been
      phase controlled to be in phase such as described in the before
      mentioned publication “Euronnac, May 2012, Meeting CERN, the
      teaching of which is considered to be included therein. Each
      amplified stretched output pulse is then compressed by means of a
      second pair of gratings 23 schematically shown on FIG. 2. The
      resulting pulse has the ultra-short duration of tens of
      femtoseconds such as of 30 femtoseconds of the original pulse
      produced by oscillator 9, but its energy is enormous of for
      instance 30 Joules.<br>
      <br>
      Theses pulses are made to hit a parabolic mirror 30 which focuses
      it on the proton target 3 as can be seen on FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting pulse is the high-average power and high-intensity
      pulse 2 shown on FIG. 1, which is in the ultra-relativistic
      regime, i.e. greater than 10&lt;23 &gt;W/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      According to FIGS. 1 and 3, these pulses 2 which can be produced
      at a repetition rate in the order of KHz for instance 10 kHZ, due
      to the efficient cooling of the single mode fiber amplifiers in
      their different bundles by means of an appropriate cooling medium,
      are made to shoot the proton target 3 which can be a solid target
      made of a substance such as hydrogen, helium and/or carbon,
      advantageously in form of a film 25. The shooting of the target
      produces the high-flux 4 of high-energy protons in the range of
      0.5 to 1 GeV which is made to impinge on the spallation target 5
      in order to be converted in the high-flux of fast energetic
      neutrons 6 by spallation process induced in the target 5 which is
      for instance a high-Z material target. It is to be noted that 1
      GeV proton produces on the target about 30 neutrons which is a
      high multiplication factor.<br>
      <br>
      The target 5 consists of an entrance window of high-stress steel
      and a cylindrical tube 27 of about 50 cm filled by a liquid Pb—Bi
      alloy for neutron production. This liquid alloy can be made to
      flow and circulate in a dedicated hydraulic circuit to maintain
      the temperature well below its critical value. Accordingly, the
      alloy is not only used for neutron production, but also as
      coolant.<br>
      <br>
      By appropriate monitoring the corrosion and the stress in the
      entrance window as well as of the temperature gradient and the
      production of H and He in the target assembly, a safe operation of
      the system is insured.<br>
      <br>
      In the conditions described above, the invention allows to produce
      efficient relativistic protons by shooting the solid target of
      hydrogen and/or helium within a laser at the density of greater
      than 10&lt;23 &gt;W/cm&lt;2&gt;. In this radiation dominated
      pressure regime, the momentum is transferred to ions through the
      electric filled arising from charge separation. In this regime,
      the proton component moves forward with almost the same velocity
      as the average longitudinal velocity of the electron component and
      renders the interaction very efficient, close to 100%. Moreover,
      the proton energy is a desired energy range between 0.5 and 1 GeV
      to produce the neutrons with the high-energy in order to achieve
      the transmutation of the nuclear waste 7.<br>
      <br>
      It results from the foregoing that the laser based way to produce
      neutrons to be directed toward a target of nuclear waste comprises
      an oscillator for producing ultra-short laser pulses in the order
      of femtoseconds having an energy in order of millijoules, very far
      from the level of tens of joules necessary for the targeted
      application of the invention, such as transmutation of nuclear
      waste. To this end, the invention proposes to combine a very large
      number, i.e. 10&lt;4 &gt;or more fibers coherently in the coherent
      amplification network system described above and shown on the
      figures. The repetition rate of the laser pulses having the
      intensity greater than 10&lt;23 &gt;W/cm&lt;2 &gt;can be
      advantageously in the order of tens of kHZ due to the use of
      fibers having a high surface area and the heat removal ensured by
      the disposition of the fibers in large diameter fiber bundles
      wherein they are separated from one another to allow circulation
      of a cooling medium there between. Since the used single mode
      fiber amplifiers are the same in each amplifier stage, and are
      tested telecommunication components, the laser pulse generator
      arrangement and the installation for transmutating nuclear waste
      can be realized as relatively cheap and compact apparatus which
      can be moved to locations where it should be used.<br>
