psychic
stress







            induced by faith or other dispositions, many cleric and lay
            Christians have enjoyed --- or suffered --- many apocalyptic
            visions. Pope Benedict IV (1657-1758), generously decreed
            that "the recipients of prophecy may be angels, devils, men,
            women, children, heathen or gentiles; nor is it necessary
            that a man should be gifted with any particular disposition
            in order to receive the light of prophecy provided that his
            intellect and senses be adapted for making manifest the
            things which God reveals to him."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Apocalyptic
prophecy







            is a particular species of eschatology (dealing with death
            and final judgment). Many of such prophecies are not
            inspired originals, but are paraphrases of earlier writings
            (such as the Sibylline oracles) that were incorporated with
            hopeful political propaganda for the historical period in
            which the writers lived. However, such pseudo-prophecies
            contain valuable fragments which can be distinguished and
            selected for the present purpose. Many others of the
            representative prophecies included here were genuine
            original visions of doom, untainted by the odium of theology
            and politics.</font></font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            prophecies attributed to St. Methodius of Patara (a martyred
            bishop of the 4th century) are some of the earliest
            post-biblical Christian prophecies extant. Most
            authoritative scholars now agree that the prophecies are the
            work of a pseudonymous author who wrote in Syriac circa 680
            AD. The manuscript in question(<i>Monumenta Patrum
              Orthodoxographa</i>, 1569) was located in the Patrium
            Veterum Library nearly 1000 years after the death of St.
            Methodius.<b> (1)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            pseudo-Methodius collection comprises several
            distinguishable documents that recur in fragments in many
            other Medieval prophecies: (1) a historical survey of the
            nations, beginning with Adam; (2) Gideon's victory over the
            Ishmaelites; (3) a history of Alexander the Great and
            Gog-Magog (the Huns, who will attack the world again in the
            latter days); (4) the new Roman Empire and the ascendancy of
            Islam; (5) the Moslem reign of terror; (6) the victory of a
            holy Roman Emperor; and (7) the overthrow of Gog-Magog by
            the Roman Emperor, the birth of the Antichrist, and the Last
            Judgment. The following excerpts may have some bearing on
            our future:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"A
            time will come when the enemies of Christ will boast: "We
            have subjected the earth and all its inhabitants, and the
            Christians cannot escape our hands." Then a Roman Emperor
            will arise in great fury against them... Drawing his sword,
            he will fall upon the foes of Christianity and crush them.
            Then peace will reign on earth, and priests will be relieved
            of all their anxieties.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"In
            the last period Christians will not appreciate the great
            grace of God who provided a monarch, a long duration of
            peace, a splendid fertility of the earth. They will be very

            this reason in the Third Gospel the Lord gave the following
            statement: "Woe to you, Chorazaim, woe to you Bethsaida, woe
            to you Capharnaum --- if you have risen up to heaven, you

            67:32] will be fulfilled in that these last men who stretch
            out their hands to God are from the seed of Chuseth, the
            daughter of Phol, king of Ethiopia. When the Cross has been
            lifted up on high to heaven, the King of the Romans will

            mankind, was born of a Virgin and in human form crushed the
            enemy with the holy power of his godhead. This then the
            enemy, having learnt that again shall the Lord come from
            heaven in the glory of His divinity, thus bethought him to
            assume the form of His coming and beguile all men. So in
            very truth shall he be born of a defiled woman, his
            instrument. In the form of Him shall come the all-polluted,
            as a wily thief to beguile all beings. Humble and gentle,
            hating the speech of the unjust, overturning all idols,
            honoring piety, a good lover of the poor, exceedingly fair,
            altogether well disposed, pleasant towards all. To

            by the peoples; neither gifts shall he accept, nor speak in

            in all these well-planned schemes he beguileth the world so

            all shall deny their own God and invite their fellows to
            praise the son of perdition, and one on another they shall
            fall and with swords each other destroy... Magnifying his
            miracles, performing his portents, Deceiver and not in truth
            manifesting these things, in such fashion the tyrant
            removeth the mountains, and simulates falsely and not truly
            while the multitude stands by, many nations and peoples

            be his disciples; to far-distant lands he shall send
            captains of his bands, who shall impart virtue and
            healing... A great conflict, Brethren, in those times

            Colum, Columba, and Comcille, 521-597 AD) was the founder of
            a great monastery on the Isle of Iona. There he wrote
            numerous religious tracts and prophecies that especially
            concern Ireland. St. Columbcille predicted the Viking raids
            on Eire from the 8th through 10th centuries, the
            Anglo-Norman invasion of 1169, the Turod conquest, the Irish
            rebellion of 1641, the great potato famine of 1845-50, and
            the invention of railroads ("In both North and South iron
            wheels shall support fiery chariots..."). He prophesied the

thou,
until







            I relate things that shall come to pass in the latter ages
            of the world. Great carnage shall be made, justice shall be
            outraged, multitudinous evils, great suffering shall
            prevail, and many unjust laws will be administered. The time
            shall come when they will not perform charitable acts, and
            truth shall not remain in them, and truth shall not remain
            in them. They will plunder the property of the church, they
            will be continually sneering at each other, they will employ
            them at reading and writing. They will scoff at acts of
            humility; there will come times of dark affliction, of
            scarcity, monarchs will be addicted to falsehood. Neither
            justice nor covenant will be observed by any one people of
            the race of Adam; they will become hard-hearted and
            penurious, and will be devoid of piety. The clergy will
            become fosterers, in consequence of the tidings of
            wretchedness; churches will be held in bondage by the
            all-powerful men of the day. Judges will administer
            injustice, under the sanction of powerful, outrageous kings;
            the common people will adopt false principles. Oh, how
            lamentable shall be their position! Doctors of science will
            have cause to murmur, they will become niggardly in spirit;
            the aged will mourn in deep sorrow, on account of the woeful
            times that shall prevail. Cemeteries shall become all red,
            in consequence of the wrath that will follow sinners; wars
            and contentions shall range in the bosoms of every family.
            Excellent men shall be steeped in poverty, the people will
            become inhospitable to their guests, the voice of the
            parasite shall be more agreeable to them than the melody of
            the harp touched by the sage's finger. In consequence of the
            general prevalence of sinful practices, humility shall
            produce no fruit. The professors of science shall not be
            rewarded, amiability shall not characterize the people;
            prosperity and hospitality shall not exist, but
            niggardliness and destitution will assume their place. The
            changes of the seasons shall produce only half their
            verdure, the regular festivals of the Church will not be
            observed; all classes of men shall be filled with hatred and
            enmity toward each other. The people will not associate
            affectionately with each other during the great festivals of
            the seasons; they will live devoid of justice and rectitude,
            up from the youth of tender age to the aged. The clergy
            shall be led into error by the misinterpretation of their
            reading; the relics of the saints will be considered
            powerless, every race of mankind will become wicked! Young
            women will become unblushing, the aged people will be of
            irascible temper; the kine will seldom be productive, as of
            old; lords will become murderers. Young people will decline
            in vigor, they will despise those who have hoary hair; there
            will be no standard by which morals may be regulated, and
            marriages will be solemnized without witnesses. Troublous
            shall be the latter ages of the world, the dispositions of
            the generality of men I will point out, from the time they
            shall abandon hospitable habits -- with the view of winning
            honor for themselves, they will hold each other as objects
            for ridicule. The possessors of abundance shall fall through
            the multiplicity of their falsehoods; covetousness shall
            take possession of every glutton, and when satisfied their
            arrogance shall know no bounds. Between mother and daughter
            anger and bitter sarcasms shall continuously exist;
            neighbors will become treacherous, cold, and false-hearted
            towards each another. The gentry will become grudgeful, with
            respect to their trifling donations; and blood relations
            shall become cool towards each other; Church livings shall
            become lay property. Such is the description of the people
            who shall live in the ages to come; more unjust and
            iniquitous shall be very succeeding race of men. The trees
            shall not bear the usual quantity of fruit, fisheries shall
            become unproductive and the earth shall not yield its usual
            abundance. Inclement weather and famine shall come and
            fishes shall forsake the rivers. The people will be
            oppressed for lack of food, shall pine to death. Dreadful
            storms and hurricanes shall afflict them. Numberless
            diseases shall then prevail. Fortifications shall be built
            narrow during these times of dreadful danger.</font></font>

            English seeress Mother Ursula Shipton, as she was popularly
            known, was christened Janet Ursula Southiel (Southill). She
            lived inYorkshire from 1488 to 1561, during the reign of
            Henry VII. The first collection of her visions was published
            in 1641, and a more complete edition was published in 1646
            by the astrologer and alchemist Sir William Lilly in his <i>Collections







              of Prophecies</i>. Most of her prophecies concerned her
            own times, but numerous fragments pertain to our future.
            Mother Shipton allegedly wrote the following verses about
            today and the near future, but in 1862 the English editor
            Charles Hindley admitted to the authorship of this falsely
            ascribed but nonetheless highly accurate prophecy, which
            includes descriptions of the radio, television, airplanes,

            more intensive, storms will have more catastrophic effects,
            earthquakes will destroy greater regions and the seas will
            overflow many lowlands. Not all of it will be the result of
            natural causes, but man will penetrate into the bowels of
            the earth and will reach into the clouds, gambling with its
            own existence. Before the powers of destruction will succeed
            in their design, the universe will be thrown into disorder,
            and the age of iron will plunge into nothingness. When the
            nights will be filled with more intensive cold and the day
            with heat, a new life will begin in nature. The heat means
            radiation from the earth, the cold the waning light of the

            In 1802, at age 28, she entered the Augustine convent at

            other spiritual manifestations disturbed her more serene
            sisters. When the convent closed in 1812, she found refuge
            in the house of a poor widow. She became bedridden in 1813,
            and began to show stigmata such as crosses on her breast and
            the wounds of Christ. In 1817, a scrupulous investigation by

            ago, the Abbess Hildegard, founder of the Benedictine
            convents at Bingen and Eibingen, predicted such events as
            the coming of Protestantism, the fall of the Holy Roman
            Empire, the diminution of both the spiritual and temporal
            powers of the Holy See, and the universal secularization of
            Church property. Three popes, two emperors, and many
            bishops, saints, and common people sought advice from "The
            Sibyl of the Rhine".</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">She
            was born in 1098 at Bockelheim. When Hildegard was 8 years
            old, her parents placed her in the care of a recluse nun,
            and she remained in the service of God for the rest of her
            life. While still a child, she began to have beatific
            visions:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Up
            to my fifteenth year I saw much, and related some of the
            things seen to others, who would inquire with astonishment,
            whence such things might come. ... Frequently, I my
            conversations, I would relate future things which I saw as
            if present, but, noting the amazement of my listeners, I
            became more reticent."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">When
            she was about 40 years old, Hildegard received a spiritual
            command to publish her visions for the world to share. Her
            best known work, <i>Scrivias</i>, (ca. 1145) is a record of
            26 visions. Like many other prophets, Hildegard foresaw the
            decline of the Church and the rise of Antichrist, whose
            career she described in detail:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"The
            time is coming when princes and people will renounce the
            authority of the Pope. Individual countries will prefer
            their own Church rulers to the Pope. The German Empire will
            be divided. Church property will be secularized. Priests
            will be persecuted. After the birth of Antichrist heretic
            will preach their false doctrines undisturbed, resulting in
            Christians having doubts about their holy Catholic faith."</font></font>

            of the world, mankind will be purified through sufferings.
            This will be true especially of the clergy, who will be
            robbed of all property. When the clergy has adopted a simple
            manner of living, conditions will improve.</font></font> </p>

            stricken with great fear. After that there will be so few
            men left that seven women will fight for one man, that they
            will say to the man: "Marry me to take the disgrace from
            me." For in those days it will be a disgrace for a woman to
            be without child, as it was by the Jews in the Old

will
come







            a time when war will break out, more terrible than all other
            wars combined, which have ever visited mankind. A horrible
            warrior will unleash it, and his adversaries will call him
            Antichrist. All nations of the earth will fight each other
            in this war. The fighters will rise up to the heavens to
            take the stars and throw them on the cities, to set ablaze
            the buildings and to cause immense devastations. Oceans will
            lie between the great warriors, and the monsters of the sea,
            terrified by everything that happens on or under the sea,
            will flee to the deep. Battles of the past will only be
            skirmishes compared to the battles that will take place,
            since blood will flow in all directions. The earth will
            shake from the violent fighting. Famine and pestilence will
            join the war. The nations will then cry "Peace, peace", but
            there will be no peace. Thrice will the sun rise over the
            heads of the combatants, without having been seen by them.
            But afterwards there will be peace, and all who have broken
            peace will have lost their lives. On a single day more men
            will have lost been killed than the catacombs of Rome have
            ever held. Pyres will be erected greater than the
            greatestcity, and people will ascend the highest mountains
            to praise God, and nobody will want to make war anymore.
            Strange signs will appear in the skies: both horns of the
            moon will join the cross. Happy will be those who will have
            survived the war, since the pleasures of life will begin
            again, and the sun will have a new brilliance...</font></font>

            over his evil customs. Men will set themselves one against
            the other and at the end will want to re-establish order.
            Some will try to do so, but this will not succeed and thus
            will end up even worse off than before! But if things will
            have reached the summit and if the hand of man can no longer
            do anything, it will be put in the hands of Him, who can
            send down a punishment so terrible that it will not have

            Italian Trinitarian tertiary and mystic Anna Maria Taigi was
            born in Sienna on 1769; she died in Rome in 1857. One day in
            the 1790s, a Servite priest who met her in the streets of
            Rome heard a voice within him telling him that she would be
            entrusted by God to his guidance and become a saint. Anna
            later went to that priest for confession after the birth her
            first child. Anna was the wife of a foul-tempered valet
            (Domenico Taigi), and raised their seven children and nursed
            her repulsively ill mother in a crowded house. Despite such
            circumstances, she was often in ecstasy and had prophetic
            gifts. A mystic sun surrounded by a crown of thorns appeared
            to her, and within it she foresaw distant events. However,
            she exercised her gift only when it was demanded by charity.
            She was consulted frequently by Popes Leo XII and Gregory

            be impossible. Only sacred candles can be lighted and will
            afford light. During this alarm, the faithful should stay in
            their houses and recite the Rosary and give Misericords to

            May 13, 1917, in a field called Cova da Iria near the
            Portuguese village of Fatima, "a beautiful lady from
            Heaven", shining like the sun and standing on a cloud over a
            beech tree, appeared to three children: Lucia Dos Santos
            (age 10) and her two cousins, Francisco (9) and Jacinta
            Marti (7). Lucia saw and heard the Madonna and spoke with
            her. Jacinta also saw and heard her, but did not speak, and
            Francisco only saw the Virgin. The radiant being spoke with
            the children for several minutes, and asked them to meet her
            again at the same place on the 13th of each month until
            October. Then, she promised, she would identify herself. <b>(4,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Madonna reappeared six times in all, and the reports of the
            events drew increasing crowds of spectators. About 50
            persons attended on June 13, and nearly 70,000 were present
            on October 13. Many witnesses saw a bright cloud over the
            beech tree, but only the three children could see and hear
            the woman.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">At
            the behest of a group of political activists and doubters
            who wished to "put an end to the nonsense," the civil
            prefect of Outrem seized, interrogated and threatened the
            children for two days in the hope of forcing a confession of
            fraud from them. Though the children had been prevented from
            meeting the Madonna on August 13, she appeared to them on
            August 19 at Valinhos, near the site of her first
            appearance. The Madonna then told them that she would appear
            a final time on October 13, and then produce a miracle.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">On
            that day the Madonna transmitted the prophecy known as the
            Secret of Our Lady of the Rosary. It was a rainy day, but
            newspaper journalists who were eyewitnesses reported that
            the rain stopped suddenly and the sun reappeared. In the
            words of A. Garret, a professor at Coimbra University, the
            sun looked like "a burnished wheel cut out of mother of
            pearl. This disc spun dizzily around... It whirled upon
            itself with mad rapidity, then advanced, blood red, towards
            the Earth, threatening to crush us with its weight."
            Terrified spectators fell to their knees in prayer. The sun
            returned to normal, then twice again repeated the prodigy.
            In addition, the rain-soaked clothes of the audience dried
            out during the brief time of the solar phenomenon.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Secret of Our Lady of the Rosary is a three-part prophecy
            that she ordered to be kept secret for 25 years or until the
            death of Lucia, whichever came first. Francisco and Jacinta
            died in the influenza pandemic that ravaged Europe in 1918
            and 1919. Lucia became a Dorothe Sister, and in 1948 she
            became a Barefoot Carmelite in a closed convent at Coimbra.
            Lucia learned to write, and recorded the text of the secret
            prophecy. This was kept in the Bishopric of Leiria until
            1943, when Pope Pius XII revealed the first two parts
            through the agency of Cardinal Schuster. The final, secret
            part of the prophecy was opened by Pope John XXIII and
            several cardinals in 1960, according to the Madonna's
            directions, but it was not revealed to the public. The first
            section is a vision of Hell. The second part predicts World
            War II. The following segment was published with Papal
            approval:</font></font> </p>

            will break out. When you see a night lit up by an unknown
            light, you will know that it the great sign that God gives
            you of the next punishment of the sins of the world with

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            June 1961, The Virgin Mary appeared to four young girls near
            the village of Garabandal in northwest Spain; she continued
            to visit them over four years. The apparition gave the girls
            numerous general lectures urging repentance, and foretold
            them of a miraculous sign that will appear some day. It is
            known that the event will occur between March-May 8-16 on a
            Thursday at 8:30 p.m. It will appear within a year of the
            Warning foretold by Our Lady of Fatima. The seer Conchita
            will know of the event 8 days in advance. It will happen on
            the feast day of a Eucharist martyr, and will coincide with
            a "great event" of the Catholic Church. The local bishop
            also will learn of the impending sign, and will allow
            priests to go to Garabandal. Conchita said this about the
            event:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">It
            will be visible to all those who are in the village and
            surrounding mountains; that the sick who are present will"
            be cured and the incredulous will believe. It will be the
            greatest miracle that Jesus will have performed for the
            world. There won't be the slightest doubt that it comes from
            God and that it is for the good of mankind. A sign of the
            Miracle, which it will be possible to film or televise, will
            remain forever."</font></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Irish archbishop St. Malachi (also known as Maelm Haedoc Va
            Morgair) was born in 1095 at Armaugh, Ireland. He died in
            1148. St. Malachi was gifted with miracles and prophecy. In
            1132 he succeeded to archbishopric of Armagh, but resigned
            in 1138 to take a journey to Rome to visit Pope Innocent
            III. En route, he visited St. Bernard (who later wrote St.
            Malachi's biography) at Clairvaux, France. There he wrote
            his famous prophecy predicting 112 individual Popes by name
            from Celestine II (1143-1144) to the very end of the Papacy.
            The Benedictine monk Arnold de Wion found the original
            manuscript in the library of the Vatican and included it in
            his book <i>Lignum Vitae</i> (1595). The series includes
            many accurate descriptions of the popes in two or three word
            phrases. Those of the 20th century are translated from Latin

            20 popes and actually names them. However, the names are not
            in accord since the ascension of Benedict XV in 1914. The
            Monk of Padua expected him to take the name of Paul VI, but

            Paul was poisoned with digitalis (to give the appearance of
            a heart attack) because he planned to press an investigation
            of the Vatican Bank's links to the Propaganda Due (P-2)
            Masonic Lodge and a network of front companies in Europe and
            South America, whereby millions of dollars were channeled
            for secret purposes. No autopsy was performed, and the body
            was quickly embalmed. The Pope also was preparing to
            liberalize the Church's position on birth control, and he
            planned to remove several high officials, among them

            hydra of error is cut off. This stroke will make the world
            and Hell beneath it tremble, but the world will be safe and
            all the good will rejoice. Keep your consultors always with

            will ever be your help, as in times past, so in the future

              Monarch ~</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">A
            large corpus of prophetic literature deals with a "Grand
            Monarch" and "Angelic Pope". Some critics have dismissed
            these as wishful thinking and political propaganda. Many
            such predictions are just that, but the consensus of these
            visionary scenarios, spread over a period of 1500 years, is
            remarkably consistent. Perhaps an interim of enlightened,
            absolutemonarchy would be an elegant solution to the crisis
            of leadership in modern times; it is a reasonable hope. No
            such characters are mentioned in Biblical prophecy, except
            perhaps in Daniel 12:1. Prophecies of the Grand Monarch
            began to appear within a few centuries after Christ, and
            served to support the notion of divine right of kings.
            However, he is not present on the stage of current affairs;
            perhaps he is waiting in the wings.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">During
the
12th







            century, the Papacy rose to its pinnacle as a universal
            religious authority and political power, in gross
            contradiction to the spiritual ideal of poverty and
            simplicity. The contrast between the opulent popes and the
            people's hopes for more saintly pontiffs gave rise to a
            powerful new apocalyptic dream of the "Pastor Angelicus"
            (Angelic Pope). There are no references to an enlightened
            Pope in the Bible, but he became a psychic necessity after
            the 13th century and has continued to manifest in prophecy
            since then.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Also
            during the 13th century, the Pope began to become identified
            with the Antichrist, and for good reason. For example, the
            inscription on the Pope's miter reads "VICARIUS FILII DEI"
            (Vicar of the Son of God). In the Latin gematria (according
            to which each letter has a numeric value), the inscription
            equals 666, the Number of the Beast in St. John's
            Revelation. The words "Mystery Babylon" and the Roman
            numerals DCLXVI (666) also appear on the Golden Carp hat
            which the Pope wears.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            idea of the Angelic Pope and the Antichrist-Pope caught on
            soon after the holy Benedictine hermit Peter Morrone was
            chosen as Pope (against his will) two years after the death
            of Nicholas IV in 1292. The cardinals could not agree on the
            successor, until Morrone was chosen "either by desperation
            or by revelation". He took the name Celestine V. The hermit
            was quite unfit for the arduous task of the Papacy and
            abdicated within six months. While acting as Pope, he built
            a hut for himself within the papal palace at Napoli and
            lived there in holy poverty. This gave rise to the popular
            opinion that he was the Angelic pope. His successor Boniface
            VIII (1294-1303) imprisoned Celestine V and was one of the
            worst men ever to hold papal office. This further inspired
            contemporary predictions of super-holy popes and the Great
            Monarch. Several of the following prophecies concern these
            characters.</font></font> </p>

            Cross-bearers shall reign and dominate holily over the world
            until the end of time... But when shall this take place?
            When crosses with the stigmas shall be seen, and the
            crucifix shall be carried as the standard... This standard
            will be admired by all good Catholics; but at the beginning
            it will be derided by bad Christians and by infidels. Their
            sneers shall, however, be changed into mourning when they
            shall witness the wonderful victories achieved through it
            against tyrants, heretics, and infidels... That man (the
            leader of the Crucifers) will be a great sinner in his
            youth, but like St. Paul he will be drawn and converted to
            God. He shall be the founder of a new religious order
            different from all the others. He shall divide it into three
            classes, namely: (1) Military knights, (2) Solitary priests,
            (3) most pious hospitalers. This shall be the last religious
            order of the Church, and it will do more good for our holy
            religion than all other religious institutes. By force of
            arms he shall take possession of a great kingdom. He shall
            destroy the sect of Mahomet, extirpate all tyrants and
            heresies. He shall bring the world to a more holy mode of
            life. There will be one fold and one Shepherd. He shall
            reign until the end of time. In the whole earth there shall
            be only twelve kings, one emperor, one pope. Rich gentlemen
            shall be few, but all saints."</font></font> </p>

            "forest-prophet" Mathias Lang (also known as Muhlhias and
            Stormberger) lived in Bavaria from 1753 to 1820. Lang could
            not read or write, so his predictions went far beyond his
            educational horizon when he spoke of telephones,
            electricity, railroads, airplanes, and the atomic bomb.
            People mocked Lang during his lifetime, but history has
            proven the accuracy of many of his predictions, such as this
            one, made before thefirst World War:</font></font> </p>

            hound" is less clear, but the "wagon without horse and
            shaft" is of course the automobile. The "silver fish" is a
            fair description of the Zeppelin, which flew over the

            march the invaders, the "red caps." The region Lang spoke of
            was so wild and inhospitable at that time that Lang's
            contemporaries could not imagine anyone living in that area,
            let along building a road there. Yet in 1972, construction
            was begun on a road over Pragel Pass, and today we can be
            certain that Lang was referring to Russians as the "Red"
            invaders. <b>(3, 5)</b></font></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"In
            the year when the war begins, it was possible to bring the
            corn in already, but not the wheat. Before this war there
            will be a time of general disloyalty; men will take evil for
            goodness and honor, deceit for politeness... There will be a
            general collapse of the fiber of society. This war will
            begin in the East. The war will break out very quickly. In
            the evening, one will want to say "Peace, Peace," but there
            is no peace, and in the morning the enemy will be at the
            door and all will resound with the din of war. It will last
            but a few days, and those who can hide for a few days will
            be safe. Also, the pull-out will be quite fast. One throws
            wheels and carriages into the water or the fleeing enemy
            will take everything with them. The people of over half the
            world will stand against each other. God will scare the two
            enemies with all His might. Only a few Russians will be able

            will not be involved, but however the Spaniards will invade
            the areas and help to reestablish order with the churches.
            Austria will be spared; in fact, it will be pretty good
            there. The Roman Chair will stand empty for some time...
            This will not however be a war of religion, but all who
            believe in Jesus Christ will have a common cause... A
            principal sign of the times in which the war will break out
            will be the general indifference in matters of religion and
            the general corruption of mores in many places. At that time

            Armsberger Wood. Another battle will be fought near the Ruhr

            war will break out again in Alsace. I saw the French in
            Alsace with Strasbourg at their rear, and I saw Italians
            fighting with them. Suddenly great transports of troops
            arrived from the French side. A two-day battle ended with
            the defeat of the Prussian army. The French pursued the
            Prussians over the Rhine in many directions. In a second
            battle at Frankfurt, the Prussians lost again and retired as
            far as Siegburg, where they joined a Russian army. The
            Russians made common cause with the Prussians. It seemed to
            me as if the Austrians were aiding the French. The battle at
            Siegburg was more horrible than any before and its like will
            never occur again. After some days the Prussians and
            Russians retreated and crossed, below Bonn, to the left bank
            of the Rhine. Steadily pressed by their opponents, they
            retired to Cologne, which had been bombarded so much that
            only one-fourth of the city remained intact. Constantly in
            retreat, the remainder of the Prussian army moved to
            Westphalia, where the last battle went against them. The

            a new emperor, about 40 years old, was elected in Germany,
            and he met the Pope. Meanwhile, an epidemic broke out in the
            region devastated by the war, and many people died. After
            the battle in Westphalia, the French returned to their own
            country, and from then on there was peace between the French
            and the Germans. Industry and trade prospered, and many
            convents were founded. All the exiles returned to their
            homes. When I begged God to take the terrible vision away, I
            heard a voice saying: "Prussia must be humiliated and in a
            manner that it never again will bring sorrow to the Church."
            In the following year the Russians will war with the Turks,
            driving the latter out of Europe and seizing Constantinople.
            The new German Emperor will mobilize for war but the Germans
            will not go beyond their border. When afterward I was shown
            France and Germany I shuddered at the depopulation that had
            taken place. Soon after the Russo-Turkish War, England also
            will be visited by war."</font></font> </p>
