      <b>O Future</b>, how do we know Thee ? Let me count the ways:
      Aeromancy, alectryo-, alcuro-, alphito-, anthraco-, arithmo-, etc.
      -- some 72 -mancies are listed in <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>
      (543.15, Forms of Divination) , plus astrology, augury, dowsing,
      phrenology, palmistry, dreams, and more et ceteras.<br>
      <br>
      As humanity slouches toward Bethlehem, Mecca, or Wherever, we
      predict the future with every move we make. For example, it's a
      lucky guess when you hazards that nobody will run the red light
      while your body is in the crosswalk. If you do get hit, maybe it's
      because you ignored or misread the psychic warning, or "karma".<br>
      <br>
      Prophecy usually has religious associations because seems to be
      supernatural. Most Westerners are familiar with Bible prophecy,
      which is ubiquitous in Europe and America, and well-known
      everywhere else. <br>
      <br>
      It obviously drives the death wish of many millions of people who
      otherwise appear to be averagely "sane".<br>
      <br>
      The Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastran, Baha'i and other religions of the
      Far East also have accumulated a considerable corpus of
      communiques from the future. Most of them present an ugly end to
      this era of errors, with a miraculous positive outcome, thanks to
      individual and collective enlightenment, and super-heroic saviors.<br>
      <br>
      The Japanese yearn for the arrival of Miroku Bants / Rigden Japo.
      The Altai call him the White Burkhan and Oirot (Messenger). Hindus
      anticipate the advent of the Kalki Avatar and Maitreya.
      Zoroastrans call him Saohsyant. Tibetans expect Gessar Khan to
      save them from China.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Hindu Prophecy</b><br>
      <br>
      Hindu cosmology claims that the universe is cyclical, passing
      through four Yugas (world ages), each of which is shorter and less
      pleasant than the previous epoch due to the degeneration of
      morality. Nowadays we are in the last, the Kala Yuga, in which
      dharma (correct behavior), is only one-fourth of its beginning
      quality. At its end, religion will disintegrate and society will
      become more secular. When the world becomes hopelessly degenerate,
      it will end in catastrophe and a new Mahayuga (Great Yuga) will
      begin. <br>
      <br>
      One thousand yugas is one day in the life of Brahma, the Hindu
      godhead. At the end of each day, the universe comes to an end and
      is resorbed into Brahma for an equally long night, during which
      time it exists only potentially. He reappears at dawn, and
      creation begins anew. The present age is the first day of the 51st
      year of Brahma’s life.<br>
      <br>
      Some scholars claim that the Kala Yuga began in 3012 BC and is 4.3
      million years long. If so, we have a relatively long wait ahead of
      us. Many people nevertheless believe that the Kalki (White Horse)
      Avatar, the tenth and final incarnation of Vishnu, will arrive any
      millenium now. The heavens will open and he will appear on his
      white horse with his sword "blazing like a comet". He will destroy
      the wicked and restore purity. Entire continents will sink and
      rise in the process.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The <i>Vishnu Purana</i> (4: 24) also advises us concerning the
      conditions this time:<br>
      <blockquote>"The leaders who will rule over the earth will be
        violent and will seize the goods of their subjects. The caste of
        servants will prevail and the outcasts will rule. Short will be
        their lives, insatiable their appetites; they will hardly
        understand the meaning of piety. Those with possessions will
        abandon agriculture and commerce and will live as servants or
        following various possessions. The leaders, with excuses of
        fiscal need, will rob and despoil their subjects and take away
        private property. Moral values and the rule of law will lessen
        from day to day until the world will be completely perverted and
        agnosticism will gain the day among men.<br>
        <br>
        "The causes of devotion will be confined to physical well-being;
        the only bond between the sexes will be passion; the only road
        to success will be the lie. The earth will be honored for its
        material treasure only. <br>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>"The priestly vestments will be a substitute for the
        quality of the priest. A simple ablution will mean purification,
        the race will be incapable of producing divine birth. Men will
        ask: what authority have the traditional tests? Marriage will
        cease being a rite. Acts of devotion, however scanty, will not
        produce any result. Every way of life will be equally
        promiscuous for all. Those who own and spend more money will be
        the bosses of men who will have only one aim, the gaining of
        wealth however dishonestly. Every man will consider himself as
        good as a Brahmin. Men will be terrified of death and fear
        scarcity; by this alone they will keep up an outward appearance
        of religious feeling. Women will not obey the orders of their
        husbands or their parents. They will be selfish, abject, liars,
        fallen and given to evil ways. Their aims in life will be
        sensual satisfaction only.<br>
        <br>
        "When... the close of the Kali age shall be nigh, a portion of
        that divine being who exists of his own spiritual nature in the
        character of Brahma, and who is the beginning and the end, and
        who comprehends all things, shall descend upon the earth. He
        will be born as Kalki in the family of an eminent Brahmin of
        Sambhala village, endowed with the eight superhuman faculties.
        By his irresistible might he will destroy all the barbarians and
        thieves, and all whose minds are devoted to iniquity. He will
        then reestablish righteousness upon earth; and the minds of
        those who live at the end of the Kali age shall be awakened, and
        shall be as pellucid as crystal. The men who are thus changed by
        virtue of that peculiar time shall be as the seeds of human
        beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws
        of the Krita age, the Age of Purity."<br>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <b>Maitreya</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Buddhist Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) revolves in cycles like
      the Hindu yugas. According to the <i>Maitreyavyankarna</i>
      (Prophecy of Maitreya), Buddha will incarnate as Lord Maitreya
      (The Buddha Who Returns) at the end of the present cycle after
      major geological catastrophes have changed the planet so much that
      he can walk from continent to continent. During his reign,
      humanity will attain salvation, and even the gods will be
      liberated from their desires.<br>
      <br>
      Krishna explained the job description to Bharata Prince Arjuna,
      recorded in the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> (4:7-8) :<br>
      <blockquote>"Whenever there is decay of righteousness... and there
        is exaltation of unrighteousness, then I Myself come
        forth...&nbsp; for the destruction of evil-doers, for the sake
        of firmly establishing righteousness, I am born from age to
        age."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Gautama Buddha told his disciple Sariputta of the signs that
      precede the end of this ages, recorded in the <i>Surangama Sutra</i>:<br>
      <blockquote>"After my decease, first will occur the five
        disappearances. And what are the five disappearances?&nbsp; The
        disappearance of attainments [to Nirvana], the disappearance of
        the method [of doing so], the disappearance of [spiritual]
        learning, the disappearance of the symbols [of Buddhism], the
        disappearance of the relics... Then when the Dispensation of the
        perfect Buddha is 5,000 years old, the relics, not receiving
        reverence and honor will go to places where they can receive
        them...<br>
        <br>
        "Maitreya, the best of men, will then leave the Tushita heavens,
        and go for his last rebirth.&nbsp; As soon as he is born he will
        walk seven steps forward, and where he puts down his feet a
        jewel or a lotus will spring up.&nbsp; He will raise his eyes to
        the ten directions, and will speak these words: 'This is my last
        birth.&nbsp; There will be no rebirth after this one.&nbsp;
        Never will I come back here, but, all pure, I shall win
        Nirvana."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Buddha also said: <br>
      <blockquote>"At that period, brethren, there will arise in the
        world an Exalted One named Maitreya, Fully Awakened, abounding
        in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds,
        unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher
        for gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha, even as I am
        now.&nbsp; He, by himself, will thoroughly know and see, as it
        were face to face, this universe, with Its worlds of the
        spirits, Its Brahmas and Its Maras, and Its world of recluses
        and Brahmins, of princes and peoples, even as I now, by myself,
        thoroughly know and see them."<br>
        <br>
        "And the Blessed One said to Ananda, I am not the first Buddha,
        nor shall I be the last. In due time another Buddha will arise
        in the world, a Holy One, a supremely enlightened one, endowed
        with wisdom, auspicious, embracing the Universe, an incomparable
        Leader of Men, a Ruler of Devas and mortals. He will reveal to
        you the same eternal truths, which I have taught you. He will
        establish His Law, glorious in its spirit and in the letter. He
        will proclaim a righteous life wholly perfect and pure, such as
        I now proclaim. His disciples will number many thousands while
        mine number many hundreds.’<br>
        <br>
        "Ananda said, ‘How shall we know Him?’<br>
        <br>
        "The Blessed One said, ‘He will be known as Maitreya.’<br>
      </blockquote>
      The sacred text <i>Anagatavamsa</i> records the sage Sariputta
      question to Buddha Arahant concerning the future Buddha. He was
      told:<br>
      <blockquote>"I am now the perfect Buddha; and there will be
        Maitreya too before this same auspicious aeon runs to the end of
        its years. The perfect Buddha, Maitreya by name, supreme of
        men."<br>
      </blockquote>
      On another occasion when Sariputta asked after Maitreya, Buddha
      answered:<br>
      <blockquote>"At that time, the ocean will lose much of its water,
        and there will be much less of it than now. In consequence a
        world-ruler will have no difficulties in passing across it.
        India, this island of Jambu, will be quite flat everywhere, it
        will measure ten thousand leagues, and all men will have the
        privilege of living on it. It will have innumerable inhabitants,
        who will commit no crimes or evil deeds, but will take pleasure
        in doing good... Human beings are then without any blemishes,
        moral offenses are unknown among them, and they are full of zest
        and joy. Their bodies are very large and their skin has a fine
        hue. Their strength is quite extraordinary. Three kinds of
        illness only are known --- people must relieve their bowels,
        they must eat, they must get old...<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        "For 60,000 years Maitreya, the best of men, will preach the
        true Dharma, which is compassionate towards all living beings.
        And when he has disciplined in his true Dharma hundreds and
        hundreds of millions of living beings, then that leader will at
        last enter Nirvana. And after the great sage has entered
        Nirvana, his true Dharma still endured for another 10,000
        years..."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Many people have claimed to be Maitreya. Since the 1980s, a
      claimant calling himself Maitreya has been offering himself to the
      world from London. He was born in 1944 in Iran, and claims to be a
      descendant of the Iranian king Nader Shad. His apologists offer
      numerous prophetic "proofs" of his authenticity. He forgot to walk
      and talk at birth, however, and apostatic lotuses neglect to
      sprout in his footsteps.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Aghartha</b><br>
      <br>
      For many centuries the Tibetans have attested to the reality of
      mystical Aghartha and its ruler, the King of the World. Many
      people believe Aghartha to be a real place, a hidden civilization
      located in a series of huge caverns under Tibet and Mongolia, with
      secret entrances all over the earth. It is also known as
      Shamballa.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever the King of the World makes prophecies, the birds and
      animals on the surface suddenly become silent. Hundreds of years
      ago, the King of the World uttered a prophecy that pertains to the
      present state of human society:<br>
      <blockquote>"Men will increasingly neglect their souls. The
        greatest corruption will reign on earth. Men will become like
        bloodthirsty animals, thirsting for the blood of their brothers.
        The crescent [Islam] will become obscured, and its followers
        will descend into lies and perpetual warfare. The crowns of
        kings will fall.<br>
        <br>
        "There will be terrible war between all the earth's peoples;
        entire nations will die --- hunger, crimes unknown to law,
        formerly unthinkable to the world. The persecuted will demand
        the attention of the whole world. The ancient roads will be
        filled with multitudes going from one place to another. The
        greatest and most beautiful cities will perish by fire. Families
        will be dispersed; faith and love will disappear. The world will
        be emptied.<br>
        <br>
        "Within 50 years there will be only three great nations. Then,
        within 50 years, there will be 18 years of war and cataclysms.
        Then the peoples of Agharti will leave their subterranean
        caverns and will appear on the surface of the earth."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Another prophecy of Shambhala states that each of its 32 kings
      will rule for 100 years. While they reign, conditions in the
      outside world will deteriorate. Men will fight more and more wars,
      seek power for its own sake, and materialism will reign. These
      modern barbarians will unite under an evil king and conquer the
      earth. When they think that nothing is left to conquer, the mystic
      mist will evaporate to reveal Shambhala. The huge army of
      barbarians will attack Shambhala. King Rudra Cakrin will lead the
      fight against the invaders, who will be destroyed in a final great
      battle.<br>
      <br>
      Nicholas Roerich, who traveled in Asia during the 1920s,
      transmitted this Tibetan prophecy of the end of the present era:<br>
      <blockquote>"First will begin an unprecedented war of nations.
        Afterwards brother will rise against brother. Oceans of blood
        shall flow. And the people shall cease to understand one
        another. They shall forget the meaning of the word teacher. But
        just then shall the Teachers appear and in all the corners of
        the world shall be heard the true teaching. To this word of
        truth shall the people be drawn, but those who are filled with
        darkness and ignorance shall set obstacles. As a diamond glows
        the light in the tower of the Lord of Shambhala. One stone on
        his ring is worth more than all the world's treasure. Even those
        who by accident help the Teachings of Shambhala will receive in
        return a hundredfold. Already many warriors of the truth are
        reincarnated. Only a few years shall elapse before everyone
        shall hear the mighty steps of the Lord of the New Era. And one
        can already perceive the unusual manifestations and encounter
        unusual people. Already they open the gates of knowledge and
        ripened fruits are falling from the trees..." <br>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <b>Mahatma Ghandhi</b><br>
      <br>
      Shortly before he was assassinated, Mahatma Mohandas Ghandhi
      (1869-1948) made a generic forewarning of our imminent doom or
      destiny:<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Mankind is approaching hard times, because as soon as
        the measure of its sins will be full, it will be called to
        account by the superior power above us. You may call this event
        as you wish: Judgment day, final settlement, or doomsday. It
        will come, most likely, very soon. Whoever will survive this
        settlement will see an entirely new earthly existence
        manifested. For a long, very long time the world war will be
        crossed out from the dictionary of mankind, perhaps even for all
        time. Christmas, the festival of Christianity, will be accepted
        by all religions as the true festival of Peace. Blessed be, who
        will live to see this epoch!"<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><br>
      <b>Zarathustra</b><br>
      <br>
      The Zoroastran religion of the Persians arose circa the 7th
      century BC, and perhaps several centuries earlier. Zoroaster ( AKA
      Zarathustra ) taught that the primary deity is Ahura-Mazda, whose
      opponent Anghra Mainyu proposed the <i>Druj</i> ("The Lie") to
      test believers. Though closely matched in power, Ahura Mazda will
      eventually overcome Anghra Mainyu.<br>
      <br>
      Zoroastrans also believe in cosmic cycles of time lasting 12,000
      years and divided into 3,000-year epochs. At this time we are in
      the second epoch, the "Time of Mixture", which refers to the
      interaction of good and evil. Zoroastrans await the birth of a
      Saoshyant (savior) who is now overdue.<br>
      <br>
      Believe it or not, when Zoroaster died, his sperm was miraculously
      preserved in Iran’s Lake Kansaoya. In due time the sperm will
      impregnate a girl who is swimming there, and she will give birth
      to three sons. <br>
      <br>
      The first will be Ukhshyat-ereta (He who makes righteousness
      grow); later he will be called Hoshedarmah. One millennium later,
      Ukhshyat-nemah (He who makes reverence grow) will be born, to be
      followed 1,000 years later by Astavat-ereta (Righteous world), who
      will oversee the end of time.<br>
      <br>
      Chapter 3 of the Zoroastran text <i>Zand-i Vohuman Yasht</i>
      contains very lengthy prophecies about the later days of this era.
      Here are some fragments:<br>
      <blockquote>"And at that time, O Zartosht the Spitaman, all men
        will become deceivers, great friends will become of different
        parties, and respect, affection, hope, and regard for the soul
        will depart from the world; the affection of the father will
        depart from the son; and that of the brother from his brother;
        the son-in-law will become a beggar from his father-in-law, and
        the mother will be parted and estranged from the daughter.<br>
        <br>
        "When it is the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, O Zartosht
        the Spitaman, the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year,
        month, and day are shorter; and the earth of Spandarmad is more
        barren, and fuller of highwaymen; and the crop will not yield
        the seed, so that of the crop of the corn-fields in ten cases
        seven will diminish and three will increase, and that which
        increases does not become ripe; and vegetation, trees, and
        shrubs will diminish; when one shall take a hundred, ninety will
        diminish and ten will increase, and that which increases gives
        no pleasure and flavor.<br>
        <br>
        "And men are born smaller, and their skill and strength are
        less; they become more deceitful and more given to vile
        practices; they have no gratitude and respect for bread and
        salt, and they have no affection for their country...<br>
        <br>
        "And... in those last times dead matter and bodily refuse become
        so abundant, that one who shall set step to step walks upon dead
        matter;..<br>
        <br>
        "The sovereignty will come from those leather-belted ones and
        Arabs and Rumans to them, and they will be so misgoverning that
        when they kill a righteous man who is virtuous and a fly, it is
        all one in their eyes...<br>
        <br>
        "And their eyes of avarice are not sated with wealth, and they
        form hoards of the world's wealth, and conceal them underground;
        and through wickedness they commit sodomy, hold much intercourse
        with menstruous women, and practice many unnatural lusts.<br>
        <br>
        "And in that perplexing time the night is brighter, and the
        year, month, and day will diminish one-third; the earth of
        Spandarmad arises, and suffering, death, and destitution become
        more severe in the world...<br>
        <br>
        "In that millennium of Aushedar-mah mankind become so versed in
        medicine, and keep and bring physic and remedies so much in use,
        that when they are confessedly at the point of death they do not
        thereupon die, nor when they smite and slay them with the sword
        and knife."<br>

      The Zoroastran text <i>Bundahishn</i> (Creation) states that in
      the millennium of the first Saoshyant Hoshedarmah, people will
      stop eating meat, then milk, then vegetables, then water, until
      they stop eating altogether for ten years before he manifests.
      During his lifetime, Ahura-Mazda will resurrect the dead during a
      period of 57 years. Then the final judgment will be convened by
      the Sadvastaran (Righteous Judges), who will separate the good and
      evil. The righteous souls will enter heaven, and the wicked will
      go to hell for three days. Then a huge comet named Gochihr will
      strike the planet, and the resulting heat will "melt the metal of
      Sharewar" ("Chosen power", a spirit with power over metals):<br>
      <blockquote>"In the final war between good and evil, fire and
        death will swirl over all, and every man will have to pass
        through boiling lava. To the just and righteous men, the lava
        will be as warm as milk, but to the wicked men, it will be
        scalding and fatal."<br>

      Then all humanity will be reunited, and all will receive an elixir
      that will give them immortality. Afficionados of Bible prophecy
      may notice a similarity to the White Stone promised to "he who
      overcomes" in the Revelation of John. And finally, Ahura-Mazda
      will defeat the evil Anghra Mainyu.<br>

      Chapter 9 of <i>Jamasp Namak</i> (The Book of Jamasp) recounts 16
      signs of the times for King Vishtasp, thus:<br>
      <blockquote>"...When the time of Aushedar would appear, these
        several signs shall necessarily appear. The first is this, that
        the nights will be brighter. The second is this, that Haptoiring
        (a star in the Bear constellation) will leave its place and will
        turn in the direction of Khorasan. The third is this, that the
        intercourse of persons one with another, will be great. The
        fourth is this, that the breach of faith, which they will make
        at that time, will have quicker and greater results. The fifth
        is this, that mean persons will be more powerful. The sixth is
        this, that wicked persons will be virtuous. The seventh is this,
        that the Drujs (evil powers) will be more oppressive. The eighth
        is this, that the magic and tricks which they will perform in
        those times, will be very bad. The ninth is this, that the
        noxious creatures, like the tigers, the wolves, and four clawed
        animals will do great harm. The tenth is this, that misinformed
        persons will commit great oppression upon the Dasturs of
        religion. The eleventh is this, that the injury to the Dasturs
        of religion will be unlawful; they will take their property by
        force and will speak evil of them. The twelfth is this, that the
        blowing of the summer and winter winds shall not be useful. The
        thirteenth is this, that affection for pleasure will be
        prevalent. The fourteenth is this, that those who arc born at
        that time will reach death more in a miserable way and in
        untimely way . The fifteenth is this, that respectable persons
        in spite of their respectful position, will practice too much of
        untruthfulness, injustice, and false evidence. Death, old age,
        unchecked pride, and strength will overtake all countries. Then
        there will come the Dastur of the world. The apostle will
        cleanse the whole country. The sixteenth is this, that the two
        caves which are in Seistan will be destroyed and the seas of the
        cities will carry away the water and the whole of Seistan will
        be full of water."<br>

      <b>Baha'i Prophecy</b><br>
      <br>
      The Persian Baha'i faith was founded in the late 19th century by
      Mirza Husayn Ali of Nur, AKA Baha'u'llah (The Glory of God). The
      Baha'i expect The Seventh Angel, who will appear sometime before
      the year of Mustageth (2001 AD -- oops!) at the end of this age.
      Abdul-Baha describes him in the book, <i>Some Answered Questions</i>:<br>
      <blockquote>"When the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly
        appear that which will cause the limbs of mankind to
        quake.&nbsp; Then and only then will the Divine Standard be
        unfurled, and the Nightingale of Paradise warble its melody...
        The Seventh Angel is a man qualified with heavenly attributes,
        who will arise with heavenly qualities and character... And that
        universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual
        power, not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and
        tranquility, not by the sword and arms; He will promote these
        divine teachings by kindness and righteousness, and not by
        weapons and harshness... <br>
      </blockquote>
      The contentions of races, the differences of religions, and the
      barriers between nations will be completely removed, and all will
      attain perfect union and reconciliation under the shadow of the
      Blessed Tree."<br>
      <br>
