      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0"><b>PROPHECIES</b>
            are memories of possible futures, echoing across time and
            space. Prophecy is a proven talent of the human mind --- one
            that baffles our notions of time, fate, and free will. The
            future is revealed to us through dreams, drugs, religious
            epiphany, magical rituals and the mantic arts. If a
            predicted event does not occur, then the seer has
            misinterpreted the psychic impression or was hallucinating.
            But false prophecies do not disprove or discredit the many
            that have been fulfilled. Indeed, many major events have
            been foretold with astonishing accuracy. Prophecy has
            exerted a powerful influence on the course of history. Many
            great persons, such as Alexander the Great, Julius and
            Augustus Caesar, and George Washington, were gifted with
            prophecy.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Hundreds
of
ancient






            and modern prophets have given accounts of their visions.
            Many of them are concerned with global catastrophes in the
            "near future". Although no prophet has been 100% accurate,
            many of the seers represented here have made short-and
            long-term predictions that were fulfilled during and after
            their lifetimes. Considering the established credibility of
            these visionaries, their warnings of impending doom deserve
            our close attention. It behooves us to know the signs of the
            times, to recognize the shadows that great events cast
            before them. Prophecies can help guide some of us out of
            harm's way when "insanity will attack the spirit of man and
            unrestrained hate shall rage." In any event, with grace,
            courage and love, some of us will survive to live in peace
            at long last.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Time
            is running out for these prophecies to be fulfilled or
            annulled. It is not too late to heed the warnings and
            prevent some disasters. The outcome of events can be
            modified by right action, unless and until it is too late.
            Prophecies also can be misunderstood and misused, and yet
            prove to be historically effective, though not in the ways
            we might expect. Prophecies often tend to be
            self-fulfilling, a kind of deathwish that derives power from
            feedback between people and circumstances. The Delphic
            Oracle of Apollo is an excellent example of this process.</font></font>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            utterances of the Greek Oracles of Dodona and of Apollo at
            Delphi were gospel in their time, and guided the course of
            Greek and Roman history for several centuries. The Delphic
            Oracle was located on Mount Parnassus. There the virgin
            priestesses, called Pythia, uttered ecstatic prophecies
            during an elaborate ritual that included chewing the leaf of
            a sacred bay tree and drinking from the holy fountain
            Kassotis that flowed from Omphalos, "the navel of the the
            earth." The Pythia sat on a tripod over a fissure in the
            cavern Adyton, and breathed the vapors arising from the
            abyss. The fumes induced a trance in them, and they
            proceeded to pronounce (or more often mumble incoherently)
            messages that were interpreted by attendant priests, who
            conveyed their translations to the supplicants. Socrates
            declared:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Such
prophecy
is






            akin to madness, but it is a madness which is the special
            gift of heaven, and the source of the chiefest blessings
            among men. For prophecy is a madness, and the prophetess at
            Delphi and the priestesses of Dodona, when out of their
            senses have conferred great benefits to Hellas, both in
            public and private life, but when their senses were few or
            none."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Oracle at Delphi was enriched with gifts from grateful
            supplicants who worshipped and propitiated Apollo and his
            oracle with beautiful temples and fountains, a theater and
            stadium, thousands of marble, bronze and gold statues, and
            many other gifts of exquisite workmanship. The Roman author
            Cicero wrote, "Never could the oracle of Delphi have been so
            overwhelmed with significant presents from all kings and
            nations had not the ages proven the truth of its oracle."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Heraclitus
wrote,






            "The god of Delphi neither revealeth, nor concealeth, but
            hinteth." However, while most of its advice was given in
            ambiguous terms, the Delphic Oracle also gave exact answers
            on occasion. Both types of response were exemplified in the
            case of Croesus, King of Lydia (6th century BC). The
            immensely wealthy monarch was concerned about the threat
            posed by Cyrus the Elder, King of Persia and Babylon.
            Seeking divine counsel, King Croesus tested several of the
            most eminent oracles of his time: Zeus Ammon in Libya,
            Dudyma near Miletus, Amphiarus and Trophonia in Boeotia,
            Zeus Dodona in Epirus, and Abae and Delphi in Phoeis.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Only
            the Delphic Oracle correctly answered the test question
            posed by Croesus: What was King Croesus engaged in at the
            moment of the query (which was on the hundredth day since
            they had departed from Sardis)? The Phytia answered thus: "I
            can count the sands and I can measure the Ocean, I have ears
            for the silent, and know what the dumb man meaneth. Lo, on
            my sense there striketh the smell of shell-covered tortoise,
            boiling now in fire with the flesh of lamb in a cauldron,
            brass in the vessel below and brass the cover of it."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            messengers returned to Sardis and reported the Pythia's
            answer, which was completely correct and satisfactory to
            Croesus.<b> </b>The king then made a huge sacrificial
            offering to Apollo and presented the Oracle with many
            priceless gifts. He asked, "Whether Croesus should march
            against the Persians, and if so, whether he should join
            himself with any army of men as his friends."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Oracle replied, "After crossing the Halys, Croesus will
            destroy a great empire." Croesus also inquired if he would
            have a long reign, to which the Pythia answered, "Nay, when
            a mule becometh king of Medes, flee, soft-soled Lydian, by
            pebbly Hermus, and stay not, nor feel shame to be a coward."
            This answer did not please Croesus, but since it seemed
            impossible for a mule to be king, he did not worry about it.
            Finally, he asked about his deaf-mute son. The Oracle
            replied: "Son of Lydia, ruler of men, Croesus, thou prince
            of fools, desire not to hear in thy halls the voice long
            prayed for of a son speaking. He will speak first on a day
            that is not propitious."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">This
            last answer disappointed Croesus, but encouraged by the
            first, he formed an alliance with Sparta and mounted an army
            against Cyrus the Great. Croesus crossed the river Halys to
            invade Cappadocia, but withdrew to his own capitol at Sardis
            after a fierce battle at Pteria. Croesus then disbanded his
            army, but Cyrus followed him with the Persian army and
            besieged Sardis, which soon fell.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Pythia's
prophecy
thus






            became clear. Croesus did indeed destroy a great empire ---
            his own. And a "mule" did become monarch of Media insofar as
            Cyrus was born of mixed parentage, as are mules; his mother
            was a princess of Media, and his father was a Persian. The
            third prophecy was fulfilled when a Persian soldier attacked
            Croesus without recognizing him. Croesus' deaf-mute son
            suddenly cried out, "Man, do not kill Croesus!"</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Soon
            after becoming Emperor of Rome in 54 AD, Nero killed his
            mother, then went vacationing in Greece. When he visited the
            Oracle at Delphi, the Pythia shouted angrily at Nero:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Your
presence
here






            outrages the god you seek. Go back, matricide! The number 73
            marks the hour of your downfall!"</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Nero
            was infuriated and had the Pythia buried alive in the sacred
            cavern, along with the bodies of the temple priests after
            their hands and feet had been chopped off.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Nero
            thought the number 73 would be his age at death. He was only
            30 years old then, so he did not worry about it. Actually,
            the number related to Galba, who was 73 years old when he
            succeeded Nero in 68 AD.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Before
he






            came to rule the Roman Empire, Hadrian visited the Delphic
            Oracle and drank from the sacred fountain Kassotis. Thus he
            learned firsthand of his destiny. After he reached the
            throne, Hadrian ordered the fountain to be plugged up to
            prevent anyone else from getting the same idea from the same
            source.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Emperor
Julian
had






            the blockage removed during his reign (361-363 AD) because
            he believed it should be available to everyone. He said:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Through
the
Oracles






            of Apollo, the greater part of civilization had come into
            being because they had revealed the will of the gods in the
            sphere of politics, as well as religion, which they
            regulated wisely for those who kept their advice."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Delphic Oracle endured until 390 AD, when Emperor Theodosius
            closed the temple; his successor, Arcadius, demolished it.</font></font>

            priests of ancient Egypt were powerful magicians who
            practised the mantic arts for the kings and pharoahs and
            accurately predicted the course of Egypt's dynastic history.
            The rulers also occasionally received advice directly from
            the gods.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">For
            example, about 1420 BC, when Thutmose IV was still a prince
            and had uncertain prospects for rulership, the god
            Harmachis-Chepera Re-Tenu appeared to him in a dream and
            promised that if Thutmose would clear away the sand that had
            accumulated around the Sphinx (the image of the god), he
            would rule over both North and South Egypt --- the entire
            land. Thutmose immediately set men to work at the task, and
            subsequently enjoyed the fulfillment of the god's promise.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Similarly,
it






            was truly prophesied to Nut-Amon (circa 670 BC):</font></font>

            the land of the south is thine, and thou shalt have dominion

            Crown shall adorn thine head. The length and breadth of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Nectanebo,
the






            last king of Egypt, also was a prophet, astrologer, and
            Hermetic magus who used his skills wisely to prevent his
            assassination and to win the wars he fought. Eventually,
            however, he abdicated and left Egypt for Macedonia because
            the gods no longer would cooperate in his magical
            operations. In Macedonia, he earned a good reputation as an
            astrologer. He was consulted by King Phillip while Olympia
            was pregnant with Alexander. Nectanebo constructed a natal
            horoscope for the most auspicious moment of birth, and
            insisted to Olympia that she must not allow the child to be
            born until the moment he specified. At that time the earth
            quaked, the sky tore with lightning, and thunder sounded
            like cosmic drum rolls saluting the event. As the infant
            gave his first cry, Nectanebo announced:</font></font> </p>

            night before Queen Olympia and King Phillip met as
            newleyweds in the bridal chamber, Olympia dreamed that a
            flash of lightning discharged within her womb with a
            thunderous crash. A sheet of fire erupted and spread flaming
            in all directions, then faded away. Phillip later dreamed
            that he was sealing up his wife's womb with the image of a
            lion. The sage Aristander of Telesmus interpreted these
            signs to mean that Olympia was pregnant, for we do not seal
            up anything empty, and that the son she bore would be
            courageous, as a lion symbolizes.</font></font> </p>

            precognitive dreams that benefited his career. The most
            famous of his dreams occurred while he laid siege to the
            city of Tyre. Alexander dreamed that he had captured a satyr
            dancing on a shield. Aristander interpreted the dream as an
            acronym of the Greek words "Sa Tyros", meaning, "Tyre is
            yours." After a seven month siege, it became his prize. He
            also had a dream in which he saw Heracles reach out and call
            from the walls of Tyre. Thus inspired, Alexander won the
            city on the next day.</font></font> </p>

            Alexander's friend Ptolemaeus was wounded in battle by a

            he was watching his wife Olympia feed a fish with roots of
            strange plants. The fish showed Alexander where the plants
            could be found. When Alexander awoke he searched out the
            plants and administered them to Ptolemaeus, who recovered.
            Later he became Pharoah of Egypt.</font></font> </p>

            Alexander wanted to build a great city, to be called

            ancient sage quoted certain passages in Homer's writings
            referring to Pharos. Alexander went quickly to Pharos, where
            he found an excellent site with outstanding advantages.
            Alexander ordered that a city be mapped out to fit the site.
            The Macedonians had no chalk with them so they marked the
            area with barley. Suddenly, countless flocks of birds of all
            species flew to the place and ate every grain of barley.
            This amazing omen disturbed Alexander, but his soothsayer
            told him it meant that Alexandria would be a nurse and
            feeder of great men of every race. The library of Alexandria
            became the greatest in the ancient world.</font></font> </p>

            Caesar was carried into their home, and she wept over him.
            In the morning, she pleaded with Caesar not to go to the

            suspicions. Brutus argued that a great throng was awaiting
            his arrival at the Senate and he must not disappoint them.
            On his way there he met the seer Spurinna and said to him,
            "The Ides of march are here without any calamity." Spurinna
            replied, "Yes, they are here, but they have not yet gone."

            stars and constellations... When he saw that Octavius,
            because of the birth of his son, was somewhat late in

            and into the sky. The priests told Octavius that such an

            forecast his ascent to imperial power. The horoscope so

            Oracle answered, "Until a virgin gives birth to a child and
            yet remains a virgin." As that seemed impossible, Augustus
            thought the oracle was predicting eternal peace. He
            dedicated the temple with a tablet inscribed "Templum pacis

            confer on him. While the Sibyl consulted her sacred books, a

            ancient prophecies known as the Sibylline Oracles or
            Sibyllae are attributed to divinely inspired seeresses who
            lived in the Greek colonies in the 8th century BC. The
            earliest reference to a Sibyl was by the philosopher
            Heraclitus (ca. 500 BC):</font></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Sibyllae were presented to Tarquin I (The Proud), the fifth
            king of Rome, by the Sibyl of Cumae in 615 BC. She offered
            him nine books foretelling the destiny of the Romans with
            instructions to be followed so that the predicted events
            would follow their course. The Sibyl demanded a payment of
            300 gold philippi, a large sum, but Tarquin refused the
            offer. The Sibyl then burned three volumes of the set, and
            again requested 300 philippi for the remaining books.
            Tarquin again declined the offer, whereupon the Sibyl burned
            three more of the books, and again demanded the same price.
            King Tarquin was thus convinced of the value of the books,
            and paid for the remaining three volumes. Only fragments of
            one book survive to this day.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Sibyllae were very popular with the Romans, who installed
            them in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, guarded by a
            special priesthood. The Sibyllae were consulted during
            crises of the Republic and upon the appearance of unusual
            omens. The books were destroyed in 83 BC when Rome burned
            during a civil war. The Senate assigned three senators to
            reconstruct the remaining book as much as possible. Emperor
            Augustus later collected all available Sibylline verses from
            Greece and other Roman colonies and edited them into about
            200 spurious oracles. The books were destroyed by the Vandal
            General Flavius Stilicho "in order to cause the ruin of the
            Empire by getting rid of its guarantee of eternal life."

            Last Judgment will follow the Abomination. Signs will
            precede. There will be four kinds of unusual color in the
            elements and a change in the course in the heavenly bodies.
            There will be a celestial sign in that the air will appear
            at times yellow, at times pitch-black, now green, now clear
            red. Apollo will be split, now in ten, now in four, now in
            two parts; the moon will run together with the sun. Those
            dwelling on the earth will be struck with fear when they see
            the stars all bloody. At the same time the earth will well
            up in different places, and there will be a fearful sign of
            commotion. There will be collision of kingdoms, seizure of
            thrones, earthquakes, and famines. Out of desire for food
            mothers will abase their sons and daughters in debauchery...
            All these things are indications of the Abomination for whom
            there is no rule.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"When
three
signs






            come the inhabitants of the earth should know that he is
            near. In the city of Aeneas a 100-year old woman will bear
            twins with the aid of the faithless. A burning river will
            issue from Mt. Aetna and devour the inhabitants. After this
            two peaks will crash together in the snowy mountains, the
            earth there will be opened in an abyss, and a snowy mist
            will ascend to heaven.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"After
these
things,






            there will be a gathering together of many nations bestial
            in their manner of life and a division of the world into ten
            sceptres. The vilest forms of copulation will precede
            pregnancies, the worst of all being that of the Abomination.
            He will then kill many kings whom he has put under his yoke.
            The Spouse will be silent, the cock will grow hoarse, and
            there will be abuse of the Lamb. Heaven, the sun, and the
            elements will seem to be a testimony to the Abomination in
            that he will do wonders, make the stars dark, weaken the
            perfect, regain the Jews. All this will happen so that he
            may renew what was old and cast out what has been renewed...</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"The
            Last Judgment will be imminent; the signs will precede it.
            The sun will be frequently eclipsing and stretching out in
            vast fashion will destroy. The Euphrates will be dried up to
            a mere trickle; Aetna will be laid open on two sides,
            Avernus will roar, and three parts of the inhabitants of
            Sicily will perish. Pharos will swell up most horibly and
            flood the nearby areas. After this the sea will sink to the
            depths and the fish gathered together will give forth a
            roar. Then the heavens will be opened in four parts, there
            will be thunder, and the inhabitants of the earth will hear
            the threats of Judgment. Ineffable things will blare forth
            on the trumpet. Blameless heralds will announce the
            destruction of all things, saying: "Let there be humility
            and repentence!"...</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Then
all






            the kings and princes will appear and behold the Lamb who
            pays back all men uupon his throne of terror. No
            discrimination of wealthy or poor will take place there, but
            only the weighing of merits. Then crimes will be made
            evident, fear and trembling and horror of the abyss set out
            for punishment will strike all so that there will be weeping
            and gnashing of teeth. They will stretch out their hands in
            prayer, but the lamb will be inflexible; he will be fearful
            in punishing. In his sight there will be lightning and
            thunder, merit along with sins. Blessing will be on his
            right; curses will come from his left. He will judge the
            good and evil to lift the former on high and allow hell to
            swallow the latter to the fate of the demons. This is the
            end of the book of the Erythraean Sibyl of Babylon."</font></font>
