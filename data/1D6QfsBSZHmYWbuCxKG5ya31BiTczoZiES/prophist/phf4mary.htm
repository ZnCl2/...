            misogynist Septuagint Council thoroughly edited the female
            principle from the first official edition of the New
            Testament, with the exception of a few polite mentions of
            Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene (who may well have been
            Jesus’ wife; the "heretical" 1970s paperback book <i>The
              Jesus Scroll</i> makes that assertion). The Mother is not
            so easily suppressed by ignorance, however, and she has
            appeared to her devotees many times throughout Church
            history, albeit at irregular intervals. She often makes
            appointments for her next visit. She usually appears within
            a globe of white light, wearing a dress and scarf, her feet
            in a cloud, sometimes holding the infant Jesus. Lightning
            and thunder, clouds of unusual shapes, and angels sometimes
            accompany her manifestations. There were over 300 reported
            apparitions of Mary in the 20th century alone. The
            visitations reviewed here (in "chronological" order) include
            interesting prophecies, some of which have come to pass.</font></p>

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The shepherdess Melanie Calvat
          (1831-1940) was the daughter of a stonemason in La Salette,
          France. On September 19, 1846, Melanie, then 14 years old, and
          Maxime Giraud, age 11, were approaching a mountain stream near
          when they saw a ball of light downhill from them, looking "as
          though the sun had fallen there. A beautiful lady, all light
          and flowers," appeared in the brilliant light and sat crying
          on a stone. Then she levitated before Melanie and Maxime and
          delivered a prophetic warning of a terrible future:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"France, Italy, Spain and England
          will be at war. Blood will flow on the streets, Frenchmen will
          fight Frenchmen and Italian against Italian and in the end
          will come a war that will be terrible.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"For a period of time God will
          not remember Italy or France for they will have forgotten the
          Gospel. The evil ones will display all their malice and there
          will be murders even in houses. At the first blow of the sword
          of God which will fall, like lightning on humanity, the
          mountains and all nature will tremble because the disorder and
          the misdeeds of man will rise to the vault of heaven.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Paris will be destroyed by fire
          and Marseilles will be inundated by the sea, other great
          cities will be destroyed by fire and razed to the ground. The
          just will have to suffer much: their prayers, penitence, and
          tears will rise to heaven; all the people of God will pray for
          pardon and sing misericords, and they will come to Me for My
          intercession and My help... There will be reconciliation
          between God and man and peace. They will serve, adore, and
          glorify Jesus Christ: love will blossom everywhere. The new
          rulers will be the right arm of the holy Church, which will be
          strong, humble, pious, poor, fervent, and a perfect imitator
          of the virtue of Jesus Christ. The Gospel will be preached
          everywhere and men will make great progress in the faith
          because there will be union between the workers for Jesus
          Christ and all who live in the fear of God.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"But this peace will not last for
          long; twenty-five years of plenty will be almost forgotten and
          the sins of men will be the cause of all the punishment which
          will once again be meted out to Earth.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"A forerunner of Antichrist will
          marshal an army drawn from all nations, united under his
          banner. He will lead them in a bloody war against those still
          faithful to the living God. He will shed much blood in
          eradicating the cult of the living God and by taking His
          place. Then there will be seen many types of punishment on
          Earth besides the diseases and hunger which will be universal.
          Wars will follow wars and the final one will be led by one of
          the ten kings of Antichrist who will have only one will and
          will be the only ones to rule in the world.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Before this event the world will
          have apparent peace and people will think of nothing but
          pleasure and the bad ones will commit sins of all kinds. But
          the sons of the Holy Church, the Sons of Faith, My perfect
          imitators, will grow in the love of God and in all virtue,
          under the guide of the Holy Spirit. I will fight on their side
          until they arrive at the fullness of time.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"For the evil done by men even
          Nature will cry out and earthquakes will occur in protest even
          against those who have committed crimes on Earth. The Earth
          will tremble and you yourself will also tremble of you, who
          are dedicated to the service of Christ, yet inside only admire
          yourselves. Tremble! The Lord is on the point of giving you
          into the hands of your enemies, inasmuch as the holy places
          are contaminated by corruption. Many convents are no longer
          the houses of God, but pastures of "Asmodeus," that is of the
          devil, impurity, and their followers.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Thus the time will be reached in
          which the Antichrist will be born of a Jewish nun, a false
          virgin who will have intimate relations with the ancient
          serpent, the master of luxury. His father will be a bishop. As
          soon as he is born he will have teeth and pronounce
          blasphemies; in a word he will be a born devil. He will emit
          fearful cries, work miracles and wallow in luxury and
          impurity. He will have brothers who are demons incarnate as he
          will be, but sons of evil, and at the age of twelve years they
          will distinguish themselves in brilliant victories. Almost all
          of them will be the head of an armed force, supported by the
          infernal legions.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The seasons will change their
          characteristics, the Earth will be lit with a fiendish red
          light; the water and the fire will cause terrible seismic
          movements which will engulf mountains and cities.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Rome will lose the Faith and
          become the seat of the Antichrist. The demons allied to
          Antichrist will operate on Earth and in the sky and Humanity
          will become worse. But God will not give up his truly faithful
          servants who are men of good will. The Gospel will be preached
          everywhere to all the people and the nations will know the
          truth.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"I make an urgent appeal to the
          whole universe; I call the true disciples of God who lives and
          reigns in the sky! I use my voice as the perfect imitator of
          the Word Incarnate, Christ, the only Savior of men. I warn my
          sons, those truly devoted to me, who are faithful to Me
          because they lead me to My Son, whom I carried in My arms and
          Who lives always in My Spirit. Lastly, I appeal to the
          apostles of the last days, the disciples faithful to Jesus
          Christ who wait for the rule Melanie will receive for them,
          who lead a life despising the world and themselves and who
          live in sight of a world in poverty and humility, in silence
          and in self-effacement, in continual prayer and in
          mortification, in love and in union with God in concealment
          and in suffering.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The time has come that you
          should show yourselves to lighten the world. Go and show
          yourselves, my beloved sons. I am with you and in you. While
          your faith is the light which will help you in these days of
          disappointment, your zeal will give you fame in the glory of
          Christ.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Fight, Sons of light, you small
          number who see, because the time of times, the final end, is
          near.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Church will be in the dark,
          the world will be convulsed, but in this confusion Enoch and
          Elijah will appear full in the spirit of God. They will
          preach, and in their words will be the power of God, and men
          of good will believe in God, and many spirits will be
          consoled, in virtue of the Holy Spirit they will make great
          progress and condemn the diabolical errors of Antichrist.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Woe to the inhabitants of the
          Earth. There will be sanquinary war, hunger, pestilence and
          epidemics, terrible rains of insects, thunder which will shake
          entire cities, earthquakes which will make entire regions
          uninhabitable. Voices will be heard in the air, and men will
          strike their heads against the wall, wishing for death, but
          this will bring them, for their part, terrible torture. Blood
          will flow everywhere. Who could ever report victory unless God
          shortened the time of trial?</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Enoch and Elijah will be put to
          death; pagan Rome will be destroyed and fire will fall from
          heaven destroying three cities. The sun will be blackened and
          only the Faith will survive.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The time is at hand. The abyss
          is opening: the king of darkness is watching, the beast is
          watching with his subjects who will proclaim him "savior of
          the world." He will rise into the air superbly to reach the
          sky, but the breath of Archangel Michael will kill him. He
          will fall back and the earth will shake without ceasing for
          three days. It will then open its womb full of fire and the
          best and his followers will be allowed into the eternal abyss
          of inferno. Then water and fire will purify the earth to
          destroy all human pride and everything will be renewed.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"If humanity is converted, stones
          and rocks will become fertile and produce grain, and the
          fields will give abundant harvest."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">Another account of the apparition
          adds the following admonitions:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Come near, my children; do not
          be afraid. I am here to tell you great news.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"If my people refuse to submit, I
          will be forced to let go the arm of my son. It is so strong
          and so heavy, I can no longer hold it back. How long a time I
          have suffered for you! If I want my son not to abandon you, I
          am obliged to plead with him constantly.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"All nature will tremble because
          of the disorder and the misdeeds of men, which will rise to
          the very heavens. During the period of the hollow peace, the

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Immaculate Lady appeared
          on February 11, 1858 to Bernadette Soubirous, her sister Marie
          and a friend, Pancho. The children were gathering firewood
          when Bernadette heard sounds coming from the nearby grotto of
          Massabielle. Bernadette went to investigate, and found a
          rosebush moving as if it was being windblown (the air was
          calm). A young, beautiful Lady appeared from a golden cloud in
          the interior of the grotto and stood above the rosebush. She
          beckoned to Bernadette to approach, and they prayed together.
          Bernadette met Mary 18 times during the next 6 months, but she
          did not know who she was until the last visitation, when Mary
          said:</font></div>

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary instructed Bernadette to
          dig a hole at a certain spot and to drink and bathe in it. The
          hole became a spring, and Mary promised that it would heal
          those who used its water. Thousands of cures have occurred
          among the millions of visitors to Lourdes since then.</font></div>

          built in honor of her appearances there, but the local pastor
          refused to believe that the apparitions were genuine. He
          accused Bernadette of lying, and demanded that the apparition
          perform a miracle by making the rosebush bloom. The
          apparitions were determined to be genuine in 1862, and the
          site has become one of the major pilgrimage sites of
          Christians.</font></div>

          no longer tell which way to take in order to return to their
          homes. Suddenly there appeared in the heavens a very bright
          light that illuminated the steps of the travelers as though it
          was midday. At that moment there was seen a host of men and
          women, of young and old, of nuns, monks and priests with the
          Holy Father at the head. They were going out from the Vatican
          and were arranging themselves in line for a procession.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"And then there came a furious
          storm which clouded that light somewhat and made it appear
          that light and darkness were engaged in battle. In the
          meantime they arrived at a little square covered with dead and
          wounded, some of whom cried aloud and asked for help.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">Very many were dropping out of
          the line of procession. After having walked for a time that
          would correspond to two hundred risings of the sun they
          realized that they were no longer in Rome. Struck with fear
          they all ran to the Holy Father to defend him personally and
          to attend to his wants. Instantly two angels were seen
          carrying a banner; they presented it to the Holy Father and
          said:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Receive the banner of He Who
          fights and scatters the strongest armies of the world. Your

          you to return."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">Looking at the banner one could
          see written on one side, "Queen conceived without sin," and on
          the other side, "Help of Christians."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The Holy Father joyfully took the
          banner, but looking closely at the small number of those who
          remained with him, he became&nbsp; very sad. The two angels
          add:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Go quickly and console your
          children. Write your brothers dispersed throughout the world
          that there must be a reform in the morals of men. That cannot
          be obtained except by distributing to the people the bread of
          the Divine Word. Catechize the children, preach the detaching
          of the heart from the things that are of the earth. The time
          has come," concluded the two angels, "when the poor shall
          evangelize the people. Vocations will come from among those
          working with the spade, the ax, the hammer to the end that
          they fulfill the words of David: God has raised up the poor
          from the land in order to place them on the thrones of the
          princes of His people."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">Having heard that, the Holy
          Father began the march. The farther he went the greater did
          the procession behind increase. When finally he set foot in
          the Holy City, he wept bitter tears for the distress in which
          he found the people and the large number now missing. As he
          entered St. Peter's he intoned the "Te Deum" to which a choir
          of angels replied singing:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Glory to God in the highest and

          face="Times New Roman,Times">With the end of the hymn there
          came an end to the thick darkness and the sun shone with a
          brightness all its own. The cities, the towns, and villages
          were thinly populated. The land had been leveled down as if by
          a hurricane, by a tempest, and a hailstorm. People went from
          one to another saying in tones of great emotion:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"There is a God in Israel."</font>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">"From the beginning of the exile
          until the singing of the 'Te Deum', the sun rose in the East
          two hundred times. The time that passed for the fulfilling of
          these things corresponds to four hundred risings of the sun."</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The following prophecy (excerpted
          from a longer version) was given to St. Bosco by the Queen of
          Heaven:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"In the midst of this endless
          sea, two solid columns, a short distance apart, soar high into
          the sky. One is surmounted by a statue of the Immaculate
          Virgin, at whose feet a large inscription reads Auxilium
          Christianorum (Help of Christians). The other, far loftier and
          sturdier, supports a Host of proportionate size, and bears
          beneath is the inscription Salus credentium (Salvation of
          believers).</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The flagship commander -- the
          Roman Pontiff -- standing at the helm, strains every muscle to
          steer his ship between the two columns, from whose summits
          hang many anchors and strong hooks linked to chains. The
          entire enemy fleet closes in to intercept and sink the
          flagship at all costs. They bombard it with everything they
          have: books and pamphlets, incendiary bombs, firearms,
          cannons. The battle rages ever more furious. Beaked prows ram
          the flagship again and again, but to no avail, as unscathed
          and undaunted, it keeps on its course. At times, a formidable
          ram splinters a gaping hole in its hull, but immediately, a
          breeze from the two columns instantly seals the gash.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Meanwhile, enemy cannons blow
          up; firearms and beaks fall to pieces; ships crack up and sink
          to the bottom. In blind fury, the enemy takes to hand-to-hand
          combat, cursing and blaspheming. Suddenly the Pope falls,
          seriously wounded. He is instantly helped up, but struck a
          second time, dies. A shout of victory rises from the enemy,
          and wild rejoicing sweeps their ships. But no sooner is the
          Pope dead than another takes his place. The captains of the
          auxiliary ships elected him so quickly that the news of the
          Pope's death coincides with that of his successor’s election.
          The enemy's self-assurance wanes.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Breaking through all resistance,
          the new Pope steers his ship safely between the two columns;
          first, to the one surmounted by the Host, and then the other,
          topped by the statue of the Virgin. At this point, something
          unexpected happens. The enemy ships panic and disperse,
          colliding with and scuttling each other.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Some auxiliary ships, which had
          gallantly fought alongside their flagship, are the first to
          tie up at the two columns. Many others, which had fearfully
          kept far away from the fight, stand still, cautiously waiting
          until; the wrecked enemy ships vanish under the waves. Then
          they too head for the two columns, tie up at the swinging
          hooks and ride safe and tranquil beside their flagship. A
          great calm now covers the sea."</font> </p>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">On May 13, 1917, in a field
          called Cova da Iria near the Portuguese village of Fatima, "a
          beautiful lady from Heaven", shining like the sun and standing
          on a cloud over a beech tree, appeared to three children:
          Lucia Dos Santos (age 10) and her two cousins, Francisco (9)
          and Jacinta Marti (7). Lucia saw and heard the Madonna and
          spoke with her. Jacinta also saw and heard her, but did not
          speak, and Francisco only saw the Virgin. The radiant being
          spoke with the children for several minutes, and asked them to
          meet her again at the same place on the 13th of each month
          until October. Then, she promised, she would identify herself.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The Madonna reappeared six times
          in all, and the reports of the events drew increasing crowds
          of spectators. About 50 persons attended on June 13, and
          nearly 70,000 were present on October 13. Many witnesses saw a
          bright cloud over the beech tree, but only the three children
          could see and hear the woman.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">At the behest of a group of
          political activists and doubters who wished to "put an end to
          the nonsense," the civil prefect of Outrem seized,
          interrogated and threatened the children for two days in the
          hope of forcing a confession of fraud from them. Though the
          children had been prevented from meeting the Madonna on August
          13, she appeared to them on August 19 at Valinhos, near the
          site of her first appearance. The Madonna then told them that
          she would appear a final time on October 13, and then produce
          a miracle.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">On that day the Madonna
          transmitted the prophecy known as the Secret of Our Lady of
          the Rosary. It was a rainy day, but newspaper journalists who
          were eyewitnesses reported that the rain stopped suddenly and
          the sun reappeared. In the words of A. Garret, a professor at
          Coimbra University, the sun looked like "a burnished wheel cut
          out of mother of pearl. This disc spun dizzily around... It
          whirled upon itself with mad rapidity, then advanced, blood
          red, towards the Earth, threatening to crush us with its
          weight." Terrified spectators fell to their knees in prayer.
          The sun returned to normal, then twice again repeated the
          prodigy. In addition, the rain-soaked clothes of the audience
          dried out during the brief time of the solar phenomenon.</font>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">The Secret of Our Lady of the
          Rosary is a three-part prophecy that she ordered to be kept
          secret for 25 years or until the death of Lucia, whichever
          came first. Francisco and Jacinta died in the influenza
          pandemic that ravaged Europe in 1918 and 1919. Lucia became a
          Dorothe Sister, and in 1948 she became a Barefoot Carmelite in
          a closed convent at Coimbra. Lucia learned to write, and
          recorded the text of the secret prophecy. This was kept in the
          Bishopric of Leiria until 1943, when Pope Pius XII revealed
          the first two parts through the agency of Cardinal Schuster.
          The final, secret part of the prophecy was opened by Pope John
          XXIII and several cardinals in 1960, according to the
          Madonna's directions, but it was not revealed to the public.
          The first section is a vision of Hell. The second part
          predicts World War II. The following segment was published
          with Papal approval:</font> </p>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">"If you do what I tell you, many

          another, more terrible one will break out. When you see a
          night lit up by an unknown light, you will know that it the

          be committed. You wish me to give you a sign, so that everyone
          will accept My Words, which I am saying through you, to the

          succeed in bringing his influence right up to the top of the
          Church; succeed in seducing the spirits of the great
          scientists who invent the arms. And if humanity opposes me I
          shall be obliged to free the arm of My Son. Now I see that God

          Heart triumphed over the errors that were being spread by
          Communist Russia. The Consecration of 1984 prevented an atomic
          war that would have occurred in 1985... The `era of peace'
          does not refer to a civil peace but rather to a peace that we
          are now living with the end of the spread of the errors of
          Communist Russia."</font> </p>

          assassinated on May 13, 1981 (the anniversary of Mary’s first
          apparitional appearance at Fatima). The gun was aimed at the
          Pope’s head, but Agca had to aim for his abdomen instead when
          the pontiff turned to a young girl who was wearing a picture
          of Our Lady of Fatima. While he was in the hospital, Pope John
          Paul reviewed the Church’s documentation of Fatima, and he
          read the secret Third Secret of Fatima. In 1984 the Pope

          written by Sr. Lucia on August 31, 1941, and a photostatic
          copy of the original manuscript of the third part of the

          face="Times New Roman,Times">"As is well known, Pope John Paul
          II immediately thought of consecrating the world to the
          Immaculate Heart of Mary and he himself composed a prayer for
          what he called an 'Act of Entrustment' which was to be
          celebrated in the Basilica of St. Mary Major on June 7, 1981."</font>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">Sodano said that the secret
          contained a prophetic vision similar to those found in the
          Bible, but the events to which the third part of the Secret of
          Fatima refers now seem part of the past:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"That text contains a prophetic
          vision similar to those found in Sacred Scripture, which do
          not describe with photographic clarity the details of future
          events, but rather synthesize and condense against a unified
          background events spread out over time in a succession and a
          duration which are not specified. As a result, the text must
          be interpreted in a symbolic key.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The vision of Fatima concerns
          above all the war waged by atheist systems against the Church
          and Christians, and it describes the immense suffering endured
          by the witnesses to the faith in the last century of the
          second millennium. It is an interminable Way of the Cross led
          by the Popes of the twentieth century.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"According to the interpretation
          of the 'little shepherds,' which was also recently confirmed
          by Sister Lucia, the 'bishop clothed in white' who prays for
          all the faithful is the Pope. As he makes his way with great
          effort towards the Cross amid the corpses of those who were
          martyred (bishops, priests, men and women religious and many
          lay persons), he too falls to the ground, apparently dead,
          under a burst of gunfire.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"After the assassination attempt
          of May 13 1981, it appeared evident to His Holiness that it
          was 'a motherly hand which guided the bullet's path,' enabling
          the 'dying Pope' to halt 'at the threshold of death.' On the
          occasion of a visit to Rome by the then bishop of
          Leiria-Fatima, the Pope decided to give him the bullet which
          had remained in the jeep after the assassination attempt, so
          that it might be kept in the Shrine. At the behest of the
          bishop, the bullet was later set in the crown of the statue of
          Our Lady of Fatima.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The successive events of 1989
          led, both in the Soviet Union and in a number of countries of
          Eastern Europe, to the fall of the Communist regime which
          promoted atheism. For this too His Holiness offers heartfelt
          thanks to the Most Holy Virgin. In other parts of the world,
          however, attacks against the Church and against Christians,
          together with the burden of suffering which they involve,
          tragically continue. Even if the events to which the third
          part of the Secret of Fatima refers now seem part of the past,
          Our Lady's call to conversion and penance, issued at the
          beginning of the twentieth century, remains timely and urgent
          today. 'The Lady of the message seems to read the signs of the
          times - the signs of our time - with special insight... The
          insistent invitation of Mary Most Holy to penance is nothing
          but the manifestation of her maternal concern for the fate of
          the human family, in need of conversion and forgiveness.'</font>

          already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above,
          we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand;
          flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would
          set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the
          splendor that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right
          hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel
          cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we
          saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how
          people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a
          Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the
          Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious
          going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big
          Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark;
          before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big
          city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step,
          afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the
          corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the
          mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was
          killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at
          him, and in the same way there died one after another the
          other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various
          lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two
          arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal
          aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood
          of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were
          making their way to God."</font> </p>

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">In June of 1961, The Virgin Mary
          appeared to four girls (Conchita Gonzales, Mari Loli Mazon,
          Jacinta Gonzalez, and Mari Cruz Gonzalez, ages 11-12) near the
          village of San Sebastian de Garabandal in the Cantabrian
          Mountains of northwest Spain. The girls were praying together
          when they heard a thunderous sound and saw a beautiful angel.
          It said nothing, then disappeared. The girls ran to the
          village church and told everyone about the occurence. The
          angel appeared to them several more times before it announced
          that the Blessed Virgin would appear to them. Later that day
          she appeared in the company of two angels with an all-seeing
          eye above her. She visited the girls more than 2,000 times in
          the next four years. The apparition repeatedly urged
          repentance, and said that a miraculous sign will appear some
          day. Conchita wrote this about it in her Diary:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"I am the only one to whom the
          Blessed Virgin spoke of the miracle. She forbade me to say
          what it will consist of. I can't announce the date either
          until eight days before it is due to occur. What I can reveal
          is that it will coincide with an event in the Church and with
          the feast of a saint, martyr of the Eucharist; that it will
          take place at 8:30 on a Thursday evening; that it will be
          visible to all those who are in the village and surrounding
          the mountains; that the sick who are present will be cured,
          and the incredulous will believe. It will be the greatest
          miracle that Jesus will have performed for the world. There
          won't be the slightest doubt that it comes from God and that
          it is for the good of mankind. A sign of the Miracle, which it
          will be possible to film or televise, will remain forever.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Warning, like the
          Chastisement, is a fearful thing for the good as well as the
          wicked. It will draw the good closer to God and warn the
          wicked that the end of times are coming... The Warning is
          something that is seen in the air, everywhere in the world and
          is immediately transmitted into the interior of our souls. It
          will last a very little time, but it will seem a very long
          time because of its effect within us. It would be like fire.
          It will not burn our flesh, but we will feel it bodily and
          interiorly... [It will be] like two stars that crash and make
          a lot of noise, and a lot of light but they don't fall. It's
          not going to hurt us but we're going to see it and, in that
          moment, we're going to see our consciences."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The event will occur between
          March 8-May16 on a Thursday at 8:30 p.m. (Garabandal time),
          within a year of the Warning foretold by Our Lady of Fatima.
          Conchita will be warned of the event 8 days beforehand. It
          will occur on the feast day of a Eucharist martyr, and it will
          coincide with a "great event" in the Church.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The following message from Mary
          is excerpted from Conchita’s notes:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Virgin told me about this on
          January 1st, 1965, up in the pine grove. I cannot say what it
          will consist of, because she did not command me to do so. And,
          as for when it is going to be, she did not tell me, so I do
          not know. What I do know is that it will be visible to
          everybody; it will be a direct work of God and will take place
          before the miracle. I do not know whether people will die
          because of it. They could only die from the shock of seeing
          it...</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Virgin told only me about
          the miracle. She forbade me to say what it will consist of. I
          cannot reveal the date either until eight days beforehand.
          What I am allowed to say is that it will coincide with an
          event in the Church, and with the feast of a Saint who is a
          martyr of the Holy Eucharist; it will be at half-past eight on
          a Thursday evening; it will be visible to everybody in the
          village and on the surrounding mountainsides; the sick who are
          present will be cured and the incredulous will believe. It
          will be the greatest miracle that Jesus has worked for the
          world. There will not remain the slightest doubt that it comes
          from God and is for the good of mankind. In the pine grove, a
          sign of the miracle will be left forever. It will be possible
          to film and televise it...</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The punishment is conditioned to
          whether or not mankind heeds the Blessed Virgin's messages and
          the miracle. If it does take place, then I know what it will
          consist of, because the Virgin told me, but I am not allowed
          to say. What is more, I have seen the punishment. What I can
          assure you is that, if it comes, it is far worse than if we
          were enveloped in fire; worse than if we had fire above us,
          and fire beneath. I do not know how long a time will elapse
          after the miracle, before God sends it."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1962, the Blessed Virgin told
          Conchita a prophecy of the popes; according to her, Pope John
          Paul II will be the last pope:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"There would be two more popes
          after Pope Paul VI and that one of the popes would have a very
          short reign. After that would come the end times but not the
          end of the world."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">Conchita made this announcement
          on September 14, 1965:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The sign that will remain
          forever at the pines is something we will be able to
          photograph, televise, and see, but not touch. It will be
          evident that it is not a thing of this world but from God."</font>

          longing for this hour in which I again shall reveal to you the
          great love of My heart... Pray and make reparation to Me.
          Admonish others to do the same because the time is near at
          hand in which I shall visit My unfaithful people because they
          have not heeded the time of My grace. Persevere in prayer, so
          that your adversary shall have no dominion over you. Tell My
          people to be prepared at all times, for My judgment shall come
          upon them suddenly and when least expected -- and not one
          shall escape My hands, I shall find them all! I shall protect
          the just. Watch the sun and moon and the stars of the Heavens.
          When they appear to be unduly disturbed and restless, know
          that the day is not far away. Stay united in prayer and
          watching until the angel of destruction has passed your doors.
          Pray that these days will be shortened." (1949)</font> </p>

          rejoicing and merry-making, as though they were going to a
          masquerade ball or the wedding feast of the devil himself!
          Assist Me in the salvation of souls. The measure of sin is
          filled! The day of revenge, with its terrifying happenings is

          windows. Talk to no one outside the house. Kneel down before a
          crucifix, be sorry for your sins, and beg My Mothers
          protection. Do not look during the earthquake, because the
          anger of God is holy! Jesus does not want us to behold the

          face="Times New Roman,Times">Another Marian apparition that
          has been approved by the Catholic Church occurred in 1969 in
          Japan. An angelic being appeared to Sister Agnes Sasagawa, who
          was a postulant in the Order of the handmaids of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This prayer was one of those
          given by the Blessed Virgin to the children at Fatima! On June
          12, 1973, Sister Agnes, who was deaf, heard a voice urging her
          to go pray in the chapel:</font> </p>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Do not fear. Pray with fervor
          not only because of your sins, but in reparation for those of
          all men. The world today wounds the most Sacred Heart of Our
          Lord by its ingratitudes and injuries. The wounds of Mary are
          much deeper and more sorrowful than yours. Let us go pray
          together in the chapel."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">When she went there, she saw
          brilliant beams of light emanating from the tabernacle. The
          light appeared during the next two days. On June 28, stigmata
          (the wounds of Christ) began to appear on her hands in the
          form of a bleeding cross. On July 6, while praying in the
          chapel, Sr. Agnes heard a the statue of the Virgin Mary speak
          to her, and other sisters saw blood dripping from the statue’s
          right hand later the same day. The phenomena repeated itself
          four times, ending on September 29. On that day, sisters

          times to appease the wrath of the father. I have prevented the
          coming of calamities by offering him the sufferings of the son
          on the cross, his precious blood, and beloved souls who
          console him forming a cohort of victim souls. Prayer, penance
          and courageous sacrifices can soften the father's anger...
          Even in a secular institute prayer is necessary. Already souls
          who wish to pray are on the way to being gathered together.
          Without attaching too much attention to the form, be faithful

          themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead... The
          work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such
          a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops
          against bishops. The priests who venerate me will be scorned
          and opposed by their confreres... churches and altars sacked;
          the Church will be full of those who accept compromises, and
          the demon will press many priests and consecrated souls to
          leave the service of the Lord. The demon will be especially
          implacable against souls consecrated to God. The thought of
          the loss of so many souls is the cause of my sadness. If sins
          increase in number and gravity, there will be no longer pardon
          for them. Today is the last time that I will speak to you in
          living voice. From now on you will obey the one sent to you
          and your superior."&nbsp; (Oct. 13, 1973)</font></p>

          Esperanza Bianchini, whose wounds appear on Good Friday, has
          been the reciprient of many mystical experiences since 1976.
          She has reported many conversations with the Virgin Mary, she
          has levitated during Mass, and has been seen to bilocate
          (appear in two places at once). She and several other persons
          have witnessed apparitions of the Blessed Virgin in the
          village of Cua in the Finca Betania region of Venezuela. In
          1984, Mary explained the reason for her appearances:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"I come to reconcile them, to
          seek them out, to give them faith, which has disappeared in
          the noise and din of an atomic awakening which is at the point
          of bursting out. My message is of faith, love and hope. More
          than anything, it brings reconciliation between people and
          nations. It is the only thing that can save this century from
          war and eternal death...If a change does not come and a
          conversion of life, one will perish under the fire, war and
          death...</font> </p>

          Confess your sins while the sun shines. Sacrifice yourselves
          for the conversion of sinners and for peace in the world. All

          would be facing its hour of decision in the mid-1990's, when
          there would be grave danger of war involving Asia and Russia.
          Apparently humanity has passed that crisis for the time being.
          Mary also gave this warning:</font> </p>

          miracle occurred during the vigil of the Immaculate Conception
          on December 8, 1991. Father Otty Ossa (Maria’s spiritual
          advisor) was saying Mass when the Host began to bleed as he
          held it. Father Ossa said:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"I broke the Host into four
          parts. When I looked down at the plate I could not believe my
          eyes. I saw a red stain forming on the Host and from it a red
          substance was beginning to emanate similar to the way blood
          spurts out in a puncture. After the Mass, I took the Host and
          protected it in the Sanctuary. The next day at six in the
          morning, I observed the Host and I found that the Blood was
          fluid and then began to dry, however to this day it still
          looks fresh. Amazingly, the Blood is only on one side, not
          bleeding through the exceedingly thin Host."</font> </p>

          the village of Medjugorje in central Yugoslavia met Mother
          Mary on Mount Podbrdo. The apparitions have continued since
          then, albeit with decreasing frequency. Mary sends a message
          of faith, conversions, and fasting to brig peace to Earth. She
          has come to bring humanity back to her son Jesus Christ, and
          she warns that Satan is extremely active now; it is necessary
          to pray often and fervently to defend against his assaults.
          Medjugorje has subsequently become a major pilgrimage site for
          more than 10 million devout Christians. The Serbo-Croatian
          conflict erupted on the 10th anniversary of the apparition.</font>

          that will occur if humanity fails to rehabilitate itself in

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"According to Mirjana, during the
          apparition on December 25, 1982, the Madonna confided the
          tenth and last secret to her, and she revealed the dates on
          which the various secrets will come to pass. The Blessed
          Virgin revealed many aspects of the future to Mirjana, many
          more up to now than to the other seers. For that reason, I
          relate now what Mirjana told me in a conversation on November
          5, 1983 I shall summarize the essential things she said,
          without any literal quotations. Before the visible sign is
          given to humanity, there will be three warnings to the world.
          The warnings will be warnings on the earth. Mirjana will
          witness them. Three days before one of these warnings, she
          will advise a priest of her choice. Mirjana's testimony will
          be a confirmation of the apparitions and an incentive for the
          conversion of the world. After these warnings, the visible
          sign will be given for all humanity at the place of the
          apparitions in Medjugorje. The sign will be given as the
          testimony of the apparitions and a call back to faith...</font>

          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The ninth and tenth secrets are
          grave matters. They are a chastisement for the sins of the
          world. The punishment is inevitable because we cannot expect
          the conversion of the entire world. The chastisement can be
          mitigated by prayers and penance. It cannot be suppressed.
          After the first warning, the others will follow within a
          rather brief period of time. So it is that people will have
          time for conversion. This time is a period of grace and
          conversion. After the visible sign, those who are still alive
          will have little time for conversion. For that reason, the
          Blessed Virgin calls for urgent conversion and reconciliation.
          The invitation to prayer and penance is destined to ward off
          evil and war and above all to save souls. We are close to the
          events predicted by the Blessed Virgin. Convert yourselves as
          quickly as possible. Open your hearts to God. This is a
          message to all mankind."</font> </p>

          lifetime. Ten days before the first secret and the second
          secret, I will notify Father Petar Ljubicic. He will pray and
          fast for seven days, and then he will announce these to the

          sign before you convert; convert soon. This time is a time of
          grace for you. You can never thank God enough for His grace.

          importance of the message of Medjugorje.</font> </p>

          Ivankovic, Maria Pavlovic, Ivanka Ivankovic, Ivan Dragicevic,
          and Jakob Colo) see an apparition of the Blessed Virgin every
          day. The experience in which they see her is a fact that can
          be checked by direct observation. It has been filmed. During
          the apparitions, the youngsters do not react to light, they do
          not hear sounds, they do not react if someone touches them,
          they feel that they are beyond time and space.</font> </p>

          as we see anyone else. We pray with her, we speak to her, and
          we can touch her... The Blessed Virgin says that world peace
          is at a critical stage. She repeatedly calls for
          reconciliation and conversion... She has promised to leave a
          visible sign for all humanity at the site of the apparitions
          of Medjugorje... The period preceding this visible sign is a
          time of grace for conversion and deepening the faith... the
          Blessed Virgin ha promised to disclose ten secrets to us. So
          far, Vicka Ivankovic has received eight. Marija Pavlovic
          received the ninth one on December 8, 1983. Jakov Colo, Ivan
          Dragicevic and Ivanka Ivankovic have each received nine. Only
          Maria Dragicevic has received all ten... These apparitions are
          the last apparitions of the Blessed Virgin on earth. That is

          apparitions have ceased for her, except on her birthday (March

          before one of the admonitions, Mirjana will notify a priest of

          by prayer and penance, but it cannot be eliminated.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Mirjana says that one of the
          evils that threatened the world, the one contained in the
          seventh secret, has been averted, thanks to prayer and
          fasting. That is why the Blessed Virgin continues to encourage
          prayer and fasting:</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You have forgotten that
          through prayer and fasting you can avert war and suspend the
          laws of nature."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"After the first admonition, the
          others will follow in a rather short time. Thus, people will
          have some time for conversion.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"That interval will be a period
          of grace and conversion. After the visible sign appears, those
          who are still alive will have little time for conversion. For
          that reason, the Blessed Virgin invites us to urgent
          conversion and reconciliation.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"The invitation to prayer and
          penance is meant to avert evil and war, but most of all to
          save souls.</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"According to Mirjana, the events
          predicted by the Blessed Virgin are near. By virtue of this
          experience, Mirjana proclaims to the world: "Hurry, be
          converted; open your hearts to God."</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"In addition to this basic
          message, Mirjana related an apparition she had in 1982, which
          we believe sheds some light on some aspects of Church history.
          She spoke of an apparition in which Satan appeared to her
          disguised as the Blessed Virgin. Satan asked Mirjana to
          renounce the Madonna and follow him. That way she could be
          happy in love and in life. He said that following the Virgin,
          on the contrary, would only lead to suffering. Mirjana
          rejected him, and immediately the Virgin arrived and Satan
          disappeared. Then the Blessed Virgin gave her the following
          message in substance:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Excuse me for this, but you must
          realize that Satan exists. One day he appeared before the
          throne of God and asked permission to submit the Church to a
          period of trial. God gave him permission to try the Church for
          one century. This century is under the power of the devil; but
          when the secrets confided to you come to pass, his power will
          be destroyed. Even now he is beginning to lose his power and
          has become aggressive. He is destroying marriages, creating
          divisions among priests and is responsible for obsessions and
          murder. You must protect yourselves against these things
          through fasting and prayer, especially community prayer. Carry
          blessed objects with you. Put them in your house, and restore
          the use of holy water...</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Holy Father, I do not want to be
          responsible for the ruin of anyone. I am doing my best. The
          world is being called to conversion and reconciliation. In
          writing to you, Holy Father, I am doing only doing my duty.
          After drafting this letter, I gave it to the youngsters so
          that they might ask the Blessed Virgin whether its contents
          are accurate. Ivan Dragicevic relayed the following answer:
          "Yes, the contents of the letter are the truth. You must
          notify first the Supreme Pontiff and then the Bishop."</font>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The Blessed Virgin at Medjugorje
          has said this concerning prophecy:</font> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">"Do not think about wars,
          punishments, evil, because if you do you are on the road
          toward them. Your task is to accept divine peace, to live it,
          and to spread it."</font> </p>

          <img src="medjug.jpg" id="_x0000_i1080" border="0"

      </center>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times">The primary message of the
          Blessed Virgin always has been one of Peace, Prayer, and
          Mercy, rather than of her prophecies, which are contingent
          upon the power of Prayer. According to Mary, the wrath of God
          and Jesus can be averted (or at least delayed) by repentance
          and the Rosary. This approach to world peace actually seems to
          have worked in the case of the fall of the USSR, which also
          prevented (or long delayed) the invasion of Europe by Soviet
          forces.</font> </p>
