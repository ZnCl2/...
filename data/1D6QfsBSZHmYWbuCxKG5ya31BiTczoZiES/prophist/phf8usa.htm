                  Prophecies ~</big></font></font></b> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Prophecies can
            be misunderstood, misinterpreted, and misused, and they tend
            to be self-fulfilling. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec
            empire is a perfect example of this problem. Toltec legends
            tell of Quetzalcoatl, a white-skinned, bearded priest-king
            who came from the East to establish an enlightened kingdom
            among the Indians. Eventually he departed by boat to the
            West. Quetzalcoatl promised to return, and as the appointed
            day of his second coming approached, heavenly omens
            indicated that the Aztec culture was about to come to an
            abrupt and violent end.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nezhaulcoyotl,
            a king of Texcoco whose reign bridged the 15th and 16th
            centuries, also was a great astrologer. He had an
            observatory built on the roof of his palace, and invited
            other astrologers in his kingdom to come to his court. There
            he disputed with them and taught his wisdom. When Moctezuma
            II was elected king of Mexico, Nezhaulcoyotl praised the
            nation for having chosen a ruler "whose deep knowledge of
            heavenly things insured to his subjects his comprehension of
            those of an earthly nature." <b>(1)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nezhaulcoyotl
            gave Moctezuma II detailed warnings of a new astrological
            age that was beginning in the Aztec calendar. One of the
            omens was a famine which developed in 1507. Then an
            earthquake occurred after the "Lighting of the New Age"
            ceremony inaugurated by Moctezuma II. These were sure signs
            of impending disaster. Each year thereafter until Hernando
            Cortes invaded Mexico in 1518, a new omen appeared. A comet
            with three heads and sparks shooting from its tail was seen
            flying eastward. In another year, another comet, described
            as "a pyramidal light, which scattered sparks on all sides,
            rose at midnight from the eastern horizon till the apex
            reached the zenith, and faded at dawn." This phenomenon
            appeared for 40 nights, and was interpreted to presage
            "wars, famine, pestilence, and mortality among the lords."</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1508,
            Moctezuma II visited Tlillancalmecatl ("Place of Heavenly
            Learning"), where he was given a rare bird. In its shiny
            crest, he saw the stars in reflection and "fire sticks"
            (guns). The image changed to show the advance ofwarriors
            riding on horses which, since he had never seen them before,
            he described as deer.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also in 1508,
            Moctezuma's sister Paranazin collapsed into a cataleptic
            trance that was mistaken for death. She recovered while the
            funeral procession was taking her to the royal crypt. She
            said that during her trance she received a vision of great
            ships from a distant land arriving with men bearing arms,
            carrying banners, and wearing "metal casque"” (helmets). The
            foreigners were to become masters of the Aztecs.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For several
            days in 1519, a comet hung over the capital city of
            Tenochtitlan. It was described as "a rip in the sky which
            bleeds celestial influences dropwise onto the Aztec world."
            After that, a thunderbolt struck and burned down the temple
            of the deity Huitilopchitli. The last omen came one night,
            again to Tenochtitlan. A woman's voice was heard "coming
            from everywhere and nowhere... crying 'My children, my
            children, are lost!'"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From these and
            other signs, the Aztecs understood their doom as originating
            with celestial powers. Was it then mere coincidence, or did
            the hands of the Fates steer Cortes’ ships to land on April
            22, 1519, the very day that the Aztec calendar calculated
            for Quetzalcoatl’s return at the end of the 13th Heaven and
            the beginning of the 9 Hells? It was as though the directing
            forces of the world had staged the drama to be acted out by
            historical characters. Anticipating the momentous event of
            Quetzalcoatl’s return, Moctezuma II had posted watchers on
            the coast to draw images of the aliens and deliver them to
            him. The emperor was amazed that the light-skinned, bearded
            figures matched the traditional descriptions of
            Quetzalcoatl. This case of mistaken identity caused the
            Aztecs to put up little resistance to the Spaniards, who
            soon conquered the empire.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To prevent
            mutiny among his troops, Cortes burned the ships after they
            landed. The cavalry-mounted Spanish forces then quickly
            defeated several local tribes who resisted their invasion.
            When their chiefs sued for peace, Cortes gave them his
            helmet and commanded them to take it to the emperor and
            return it filled with gold. The helmet itself was an object
            of wonder to the Aztecs: it was almost identical to that
            worn by the great deity Huitzilopochtli. Marveling at the
            similarity, the emperor returned the helmet, filled with
            gold and accompanied by a warning to come no closer. But the
            Spaniard's greed for gold and dominion drew them inexorably
            toward Tenochtitlan.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Though nearly
            overwhelmed with superstitious fear of the mythic
            Quetzalcoatl, Moctezuma II is said to have greeted Cortes at
            the city gates with the words:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"O Lord, with
            what trouble have you journeyed to reach us, have arrived in
            this land, your own country of Mexico, to sit on your
            throne, which I have been guarding for you this while; I
            have been watching for you, for my ancestors told that you
            would return. Welcome to this land. Rest a while; rest in
            your palace."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although he was
            outnumbered militarily by more than 1000 to 1 (Moctezuma's
            palace guard alone was larger than Cortes' expedition),
            Cortes boldly accepted the offer. In the course of ensuing
            events, the Spaniards seized Moctezuma II and displayed the
            captive king to his subjects. Reacting in anger, the people
            stoned and fatally wounded him. The Aztec empire fell soon
            afterwards.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As he lay
            dying, Moctezuma II had a wondrous vision. He told it to
            Tula, his favorite daughter. Later, she told it to the
            Tezcucan noble Iztlilzochitl, who recorded it:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"To the world I
            have said farewell. I see its vanities go away from me one
            by one.. Last in the train and most loved, most glittering
            is power, and in its hands I see my heart. A shadow creeps
            over me, darkening all without, but brightening all within,
            and in the brightness, lo, I see my people and their future!</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The long, long
            cycles, two, four, eight, pass away, and I see the tribes
            newly risen, like the trodden grass, and in their midst a
            Priesthood and a Cross. An age of battle more, and lo! There
            remains the Cross, but not the priests; in their stead is
            Freedom and God.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I know the
            children of the Aztecs, crushed now, will live, and more
            after ages of wrong suffered by them, they will rise up, and
            take their place --- a place of splendor --- amongst the
            deathless nations of the earth. What I was given to see was
            revelation. Cherish these words, O Tula; repeat them often,
            make them a cry of the people, a sacred tradition; let them
            go down with the generations, one of which will, at last,
            understand the meaning of the words FREEDOM And GOD, now
            dark to my understanding; and then, not till then, will be
            the new birth and new career."</font> <br>

        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 14th
            century, almost 200 years before Pizzaro arrived to conquer
            the Incas, a young prince had a dream in which a spirit
            appeared and identified itself as Viracocha Inca, son of the
            sun and brother of the first king of the Inca dynasty. The
            spirit said that a northern tribe, the Chancas, was
            preparing a revolution against the monarchy, and serious
            consequences would follow.. The Chancas did rebel, and the
            prince subdued them. But rebellion was common, and the Inca
            priests concluded that a much greater danger was implied in
            the warning. The priests interpreted another meaning: One
            day, bearded foreigners who were "masters of the lightning"
            would arrive from the sea to herald the fall of the empire.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The prince
            became the eighth Inca king, and the people gave him the
            name Viracocha. He commissioned the construction of a temple
            with twelve winding halls leading upward to a statue of a
            tall, bearded man dressed in a tunic. He held a chained,
            ferocious animal that had the claws of a leopard. King
            Viracocha carved the statue with his own hands in order to
            create an exact image of the spirit in his veridic dream.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several omens
            occurred as the years passed. One day in the sky over the
            capitol city of Cuzco, a condor (the sacred messenger of the
            sun) was attacked by a swarm of falcons. The wounded condor
            fell into the city square and was given medical aid by the
            priests, but it died anyway. The Inca sages were greatly
            disturbed because they saw it as an omen of bad times to
            come.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In an audience
            before Huayna Capac, the 11th Inca king, a soothsayer
            interpreted an awesome sign that had appeared in the sky:
            three halos (red, green and brown) encircling the moon. The
            sage said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The Moon, your
            Mother, tells you that Pachacamac, the Creator and giver of
            Life, threatens your Family, your Realm, and subjects. Your
            sons will wage a cruel War, those of royal Blood will die,
            and the Empire will disappear."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since there
            were only twelve halls in the Temple of Viracocha, and
            Huayna Capac was the 11th king, he correctly feared that the
            kingdom would end with its next ruler. Huayna Capac also
            worried about a party of light-skinned, bearded foreigners
            who had come ashore to the north, wielding strange weapons
            that erupted with fire, as spoken of in earlier prophecies.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On his
            deathbed, Huayna Capac addressed his priests and officials
            thus:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Our father the
            sun has revealed to me that after a reign of twelve Incas,
            his own children, there will appear in our country an
            unknown race of men who will subdue our empire. They
            doubtless belong to the people whose messengers have
            appeared on our shores. Be sure of it, these foreigners will
            reach this country and fulfill the prophecy."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The foreign
            messengers were Vasco Nunez de Balboa and company, who
            arrived at Tumbes in 1511. The Spaniards returned in 1532,
            well armed for conquest under the command of Francisco
            Pizzaro. Within a few years after the death of Huayna Capac
            from smallpox, his two sons went to war against each other.
            Atahualpa won and assumed the throne as the 12th Inca, just
            in time to lose the empire to Pizzaro on November 16, 1532.</font>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The <i>Q'ero </i>(Long-haired
ones),







            the last of the Incas, recently revealed their prophecies of
            the End of Time to Alberto Villoldo, who has published them.
            The <i>Q'ero</i> are awaiting the next Pachacuti (He Who
            Transforms the Earth), and expect it to be the end of the
            world as we know it. The signs of upheaval have begun, and
            will last four years. A new humanity will emerge from the
            chaos. The prophecies announce the beginning of a new
            "millenium of gold", and speak of "a rip in the fabric of
            time", through which will come a luminous being. The signs
            of the times include: the drying-up of high mountain <i>cochas







              (</i>lagoons), the near-extinction of the condor, and

        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The sacred
            Aztec calendar is properly called the Eagle Bowl (Figure 1).
            It represents the solar deity Tonatiuh. The amazingly
            accurate calendar has been in use in various forms for more
            than 2,000 years. A Zapotec prophecy, based on the Eagle
            Bowl, states:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"After Thirteen
            Heavens of Decreasing Choice, and Nine Hells of Increasing
            Doom, the Tree of Life shall blossom with a fruit never
            before known in the creation, and that fruit shall be the
            New Spirit of Men."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 13 Heavens
            and 9 Hells were each 52 years long (1,144 years total).
            Each of the 9 Hells were to be worse than the last. On the
            final day of the last Hell (August 17, 1987), Tezcatlipoca,
            god of death, would remove his mask of jade to reveal
            himself as Quetzalcoatl, god of peace.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the
            mythology of the Aztecs, the first age of mankind ended with
            the animals devouring humans. The second age was finished by
            wind, the third by fire, and the fourth by water. The
            present fifth epoch is called Nahui-Olin (Sun of
            Earthquake), which began in 3113 BC and will end on December
            24, 2011. It will be the last destruction of human existence
            on Earth. The date coincides closely with that determined by
            the brothers McKenna in <i>The Invisible Landscape</i> as
            “the end of history” indicated by their computer analysis of
            the ancient Chinese oracle-calendar, the <i>I Ching</i>.</font>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mayan

            Sunday, December 23, 2012. Only a few people will survive
            the catastrophe that ensues. In the fifth age, humanity will
            realize its spiritual destiny. In the sixth age, we will
            realize God within ourselves, and in the seventh age we will

            many tribes to bring peace about 2,000 years ago. This
            spiritual hero was best known as Quetzalcoatl. Some of his

            (now identified with Teotihuacan in Mexico) through two
            millennia. The Toltecs would be conquered first by the
            Sacrificers of Men (the Aztecs), then by white-skinned,

            these weapons, until they reach for the one which is
            ultimate. Should they use that, there will be no forgiveness
            in that vale where there is no turning. Using such a weapon
            to make man over, is reaching into the heavens for the
            Godhead. These things are not for man's decision, nor should
            man presume to think for all things, and thus mock the
            Almighty. Woe to those who do not listen! There are lamps

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Book X of
            his <i>History</i>, the 16th century chronicler Fray
            Bernardino de Sahagun described the departure of the "wise
            men" who had been the attendant priests of Kate-Zahl at
            Teotihuacan:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The wise men
            remained not long; soon they went. Once again, they embarked
            and carried off the writing, the books, the paintings; they
            carried away all the crafts, the castings of metals. And
            when they departed, they summoned all those they left
            behind. They said to them: "Our lord, the protector of all,
            the wind, the night, saith you shall remain. We go leaving
            you here. Our lord goeth bequesting you this land; it is
            your merit, your lot. Our lord, the master of all, goeth
            still farther, and we go with him. Whither the lord, the
            night, the wind, our lord, the master of all, goeth, we go
            accompanying him. He goeth, he goeth back, but he will come,
            he will come to do his duty, he will come to acknowledge
            you. When the world is become oppressed, when it is the end
            of the world, at the time of its ending, he will come to
            bring it to an end. But you shall dwell here; you shall
            stand guard here..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A surviving
            Toltec legend includes this prophecy:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Ce Acatl
            [Quetzalcoatl] spent a night with a Huiteca family. They fed
            him and played music for him. The father, a strong Indian
            farmer, showed Ce Acatl a stone carving he had and told him,
            "This carving tells of the coming of the Lord of the Dawn.
            it says he will come in the Year One Reed. It says he will
            build a city and change the world."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The farmer had
            no idea who he was talking to. He continued. "Now," he said,
            "many people say he will not come. Many people say it is a
            long time from now that he will come. Some people say he
            will come from the East and he will bring a great book of
            words and numbers. Other people say he will come from a tree
            and count the Last twenty Days of the Creation. What do you
            say about this?"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Ce Acatl grew
            gray with the depth of his answer. "If I told you of my
            thought, of what I know of the Spirit of the Lord of the
            Dawn, if I told you of what I think will happen, you would
            laugh and think me crazy. So I say only this: One day a race
            shall walk upon this earth, a race of men whose spirits are
            so great, whose wisdom is so complete, whose powers to
            commune with the Creator are so keen they will dwarf the
            doings of the Lord of the Dawn of our day. When that day
            comes the Creator will send forth a manifestation that will
            in turn amaze the wisest men of that unbelievable age. And
            even then the greatest brains on earth will wonder --- has
            he come? Will he come? Or has he been here?"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When he
            departed, Ce Acatl promised to close the Thirteenth Heaven
            and open the First of the Nine Hells, and he vowed to
            destroy the man-made gods. He set the year and date of his
            birth (260 years later on Day One Reed in year One Reed) and
            said, "I shall return. I shall come from the east like the
            Morning Star, and I will fulfill that part of the prophecy."</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is said that
            when Ce Acatl passed away at the age of 52, "A hush fell
            over the entire planet, and burning bright in the heavens
            directly above the great tree, the Tree of Life [El Tule],
            glowed the planet Venus, the Morning Star."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Quetzalcoatl
            also foretold the following:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In time, white
            men will come out of the eastern sea in great canoes with
            white wings like a big bird. The white men will be like a
            bird with two different kinds of feet. one foot will be that
            of a dove [Christianity], the other of an eagle [predator].
            A few hundred years after the arrival of the first white
            men, other white men would arrive with both feet as a dove."</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Quetzalcoatl

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A Zapotec
            prophecy, transmitted by Joseph Jochmans, also announced the

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"One of the
            incarnations of Quetzalcoatl is buried beneath the roots of

            of the dawning sun of the new heaven cycle [August 17, 1987]
            sink into the depths of the Earth, billions of tiny spirits
            will burst from the heart of Quetzalcoatl. They will slowly
            rise through the trunk, through the limbs and branches,
            appearing as sparkles of light, finally erupting from limbs
            and branches, to circle the globe, each spirit to implant
            itself within the heart of a human being, and plant a
            crystal of peace and love..."</font> </big></p>

        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the course
            of their communion with the Great Spirit, native Americans
            have received many visions of the destiny of North American
            civilization. The largest number of such prophesies have
            been preserved by the Hopi in Arizona. Their community of
            Oraibi is the oldest continually inhabited settlement (about
            1,000 years) in North America. The name Hopi is derived from
            <i>Hopitu Shinumu</i> ("Peaceful [or: Righteous] People").</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Hopi
            believe that the human race has evolved through three world
            stages of life since its origin. Each of these worlds was
            destroyed in turn, and human life was purified and nearly
            ended by the Great Spirit because of man’s corruption and
            greed. <b>(3)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the Hopi
            cosmology, the universe at first was only infinite blackness
            in the mind of Taiowa, the Creator. Taiowa made Sotuknang,
            the first man, and commanded him to order the cosmos. On the
            first day, Sotuknang divided the universe into nine worlds.
            One world was reserved for Taiowa, one was for Man, andseven
            were for future worlds. The present is the Fourth World.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Topkela was the
            first and most beautiful of the worlds. There, humanity
            thrived in harmony with Nature in the company of animals.
            But the Snake spoke and seduced Man away from Taiowa the
            Creator. Seeing this, Taiowa ordered Satuknang to destroy
            Tokpela and its inhabitants, except for a few "children of
            pure heart" whom he sheltered in the center of the Earth
            when he rained fire upon the planet and burned the sky. The
            people stayed underground while volcanoes erupted.
            Afterwards, the people emerged and moved into the second
            world, Topka, which was less beautiful than the first.
            There, men lived in huts, learned crafts, and drew apart
            from Nature. Eventually they became greedy, materialistic,
            and insatiable as before. Taiowa again ordered Sotuknang to
            destroy the humans and the world they had ruined. The
            faithful few again hid underground with the Ant People. The
            earth rolled over twice, and everything on it was destroyed
            by ice, which covered everything. After the ice had melted
            enough to make the world inhabitable, the survivors emerged
            into the third world, Kuskurza. There, man built cities and
            tall buildings, and departed further still from the
            Creator’s nature, becoming very evil. Kuskurza in turn was
            destroyed by flood. (<b>4-6</b>)</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the Hopi's
            ancestors emerged from the underworld, they met the demigod
            Maasaw, who owns this world. Maasaw had been caretaker of
            the Third World, but because of his pride, he had been
            demoted to become the god of death. When Kuskurza was
            destroyed, Taiowa gave Maasaw another chance and appointed
            him to be the guardian of this world. The people asked
            Maasaw for permission to live in the new land of Turtle
            Island (North America). Maasaw said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It is up to
            you, whether you are willing to live my poor, humble and
            simple life. It is hard, but if you are willing to live
            according to my teachings and instructions and will never
            lose faith in the life I shall give you, you may come and
            live with me. Now you look at me. I am a poor man. I have
            almost nothing: I have only my planting stick, my seed corn,
            and a jug of water. I live a simple life. If you wish to
            live with me, you must sacrifice many things. If you want me
            for your leader, your chief, you must prove that you can
            live this way of life.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now look
            around. See this land. It is poor land. There is not much
            water and very few trees. But this is the richest land.
            There is great wealth under. But hear this warning --- you
            are not to disturb this land and take this wealth out as
            long as there is still war going on. If you do, these things
            will be used to destroy life and this will not be your
            salvation...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Never disturb
            this land. Do not cede your land to anyone; don't ever give
            it away. Above all, it is to provide your nourishment. Hold
            this land dear like a mother as long as you live. If you
            sell it you will no longer reap crops. Be prepared: one
            after another people will approach you and put you to the
            test in this matter.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If, in
            addition, you are willing to adopt the religion which I
            practice, you will derive further benefits for your life...
            But you have arrived with great ambitions and expectations.
            When you fall into your evil ways again, you will make me
            weep...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"All right, you
            have settled in a desert, yet the land is filled with
            riches. You reside on the very backbone of the earth. All
            kinds of precious things are buried in this earth. There
            exists a storehouse of treasures underground but you must
            not dig them up yet.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Three times
            big war will rage. Should you excavate these treasures while
            the killing is taking place, powerful weapons will be forged
            from them and people will be slain by them. If you act on
            your own in this matter, you will do wrong. Not before the
            day of purification has been completed, may you unearth
            these things. At that time people will benefit from them.
            However, if these wars ever take place here, don’t pick up
            your weapons, and don’t engage in the business of
            killing..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The people
            asked Maasaw to be their leader, but he declined. He said:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A greater one
            than I has given you a plan to fulfill first. When the
            previous parts of the world were pushed underwater, this new
            land was pushed up in the middle to become the backbone of
            the earth. You are now standing on its west side slope. But
            you have not yet made your migrations. You have not yet
            followed your stars to the place where you will meet and
            settle. This you must do before I can become your leader.
            But if you go back to evil ways again I will take over the
            earth from you, for I am its caretaker, guardian, and
            protector... So go now and claim the land with my
            permission."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Maasaw then
            placed four different colors and sizes of corn before the
            leaders of the four different racial groups, and had each
            one choose which would be their food in this world. The Hopi
            were the last to choose, and they picked the smallest ear of
            multi-colored corn. Pleased by their choice, Maasaw said:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It is well
            done. You have chosen the real corn, for all the others are
            imitations inside of which are hidden seeds of different
            plants. You have shown me your intelligence; for this reason
            I will place in your hands these <i>owa tutuveni</i>
            [sacred stone tablets], symbols of power and authority over
            all land and life to guard, protect, and hold in trust for
            me until I return to you in a later day, for I am the first,
            but I am also going to be the last."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the
            three Bear Clan tablets describes the land from the Grand
            Canyon to the Rio Grande, which was granted by Maasaw to the
            Hopis. Another tablet is inscribed with mnemonic symbols of
            prophecies. A third tablet maps the allocations of farmland
            to the various clans, and delegates leadership to the Bear
            Clan. The fourth tablet is a very precise map of the
            location of the Sipaapuni, the great underground city where
            the Hopi ancestors hid during the destruction of the past
            worlds. (<b>Figs. 2, 3</b>)</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The symbols on
            the front of the tablet now held by the Fire Clan show the
            mask of Maasaw and the swastika pattern which represents the
            Hopi migrations. One corner is missing. The back of the Fire
            Clan tablet shows the figure of a headless man, which
            symbolizes the following prophecy:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a time to
            come, the Hopis will be forced to develop their lives at the
            dictates of a new ruler. They are not to resist, but must
            wait for their Elder Brother, Antsa Qoetsapava Powatanica. A
            corner of the Fire Clan tablet was broken off and given to
            the Elder Brother when he left on his migration. He hid it
            in the Sipaapuni city because he did not want to risk losing
            it in the course of his travels and reincarnations. He will
            retrieve it when he returns. In due time, the tablet will be
            split open to expose interior inscriptions which will reveal
            the origin and identity of the Hopi. Fitting the missing
            corner piece to the tablet, the Elder Brother will thus
            identify himself to the Hopi. The tablet will be split open
            to expose interior inscriptions which will reveal the origin
            and identity of the Hopi. Then Pahaana will proceed to
            deliver them from their persecutors and develop with them a
            new and universal brotherhood of man. But if he accepts any
            other religion, he must assent to having his own head cut
            off. This will dispel the evil and save the Hopi people.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The chief of
            the Bow Clan led the faithful Hopi to this new land, but he
            fell into evil ways. His two sons rebuked him for his
            mistakes, and after he died they assumed the
            responsibilities of leadership. Then Maasaw sent the Elder
            Brother to the east and across the ocean. Upon reaching his
            destination, he was to start back to look for his younger
            brother, who remained on Turtle Island. The Elder Brother’s
            mission was to help his younger brother to bring about
            Purification Day, when evil people would be punished and
            destroyed. Afterwards, real peace, brotherhood, and
            everlasting life would be established. The Elder Brother
            would restore to his younger brother all the land which the
            Evil One among the white men had taken.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The younger
            brother (the Hopi ancestors) was instructed to travel
            throughout Turtle Island and mark his trail with the
            petroglyphs we see today. This was done to claim the land,
            and to record and preserve the history of the Indians
            throughout the reign of white men. The whites would destroy
            most of the native Americans’ oral history and culture
            before destroying themselves also.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A great white
            star would appear when the Elder Brother reached his
            destination. All people were to settle wherever they
            happened to be at that time, and there they were to remain
            until the Elder Brother returned.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Hopi
            settled in <i>Tuuwanasavi</i>, the area now known as Four
            Corners, where the state lines of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah
            and Colorado meet. This area is the "heart" of Turtle Island
            and of Mother Earth, and it is the microcosmic image of the
            entire planet. There, the Hopi lived a simple life as
            stewards of the land, which produced abundant crops despite
            being a desert. Their <i>katsina</i> ceremonies serve to
            maintain the balance of natural forces and to reaffirm their
            faith in Taiowa, in Maasaw and other spirits, and to show
            respect for all life.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Maasaw told the
            Hopi that after a time Pahana, White Man, would come and
            take their land and try to lead the Hopi into evil ways.
            Life would be <i>Koyaanisqatsi </i>("World out of
            balance"). The Hopi were told that they must hold to their
            ancient religion and their land, and they must do it without
            violence. Maasaw promised that if they succeeded, their
            people and land would be a center where the True Spirit
            would reawaken.</font> </big></p>

            that after many years the Elder Brother might change the
            color of his skin, but his hair will remain black, and he
            will wear it long, in a braided tail. He will wear a red
            cloak or a red cap which resembles the back of a horned
            toad. He will speak the Hopi language, and he will be able
            to write. He will follow no religion but his very own. He
            will bring (or come to recover) the missing corner of the <i>owa

            meet him on the trail on the east side of Oraibi if he is on
            time (on the last day of Soyal, the winter solstice
            ceremony), or on the trail to Sikya’wa (Yellow Rock), at
            Chokuw (Pointed Rock), Nahoyungvasa (Cross Fields), or at
            Tawtona (Where the Sun Ray Goes Over the Line) below Oraibi

            judgment and punishment will take place. The Elder Brother
            will help the younger brother obtain justice. In one day he

            because he will have no mercy."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is said that
            the Elder Brother will bring with him two great, intelligent
            and powerful helpers. One will have a sign of a swastika and
            the sign of the sun. The first helper can be interpreted to
            represent the German-Japanese Axis of World War Two. From
            the Hopis' perspective, these enemies of the USA were doing
            the Indians a real service. The second helper will have the
            sign of a Celtic Cross with red lines between the arms of
            the cross. In the Hopi symbology, this form of cross
            represents women, and the red lines indicates their
            menstrual flow. The symbol represents their liberation and
            the revival of matriarchal power after ages of suppression.</font>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Maasaw warned
            that if these great beings failed, terrible evil would
            befall the world and great numbers of people would be
            killed. However, they would succeed if enough Hopi remained
            true to the ancient spirit of their people. Unfortunately,
            there are very few traditionalist Hopis remaining today, so
            the situation looks very bleak.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hopi prophecy
            states that World War III will be started by the people who
            first received the light -- China, Palestine, India and
            Africa. When the war comes, the United States will be
            destroyed by "a gourd of ashes" which will be thrown to the
            ground. The rivers will boil, the earth shall burn, and no
            grass will grow there for many years. It will cause a
            disease that no medicine can cure. This can only mean that
            nuclear weapons will be used against the USA. The Hopi
            traditionalist Thomas Banyaca has said that if many US
            soldiers are sent overseas, they will be killed by atomic
            bombs, and then Turtle Island also will be bombed. "Men will
            fall from the sky", meaning that invading soldiers will
            parachute to earth. Another Hopi prophecy states:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When the Blue
            Star Kachina dances in the plaza, the time of the great
            trial will be here... The end of all Hopi ceremonies will
            come when a Kachina removes his mask during a dance in the
            plaza before uninitiated children. For a while there will be
            no more ceremonies, no more faith. Then Oraibi will be
            rejuvenated with its faith and ceremonies, marking the start
            of a new cycle of Hopi life."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The following
            Hopi prophecy was first published in a mimeographed
            manuscript that circulated among several Methodist and
            Presbyterian churches in 1959. While driving along a desert
            road one hot day in the summer of 1958, a minister named
            David Young stopped to offer a ride to a Hopi elder, who
            accepted with a nod. After riding in silence for several
            minutes, the elder said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I am White
            Feather, a Hopi of the ancient Bear Clan. In my long life I
            have traveled through this land, seeking out my brothers,
            and learning from them many things full of wisdom. I have
            followed the sacred paths of my people, who inhabit the
            forests and many lakes in the east, the land of ice and long
            nights in the north, the mountains and streams of jumping
            fish in the west, and the places of holy altars of stone
            built long ago by my brothers' fathers in the south. From
            all these I have heard the stories of the past, and the
            prophecies of the future. Today, many of the prophecies have
            turned to stories, and few are left --- the past grows
            longer, and the future grows shorter.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And now White
            Feather is dying. His sons have all joined his ancestors,
            and soon he too shall be with them. But there is no one
            left, no one to recite and pass on the ancient wisdom. My
            people have tired of the old ways. The great ceremonies that
            tell of our origins, of our Emergence into the Fourth World,
            are almost all abandoned, forgotten. Yet even this has been
            foretold. The time grows short..</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My people
            await Pahana, the lost White Brother, as do all our brothers
            in the land. He will not be like the white men we know now,
            who are cruel and greedy. We were told of their coming long
            ago. But still we await Pahana.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"He will bring
            with him the symbols, the missing piece of that sacred
            tablet now kept by the elders, given to him when he left,
            that shall identify him as our True White Brother.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The Fourth
            World shall end soon, and the Fifth World will begin. This
            the elders everywhere know. The signs over many years have
            been fulfilled, and so few are left.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            First Sign: We are told of the coming of the white-skinned
            men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana --- men who
            took the land that was not theirs. And men who struck their
            enemies with thunder.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Second Sign: Our lands will see the coming of the spinning
            wheels of wood filled with voices. In my youth, my father
            saw this prophecy come true with his eyes --- the white men
            bringing their families in wagons across the prairies.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Third Sign: A strange beast, like a buffalo but with great
            long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These
            White Feather saw with his own eyes --- the coming of the
            white mens' cattle.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Fourth Sign: The land will be criss-crossed by snakes of
            iron.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Fifth Sign: The land will be criss-crossed by a giant
            spider's web.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Sixth Sign: The land will be criss-crossed with rivers of
            stone that make pictures in the sun.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Seventh Sign: You will hear of the sea turning black, and
            many living things dying because of it.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is the
            Eighth Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair
            long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to
            learn their ways and wisdom.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And this is
            the Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling place
            in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a
            great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after
            this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"These are the
            Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock
            to and fro. The white man will battle against other people
            in other lands --- with those who possessed the first light
            of wisdom. There will be many columns of smoke such as White
            Feather has seen the white man make in the deserts not far
            from here. Only those which come will cause disease and a
            great dying. Many of my people, understanding the
            prophecies, shall be safe. Those who stay and live in the
            places of my people also shall be safe. Then there will be
            much to rebuild. And soon --- very soon afterward --- Pahana
            will return. He shall bring with him the dawn of the Fifth
            World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their
            hearts. Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall
            smooth the way to the Emergence into the Fifth World.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But White
            Feather shall not see it. I am old and dying. You ---
            perhaps you will see it. In time, in time..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Hopi elder
            became silent. They had arrived at his destination, and Rev.
            Young stopped to let him out of the car. They never met
            again. Rev. Young died in 1976, so he did not live to see
            the further fulfillment of this remarkable prophecy.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The signs are
            interpreted thus: The First Sign is of guns, and the Second
            is of the pioneers’ covered wagons. The Third Sign is of
            longhorn cattle. The Fourth describes railroad tracks, and
            the Fifth is a clear image of electric power and telephone
            lines. The Sixth Sign describes concrete highways and their
            effect of producing mirages. The Seventh Sign predicts
            catastrophic oil spills such as the Exxon Valdez. The Eighth
            Sign suggests the hippy movement of the 1960s and 70s. The
            Ninth Sign was the US space station Skylab, which fell to
            Earth in 1979. According to Australian eyewitnesses, it
            appeared to be burning blue. Or, the Russian space station
            Mir may be indicated here.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another version
            of this prophecy says that when a black ribbon (the highway)
            is built on the land, a bug (the automobile) will move on
            it, and this will be this sign for the first shaking of the
            Earth, World War One. The first shaking will be so violent
            that the bug will be shaken off the earth and will begin to
            fly (the airplane), leaving a trail of dirt behind it.
            Eventually the sky will become so dirty that it will cause
            diseases that will become worse and worse. This may refer to
            the current controversy about "chem-trails", the aerial web
            of chemical sprays that are beings spewed over America.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another Hopi
            prophecy warns that nothing should be brought back from the
            Moon --- obviously anticipating the Apollo 11 mission that
            returned with samples of lunar basalt. The Hopi warned that
            it would disturb the balance of natural and universal laws
            and forces, resulting in earthquakes, severe changes in
            weather patterns, and social unrest. All these things are
            happening today.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1948, the
            Hopi spiritualist leaders chose four representatives to
            approach the United Nations. Because of their prophetic
            knowledge, the Hopi leaders felt it was time to go east to
            the edge of Turtle Island, where a "House of Mica [glass]
            would stand at this time, where Great Leaders from many
            lands would be gathered to help any people who are in
            trouble". They were to go there when the lands of the Hopi
            and other Indian brothers were about to be taken away from
            them and their way of life was in danger of being completely
            destroyed by evil ones among the white men and by some other
            Indian brothers who were influenced by the white race. This
            is a clear and present danger, because the infernal meddling
            of Christians, the betrayal of treaties by the federal
            government, the sale of tribal lands by Indians, and the
            ecological disasters caused by coal and uranium mining, are
            destroying the Hopi land and people, and all native
            Americans.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to
            prophecy, at least one, two, or three leaders or nations
            would hear and understand the Hopi warnings, for they too
            should know the ancient instructions. Upon hearing the
            message of the Hopi, they were to act immediately to correct
            many wrongs being done to the Red Man. However, the Hopi
            might find that the doors of the Mica House would be closed
            to them:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When Great
            Leaders in the Mica House refuse to open the door when you
            stand before it that day, do not be discouraged or turn
            about on the path you walk, but take courage, determination,
            and be of great rejoicing in your hearts, for on that day
            the White Race who are on your land with you have cut
            themselves from you and thereon lead themselves to the
            greatest Punishment at the Day of Purification. Men shall be
            destroyed for their sins and evil ways. The Great Spirit has
            decreed it and no one can stop it, change it, or add
            anything to it. It shall be fulfilled!"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1959,
            another delegation of six traditional Hopi elders, led by
            Dan Katchongva, traveled to the UN building. Their
            prophecies foretold that if the Hopi’s request to address
            the House of Mica was refused after knocking (visiting) four
            times, mankind would surely be destroyed. Thomas Banyaca
            knocked for the fourth time in 1991, and was permitted to
            address the General Assembly for a few minutes during the
            opening ceremonies of the UN's International Year of
            Indigenous Peoples December 10, 1992). He was the last
            speaker, and only a few UN delegates remained to hear him.
            He said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We have made a
            sacred covenant to follow Maasaw, the Great Spirit's Life
            Plan at all times, which includes the responsibility of
            taking care of this land and life for his divine purpose.
            Our goals are not to gain political control, monetary
            wealth, or military power, but rather to pray and to promote
            the welfare of all living beings and to preserve the world
            in a natural way."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Banyaca then
            told the Hopi story of the previous worlds which were
            destroyed because of human greed, and warned that this
            world, too, is near its end. He said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is now a
            time to weigh the choices for our future. We do have a
            choice. If you, the nations of this Earth, create another
            great war, the Hopi believe we humans will burn ourselves to
            death with ashes. That's why the spiritual Elders strongly
            urge that the United Nations fully open the door for Native
            spiritual leaders as soon as possible... The Native peoples
            of the world have seen and spoken to you about the
            destruction of their lives and homelands, the ruination of
            nature and the desecration of their sacred sites. It is time
            the United Nations used its rules to investigate these
            occurrences and stop them now."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Grandfather
            Banyaca requested that the UN protect the Four Corners area,
            because it will have a special purpose in the future
            survival of humankind. He asked that the UN keep its doors
            open for spiritual leaders of all peoples "to come to speak
            to you for more than a few minutes". He also invited world
            leaders to visit the Hopi country and "sit down with our
            real spiritual leaders in their sacred kiva" and learn their
            "ancient secrets of survival and balance." The UN has failed
            to respond.</font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Between 1975
            and 1986, a group of traditionalist elders and
            English-speaking Hopis cooperated to produce 44 issues of a
            newsletter called <i>Techqua Ikach</i> (<i>Land &amp; Life</i>),






            totaling over 200 pages which outlined their prophetic
            message in great detail. In 1993, Thomas Mails was selected
            by Dan Evehema (then 100 years old) to represent the
            authorized prophecies. The resulting book<i> Hotevila</i>

            Hopi Tribal Council was formed...The Bahanas’ government
            will gradually cease their responsibility in caring for the
            Native people... Any mistake we make will be our own doing.
            The Bahana government would not be responsible. Their
            influence would linger on in making sure we run our
            government the Bahana way, not by our own... traditional
            ways... If we link ourselves with a culture not of our
            own... it will be difficult to regain what we discard in the
            name of progress. Of course we can continue to practice what
            we lose, but it will have lost its value. What happens at
            the end will be the consequences of our carelessness.</font>

            traditionalists and the modernists. The traditionalists were
            forced to leave Oraibi and move to Hotevila. The second
            division took place in the aftermath of a spectacular UFO
            sighting in August 1970. The third division is occurring now
            as the Tribal Council has forced the installation of

            warm. You will experience snowfall at the height of planting
            time. Then you will have to sow wearing gloves and long
            underwear. To sow, the farmer will have to push aside the
            snow, dig a hole, and then plant his seeds. It will come to
            this if you extract those precious things from the earth.</font>

            grasses will not sprout. There will be no point in having

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Gradually your

            you sow, the stalks will still be short before the frost
            strikes. By the fourth time the plants will barely have

            the Earth will some day roll over in its orbit (Isaiah

            traditional "butterfly" hair arrangement) riding in a
            wingless, dome-shaped craft. The petroglyph tells of the

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The famous
            "Prophecy Rock" petroglyph (<b>Fig. 5</b>) is known as the
            Hopi Life Plan. Some people claim that the petroglyph was
            carved in the 20th century. A Hopi man (a resident of Old
            Oraibi) whom I met at Prophecy Rock told me it did not exist
            when he was a youth in the 1970s. The following explanation,
            transmitted by LeVan Martineau, was provided by the Hotevila
            faction and approved by the traditionalist Hopi elders:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In the figure
            of the Life Plan, (a) represents Maasaw pointing to the
            earth from which the Hopi emerged. The short lines (b)
            between his right hand and foot represent the Hopi clans. In
            recent years, the Hopi added a bow to the right of Maasaw to
            illustrate his instructions to lay down their weapons and
            live in peace. With his left hand, he is touching the path
            of Life Plan (c) which the Hopi are to follow. The circle
            (d) near his left hand represents the Hopi’s stewardship
            over Turtle Island.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Point (e)
            indicates the time when, as Maasaw predicted, the Hopi would
            digress from the True Path and follow another trail. The
            square (f) at this point is supposed to represent Oraibi.
            The two lines leading from Oraibi mark the split that
            occurred in 1905 between the progressive Oraibi and
            traditionalist Hotevila factions. The upper line (g)
            branching from the square is the false path of the wicked
            people who strive to dominate Nature and rise above other
            people without the guidance of God. The three human figures
            (h) on the false path are the generations of wicked people
            who walk that way. Hopi elders claim that in recent times,
            heads were added to the symbols. The lack of heads would
            represent the punishment of death that will befall the
            wicked.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Two zig-zag
            lines (I) branch from the false path. They represent
            carelessness and different paths to the final destruction
            pursued by the wicked people. Each zig and zag is another
            evil intention that eventually will be exhausted, which is
            indicated by the drooping symbol for turning around or
            sagging down (j) at their ends.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The lower
            straight line (k) is the true path of life leading to
            everlasting life (l), symbolized by the masked figure of
            Maasaw (o). He holds a planting stick in one hand while
            touching a corn stalk with the other. Maasaw stands waiting
            at the end of the True Path of Life because, as he says, ‘I
            am the first and I am the last.’</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The True Path
            is interrupted in three places by arches (m) which might
            have been complete circles at some time in the past. These
            are said to represent gourds, symbolizing three great
            ‘shakings’ or wars that will rattle humanity before the Life
            Plan is fulfilled. Hopi elders say the third gourd is the
            ‘final war of purification in which all evil will be
            destroyed.’</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Line (n),
            which also resembles a corn stalk, connects the false path
            with the true way. It offers a last chance for the wicked to
            repent and return to the Path of Life. The two
            dead-endzig-zag trails indicate complete and permanent
            destruction of body and soul, since they continue for only a
            short distance beyond the point of no return.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Symbol (p) is
            obscured by scratches, but the Hopis claim it is a crucifix,
            added to the petroglyph after a bloody 17th century
            encounter with the Spanish. The symbol was at Maasaw’s
            behest to show that Christianity is incompatible with the
            Hopi Life Plan, and should not merge with it."<b> (10)</b></font>

        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Deganawida ("He
            the Thinker") was a wise prophet of the Iroquois. He lived
            at the same time as the great chief Hiawatha, circa 1500. At
            that time the Iroquois nations were at war among themselves.
            Deganawida was given a vision of a gigantic spruce tree
            which reached up to the sky to the Elder Brothers,
            symbolizing the Family of Humanity. Deganawida began to
            preach a religion of love and harmony, thereby bringing
            unity to the Iroquois nations, a great confederacy that
            lasted more than 300 years. In another vision, Deganawida
            foresaw the destiny of the native Americans. That vision was
            transmitted orally until Edmund Wilson published it in his <i>Apologies






              to the Iroquois</i>:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When
            Deganawida was leaving the Indians in the Bay of Quinte in
            Ontario, he told them that they would face a time of great
            suffering. They would distrust their leaders and the
            principles of peace of the League, and a great white serpent
            [Caucasians] was to come upon the Iroquois. For a time, it
            would intermingle with the Indian people and be accepted by
            the Indians, who would treat the serpent as a friend. This
            serpent would in time become so powerful that it would
            attempt to destroy the Indians; the serpent was described as
            choking the life’s blood out of the Indian people.
            Deganawida told the Indians that they would seem to be lost,
            but when things looked their darkest a red serpent [China]
            would come from the north and approach the white serpent,
            which would be terrified; upon seeing the red serpent, he
            would release the Indian, who would fall to the ground like
            a helpless child, and the white serpent would turn all its
            attention to the red serpent. This bewilderment would cause
            the white serpent to accept the red serpent momentarily. The
            white serpent would be stunned and take part of the red
            serpent and accept him. Then there will be a heated argument
            and a fight. Then the Indian revives and crawls toward the
            land of the hilly country where he would assemble his people
            together and they would renew their faith and the principles
            of peace that Deganawida had established. There would at the
            same time exist among the Indians a great love and
            forgiveness for his brother, and in this gathering would
            come streams from all over --- not only the Iroquois, but
            from all over --- and they would gather in the hilly
            country, and they would renew their friendship. Deganawida
            said they would remain neutral in this fight between the
            white serpent and the red serpent.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At the time
            they were watching the two serpents locked in this battle, a
            great message would come to them and make them ever so
            humble, and when they had become that humble, they will be
            waiting for a young leader, an Indian boy, possibly in his
            teens, who would become a choice seer. Nobody knows who he
            is or where he comes from, but he will be given great power
            and would be heard by thousands, and he would give them the
            guidance and the hope to refrain from going back to their
            land and he would become the accepted leader. Deganaweda
            said that they will gather in the land of the hilly country
            between the branches of an elm tree, and they should burn
            tobacco and call upon Deganawida by name when they are
            facing their darkest hours, and he will return. Deganawida
            said that as the choice seer speaks to the Indians, they
            will notice to south a black serpent [Africans] coming from
            the sea. He is described as dripping with salt water. And as
            he stands there, he rests for a spell to get his breath, all
            the time watching to the north to the land where the white
            serpent and the red serpent are fighting.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Deganawida
            said that the battle between the white and the red serpents
            would open slowly, then become so violent that the mountains
            would crack and the rivers would boil and the fish would
            turn up their bellies. He said that there would be no leaves
            on the trees in that area. There would be no grass, and
            strange bugs and beetles would crawl from the ground and
            attack both serpents. He said that a great heat would cause
            the stench of death to sicken both serpents. And then, as
            the boy seer is watching this fight, the red serpent reaches
            around the back of the white serpent and pulls from him a
            hair. The hair suddenly turns into a woman, a white woman
            who tells him strange things that he knows to be true, but
            he wants to hear them again. When this white woman finished
            telling these things, he takes her and gently places her on
            a rock with great love and respect, and then he becomes
            infuriated at what he has heard, so he makes a beeline for
            the north, and he enters the battle between the red and
            white serpents with such speed and anger that he defeats the
            two serpents who have already become battle-weary.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When he
            finishes, he stands on the chest of the white serpent, and
            he boasts and puts his chest out like he’s the conqueror,
            and he looks for another serpent to conquer. He looks to the
            land of the hilly country and then he sees the Indian
            standing there with his arms folded and looking so noble
            that he knows that this Indian is not the one that he should
            fight. The next direction he will face will be eastward, and
            at that time he will be momentarily blinded by a light that
            is many times brighter than the sun. The light will be
            coming from the east to the west over the water, and when
            the black serpent regains his sight, he becomes terrified
            and makes a run for the sea. He dips into the sea and swims
            away in a southerly direction, and shall never again be seen
            by the Indians.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The white
            serpent revives, and he, too, sees this light, and he makes
            a feeble attempt to gather himself and to go toward that
            light. A portion of the white serpent refuses to leave, but
            instead makes its way toward the land of the hilly people.
            The red serpent would revive and he would shiver with a
            great fear when he sees that light. He would crawl toward
            the north and leave a bloody trail, and he would never be
            seen again by the Indians. Deganawida said that as this
            light approaches he would be that light, and he would return
            to his Indian people would be a greater nation than they
            ever were before." <b>(11)</b></font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Teton Sioux
            Chief Crazy Horse received this vision toward the end of his
            life:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"He saw his
            people being driven into spiritual darkness and poverty
            while the white people prospered in a material way all
            around them. But even in the darkest times, he saw that the
            eyes of a few of his people kept the light of dawn and the
            wisdom of the earth, which they passed on to some of their
            grandchildren. He saw the coming of automobiles and
            airplanes, and twice he saw the great darkness and heard the
            screams and explosions when millions of people died in two
            great world wars.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But he saw,
            after the second great war passed, a time come when his
            people began to awaken, not all at once, but a few here and
            there, and then more and more, and he saw that they were
            dancing in a beautiful light of the Spirit World under the
            Sacred Tree even while still on Earth. Then he was amazed to
            see that dancing under the tree were representatives of all
            races who had become brothers, and he realized that the
            world would be made new again and in peace and harmony not
            just by his people, but by members of all races of mankind."

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At the

            legs the waters will flood in, and a world cycle will come
            to its end. It is said that the buffalo now stands on one
            leg and is almost bald." <b>(13, 14)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several other
            Indian seers, and whole groups of Sun-Dancers, have received
            visions which deserve notice here. The Seneca Grandfather
            Moses Shongo (died ca. 1925) foresaw a 25-year period of
            purification, lasting until the year 2012 or so, during
            which the Earth will purge itself.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the late
            1980s, while the Blackfeet people were convening their
            sacred Sun Dance, the skies darkened with black storm clouds
            that hid the sun. Then there was utter stillness. The clouds
            withdrew from around the sun, and a white cloud appeared in
            its place. The cloud drew near, changing its shape until it
            assumed the form of a man, suspended in mid-air and visible
            to the people. The being spoke, telling them "Do not be
            disturbed, but to be patient a little while longer, for He
            would come again and lead them out of the darkness into the
            light, and they would not suffer the same way again".
            Meanwhile, the people were to purify themselves with prayer
            and sweat lodges. Thus, they would be prepared to receive
            Him when He returned to live with them and lead them to
            peace at home.<b>(15)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The oral
            traditions of the Navajo also warn of the Time of the End.
            The Navajo expect a New Faith to come to them, like the
            dawn. At first, only a few people who are prepared and
            awaiting the event will be aware of it. Then more and more
            people, and eventually everyone, will see it. The Navajo
            chants say that there are two signs of the new Spirit. The
            first is a Nine-pointed Star that will come from the East
            and unify all races and nations with love. The second sign
            will be a great chief, also in the east, who will wear a
            headdress with twelve feathers. Each feather represents a
            spiritual principle which he will teach. The Navajo Unity
            Chant says:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In the Day of
            Unity you will walk in beauty; the beauty will walk before
            you; the beauty will walk behind you; you will be surrounded
            by beauty. Through the beautiful teachings of a new Prophet
            of God, these meanings will become very clear. Man himself
            in this Age has found many ways to create beauty. With these
            beautiful things we must now have beautiful minds. With
            beautiful minds we will have beautiful hearts. With
            beautiful hearts we will talk in beauty. The speech of all
            men will be in beauty... Those who speak with beautiful
            speech will lead the world to beauty... The center of this
            beautiful speech comes from a Holy Mountain..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In May 1996, a
            96-year old Navajo woman named Irene Yazzie claimed she was
            visited by two tribal deities at her hogan near Big Mountain
            in northeast Arizona. The deities, one of whom was
            identified as Maasaw, appeared as old men. They warned
            Yazzie thus:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Drought,
            poverty and desolation on the reservation are all proof that
            the Navajos are in grave danger if they continue to forsake
            their traditions."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In June 1996,
            the Star Knowledge Conference and Sun Dance was held on the
            Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The gathering
            was convoked in response to a vision received by Standing
            Elk, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Sioux. According to
            the vision (and in fulfillment of Sioux and Hopi
            prophecies), Native Americans were to share their knowledge
            about extra-terrestrial Star Nations. Shamans and
            spokespersons from a dozen tribes came because they too had
            seen signs which indicated that they were to reveal their
            secret oral traditions about their tribal origins among the
            stars, and the return of the Star nations. In his address,
            Oglala Sioux holy man Floyd Hand said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Each Native
            American tribe has its extra-terrestrial race [ancestors].
            The Star People will return in the latter part of the 1990s.
            Changes will happen as their time draws near. The first sign
            is floods, fire, and earthquakes. There will be a world
            Great Drought in 1997-1999. Many will starve. There will be
            destruction of electrical and sewer lines, loss of cities
            and many lives. In 1998 White Buffalo Calf Woman is coming
            back to Turtle Island [North America]. There are four omens.
            The First Omen was the recent birth of a white buffalo calf
            on a White ranch, whose hide eventually turned the other
            colors of the Four Nations (yellow, red and black). The
            Second Omen was the birth of another white buffalo calf to a
            Sioux rancher, but it died... The Third Omen was a third
            white calf, but no one is listening despite human suffering
            and death. The Fourth Omen will be the Star People coming
            and visiting in Santa Fe, New Mexico."</font> </big></p>

            their pain. In these times that are coming, she told me, we
            must learn to help women regain their power. If the women do
            not reclaim their power, it is told, the world will be lost.
            Because the men no longer act like men. They are not noble

            upon the land. These plagues will spread through your waters
            and through your blood and through your food because you

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The great Shawnee
            chief, Tecumseh, was a warrior, a diplomat, a peacemaker and
            a prophet. He accurately prophesied to the day the great
            earthquake at New Madrid, IL (December 18, 1811) several
            months before it occurred. Tecumseh and his brother
            organized a confederacy of tribes to fight the menace of the
            United States. After the Battle of Tippecanoe (1811), in
            which his brother Tenskwatawa was defeated, Chief Techumseh
            sent a message, delivered by prisoners he released to
            General William H. Harrison:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Harrison will not win
            this year to be the great chief. But he may win next year.
            If he does, he will not finish his term. He will die in
            office."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the prisoners
            argued, "But Chief Tecumseh, no president has ever died in
            office".</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Harrison will die, I
            tell you," Tecumseh said. "And when he dies you will
            remember the deaths of my people. You think that I have lost
            my powers: I who caused the sun to darken and red men to
            give up firewater. But I tell you Harrison will die. And
            after him, every great chief chosen every twenty years
            thereafter will die. And when each one dies, let everyone
            remember the death of our people."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before Tecumseh left
            for the Battle of the Thames in Canada (October 13, 1813),
            he gave away his possessions and made this prophecy to
            Tenskwatawa:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Brother, be of good
            cheer. Before one winter shall pass, the chance will yet
            come to build our nation and drive the Americans from our
            land. If this should fail, then a curse shall be upon the
            great chief of the Americans, if they shall ever pick
            Harrison to lead them.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"His days in power
            shall be cut short. And for every twenty winters following,
            the days in power of the great chief which they shall select
            shall be cut short. Our people shall not be the instrument
            to shorten their time. Either the Great Spirit shall shorten
            their days or their own people shall shoot them.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is not all. Each
            contest to select their great chief shall be marked by sharp
            divisions within their nation. Within seven winters of each
            contest, there shall be a war among their people, either
            within their nation or with other nations, I know not which.
            Our people shall prosper only if they can avoid these wars."</font>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When President Harrison
            died of pneumonia on April 4, 1841, many began to believe in
            Tecumseh's curse. Since then, every president elected in a

                who was elected in those periods died during his term in
                office: William Harrison (1841, pneumonia), Abraham

                statistically significant results (0.012). According to
                Capobianco, “There is slightly better than one chance in
                a hundred that the seven deaths would have occurred in
                this way... The average interval of 20.44 years [between
                presidential deaths in office] is nearly the same length
                as the interval for the double cycle in sunspots (21.22
                years). Furthermore, the presidential deaths always
                occurred near the extreme dip in the sunspot cycle. In

                became inoperative in 1981 because the Jupiter-Saturn

Stalking







                  Wolf ~</big></font></font></b> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 1920s,
            the Apache elder Stalking Wolf, who was the mentor of master
            tracker Tom Brown, Jr., received this horrid vision of the
            self-destruction of white men in North America. Only one
            sign remains to be fulfilled before the Purification begins:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The Earth is
            dying. The destruction of man is close, so very close, and
            we must all work to change that path of destruction. We must
            pay for the sins of our grandfathers and grandmothers, for
            we have long been a society that kills its grandchildren to
            feed its children. There can be no rest, and we cannot run
            away; far too many in the past have run away. It is very
            easy to live a spiritual life away from man, but the truth
            of Vision, in spiritual life, can only be tested and become
            a reality when lived near society...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I had a
            Vision... of the destruction of man. But man was given four
            warnings to that destruction, two of which gave man a chance
            to change his ways and two of which would give the children
            of the Earth time to escape the Creator’s wrath...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They will be
            obvious to you and to those who have learned to listen to
            the spirit of the Earth, but to those who live within the
            flesh and know only flesh, there is no knowing or
            understanding. When these signs, these warnings and
            prophecies, are made manifest, then you will understand the
            urgency of what I speak. Then you will understand why people
            must not just work for their own spiritual rapture but to
            bring that rapture to the consciousness of modern man".</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The spirit of a
            warrior appeared to Stalking Wolf and transported him to
            another time and place, saying:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"These are the
            things yet to come that will mark the destruction of man.
            These things you may never see, but you must work to stop
            them and pass these warnings on to your grandchildren. They
            are the possible futures of what will come to pass if man
            does not obey the laws of Creation and the Creator. There
            are four signs, four warnings, that only the children of the
            earth will understand. Each warning marks the beginning of a
            possible future, and as each warning becomes reality, so too
            does the future it marks."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first sign
            was of a famine in Africa. Stalking Wolf found himself in a
            dying village. The spirit of a shaman spoke to him, saying:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Welcome to
            what will be called the land of starvation. The world will
            one day look upon all of this with horror and will blame the
            famine on the weather and the Earth. This will be the first
            warning to the world that man cannot live beyond the laws of
            Creation, nor can he fight Nature. If the world sees that it
            is to blame for this famine, this senseless starvation, then
            a great lesson will be learned. But I am afraid that the
            world will not blame itself but that the blame will be
            placed on Nature. The world will not see that it created
            this place of death by forcing these people to have larger
            families. When the natural laws of the land were broken, the
            people starved, as Nature starves the deer in winter when
            their numbers are too many for the land to bear...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"These people
            should have been left alone. They once understood how to
            live with the Earth, and their wealth was measured in
            happiness, love and peace. But all of that was taken from
            them when the world saw theirs as a primitive society. It
            was then that the world showed them how to farm and live in
            a less primitive way. It was the world that forced them to
            live outside the laws of creation and as a result is now
            forcing them to die...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This will be
            the first sign. There will come starvation before and after
            this starvation, but none will capture the attention of the
            world with such impact as does this one. The children of the
            Earth will know the lessons that are held in all of this
            pain and death, but the world will only see it as drought
            and famine, blaming Nature instead of itself."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It is during
            the years of the famine, the first sign, that man will be
            plagued by a disease... that will sweep the land and
            terrorize the masses. The white coats [doctors] will have no
            answers for the people and a great cry will arise across the
            land. The disease will be born of monkeys, drugs and sex. It
            will destroy man from the inside, making common sickness a
            killing disease. Mankind will bring this disease upon
            himself as a result of his life, his worship of sex and
            drugs, and a way of life away from Nature. This, too, is a
            part of the first warning, but again man will not heed this
            warning and he will continue to worship the false gods of
            sex and the unconscious spirit of drugs.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The drugs will
            produce wars in the cities of man, and the nations will
            arise against those wars, against that killing disease. But
            the nations will fight in the wrong way, lashing out at the
            effect rather than the cause. It will never win these wars
            until the nation, until society, changes its values and
            stops chasing the gods of sex and drugs. It is then, in the
            years of the first sign, that man can change the course of
            the probable future. It is then that there can still be
            hope. But once the second sign of destruction appears, the
            Earth can no longer be healed on a physical level. Only a
            spiritual healing can then change the course of the probable
            futures of mankind."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The landscape
            appeared drier, there was no vegetation to be seen, and
            animals lay dying. A great stench of death arose from the
            land... The sun seemed to be larger and more intense; no
            birds or clouds could be seen; the air seemed thicker still.
            It was then that the sky seemed to surge and huge holes
            began to appear. The holes tore with a thunderous sound, and
            the very Earth, rocks and soil shook.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The skin of
            the sky seemed to be torn open like a series of gaping
            wounds, and through these wounds seeped a liquid that seemed
            like the oozing of an infection..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The spirit
            warrior said to Stalking Wolf:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Holes in the
            sky... will become the second sign of the destruction of
            man. The holes in the sky and all that you have seen could
            become man’s reality. It is here that man must heed the
            warning and work harder to change the future at hand. But
            man must not only work physically, he must also work
            spiritually, through prayer, for only through prayer can man
            now hope to heal the Earth and himself...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"These holes
            are a direct result of man's life, his travel, and of the
            sins of his grandfathers and grandmothers. These holes, the
            second sign, will mark the killing of his grandchildren and
            will become a legacy to man’s life away from nature. It is
            the time of these holes that will mark a great transition in
            mankind's thinking. They will then be faced with a choice, a
            choice to continue following the path of destruction or a
            choice to move back to the philosophy of the Earth and a
            simpler existence. It is here that the decision must be
            made, or all will be lost..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first sign
            was the famine in Biafra and the outbreak of AIDS. The
            second sign obviously refers to the huge holes now appearing
            in the Earth’s ozone layer. Stalking Wolf had a third
            vision:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The sky
            suddenly turned back to a liquid and then turned blood red.
            As far as his eyes could see, the sky was solid red, with no
            variation in shadow, texture or light... As sunset drifted
            to night, the stars shone red, the color never leaving the
            sky, and everywhere was heard the cries of fear and pain.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This, then, is
            the third sign, <b>The Night of the Bleeding Stars</b>. It
            will become known throughout the world, for the sky in all
            lands will be red with the blood of the sky, day and night.
            It is then, with the sign of the third probable future, that
            there is no longer hope. Life on Earth as man has lived it
            will come to an end, and there can be no turning back,
            physically or spiritually. It is then, if things are not
            changed during the second sign, that man will surely know
            the destruction of the Earth is at hand. It is then that the
            children of the Earth must run to the wild places and hide.
            For when the sky bleeds fire, there will be no safety in the
            world of man...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"From this
            time, when the stars bleed, to the fourth and final sign
            will be four seasons of peace. It is in these four seasons
            that the children of the Earth must live deep in the wild
            places and find a new home, close to the Earth and the
            Creator. It is only the children of the Earth who will
            survive, and they must live the philosophy of the Earth,
            never returning to the thinking of man. And survival will
            not be enough, for the children of the Earth must also live
            close to the spirit. So tell them not to hesitate if and
            when this third sign becomes manifest in the stars, for
            there are but four seasons to escape.</font> </big></p>

            ten years the children of the Earth must remain hidden in
            the wild places, make no permanent camps, and wander to
            avoid contact with the last remaining forces of man. They
            must remain hidden, like the ancient scouts and fight the

            and anguish. Roving bands of men will hunt and kill other
            men for food, and water will always be scarce, getting
            scarcer with each passing year. The land, the water, the sky
            will all be poisoned, and man will live in the wrath of the
            Creator. Men will hide at first in the cities, but there he
            will die. A few will run to the wilderness, but the
            wilderness will destroy them, for they had long ago been
            given a choice. Man will be destroyed, his cities in ruin,
            and it is then that the grandchildren will pay for the sins
            of their grandfathers and grandmothers...</font> </big></p>

            (Washington). In his book <i>Black Dawn/Bright Day</i>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to

            scrolls, tell this prophecy:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"[Our great
            ancestors] saw the coming of the Europeans to this
            continent. They saw the kinds of hats they would be wearing.
            They saw how they would look and the kind of canoes they
            would have. They were told that if these people came in a
            sacred manner and accepted the knowledge that was given them
            by the people of this continent, then it would be a
            beautiful thing. We would walk as brothers and sisters on
            the land.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It soon became
            obvious that the Europeans didn’t respect the sacred
            teachings of the land. Our prophecies said that if this
            happened, there would come a time when we would lie in the
            dust for 100 years or more as if we were dead. Even our own
            people wouldn’t respect our teachings, and both Native and
            non-Native people would fail to understand them. Some
            Natives would turn from the teachings and be lured away
            saying, ‘This is a better teaching.’</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Our prophecies
            also said that at the end of that 100 years, we would be
            walking on our hind legs again. We would be alive as if we
            were Earth spirits just reborn. We would stand up and have
            our power again. We would be able to call in the forces ---
            the thunder and the lightning and the storms --- and
            communicate with these powers all the time because this is
            part of our ancient knowledge. We would have these abilities
            again, and we would return to the sacred path.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At that time,
            our sons and daughters would again come to us and ask to be
            taught the sacred ways. And the sons and daughters of the
            people who had come across the great Water would come to us
            too. they would say, ‘teach us, for we are about to destroy
            the Earth.’ This is the stage we are at right now...</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Another
            prophecy of my Native people speaks of a time when the Earth
            would hold back her increase: one area would be too wet;
            another too dry. One place would be too hot; another, too
            cold. this is what we are experiencing now... Another part
            of the prophecy states that the rivers will change their
            courses."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sun Bear also
            described one of his Dreams of Destruction:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Over a period
            of time I have had many, many dreams that showed the coming
            of the Earth changes... One reason that I organized the Bear
            Tribe as a rural-base community was because I saw in my
            dreams major destruction coming to the cities.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I saw a time
            when the cities wouldn't exist in their present state.
            During the changes the most dangerous places will be near
            cities with nuclear and chemical plants. But all major
            cities will experience a breakdown in services. In my
            dreams, I've seen great garbage piles on the streets, the
            electric service out of order because of storms...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I also foresee
            race riots in the big cities, with street gangs engaged in
            uncontrolled fighting against each other, using guns to get
            what they want. When there is no money to pay their
            salaries, the police will not be there to protect the people
            in the city. Instead, in one of my dreams, I saw the police
            banded together in groups calling themselves the 'Brothers
            of the Gun.' They were using their guns to take whatever
            they wanted. This is already happening in other parts of the
            world...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I see the
            cities being hit by major epidemics caused by bad water,
            toxic chemicals, or other things...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In my dreams,
            I've also seen wheat crops that had rusted. They had
            candy-like clumps of rust, a serious disease that was
            destroying the crops. There were great black birds like
            crows or vultures, just waiting. With nothing left to eat,
            these birds were scavenging bodies as humans died... In my
            dreams I see diseases like this continuing to cause great
            destruction...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In my dreams
            I've also seen small bands of people living very close to
            the Earth. I saw that other people would come to join them,
            and they would embrace these newcomers. All they said to
            them was, 'You have survived.' There were no more 'isms' in
            the world -- not Catholicism, not Communism, nothing. We
            were all just human beings living on the Earth in a sacred
            manner...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I see about
            one-fourth of the world's population surviving. All those

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The vision
            received by George Washington in the winter of 1777 is one
            of the most fascinating of all American prophecies.
            Washington told his vision to Anthony Sherman, who recounted
            it to Wesley Bradshaw, publisher of the <i>National Stripes</i>:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The last time
            I ever saw Anthony Sherman was on the 4th of July, 1859, in
            Independence Square. He was then 99 years old, and becoming
            very feeble. But though so old, his dimming eyes rekindled
            as he gazed upon Independence Hall, which he had come to
            visit once more.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Let's go into
            the hall", he said. "I want to tell you of an incident in
            Washington's life --- one which no one alive knows of except
            myself; and if you live, you will before long see it
            verified. Mark the prediction; you will see it verified.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"From the
            beginning of the revolution we experienced all phases of
            fortune, now good and now ill, one time victorious and
            another conquered. The darkest period we had, I think, was
            when George Washington, after several reverses, retreated to
            Valley Forge, where he resolved to pass the winter of 1777.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Ah, I have
            often seen tears coursing down our dear commander's
            care-worn cheeks, as he would be conversing with a
            confidential officer about the condition of his poor
            soldiers. You have doubtless heard the story of Washington
            going to the thicket to pray. Well, it was not only true,
            but he used to pray in secret for aid and comfort. And God
            brought us safely through the darkest days of tribulation.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"One day, I
            remember it well, the chilly winds whispered through the
            leafless trees, though the sky was cloudless and the sun
            shone brightly. He noticed that his face was a shade paler
            than usual, and there seemed to be something on his mind of
            more than ordinary importance. After a preliminary
            conversation of about half an hour, Washington, gazing upon
            his companion with that strange look of dignity which he
            alone could command, said to the latter:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I do not know
            whether it is owing to the anxiety of my mind, or what, but
            this afternoon, as I was sitting at this table engaged in
            preparing a dispatch, something in the apartment seemed to
            disturb me. Looking up I beheld standing opposite me a
            singularly beautiful being. So astonished was I, for I had
            given strict orders not to be disturbed, that it was some
            moments before I found language to inquire the cause of the
            visit. A second, a third, and even a fourth time did I
            repeat the question, but received no answer from my
            mysterious visitor except a slight raising of the eyes.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"By this time I
            felt strange sensations spreading over me. I would have
            risen but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered
            volition impossible. I assayed once more to speak but my
            tongue had become useless, as if paralyzed. A new influence,
            mysterious, potent, irresistible, took possession of me. All
            I could do was to gaze steadily, vacantly, at my unknown
            visitor.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Gradually the
            surrounding atmosphere seemed to fill with sensations, and
            grew luminous. Everything about me seemed to rarefy, the
            mysterious visitor also becoming more airy, and yet more
            distinct to my eyes than before. I began to feel as one
            dying, or rather to experience the sensations which I have
            sometimes imagined accompany death. I did not think, I did
            not reason, I did not move. All alike were impossible. I was
            only conscious of gazing fixedly, vacantly at my companion.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Presently I
            heard a voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn,'
            while at the same time my visitor extended an arm eastward.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now I beheld a
            heavy white vapor at some distance rising fold upon fold.
            This gradually dissipated, and I looked upon a strange
            scene. Before me lay, spread out in one vast plain all the
            countries of the world --- Europe, Asia, Africa, and
            America. I saw rolling and tossing between Europe and
            America the billows of the Atlantic, and between Asia and
            America lay the Pacific. 'Son of the Republic,' said the
            mysterious voice as before, 'Look and learn.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At that moment
            I beheld a dark shadowy being like an angel, standing or
            rather floating in mid-air between Europe and America.
            Dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand,
            he sprinkled some upon America with his right hand, while
            with his left he cast some over Europe. Immediately a cloud
            arose from these countries and joined in mid-ocean. For a
            while it seemed stationary, and then it moved slowly
            westward until it enveloped America in its murky folds.
            Sharp flashes of lightning gleamed through it at intervals,
            and I heard the smothered groans and cries of the American
            people.</font> </big></p>

            the angel dipped from the ocean and sprinkled it out as
            before. The dark cloud was then drawn back into the ocean in
            whose heaving billows it sank as before.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A third time I
            heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic,
            look and learn.' I cast my eyes upon America and beheld
            villages and towns and cities springing up one after another
            until the whole land from the Atlantic to the Pacific was
            dotted with them. Again I heard the mysterious voice saying,
            'Son of the Republic, the end of the century cometh; look
            and learn.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And this time
            the dark shadowy angel turned his face southward. From
            Africa I saw an ill-omened spectre approach our land. It
            flitted slowly and heavily over every town and city of the
            latter. The inhabitants presently set themselves in battle
            array against each other. As I continued looking, I saw a
            bright angel on whose brow rested a crown of light on which
            was traced the word 'Union.' He was bearing the American
            flag. He placed the flag between the divided nation and
            said, 'Remember, ye are brethren.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Instantly, the
            inhabitants, casting down their weapons, became friends once
            more and united around the National Standard.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Again I heard
            the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and
            learn.' At this the dark shadowy angel placed a trumpet to
            his mouth and blew three distinct blasts; and taking water
            from the ocean, he sprinkled it upon Europe, Asia and
            Africa.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then my eyes
            beheld a fearful scene. From each of these continents arose
            thick black clouds that were soon joined into one. And
            through this mass there gleamed a dark red light by which I
            saw hordes of armed men. These men, moving with the cloud,
            marched by land and sailed by sea to America, which country
            was enveloped in the volume of the cloud. And I dimly saw
            the vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the
            villages, towns and cities which I had seen springing up.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"As my ears
            listened to the thundering of the cannon, clashing of
            swords, and the shouts and cries of millions in mortal
            combat, I again heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of
            the Republic, look and learn.' When this voice had ceased,
            the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his
            mouth and blew a long and fearful blast.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Instantly a
            light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me and
            pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which
            enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose
            head still shone the word ‘Union’ and who bore our national
            flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from
            the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These
            immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I
            perceived were well-nigh overcome but who immediately,
            taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and
            renewed the battle.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Again, amidst
            the fearful noise of the conflict I heard the mysterious
            voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn.' As the
            voice ceased, the shadowy angel for the last time dipped
            water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon America.
            Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the
            armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land
            victorious.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then once more
            I beheld the villages, towns and cities springing up where I
            had seen them before, while the bright angel, planting the
            azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried
            with a loud voice, 'While the stars remain, and the heavens
            send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the union last.'
            And taking from his brow the crown on which blazoned the
            word, 'Union,' he placed it upon the standard while the
            people kneeling down said, 'Amen.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The scene
            instantly began to fade and dissolve, and I at last saw
            nothing but the rising, curling vapor I at first beheld.
            This also disappeared, and I found myself once more gazing
            upon the mysterious visitor, who, in the same voice I had
            heard before, said, 'Son of the Republic, what you have seen
            is thus interpreted. Three great perils will come upon the
            republic. The most fearful for her is the third. But the
            whole world united shall not prevail against her. Let every
            child of the republic learn to live for God, his land and
            Union.' With these words the vision vanished, and I started
            from my seat and felt that I had seen a vision wherein had
            been shown me the birth, the progress, and destiny of the
            United States." <b>(19)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first peril
            foreseen by Washington was that of the War of Independence,
            the second danger was the Civil War, and the third will be a
            second revolution and civil war, complicated by the invasion
            of America by armies from Asia, Africa, and even Europe. The
            reference to "a light as of a thousand suns" suggests that
            nuclear weapons might be used to destroy the invaders.</font>

Molly







                  Pitcher ~</big></font></font></b> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two women, both
            named Molly Pitcher, figured as heroines in the American
            Revolution, and sometimes they are confused with each other.
            The best known Molly Pitcher was Mrs. Mary Hayes, wife of an
            artilleryman in the Continental Army. At the battle of
            Monmouth she carried water for the troops, and so was
            nicknamed "Molly Pitcher". When her husband was wounded, she
            took his position and kept firing the cannon for the
            duration of the battle. General Washington commissioned her
            as a sergeant to reward her bravery.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The other Molly
            Pitcher was a renowned seeress, born Mary (Molly) Diamond.
            She married Robert Pitcher, a shoemaker, when she was 20
            years old.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Molly’s ability
            as a psychic gave her access to British military secrets
            which she passed on to the revolutionaries. When General
            Washington took command of the American Army at Cambridge on
            July 3, 1775, Mary was presented to Washington as the
            "Daughter of our regiment." Washington said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You have
            adopted a sibyl and a saint."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the
            ceremony, Molly had a vision which she later told to
            Washington: an eagle hovered over him without unfolding its
            wings. Not until several years later was the eagle chosen as
            our national bird.Molly Pitcher also predicted several
            inventions, some of which remain to be discovered:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Thousands
            shall go behind a curl of smoke [locomotives]... Carriages
            will go at lightning speed and none shall see what propelled
            them [automobiles]... Men will ascend and descend Jacob’s
            Ladder of heaven like angels [the NASA space program]...
            Magnificent music will be conducted on wires hundreds of
            miles away and will play at the instigation of man...</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Men shall
            arise who will command the storms, turning and directing
            them at pleasure. Great heat will be prevented by the use of
            clouds which can be turned on or off at will, and water
            shall be pumped from them where drought is upon the earth.
            The frozen water in winter shall be thawed by glorious
            sunbeams led by sun conductors and several other wonderful

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">General George
            B. McClellan, chief of the Union Armies, had a dream vision
            that saved Washington DC and the Union itself in the second
            summer of the Civil War.<b> (20)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 2 a.m. of
            the third night after arriving in Washington to take command
            of the U.S. Army, General McClellan fell asleep while
            studying his map table. He had been asleep for about ten
            minutes when he imagined that the locked door of his room
            suddenly was thrown open. Someone entered and said in a
            powerful voice"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"General
            McClellan, do you sleep at your post? Rouse you, or ere it
            can be prevented the foe will be in Washington."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The general
            felt as though he were suspended in a void of infinite
            space. The voice continued to speak "from a hollow distance
            all about." He thought that he awoke from his sleep, but
            while the map table remained, the surrounding room had
            vanished, and he gazed upon a living map of the entire USA
            from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. The
            mysterious being beside him appeared only as a ghostly,
            man-shaped vapor.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">McClellan was
            amazed to see troop movements and the entire distribution of
            Confederate forces, and he was elated with the prospect of
            the victory he could realize with this new knowledge. But
            then he saw Confederates moving into select positions which
            he had chosen to occupy, and he realized that the enemy knew
            his plans. The voice spoke:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"General
            McClellan, you have been betrayed, and had God not willed
            otherwise, ere the sun of tomorrow had set, the Confederate
            flag would have waved above the Capitol and your own grave.
            But note what you see. Your time is short."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While the voice
            continued to describe the Confederate positions, McClellan
            wrote on his own map, making notes from the living map
            around him. The rest of his vision concerns what is now our
            near future:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I had been
            conscious of a shining light on my left that steadily
            increased until the moment I ceased my task, when it became,
            in an instant, more intense than the noonday sun. Quickly I
            raised my eyes, and never, were I to live forever, should I
            forget what I saw. The dim, shadowy figure was no longer a
            dim, shadowy one, but a glorified, refulgent figure of
            Washington, Father of his Country, and now, for the second
            time, its savior.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My friend, it
            would be utterly impossible for me to attempt to describe
            the majesty of that returned spirit. I can only say that
            Washington, as I beheld him in my dream (or trance as you
            may choose to call it), was the most God-like being I could
            have ever conceived of. Like a weak, dazzled bird, I sat
            gazing at the heavenly vision from the sweet and silent
            repose of Mt. Vernon. Our Washington had risen, to once more
            encircle and raise up with his saving arms our fallen and
            bleeding country. As I continued looking, an expression of
            sublime benignity came gently upon his face and for the last
            time I heard that slow, solemn voice saying something like
            this:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'General
            McClellan, while yet in the flesh I beheld the birth of the
            American Republic. It was indeed a hard and bloody one, but
            God’s blessing was upon the nation, and therefore, through
            this great struggle for existence, He sustained her with His
            mighty hand and brought her out triumphantly. A century has
            not passed since then, and yet the child republic has taken
            her position, a peer with nations whose pages of history
            extend for ages into the past. She has (since those days, by
            the favor of God) greatly prospered and now, by the very
            reason of this prosperity, she has been brought to her
            second struggle, this so far the most perilous ordeal she
            has to suffer in passing, as she is, from childhood to
            opening maturity.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"She is called
            upon to accomplish that vast result --- self-conquest --- to
            learn that important lesson --- self-control, self-rule,
            that in the future will place her in the van of power and
            civilization. It is here that all the nations hitherto have
            failed, and she, too, the republic of the earth, had God
            willed otherwise, would by tomorrow’s sunset, have been a
            heap of stones, cast up over the final grave of human
            liberty. But her cries have come up out of the borders like
            sweet incense unto heaven. She shall be saved. Then shall
            peace once more be upon her, and prosperity shall fill her
            with joy.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But her
            mission will not then be accomplished, for ere another
            century shall have gone by THE OPPRESSORS OF THE WHOLE
            EARTH, hating and envying her and her exaltation, SHALL JOIN
            THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND RAISE UP THEIR HANDS AGAINST HER.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But if she be
            found worthy of her high calling, they shall be truly
            discomfited and then will be ended her third and last
            struggle for existence. Henceforth shall the Republic go on,
            increasing in goodness and power, until her borders shall
            end only in the remotest corners of the earth, and the whole
            earth shall, beneath her shadowy wings, become a Universal
            Republic.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Let her in her
            prosperity, however, remember the Lord her God. Let her
            trust in Him and she shall never be confounded."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I inclined my
            head to receive his blessing, ‘the baptism of the spirit of
            Washington.’ The following instant peals of thunder rolled
            in upon me, and I awoke. The visitor had departed and I
            again was sitting in my apartment with everything exactly as
            it was before I fell asleep, with a few exceptions. The maps
            of which I had dreamed I had been marking were literally
            covered with a net of pencil signs and figures. I rose to my
            feet and rubbed my eyes, and took a turn or two around the
            room to recover myself. I had before me as complete a map
            and repository of information as though I had spent several
            years in gathering and recording its details.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Our beloved,
            glorious Washington shall again rest quietly, sweetly in his
            tomb, until perhaps the end of the Prophetic Century
            approaches once more, laying aside the crements of Mt.
            Vernon, to become Messenger of Succor and Peace from the
            Great Ruler, who has all nations of the Earth in his
            keeping.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But the future
            is too vast for our comprehension; we are the children of
            the present. When peace shall again have folded her bright
            wings and settled upon our land, the strange, unearthly map
            marked while the Spirit eyes of Washington looked down,
            shall be preserved among the American archives, as a
            precious reminder to the American nation of what in her
            second great struggle for existence, they owe to God and the
            Glorified Spirit of Washington. Verily, the works of God are
            above the understanding of man!"</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Convinced of
            the divine nature of his dream and by the new details on his
            map, General McClellan immediately rode along the Union
            front and made strategic changes necessary to meet the
            Confederates’ plan of attack on Antietam (September 17,
            1862). Thus he succeeded in preventing the capture ofthe
            Capitol, and saved the Union. However, he failed to pursue
            General Lee’s troops, and he was removed from command on
            account of that error.</font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">David G. Croly
            (1829-1889) was born in Ireland, and emigrated with his
            parents to New York. He became a journalist for the New York
            <i>Evening Post</i> and the <i>Herald</i>, and was editor
            of <i>World</i> magazine. Croly made his first prediction
            in 1871, foretelling in detail the Panic of 1873. He began
            writing the column "Sir Oracle" for the <i>Real Estate
              Record &amp; Builder’s Guide,</i> intended "to be read
            today and judged in the year 2000". The columns were
            reprinted in <i>Croly’s Glimpses of the Future</i> (1888).
            David Croly accurately predicted that Germany would
            instigate World War Two. He foretold of India’s independence
            from British rule, the dominance of the USSR, and new
            technologies such as motion pictures, photoelectric
            printing, air travel, and electric power. Croly also made
            predictions that still await fulfillment. He saw that new
            states will be formed from Texas and California, and a new
            Constitution will be adopted under the pressure of radical
            changes and civil war. The USA will expand to absorb Canada,

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mormons
            have produced several prophets who foretold of a second
            civil war in America, and its invasion. The Mormon prophets
            agree with each other and with George Washington, Gen.
            McClellan, and several European prophets in their
            descriptions of the horrors that will be America’s
            come-uppance.<b> (21)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big>The Mormon Elder John J. Roberts recorded a prophecy made
          by Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS Church, during a grand
          review of the Nauvoo Legion in May 1843. Theodore Turley also
          was present at the conversation. He reiterated the prophecy
          during a sermon about two weeks later. Smith said: </big></p>
      <p><big>"I want to tell you something. I will speak in a parable
          like unto John the Revelator. </big></p>
      <p><big>"You will go to the Rocky Mountains and you will be a
          great and mighty people established there, which I will call
          the 'White Horse of Peace and Safety'... I shall never go
          there. Your enemies will continue to follow you with
          persecutions and will make obnoxious laws against you in
          Congress to destroy the White Horse, but you will have a
          friend or two to defend you to throw out the worst part of the
          laws, so they will not hurt much. You must continue to
          petition Congress all the time, but they will treat you like
          strangers and aliens and will not give you your rights but
          will govern you with strangers and commissioners; you will see
          the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed; it
          will hang by a thread, as it were, as fine as the finest silk
          fiber. </big></p>
      <p><big>"I love the Constitution; it was made under the
          inspiration of God, and will be preserved and saved by the
          efforts of the White Horse and the Red Horse [the Indians] who
          will combine in its defense. The White Horse will raise an
          ensign on the tops of the mountains of peace and safety. The
          White Horse will find the mountains full of minerals and they
          will become very rich. You will see silver piled up in the
          streets. </big></p>
      <p><big>"You will see gold shoveled up like sand. Gold will be of
          little value even in a mercantile capacity, for the people of
          the world will have something else to do in seeking for
          salvation. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The time will come when the banks in every nation will
          fail and only two places will be safe where people can deposit
          their gold and treasures. These places will be the White Horse
          and England’s vaults. </big></p>
      <p><big>"A terrible revolution will take place in America such as
          has never been seen before, for the land will be literally
          left without a supreme government, and every species of
          wickedness will be rampant. It will be so terrible that father
          will be against son, mother against daughter, and daughter
          against mother. The most terrible scenes of murder, bloodshed,
          and rapine that has ever been looked on will take place. Peace
          will be taken from the earth, and there will be peace only in
          the Rocky Mountains. This will cause many thousands of honest
          heart to gather there, not because they would be saints but
          for safety and because they would not take up the sword
          against their neighbor. </big></p>
      <p><big>"You will be so numerous that you will be in danger of
          famine, but not for the want of seed time and harvest, but
          because of so many to be fed. Many will come with bundles
          under their arms to escape the calamities, and there will be
          no escape except by fleeing to Zion. </big></p>
      <p><big>"Those that come to you will try to keep the laws and be
          one with you, for they will see your unity and the greatness
          of your organization. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The Turkish Empire or the Crescent will be one of the
          first nations that will be disrupted, for freedom must be
          given for the Gospel to be preached in the Holy Land. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The Lord took of the best blood of the nations and
          planted them on the small islands now known as England and
          Great Britain, and gave them great power in the nations for a
          thousand years and their power will continue with them, that
          they may keep the balance of power and keep Russia from
          usurping her power all over the world. England and France are
          now bitter enemies, but they will be allied together and be
          united to keep Russia from conquering the world. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The two Popes, Greek and Catholic, will come together and
          be united... </big></p>
      <p><big>"While the terrible revolution of which I have spoken is
          going on, England will be neutral until it becomes so inhuman
          that she will interfere to stop the shedding of blood. England
          and France will unite together to subdue the nations; they
          will find the nations so broken up and so many claiming
          government, till there will be no responsible government. </big></p>
      <p><big>"Then it will appear to the other nations or powers as
          though England had taken possession of the country. The Black
          horse will flee to the invaders and join with them, for they
          will have fear of the coming slaves again, knowing England did
          not believe in slavery; fleeing to them they believe would
          make them safe; armed with British bayonets, the doings of the
          Black Horse will be terrible... </big></p>
      <p><big>"During this time the White Horse will have gathered
          strength, sending out Elders to gather the honest in heart
          among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand
          by the Constitution of the United States, as it was given by
          the inspiration of God. </big></p>
      <p><big>"In these days God will set up a kingdom, never to be
          thrown down, for other kingdoms to come unto. And these
          kingdoms that will not let the Gospel be preached will be
          humbled until they will. </big></p>
      <p><big>"England, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland,
          Holland, and Belgium have a considerable amount of blood of
          Israel among their people which must be gathered. These
          nations will submit to the kingdom of God. England will be the
          last of these kingdoms to surrender, but when she does so it
          will be as a whole in comparison as she threw off the Catholic
          power. The nobility know that the Gospel is true but it has
          not enough pomp and grandeur and influence for them to embrace
          it. They are proud, and will not acknowledge the Kingdom of
          God, or come unto it, until they see the power which it will
          have. </big></p>
      <p><big>"Peace and safety in the Rocky Mountains will be protected
          by a cordon band of the White Horse and the Red Horse. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The coming of the 10 Tribes of Israel, the coming of the
          Messiah among his people, will be so natural that only those
          who see Him will know that He has come, but he will come and
          give his laws unto Zion, and minister unto His people. This
          will not be His coming in the clouds of heaven to take
          vengeance upon the wicked of the world. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The Temple in Jackson County will be built in this
          generation. The saints will think there will not be time to
          build it, but with all the help you will receive you will put
          up a great temple quickly. They will have all the gold,
          silver, and precious stone; for these things only will be used
          for the beautifying of the temple; all the skilled mechanics
          you want, and the Ten Tribes of Israel will help you build it.
          When you see this land bound with iron you may look to Jackson
          County... </big></p>
      <p><big>"There is a land beyond the Rocky Mountains that will be
          invaded by the heathen Chinese unless great care and
          protection are given. Speaking of the heathen, where there is
          no law there is no condemnation; this will apply to them. </big></p>
      <p><big>"Power will be given to the White Horse to rebuke nations
          afar off, and they will be one with the White Horse, but when
          the law goes forth they will obey; for the law will go forth
          from Zion. </big></p>
      <p><big>"The last great struggle that Zion will have to contend
          with is when the whole of the Americas will be made the Zion
          of our God. </big></p>
      <p><big>"Those opposing will be called Gog and Magog. The nations
          of the world led by the Russian Czar and their power, will be
          great, but all opposition will be overcome and this land will
          be the Zion of our God." </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another prophecy
            uttered by Joseph Smith told how the Saints would go to the
            Rocky Mountains and become a great and wealthy people. In
            the latter days, however, Smith said:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There will be two
            great political parties in this country. One will be called
            the Republican, and the other the Democrat party. These two
            parties will go to war and out of these two parties will
            spring another party which will be the Independent American
            Party. The United States will spend her strength and means
            warring in foreign lands until other nations will say,
            'Let's divide up the lands of the United States'; then the
            people of the US will unite and swear by the blood of their
            forefathers, that the land shall not be divided. Then the
            country will go to war, and they will fight until one half
            of the US Army will give up, and the rest will continue to
            struggle. They will keep on until they are very ragged and
            discouraged, and almost ready to give up --- when the boys
            from the mountains rush forth in time to save the American
            Army from defeat and ruin. And they will say, 'Brethren, we
            are glad you have come; give us men, henceforth, who can
            talk with God'. Then you will have friends, but you will
            save the country when its liberty hangs by a hair, as it
            were."</font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On Christmas
            night in 1882, the Mormon Bishop Charles D. Evans had a
            vision in which he saw what is now our present and near
            future:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"While I
            continued to stare and marvel at the wondrous work before
            me, all of a sudden the scene vanished, and a new era,
            resultant, however, from the forces of the religious
            agencies before mentioned, burst upon my view. The history
            of American Independence, with the actors therein, passed
            before me. The Constitution of the United States was
            emblazoned upon an immense distance. Civil and religious
            toleration was general throughout the land. Man rejoiced in
            the privilege of worshipping God according to the dictates
            of conscience. Prosperity reigned. Angels smiles. Heaven
            approved. The fetters of political and religious
            intolerance, forged by the monarchs of the eastern world,
            were sundered, shall it be said forever? Such was my
            thought. I was full of joy at the sight; big tears of joy
            rolled down my cheeks, when all of a sudden, my attention
            was directed to a personage standing by my bedside, and who
            was attired in a white and flowing robe. Addressing me, he
            said, 'Son of Mortality, look."'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I looked and
            beheld a scene most revolting to my senses, from the fact
            that it was the reverse of the prosperity and religious
            freedom I had before witnessed. I saw the representatives of
            one branch of the Republic holding in their hands fetters
            they themselves had forged.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The personage,
            again addressing me, said,'"Knowest thou the meaning of
            these?'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I answered,
            'No.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"He replied,
            'These are the chains with which certain sons of the
            Republic, who have tasted the fruit of the tree of liberty,
            desire to bind their fellows. These are they who seek to
            subvert the cause of human freedom. These seek to enslave
            one portion of the children of freedom who differ from them
            in religious belief and practice. Know thou, my son, that
            their object is filthy lucre. They plot to take away human
            rights, and to destroy the freedom of the soul, to possess
            the homes of the industrious without fee or reward. Their
            souls shall be in derision, and the heavens shall laugh at
            their folly. Their calamity slumbereth not. But cast thine
            eyes eastward and look.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I looked and
            beheld that the bands that held society together during the
            reign of the republic, were snapped asunder. Society had
            broken loose from all restraints of principle and good
            conscience. Brotherhood had dissolved. Respect for common
            rights and even the rights of life and property had fled
            from the land. I saw faction after faction arise and contend
            with each other. Political strife was everywhere. Father and
            son alike contended in these awful feuds. The spirit of
            deadly hate... passed through the Republic. Blood was
            written every banner. The spirit of bloodshed appeared to
            possess every heart.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Turning to the
            person in white I exclaimed, 'Surely this means the total
            destruction of our nation."'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Touching my
            eyes with his finger, he replied: 'Look again.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I looked and
            beheld that many who were angry with the rulers of the
            Republic, for the subversion of the Constitutional law, and
            their wholesale plunder of the public moneys, arose and
            proclaimed themselves the friends of the Constitution in its
            original form. These looked around for some others to
            sustain the country's flag inviolate, pledging themselves
            and their fortunes and sacred honours to that end.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A voice was
            suddenly heard declaring these words: 'In the distant
            mountain tops are to be found the true lovers of freedom and
            equal rights, a people who have never made war upon each
            other. Go there, for only there can your lives and property
            be secure from the spoiler. There alone can the flag you
            love wave proudly for the protection of all people,
            irrespective of creed and color.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"While thus
            engaged I cast my eyes to the far west, when suddenly
            appeared on Ensign Peak, near Salt Lake City, a beautiful
            flag whereon was written these words: 'Friends of Human
            Liberty throughout the world, all hail! We greet you under
            the flag of freedom, our country's flag.' One shout of
            'Welcome' from the Mountain Sons of Freedom rent the air. I
            beheld that the multitude wept with joy. The laws were again
            administered in purity. The people prospered. Tyrants were
            hurled down. All religious bodies were equally protected
            before the law. No North, no South, no East, no West, but
            one unbroken nation whose banner waved for all the world. On
            this I awoke in tears of joy.<b>" (21)</b></font> </big></p>

            John Taylor, as recorded by Wilford Woodruff, and published
            in Kraut's <i>Visions of the Latter Days</i>, describes the
            horror in America:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I continued on my way
            passing through Omaha, Council Bluffs, and Iowa, and saw
            many women moving about in an excited manner. Sickness and
            death prevailed on all sides. The inhabitants of Illinois
            and Missouri were in dreadful condition, the men and women
            killing each other in the most brutal manner.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Next I visited the
            City of Washington DC and found the place deserted and in
            ruins. From there I went to Baltimore and on the square,
            where stands the monument of 1812, dead bodies of the
            inhabitants of the place were piled in heaps. While there I
            saw mothers cut the throats of their own children and drink
            the blood in order to quench their thirst. The waters of
            Chesapeake Bay were so befouled from the effect of the dead
            bodies that the water could not be used. Sickness and death
            prevailed throughout the city and the stench was something
            awful..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Taylor then visited

            would be impossible for me to describe them.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After these scenes had
            passed, I found myself standing on the left bank of the
            Missouri River, just oppsoite to where stood the City of
            Independence and soon discovered that the states of
            Illinois, Missouri, and part of Iowa had been swept clean of
            its inhabitants and the surrounding country was a complete
            wilderness...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I then looked over the
            country; in every direction as far as I could see, a similar
            condition prevailed. I then passed eastward above the earth
            and looking down saw many people coming west, mostly women
            who were carrying small bundleson their backs, and I thought
            it strange that there were so few men among them. They were
            on their way to the mountains, and I wondered how they could
            get there as the railroads were abandoned and the rails were
            in bad condition..." (KRAUT, Ogden: <i>The White Horse

            world. I saw on one side the Christian forces, and on the
            other side the Buddhist and Mohammedan forces. Throughout
            the world, I saw destruction of the land, industry at a

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The renowned
            American psychic Edgar Cayce was called "The Sleeping
            Prophet" because most of his messages were transmitted while
            he was in a sleep-like trance. Cayce was born in 1877. His
            psychic abilities began to manifest at the age of six, when
            he began to see and talk to "visions", some of which were
            recently deceased relatives. Cayce enhanced his education by
            sleeping with his schoolbooks under his pillow; he absorbed
            information by some unknown psychic talent which faded as he
            grew older. At age 21, he developed a paralysis of the
            larynx. Doctors could not find a cause or cure. Cayce healed
            himself by going into a trance and diagnosing his problem.
            Then he prescribed medication and therapy which restored his
            voice. Thereafter, a group of Kentucky physicians began to
            consult with Cayce to diagnose their patients. He required
            only the name and address of the patient in order to
            diagnose the person, regardless of the distance. <b>(22,

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Edgar Cayce
            gave over 14,000 documented "readings" for more than 8,000
            people during his 43-year career (he died on January 3,
            1945). He also made a number ofprophecies in odd Englishing

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There must
            eventually come a revolution in this country --- and there
            will be a dividing of the sections as one against another.
            For these are the leveling means and manners to which men
            resort when there is plenty in some areas and a lack of
            sustenance in others.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When many of
            the isles of the sea and many of the lands have come under

            who rather join themselves with that force by which they may
            proclaim might and power as right, as of a superman who is
            ideal for a generation to be established, then shall their

            There will appear open waters in the northern portions of
            Greenland. There will be seen new lands of the Caribbean

            covered all of the western part of the country, as the city
            where I lived was on the coast. The family name was a
            strange one. At an early age as a child I declared myself to
            be Edgar Cayce who had lived 200 years before. Scientists,
            men with long beads, little hair, and thick glasses, were
            called in to observe me. They decided to visit the places
            where I said I had been born, lived, and worked in Kentucky,
            Alabama, New York, Michigan, and Virginia. Taking me with
            them the group of scientists visited these places in a long,
            cigar-shaped metal flying ship which moved at a high speed.
            Water covered part of Alabama. Norfolk, Virginia, had become
            an immense seaport. New York had been destroyed either by
            war or an immense earthquake and was being rebuilt.
            Industries were scattered over the countryside. Most of the
            houses were built of glass. Many records of my work as Edgar
            Cayce were discovered and collected. The group returned to
            Nebraska, taking the records with them to study... These
            changes in the earth will come to pass, for the time and
            times and half times are at an end, and there begins those

            Martinique, the author of <i>Edgar Cayce and the End Times</i>

            prophecies of doom in the months before he died in 1945. His
            private journal was left to a friend with instructions that
            it be kept secret until October 30, 1994. The diary includes
            seven predictions for 1995-1999, and gives this warning:</font>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There's no
            doubt that the predictions are accurate because a number of
            them have already come to pass. Mr. Cayce foresaw the advent
            of AIDS, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of
            Iraq’s Saddam Hussein as an evil force in the Middle East
            --- events that occurred prior to October 30, 1994, but were
            included in the diary. The thrust of the little book,
            however, keys on events that will come to pass between 1995
            and 1999:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A wave of
            deadly plagues will sweep around the planet, killing over
            100 million people and disabling as many more. Acid rains
            will devastate the rain forests of South America and unleash
            new viruses that have been contained there for ages. An
            unknown source of radiation will appear on the floor of the
            Atlantic Ocean and it will kill the marine life there,
            leading to worldwide food shortages. Earthquakes in New
            York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Florida, Texas, California and
            Oregon will cripple Americ's economic infrastructure and
            complete collapse will ensue. A huge hole in the ozone layer
            will open over Europe in 1998, causing skin cancer for
            millions of people. In 1999, Saddam Hussein will attack
            Israel with nuclear weapons. The USA will intervene, and
            World War III will commence in full force. China will defeat
            a western alliance led by the US. The Chinese will force
            people to abandon religion and wear the 'Mark of the Beast'
            on their hands. In 1999, a child whom Cayce identifies as
            'Simeon' will appear in Israel and call himself Messiah. He
            will introduce an era of peace.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Cayce
            envisioned a virus similar to the Ebola virus. He says it
            will be spread by a cough or a sneeze --- and it will be
            99.9% fatal... While pockets of survivors will remain alive
            after the plague has swept the globe, Cayce believed the
            outbreak would virtually end mankind's reign on Earth... The
            diary says there will be a brief period of peace and harmony
            in 1999, just before the virus strikes. After that Cayce
            foresees the End times, just as the Bible itself foretells
            it. "</font> </big></p>

            him about events that would shatter civilization before the
            year 2000. Brinkley foresaw the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
            the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and "Desert Storm" in
            Kuwait. According to Brinkley, the USA will be shattered by
            "two horrendous earthquakes". Years later he wrote the book
            <i>Saved by the Light</i> to describe his experience:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The Beings
            came to me one at a time. As each one approached, a box the
            size of a videotape came from its chest and zoomed right at
            my face... The box opened to reveal what appeared to be a
            tiny television picture of a world event that was yet to
            happen. As I watched, I felt myself drawn right into the
            picture, where I was able to live the event. This happened
            twelve times, and twelve times I stood in the midst of many
            events that would shake the world in the future.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At the time I
            didn't know these were future events. All I knew was that I
            was seeing things of great significance and that they were
            coming to me as clearly as the nightly news, with one great
            difference: I was being pulled into the screen.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Much later,
            when I returned to life, I wrote down 117 events that I
            witnessed in the boxes. For three years nothing happened.
            Then in 1978, events that I had seen in the boxes began to
            come true. In the 18 years since I died and went to this
            place, 95 of those events have taken place.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"On this day,
            17 September 1975, the future came to me a box at a time...</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Boxes one, two
            and three showed the mood of America in the aftermath of the
            war in South-East Asia. They revealed scenes of spiritual
            loss in our country that were byproducts of that war, which
            weakened the structure of America and eventually the world.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The scenes
            were of prisoners of war, weak and wasted from hunger, as
            they waited in the rugged prisons of North Vietnam for
            American ambassadors to come and free them. I could feel
            their fear and then despair when they realized one by one
            that no help would be forthcoming and that they would live
            out their remaining years as slaves in jungle prisons. These
            were the MIAs, those military men considered to be missing
            in action.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The MIAs were
            already an issue in 1975, but they were used as a starting
            point in the visions to show an America that was slipping
            into spiritual decline.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I could see
            America falling into enormous debt. This came to me as
            scenes of money going out of a room much faster than it was
            coming in. Through some kind of telepathy I was aware that
            this money represented the national debt and that it spelled
            disaster down the road. I also saw people waiting in line
            for the basics in life like clothing and food.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Many scenes of
            spiritual hunger came from the first two boxes as well. I
            saw people who were transparent in such a way that they were
            hollow. This hollowness, it was explained to me, was caused
            by a lack of faith in America and what it stood for. The war
            in South-east Asia had combined with inflation and distrust
            in our government to create a spiritual void. This void was
            added to by our loss of love for God.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This spiritual
            depravity resulted in a number of shocking visions: people
            rioting and looting... kids shooting other kids... criminals
            stealing cars, young men firing on other young men from the
            windows of cars... Most of the criminals were children or
            adolescents that no one cared about... These kids had no
            family units and, as a result, they were acting like
            wolves...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In the third
            box I found myself facing the Seal of the President of the
            United States... I saw the initials ‘RR’ [Ronald Reagan]
            emblazoned beneath his seal...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Boxes four and
            five were scenes from the Middle East, showing how this area
            of eternal strife would reach a boiling point..." <b>(25)</b></font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Brinkley
            foresaw two accords being signed by Israelis and Arabs,
            after which "the country of Jordan would exist no more...":</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The fifth box
            showed oil being used as a weapon to control the
            international economy. I saw images of Mecca and then of the
            Saudi people. While these images streamed before me, a
            telepathic voice said that oil production was being cut off
            to destroy America’s economy and to milk money from the
            world economy.. Saudi Arabia was making an alliance with
            Syria and China... The date that came to me was 1992..."</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Obviously, this
            event has not occurred as scheduled. Box six showed Brinkley
            the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors near Kiev in
            1986. He also saw a second nuclear accident "in a northern
            sea so badly polluted that no ships would travel there. The
            water was a pale red and was covered with dead or dying
            fish. Around the water were peaks and valleys that made me
            think I was seeing a fjord like those in Norway... The date
            on the picture was 1995..." Fortunately, this vision has not
            come to pass.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Box seven
            revealed the new environmental "religion" that would arise
            in the wake of the horrid genetic mutations caused by the
            second nuclear disaster. Boxes eight and nine were visions
            of China invading Russia and capturing Siberia. Boxes ten
            and eleven concerned America:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Boxes ten and
            eleven came in rapid succession. They revealed scenes of the
            economic collapse of the world. In general terms, these
            visions showed a world in horrible turmoil by the turn of
            the century, one that resulted in a new world order that was
            truly one of feudalism and strife.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In one of
            these visions, people lined up to take money out of banks.
            In another, the banks were closed by the government. The
            voice that accompanied the vision told me that this would
            take place in the nineties and would be the beginning of an
            economic strife that would lead to the bankruptcy of America
            by the year 2000.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The box showed
            images of dollar signs flying by as people pumped gas and
            looked distressed. I knew this meant that oil prices were
            accelerating out of control.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I saw thirteen
            new nations entering the world market in the late nineties.
            These were nations with manufacturing capabilities that put
            them on a competitive footing with the United States. One by
            one our European markets began to give their business to
            these countries, which slowed our economy even more. All
            this leads to a greatly weakened economy.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But the end of
            America as a world power came as visions of two horrendous
            earthquakes in which buildings were swaying and toppling
            over like a child's wooden blocks. I knew that these quakes
            happened sometime before the end of the century, but I
            couldn't tell where they took place. I do remember seeing a
            large body of water that was probably a river.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The cost of
            rebuilding these destroyed cities would be the final straw
            for our government, now so financially broke that it would
            hardly be able to keep itself alive. The voice in the vision
            told me that it would be this way, while the images from the
            box showed Americans starving and lined up for food.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At the tail
            end of box ten came images of warfare in the desert, a
            massive show of military might... The date 1990 came into my
            head. That was the year of Desert Storm, the military
            operation that squashed the army of&nbsp; Iraq for occupying
            Kuwait.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Box eleven
            began with Iran and Iraq in possession of nuclear and
            chemical weapons. Included in this arsenal was a submarine
            loaded with nuclear missiles. The year, said a voice in the
            vision, was 1993...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The final
            visions from box eleven were like many images we now see of
            Sarajavo: modern cities crumbling beneath the weight of
            warfare, their inhabitants fighting one another for reasons
            ranging from racism to religious conflict. I saw many towns
            worldwide where desperate citizens were eating their own
            dead.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In one such
            scene, Europeans in a hilly region of the world were weeping
            as they cooked human flesh. In rapid succession I saw people
            of all five races eating their fellow humans."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Box twelve
            addressed the 1990s, and concerned a man who sounds much
            like the anti-Christ featured in Christian prophecies.
            Brinkley described it thus:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In this box I
            watched as a biological engineer from the Middle East found
            a way to alter DNA and create a biological virus that would
            be used in the manufacture of computer chips...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Before the end
            of the century, this man was among the richest in the world,
            so rich that he had a stranglehold on the world economy.
            Still the world welcomed him, since the computer chips he
            had designed somehow put the world on an even keel.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Gradually he
            succumbed to his own power. He began to think of himself as
            a deity and insisted on greater control of the world. With
            that extra control, he began to rule the world.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"His method of
            rule was unique. Everyone in the world was mandated by law
            to have one of his computer chips inserted underneath his or
            her skin. This chip contained all of an individual’s
            personal information. If a government agency wanted to know
            something, all it had to do as scan your chip with a special
            device...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There was an
            even more sinister side to this chip. A person’s lifetime
            could be limited by programming this chip to dissolve and
            kill him with the viral substance it was made from.
            Lifetimes were controlled like this to avoid the cost that
            growing old places on the government. It was also used as a
            means of eliminating people with chronic illnesses...</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"People who
            refused to have chips implanted in their bodies roamed as
            outcasts. They could not be employed and were denied
            government services.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"At the very
            end came a thirteenth vision.... The vision was in many ways
            the most important of all because it summed up everything I
            had seen in the twelve boxes. Through telepathy I could hear
            a Being say, 'If you follow what you have been taught and
            keep living the same way you have lived the last 30 years,
            all of this will surely be upon you. If you change, you can
            avoid the coming war."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Scenes from a
            horrible world war accompanied this message. As the visions
            appeared on the screen, the Being told me that the years
            1994 through 1996 were critical ones in determining whether
            this war would break out. 'If you follow this dogma, the
            world by the year 2004 will not be the same one you now
            know.' said the Being. 'But it can still be changed and you
            can help change it.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Scenes from
            World War III came to life before me. I was in a hundred
            places at once... Somehow it was clear to me that this final
            war, Armageddon, was caused by fear... 'The fear these
            people are feeling is an unnecessary one,' said the Being of
            Light. 'But it is a fear so great that humans will give up
            all freedoms in the name of safety.'</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I also saw
            scenes... of natural disasters.. People were starving in
            this vision... I saw civil wars breaking out in Central and
            South America and the rise of socialist governments in all
            of these countries before the year 2000. As these wars
            intensified, million of refugees streamed across the US
            border, looking for a new life in North America. Nothing we
            did could stop these immigrants. They were driven by fear of
            death and loss of confidence in God.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I saw millions
            of people streaming north out of El Salvador and Nicaragua,
            and millions more crossing the Rio Grande into Texas. There
            were so many of them that we had to line the border with
            troops and force them back across the river. The Mexican
            economy was broken by these refugees and collapsed under the
            strain...</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"After the
            final visions, the thirteenth Being of Light... told me that
            everything I had just seen was in the future, but not
            necessarily cast in stone. 'The flow of human events can be
            changed, but first people have to know what they are,' said
            the Being... 'Humans are mighty spiritual beings. All they
            need to realize is that love is treating others the way they

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The modern seer
            Gordon-Michael Scallion has made a considerable reputation
            as a prophet of "Earth Changes", the imminent period of
            cataclysmic global super-quakes and vulcanism that will
            largely destroy civilization as we know it. His track record
            was spoiled by the failure of his super-quake predictions
            which he announced in <i>The Earth Changes Report</i>.
            Scallion warned of "California Super-Mega Quakes, 8-12 on
            the Richter scale -- Predicted to occur no later than May 9,
            1993." <b>(26)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several other
            prophets, past and present, have warned that super-quakes
            would occur in the latter days of this cycle of
            civilization, but none have been able to say just when it
            would happen. Scallion has proven remarkably accurate about
            other quakes before and since then, but the "super-mega
            quakes" defy dating. In 1993, Scallion published the
            following psychic information about warning signs of
            impending disaster:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If an 8.0+
            (Richter scale) quake occurs in the Indian Ocean region ---
            Sri Lanka should be watched carefully --- then within days
            the major earth changes shall occur in Japan, Alaska, Italy,
            Martinique and the western United States and Canada. As to
            the day and hour of the "big one' [the California quake],
            this should not be seen as a singular event. While May
            [1993] will be remembered as the month when the great plates
            shifted, events shall occur even before this --- many
            [quakes] exceeding 7 on the Richter scale occurring roughly
            along a line drawn from Vancouver, BC to Eureka to San
            Diego... The super-mega quake shall not have a singular
            epicenter. Rather, the land itself displaces its forces from
            north to south. The current Richter scale will not be able
            to measure its magnitude. Later, it shall be computed to
            have been in excess of 10 and a new scale shall be created.
            The following areas of California shall experience
            inundations. Portions of San Diego shall go under water as
            well as much of the Imperial Valley. Tidal waves shall be
            created traveling south and southwest along the whole west
            coast. Los Angeles shall be the hardest hit and initially
            will be thought to be the epicenter... Multiple quakes shall
            occur. The aquaducts feeding many cities such as Los Angeles
            shall fail and much of California shall be without power.
            Roads that cross other roads shall come down and become
            impassable. Portions of land from San Francisco to
            Sacramento shall be displaced by hundreds of feet in some
            areas. Numerous bridges shall collapse... Migrations will be
            to Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Idaho. Loss of life
            shall be great..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his
            "Prophecies for 1993", Scallion stated:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I would like
            to point out that prophecies are given to warn people so
            that they can prepare for what is to come, or to allow our
            aware consciousness to raise to higher levels, thus enabling
            us to alter a probable event. NO PROPHECY IS GUARANTEED TO
            OCCUR. If this were the case it would indicate that we do
            not have free will. This is what Tribulation is all about
            --- exercising our free will, a time period of choosing our

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The seeress
            Jeanne Dixon (1918-1997) was a prolific predictor of events
            --- and non-events. She accurately foretold the
            assassinations of Mahatma Ghandhi, Martin Luther King, John
            F. Kennedy, and his brother Robert. Mrs. Dixon predicted the
            launch of Sputnik and the sinking of the submarines USS
            Thresher and Scorpion. Her successful predictions include
            the political defeat of Dewey by Harry Truman, the landslide
            election of Dwight Eisenhower, the demise of Nikita
            Kruschev, and the plane crash that killed UN Secretary Dag
            Hammarskold. <b>(28)</b></font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1945, Dixon
            warned an official of the Indian diplomatic mission in

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"On June 2,

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It happened so.
            During the summer of 1947, she predicted thus:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Mahatma
            Ghandhi will be assassinated within the next six months. He
            will be killed by someone they least suspect."</font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jeanne Dixon
            also made hundreds of trivial predictions about celebrities
            and insignificant events (usually wrong), earning her the
            sobriquet of a "gossip prophet". She explained it thus:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"When a psychic
            vision is not fulfilled as expected, it is not because what

            interpreted it correctly."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of Jeanne
            Dixon's prophecies, published in the 1970s, was fulfilled in
            part when Mehmed Agca attacked Pope John Paul II:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"During this
            century one pope will suffer bodily harm. Another will be
            assassinated. The assassination will be the final blow to
            the office of the Holy See. This pope will be the same one
            who will be chosen in the not too distant future but whose
            election will not be approved by the Roman clergy. His
            influence, however, will be such that he will win out over
            the objections of his opponents. While this pope will be the
            last one ever to reign as singular head of the Church, the
            beginnings of this change will occur with one of his
            predecessors who will give far-reaching powers to his
            cardinals. These same cardinals will use their powers to
            replace him with one more to their liking."</font> </big></p>

            Nostradamus (C. 1:60) and St. John (<i>Revelation</i> 8:
            8-12), Jeanne Dixon saw that Earth will be struck by a
            comet. Her timing was premature:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I have seen a
            comet strike our Earth around the middle of the 1980s.

            Those men made sure that the American colonists were
            thoroughly indoctrinated with the principles of religious
            tolerance, political democracy and republicanism, social
            equality and capitalism. Many members of the Rosicrucians
            and other secret societies emigrated to America and
            established their organizations in the "New Atlantis". Their
            occult ideas were incorporated into the designs of the Great
            Seal, the flag, and other American symbols, and their
            societies still exist and are active today.</font> </big></p>

      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All of the
            above symptoms are very evident in modern America. The
            average span of the world’s great civilizations has been
            about 200 years. The USA is just over 200 years old and
            stumbling headlong into the home stretch of this historical
            cycle.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In <i>The
              Decline and Fall of the Athenian Republic</i>, Tyler wrote
            this of great civilizations:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They begin in
            Bondage. They then go from Bondage to Spiritual Faith. With
            that Spiritual Faith they develop great Courage. That Great
            Courage leads to Liberty. Liberty then leads to Abundance.
            Abundance then leads to Selfishness. This Selfishness then
            leads to Complacency. The Complacency grows into Apathy.
            Apathy then degenerates into Dependence. This Dependence
            brings them full circle back into Bondage."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The USA is in
            the last stages (apathy and dependence) of the cycle, and
            now is a virtual police state. Because so much of the
            current federal government is illegitimate and corrupt, in
            1994 it became possible and necessary for American patriots
            to issue another Declaration of Independence, in which every
            complaint made against King George III in 1776 was
            paraphrased and reiterated against the modern regime.</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Using the phony
            Drug War as its excuse, the federal government has abandoned
            the Constitution and surrendered to the Communist model of
            suppression by imposing pre-trial detention without bail,
            mandatory minimum prison sentences, and capitol punishment
            for drug crimes, plus increased fines, forfeitures and asset
            seizures, "good faith" exceptions to the exclusionary rule,
            and other aberrant violations of justice. America has become
            a police state because of its insane drug laws and craven
            citizens. Perhaps we have gotten the government we deserve.
            Certainly, we have proven the truth expressed by Goethe,
            that "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who
            falsely believe they are free."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Drug War is
            perpetuated by totalitarians merely to satisfy their lust
            for power. The skillful propaganda they generate has created
            an unwarranted fear of drugs that terrorizes hundreds of
            millions of ignorant people. Actually, drugs such as
            Cannabis and LSD are very powerful tools for liberation,
            just as are guns and printing presses. Yet, rather than
            enjoy medical freedom of choice, Americans have surrendered
            their divine rights to the needs of the New World Order.
            This fraud is nothing new, as William Pitt observed in a
            speech before the British House of Commons in 1783:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Necessity is
            the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the
            argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Drug War is
            a coup d'etat. The real issue is: Freedom, which is
            self-control, not governmental rule. The Drug War is not
            being fought against molecules, but against ourselves and
            freedom. The Drug War is conquering America law by law,
            right by right, until nothing will remain to do but fight
            the Second Civil War. The Drug War is a fraud that has cost
            Americans their civil rights, over 150 billion tax dollars,
            and at least 100 million man-years spent in prisons, corrupt
            law enforcement, and other associated costs including
            countless deaths at home, in the streets, and abroad. We
            live in unmanly fear of our government. We have been
            rendered dumb and ignorant by an open conspiracy that
            suckles upon like a vampire, eats our children, and aborts
            our birthrights.</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Enough! Rather,
            as Albert Camus wrote, "Let us rejoice as men because a
            prolonged hoax has collapsed and we clearly see what
            threatens us."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abraham Lincoln
            is attributed with having stated (8 December 1840):</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Prohibition...
            goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
            control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime
            out of things that are not crimes... A prohibition law
            strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our
            government was founded."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lincoln also
            was of this opinion:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"These rights
            are inherent and inalienable, that they can never be
            surrendered or alienated, but by idiots or madmen, and all
            the acts of idiots and lunatics are void, and not
            obligatory, by all the laws of God and man..."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Samuel Adams
            asserted the truth of the matter thus:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If men,
            through fear, fraud or mistake, should in terms renounce or
            give up any essential natural right, the eternal law of
            reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate
            such renunciation. The right to freedom being the gift of
            God Almighty, it is not in the power of man to alienate this
            gift and voluntarily become a slave."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Benjamin
            Franklin wrote likewise in1755:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They that can
            give up an essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
            safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a letter to
            W.S. Smith (January 30, 1787), Thomas Jefferson wrote:</font>
        </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What country
            before ever existed a century and a half without a
            rebellion?... God forbid we should ever be twenty years
            without such a rebellion... And what country can preserve
            its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to
            time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?
            Let them take arms... the tree of liberty must be refreshed
            from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It
            is its natural manure."</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abe Lincoln
            also reminded us:</font> </big></p>
      <p><big><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This country,
            with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.
            Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government
            they can exercise their constitutional right to dismember or
            overthrow it." (as reserved in Articles 9 and 10 of the Bill
