      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Michel
de






            Notredame, or Nostradamus, was the greatest prophet of all
            time. He was born to Renee and Jacques de Notredame in 1503
            at St. Remy in Provence, France. They were Jewish, but
            converted to Christianity under the compulsory edict of
            Louis XII.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            1522, his parents sent Michel to study medicine at
            Montpelier, where he obtained a baccalaureate in 1525. Armed
            with his license, prescriptions and zeal, Nostradamus set
            out through southern France to battle the Black Plague. In
            1529 he returned to Montpellier to obtain his doctorate.
            Afterwards he went traveling again, but eventually accepted
            an invitation to stay at Agen, near Bordeaux, at the house
            of the eminent poet-philosopher and literary critic
            Julius-Cesar Scaliger. Nostradamus called Scaliger "a Virgil
            in poetry, a Cicero in eloquence, a Galen in medicine."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">At
            Agen, Nostradamus met and married Adriete de Loubeja. They
            began to raise a family, but another outbreak of plague took
            the lives of his wife and two children. Despite his skills,
            Nostradamus could not save them; his medical practice
            suffered for that. Then, his friendship with Scaliger
            deteriorated into argument, as was the critic's wont, and
            the Inquisitors summoned Nostradamus for questioning. He
            decided to travel again, and did so for several years.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">While
in






            Provence from 1544-1545, Nostradamus fought the plague
            again, especially at Aix where it was at its worst. He
            settled nearby at Salon and married Anna Gemella in November
            1547. He devoted himself to the practice of medicine and
            private studies.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Nostradamus
began






            to discover his prophetic abilities in 1547. He began
            publishing predictive annual <i>Almanacs</i> in 1550,
            followed by <i>Prognostications</i> in 1554. At that time,
            the lawyer, scholar and theologian Jean-Ayme de Chavigny
            resigned from his position as mayor of Bearne to study under
            Nostradamus. Chavigny was the prophet's friend, only
            student, and wrote Nostradamus' biography. At the urging of
            Chavigny, Nostradamus had the first edition of <i>The True
              Centuries</i> published in March 1555. The book contained
            353 quatrains; more were added in subsequent editions. In
            the preface, Nostradamus wrote:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"In
            1554, I decided to give way and, by dark and cryptic
            sentences, tell of the causes of the future mutation of
            mankind, especially the most urgent ones... in a manner that
            would not upset fragile sentiments. All had to be written
            under a cloudy form, above all things prophetic...</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Many
times
in






            the week, I am overtaken by an ecstasy; having rendered my
            nocturnal studies agreeable through long calculations, I
            have composed books of prophecies, of which each contains
            one hundred astronomical quatrains of prophecies. I have
            sought to polish them a bit obscurely. They are perpetual
            prophecies, for they extend from now to the year 3797."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            the "Epistle to Henry II" included in the expanded 1557
            edition of <i>The True Centuries</i>, Nostradamus wrote:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Although
my
calculations






            may not hold good for all nations, they have, however, been
            determined with the emotion, handed down to me by my
            forebears, which comes over me at certain hours. But the
            danger of the times, O most serene King, requires that such
            secrets should not be bared except in enigmatic sentences
            having, however, only one sense and meaning, and nothing
            ambiguous or amphibological inserted. Rather, they are under
            a cloud of obscurity."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Nostradamus
first






            wrote his quatrains in plain Old French, and he included
            names and dates. Then he rewrote them in a complex code of
            acronyms, anagrams, apocope, synechdoches, ellipses,
            hyperbations and metatheses, syncopes, aphereses,
            epentheses, metonyms, and other exotic grammars and
            syntaxes. Nostradamus burned (or possibly buried) the
            original, explicit prose prophecies, because he did not want
            to complicate unduly humanity's problem of free choice, or
            to encourage a fatalism that might deter us from making our
            best efforts to correct ourselves. Nor did he wish to
            interfere with the fulfillment of his prophecies by stating
            them too clearly in advance. And, he had no desire to incur
            the wrath of the Holy Inquisition. Nostradamus qualified his
            divinations in a warning in the preface:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"I
            warn you especially against the vanity of the more execrable
            magic, condemned of yore by the Holy Scriptures and by the
            Canons of the Church.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"However,
judicial
astrology






            is excepted from this judgment. For it is by this, together
            with divine inspiration and revelation, and continual
            nightly watches and calculations, that we have reduced our
            prophecies to writing. Although this occult philosophy was
            not condemned, I did not desire that you should ever be
            tempted with their unbridled promptings. I had at my
            disposal many volumes which had been hidden a great many
            centuries. But dreading what use might be made of them,
            after reading them I consigned them to the flames. As the
            fire came to devour them, the flame licking the air shot
            forth an unusual brightness, clearer than natural fire. It
            was like the light of lightning thunder, suddenly
            illuminating the house, as if in sudden conflagration..."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">According
to
some






            opinions, those books were some of the sacred manuscripts
            rescued from the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem
            when it was destroyed by Titus in 70 AD. The occult keys
            were transmitted by the fathers of the tribe of Issachar,
            who were closely linked to the Temple and the Kings of
            Jerusalem. The builders of the Temple are thought to have
            removed themselves to the area of Provence, France, and
            Nostradamus may have inherited some of their books.
            Nostradamus explained himself further in his "Epistle to
            Henry II":</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"It
            is quite true, Sire, that my natural instinct has been
            inherited from my forebears... and that this natural
            instinct has been adjusted and integrated with long
            calculations. At the same time, I freed my soul, mind, and
            heart of all care, solicitude, and vexation. All of these
            prerequisites for presaging I achieved in part by means of
            the brazen tripod...</font></font> </p>

            gave notice of his "Incantation of the Law against inept

after
the

            Montgomery (C.1:35, C.3:30, and C.3:35). In the ensuing

            1912, the German researcher Graf Karl von Klinckow published
            the first decisive bibliographic study of the old editions,
            but it contained many errors of transmissions. The
            definitive study to date is Edgar Leoni's <i>Nostradamus

            bought were aspects of President Nixon's Watergate crisis of
            1974. "The empire contracted to another" refers to Nixon's
            replacement by President Gerald Ford. In line 3, "the chapel
            stained with blood" notes the murder of a young woman in San
            Jose, California in December 1974. Her body was found in a
            church. This line helps place the prophecy concurrently with
            the Watergate conspiracy. It also makes one wonder if
            Nostradamus was reading modern newspaper across time, since
            the murder in question was minor news, mentioned only in
            local newspapers. Of course, the prophet may well have had

            there was a drought ("extreme dryness") in Biafra, Africa,
            "to the south" of France. The third line was fulfilled by a

            quatrain can apply to the Israeli siege of the PLO in
            Beirut. "The device of flying fire" is Nostradamus' term for
            jets or missiles, phosphorus bombs and artillery which were
            used "to trouble the great besieged Chief", Yasser Arafat.
            The Israeli invasion of Lebanon was triggered by the
            attempted assassination of Shlomo Argov, the Israeli
            ambassador in London, by a PLO splinter group ("sedition
            within"). Line 4 is confusing until "profligate" is
            understood in its obsolete meaning: beaten and dispersed.
            Thus, "profligate" certainly applies to the PLO besieged in
            Beirut. Their circumstance and its resolution (the
            UN-supervised evacuation of the PLO army) are unique in
            history, and Nostradamus can be credited with having

            Chinese aggressions. Almost 15% of Nostradamus' quatrains
            concern the Muslims. Some of his predictions came true
            within 20 years after the publication of <i>The True
              Centuries</i>, but most of them definitely indicate a
            future war between Christians and Muslims. About a dozen
            quatrains concerning this tribulation are dated by
            astronomical configurations beginning in the 1980s and
            continuing into the 21st century. This war did not begin on
            schedule, but the prophet was perfectly accurate in his

            war, and the people of Israel came out weakened by it.
            Worthwhile wars are the business of charlatans. Those who
            spoke about the war and brought it upon us should have
            thought more than twice of the price, especially in human
