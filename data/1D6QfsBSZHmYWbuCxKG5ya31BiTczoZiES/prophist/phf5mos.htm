            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prophecy</span> is the
            history of possible futures, passing like movie previews
            through the minds of seers who may feel either blessed or
            cursed by their visions. Westerners have been saturated for
            two millenia with Judaeo-Christian visions of apocalypse, to
            the exclusion of any consideration for other opinions such
            as those of the Muslims.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Islam
has






            produced many prophecies concerning the end of this cycle of
            civilization. Some of them obviously derive from Biblical
            sources, while others are quite original and intriguing
            warnings of Fitnah (Tribulation) and Qiyamah (Judgment Day).</font></font>

      <p><b>Signs of Qiyamah ~</b><a name="qiyamah"></a> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Holy Prophet Mohammed (peace be on him: pboh) made this
            general prophecy about the present state of affairs,
            recorded in the <i>Mudkhal</i> by Ibn-al-Hajj: "The Holy
            Prophet (pboh) said, "Prayers will be neglected, carnal
            desires will be pursued, transgressors will become leaders,
            it will not be possible to distinguish the faithful from the
            false, telling lies will become desirable, payment of Zakah
            will be taken as a burden, the believer will be deemed the
            most disgraceful and he will be pained at seeing evils all
            around and his heart will melt as salt in water but he will
            not be able to say anything. Rain will do no good; it will
            fall out of season. Males will commit adultery with males,
            and females with females. Women will dominate. The offspring
            will disobey their parents, friend will treat his friend
            badly, sins will be taken lightly. Mosques will have
            external decorations and beauty and there will be
            worshippers too but there will be hypocrisy and mutual
            enmity in their hearts. Then will appear a people from the
            West who will dominate the weak among my people. People will
            produce copies of the Holy <i>Quran</i> in letters of gold
            but will not act upon it. The <i>Quran</i> will be recited
            in a melodious way. Usury will become rampant. Human blood
            will have no value, religion will have no helpers. Singing
            women will be on the increase. The rich will perform the
            Hajjas as a pastime, the people of the middle class will do
            so to conduct business and the poor to beg for charity."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            the <i>Shama'il </i>of Timirdi, the Prophet Mohammed
            (pboh) again predicted the wealth and decadence of the
            modern world: "The best of the generations is my generation,
            then those who follow them, then those who follow them, then
            after them will come a people who will praise themselves in
            abundance of wealth and love and plumpness..."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"When
the






            booty is taken in turn, property given in trust is treated
            as spoil, Zakah is looked on as a fine, learning is acquired
            for other than a religious purpose, a man obeys his wife and
            is unfilial toward his mother, brings his friend near and
            drives his father far off, voices are raised in the mosques,
            the most wicked member of a people becomes its leader, a man
            is honored through fear of the evil he may do, singing girls
            and stringed instruments make their appearance, wines are
            drunk, and the last members of this people curse the first
            ones, look at that time for a violent wind, an earthquake,
            metamorphosis, pelting rain, and signs following one another
            like bits of a necklace falling one after the other when its
            string is cut."</font></font> </p>
      <p>Timirdi also recorded this narration by 'Imran ibn Husayn: "The
        Prophet (pboh) said: 'Some people of this Ummah will be
        swallowed up by the earth, some will be transformed into
        animals, and some will be bombarded with stones.' One of the
        Muslims asked, 'When will that be, O Messenger of Allah?' He
        said, 'When singers and musical instruments will become popular,
        and much wine will be drunk.'" </p>
      <p>Similarly, according to Ahmad, Abd Allah ibn Amr said: "I heard
        the Prophet say, If you see my Ummah fearing a tyrant so much
        that they dare not tell him that he is a tyrant, then there will
        be no hope for them. The Prophet said, Among my Ummah, some will
        be swallowed up by the earth, some bombarded with stones, and
        some transformed into animals." </p>
      <p>Huzafa narrates that Mohammed (pboh) said: "Qiyamah will not
        come till you see ten signs, which are: Smoke which spreads
        throughout the East and West for forty days; Dajjal; Da'aba, a
        four-legged beast of the length of 60 yards. He will have the
        stick of Musa [Moses] and ring of Sulaiman [Solomon]. In running
        he will have no equal. He will strike Mu'min with Musa's stick
        and will mark the word Mu'min on his face and similarly put the
        stamp of Kafr [Star of David] on the face of the Kafr; Rising of
        the sun from the West; Descent of Isa ibn Maryam [Jesus]; Juj
        and Majuj [Gog and Magog]; Sinking of the earth at three places,
        East, West, and Arabian Gulf; Fire which will emanate from one
        side of Aden and drive the people to Hasr. </p>
      <p>"These events also are said to be inevitable: The Kaaba will be
        burned down, after which Dajjal will abide on earth. Then Allah
        (sallallahu alayhe wa sallam: saws) will send Isa, who will look
        upon the Dajjal and kill him. Then the people will live for
        seven years with no rancor at all. Then Allah (subhanahu wa
        taala: swt) will send a cold wind from the side of Syria that
        will remove all the believers from the earth, leaving only the
        wicked. Then Satan will come to them in human form and ask them,
        'Why don't you respond?' And they will ask him what orders he
        has for them, and he will command them to worship idols, and
        they will have an abundance of wealth. Finally, the trumpet will
        be blown. Then Allah (swt) will send rain like dew, and bodies
        of people will grow from it, then the trumpet will be blown
        again and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it
        will be said, 'O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand
        there'. Then we will be questioned. Then it will be said, 'Bring
        out a group for the 999 out of 1000 for the Hell-Fire'. This
        will be the day that will make the children old because of its
        terror." </p>
      <p>The sinking of the earth in three places also has been
        interpreted as the defeat of armies. </p>
      <p>Abdullah ibn Amr reiterates Huzafa: "Allah's Messenger (pboh)
        said: The Dajjal will appear in my Ummah and he will stay for
        forty --- I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months
        or forty years. Allah will then send Isa ibn Maryam, who will
        resemble Urwah ibn Mas'ud. He will chase Dajjal and kill him.
        Then people will live for seven years, during which time there
        will be no rancour between any two persons. After that Allah
        will send a cold wind from the direction of Syria. None will
        survive on Earth, having a speck of good in him or faith in him:
        he will die. Even if some among you were to enter the innermost
        part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and
        cause your death. I heard Allah's Apostle (pboh) as saying: Only
        the wicked people will survive and they will be as careless as
        birds with the characteristics of beasts. They will never
        appreciate good nor condemn evil. Then Satan will come to them,
        in human form, and would say: Don't you respond? They will say:
        What do you order us to do? He will command them to worship the
        idols but, in spite of this, they will have an abundance of
        sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet will be
        blown and he who hears it will bend his neck to one side and
        raise it from the other side. The first one to hear that trumpet
        will be the person who is busy in setting right the cistern
        meant for supplying water to the camels. He will faint and the
        other people will also faint. Then Allah will send or He will
        cause to be sent rain which will be like dew and there will grow
        out of it the bodies of people. Then the second trumpet will be
        blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it
        will be said: O people, go to your Lord. They will be made to
        stand there and they will be questioned. Then it will be said:
        Bring out a group for the Hell-Fire. It will be asked: How much?
        It will be said: Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of one
        thousand for the Hell-Fire. That will be the day that will make
        the children old because of its terror and that will be the day
        about which it has been said: "On the day when the shank will be
        uncovered". (Hadith 7023) </p>
      <p>Hudhayfah ibn Usayd Ghifari says likewise: "Allah's Apostle
        (pboh) came to us all of a sudden as we were in a discussion. He
        said: What do you discuss about? The Companions said: We are
        discussing about the Last Hour. Thereupon he said: It will not
        come until you see ten signs before, and he made a mention of
        the smoke, Dajjal, the rising of the sun from the West, the
        descent of Jesus ibn Maryam (Allah be pleased with him), Juj and
        Majuj, and landslides in three places, one in the east, one in
        the west, and one in Arabia at the end of which fire would burn
        forth from Yemen, and would drive people to the place of their
        assembly [judgment]." (Hadith 6931) </p>
      <p>Similarly, a narration by Abu Hurayrah states: "Allah's Apostle
        (pboh) said: Hasten to do good deeds before six things happen:
        the rising of the sun from the west, the smoke, the Dajjal, the
        beast, and the death of one of you, or the general turmoil."
        (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 7039) </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">According
to
Hadhrat






            Abu Musa Ash’ari, the sage Rasulallah made these comments
            about life today: "Qiyamah&nbsp; will come when: it will be
            regarded as a shame to act on Quranic injunctions;
            untrustworthy people will be regarded as trustworthy and the
            trustworthy will be regarded as untrustworthy; it will be
            hot in winter and cold in summer; the length of days will be
            stretched; a journey of a few days will be covered in a few
            hours; orators and lecturers will lie openly; people will
            dispute over petty issues; women with children will be
            displeased on account of them bearing offspring, and barren
            women remain happy on account of having no responsibility of
            offspring; oppression, jealousy, and greed will become the
            order of the day; people will blatantly follow their
            passions and whims; lies will prevail over truth; violence,
            bloodshed and anarchy will become common; shameless
            immorality is perpetrated publicly; the offspring will
            become a cause of grief and anger for their parents;
            legislation of matters pertaining to the Deen will be handed
            over to the worst elements of the Ummat, and if people
            accept them and are satisfied with their findings, then such
            persons will not smell the fragrance of Jannat."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">When
            Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Mas’ood asked Rasulallah about the
            Signs of Qiyamah, he was told: "Music and musical
            instruments will be found in every home. People will indulge
            in homosexuality. There will be an abundance of illegitimate
            children. There will be an abundance of critics,
            tale-carriers, back-biters and taunters in society. People
            will establish ties with strangers and sever relations with
            their near and dear ones. Hypocrites will be in control of
            the affairs of the community and evil, immoral people will
            be at the helm of businesses. The Masjid will be decorated,
            but the hearts of people will be devoid of guidance. The
            courtyards of Masjids will be built beautifully and high
            pulpits will be erected. Various wines will be consumed in
            excess."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Auf
            bin Malik also consulted about Qiyamah with Rasulullah, who
            said: "Count six things before the advent of Qiyamah: (1) my
            death; (2) the conquest of Jerusalem; (3) mass deaths among
            you people, just as when sheep die in large numbers during
            an epidemic; (4) abundance of wealth to such an extent that
            if a person were to be given a hundred dinars he will still
            not be satisfied; (5) general anarchy and bloodshed, that no
            Arab household will be spared from it; (6) then a life of
            peace as a result of a peace agreement between you and the
            Banil Asfaar [Romans, Christians] which they will break and
            attack you with a force consisting of eighty flags and under
            each flag will be an army of 12,000 men."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Muslims have several specific prophecies that pit them
            against Jews and Christians till the bitter, exhausted end.
            The return of the Jews to Israel, the current situation in
            the Mideast, and the probable future was predicted quite
            explicitly in the <i>Quran</i>:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, dwell securely

            nations."<i>&nbsp; </i>(<i>Quran</i> 17:104)</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            they shall incur the wrath of Allah, and humiliation will be

            is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.<i>" </i>(<i>Quran</i>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And

            them to the Day of resurrection. And Allah will soon let
            them know the consequences of what they do." (<i>Quran</i>

            mentioned the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes
            described him as insignificant and sometimes described him
            as very significant, as if he were nearby in the date-palm

            will be followed by 70,000 Yahudis (Jews) from Isfahan
            (present-day Iran) wearing silk clothing, or wearing Persian

            which time the non-believers will lay unconscious, while
            Muslims will suffer from a cold-like illness. The fog will
            be followed by three days of darkness. This will occur
            during the month of Zil-Hajj after Eidul-Adha. Then the sun

            reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping
            from his dead. I asked, 'Who is this?' They replied: 'The
            son of Mary'. Then I turned my face to see another man with
            a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one
            eye. His other eye look like a grape protruding out. They
            said: 'He is Ad-Dajjal'. The man he resembled most is Ibn

        Thereupon he said: The Last Hour will not come until 70,000

        will neither fight with weapons nor shower arrows but will only
        say: 'There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest',and
        one side of it will fall. Thawr [one of the narrators] said: I

        for the second time ''There is no god but Allah and Allah is the
        Greatest', and the other side will fall. They will say: 'There
        is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest', and the gates

      <p>Sahih Muslim<i> </i>also gives this account by Abu Hurayrah:
        "Allah's Apostle (pboh) said: The Last Hour will not come until
        the Romans land at al-Amiq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of
        the best soldiers of the people on Earth at that time will come
        from Medina to oppose them. When they arrange themselves in
        ranks, the Romans will say: Do not stand between us and those
        Muslims who took prisoners from among us. Let us fight them. The
        Muslims will say: Nay, by Allah, we shall never turn aside from
        you and from our brethren so that you may fight them. They will
        then fight and a third of the army, whom Allah will never
        forgive, will run away. A third, which will be constituted of
        excellent martyrs in Allah's eyes, would be killed. The third
        who will never be put on trial will win and they will be the
        conquerors of Constantinople. As they are busy in distributing
        the spoils of war after hanging their swords by the olive trees,
        Satan will cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your
        families. They will then come out, but it will be of no avail.
        When they reach Syria, he will come out while they are still
        preparing themselves for battle, drawing up the ranks.
        Certainly, the time of prayer will come and then Isa ibn Maryam
        (pboh) will descend and lead them in prayer. When the enemy of
        Allah sees him, it will disappear just as salt dissolves in
        water, and if Isa were not to confront them at all, even then it
        would dissolve completely. Allah would kill them by his hand and
        he would show them their blood on Isa's lance." (Hadith 6924) </p>

      <p>Abu Hurairah quotes the Prophet (pboh) thus: "The Euphrates
        will disclose a golden treasure. Whoever is present at that time
        should not take anything of it." </p>
      <p>In another quotation, Abu Hurairah repeats the above with
        elaboration: "The Prophet said, The Hour will not come before
        the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people will
        fight. Ninety-nine out of every hundred will die, but every one
        among them will say that perhaps he will be the one who will
        survive." </p>
      <p>Timirdi recounts this Hadith from Ali ibn Abi Talib: "The
        Prophet said: 'If my Ummah bears fifteen traits, tribulation
        will befall it.' Someone asked, 'What are they, O Messenger of
        Allah?' He said, 'When any gain is shared out only among the
        rich, with no benefit to the poor; when a trust becomes a means
        of making a profit; when paying Zakat becomes a burden; when a
        man obeys his wife and disobeys his mother; and treats his
        friend kindly whilst shunning his father; when voices are raised
        in the mosques; when the leader of a people is the worst of
        them; when people treat a man with respect because they fear
        some evil he may do; when much wine is drunk; when men wear
        silk; when female singers and musical instruments become
        popular; when the last ones of this Ummah curse the first ones
        --- then let them expect a red wind, or the earth to swallow
        them, or to be transformed into animals.'" </p>
      <p>Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet (saws) said: "By Him Who
        sent me with the Truth, this earth will not pass away until
        people are afflicted with landslides, are pelted with stones,
        and are transformed into animals." The people asked, "When will
        that be, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "When you see women
        riding in the saddle, when singers are common, when bearing
        false witness becomes widespread, and when men lie with men and
        women with women". </p>
      <p>Ibn Majah transmitted this warning of apostasy in the latter
        days: "Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman said, 'The Prophet said: Islam
        will become worn out like clothes are, until there will be
        no-one who knows what fasting, prayer, charity and rituals are.
        The Qur'an will disappear in one night, and no Ayah will be left
        on earth. Some groups of old people will be left who will say:
        We heard our fathers saying La ilaha illa Allah, so we repeated
        it.' </p>
      <p>"Silah asked Hudhayfah: 'What will saying La ilaha illa Allah
        do for them when they do not know what prayer, fasting, ritual
        and charity are?' Hudhayfah ignored him; then Silah repeated his
        question three times, and each time Hudayfah ignored him.
        Finally he answered: 'O Silah, it will save them from Hell', and
        said it three times." </p>
      <p>According to a Hadith from Bukhari, narrated by Abu Hurairah,
        the Prophet (pboh) said: "The Hour will not come until the
        buttocks of the women of Daws move whist going around Dhu
        l-Khalasah." </p>
      <p>The idol Dhu l-Khalasah was worshipped by the Daws (a tribe in
        Yemen) before Islam. </p>
      <p>Similarly, 'A'ishah said: "I heard the Prophet (sallallahu
        alayhe wa sallam) say, 'Day and night will not pass away until
        people begin to worship Lat and 'Uzza' [pre-Islamic Arabic
        goddesses]. </p>
      <p>Abu Hurairah quotes The Prophet (pboh) thus concerning women
        and an unidentified people with a predilection for whips
        (perhaps a reference to sado-masochism): "There are two types
        among the people of Hell whom I have not yet seen. The first are
        people who have whips like the tails of oxen, with which they
        beat people, and the second are women who are naked in spite of
        being dressed; they will be led astray and will lead others
        astray, and their heads will look like camels humps. These women
        will not enter Paradise; they will not even experience the
        faintest scent of it, even though the fragrance of Paradise can
        be perceived from such a great distance." </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Abu Hurairah again said: "I heard the Prophet say,
        If you live for a while, you will see people go out under the
        wrath of Allah and come back under His curse, and they will have
        in their hands whips like the tail of an ox." </p>
      <p>Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet (saws) said: "The Hour will not
        come until the time when a man will leave his home, and his
        shoes or whip or stick will tell what is happening to his
        family." </p>
      <p>According to another version of this report, the Prophet (saws)
        said: "By Him in Whose hand is my soul, the Hour will not come
        until wild animals talk to men, and a man speaks to his whip or
        his shoe, and his thigh will tell him about what happened to his
        family after he left." </p>
      <p>This is a clear prophecy about the modern invention of
        cellphones. The mention by Abu Hurairah of "whips like the tail
        of an ox" may be an attempt to describe the antennas on
        cellphones, radios, cars, and televisions. </p>
      <p>Ibn Majah relates that Abd Allah ibn 'Umar said: "The Prophet
        (saws) came to us and said, 'O Muhajirun, [pilgrims] you may be
        afflicted by five things; God forbid that you should live to see
        them. If fornication should become widespread, you should
        realise that this has never happened without new diseases
        befalling the people which their forebears never suffered. If
        people should begin to cheat in weighing out goods, you should
        realise that this has never happened without drought and famine
        befalling the people, and their rulers oppressing them. If
        people should withhold Zakat, you should realise that this has
        never happened without the rain being stopped from falling; and
        were it not for the animals' sake, it would never rain again. If
        people should break their covenant with Allah and His Messenger,
        you should realise that his has never happened without Allah
        sending an enemy against them to take some of their possessions
        by force. If the leaders do not govern according to the Book of
        Allah, you should realise that this has never happened without
        Allah making them into groups and making them fight one
        another." </p>
      <p>Ahmad recorded a Hadith by Allah ibn 'Amr, who said: "I went to
        the Prophet (pboh) one day whilst he was performing Wudu'
        [ablution] slowly and carefully. He raised his head, looked at
        me and said, 'Six things will happen to this Ummah: the death of
        your Prophet ' --- and when I heard that I was aghast --- this
        is the first. The second is that your wealth will increase so
        much that if a man were given ten thousand [dinars], he would
        still not be content with it. The third is that tribulation will
        enter the house of every one of you. The fourth is that sudden
        death will be widespread. The fifth is a <br>
        peace-treaty between you and the Romans: they will gather troops
        against you for nine months --- like a woman's period of
        childbearing --- then they <br>
        will be the first to break the treaty. The sixth is the conquest
        of a city.' I asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, which city?' He
        said, 'Constantinople'." </p>
      <p>Ahmad says that Abu Hurairah said that the Prophet (pboh) said:
        "Woe to the Arabs from the great evil which is nearly
        approaching them: it will be like patches of dark night. A man
        will wake up as a believer, and be a kafir [unbeliever] by
        nightfall. People will sell their religion for a small amount of
        worldly goods. The one who clings to his religion on that day
        will be as one who is grasping an ember - or thorns." </p>
      <p>Mohammed (pboh) also mentioned these minor signs, which are
        evident today: Knowledge will disappear and ignorance will
        appear, even though books will be widesread... Adultery and
        fornication will be prevalent, performed in public, and there
        will be new sexual diseases and many bastard children...
        Fornication will be widespread among leaders, when people stop
        forbidding evil... Leaders will be oppressors, and the worst of
        people... When the Muslims are large in number, the nations of
        earth will gather against them "like hungry people going to sit
        at a table full of food"... The people of Iraq will have no food
        or money due to oppression by the "Romans" (the US invasion of
        Iraq, 2003)... There will be much food, but much of it will have
        no blessing... People will refuse when they are offered
        food...&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit will be shared only with the rich;
        the poor will not benefit... People will become uncharitable
        misers, and good deeds will decrease...<font face="Times New
          Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0"> Men will walk in the
            marketplace with their thighs exposed (shorts)... Men will
            begin to look like women and women like men... People will
            dance till late at night... </font></font>Women will enter
        the business world, and will refuse to have children... Children
        will be foul and full of rage... </p>
      <p>Rain will be acidic...Smoke will appear over cities (smog/haze
        pollution)... Earthquakes will increase... Men will try to make

      <p><b>The Great Hour &amp; Day of Doom ~</b><a name="doom"></a> </p>
      <p>The exact time of (al-Sa'at al'Uzma (the Great Hour), or Day of
        Doom, is known only to God. </p>
      <p>Anas ibn Malik told this Hadith (reported by Ibn Majh and
        Bukhari) spoken by the Prophet: "I shall tell you a Hadith which
        I heard from the Messenger of Allah, and which no one will tell
        you after me. I heard him say, 'Among the signs of the Hour will
        be the disappearance of knowledge and the appearance of
        ignorance. Adultery will be prevalent and the drinking of wine
        will be common. The number of men will decrease and the number
        of women will increase until there will be fifty women to be
        looked after by one man.'" </p>
      <p>Ali ibn Abi Talib quotes the Prophet (pboh) thus: "The Hour
        will come when leaders are oppressors, when people believe in
        the stars and reject al-Qadar [Divine Decree, prophecy] when a
        trust becomes a way of making a profit, when people give to
        charity reluctantly, when adultery becomes widespread --- when
        this happens, then your people will perish.'" </p>
      <p>As recorded by Bukhari, Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet
        (saws) said: "The Hour will not come until the following events
        have come to pass: people will compete with one another in
        constructing high buildings; two big groups will fight one
        another, and there will be many casualties --- they will both be
        following the same religious teaching; earthquakes will
        increase; time will pass quickly; afflictions and killing will
        increase; nearly thirty dajjals will appear, each of them
        claiming to be a messenger from Allah; a man will pass by a
        grave and say, 'Would that I were in your place'; the Sun will
        rise from the West; when it rises and the people see it, they
        will all believe, but that will be the time when 'No good will
        it do to a soul to believe in them then, if it believed not
        before'; and a wealthy man will worry lest no one accept his
        Zakat [charity]." </p>
      <p>Some exegetes claim that the rising of the Sun in the West
        refers to the rise of Islam in Europe, but it more likely
        indicates a shift of the Earth's axis, which is predicted by
        several prophets of other cultures. </p>
      <p>Abu Sa'id al-Khudri states that the Prophet (saws) said:
        "Thunderbolts will increase so much as the Hour approaches that
        when a man comes to a people, he will ask, 'Who amongst you was
        struck by a thunderbolt this morning?' and they will say,
        'So-and-so and so-and-so was struck'." </p>
      <p>Abu Hurairah recorded that the Prophet (saws) said: "The Hour
        will not come until there has been rain which will destroy all
        dwellings except tents." </p>
      <p>Ibn Majah narrated this Hadith: "The Prophet said: Just before
        the Hour, there will be days in which knowledge will disappear
        and ignorance will appear, and there will be much Harj" [killing
        in the Ethiopian language; also quoted by Bukhari in Volume 9,
        Book 88, Numbers 183, 185 &amp;186, narrated Abu Musa) </p>
      <p>In like wise, according to Bukhari, Abu Hurairah (radiallahu
        anhu) said: "The Prophet said, Time will pass rapidly, knowledge
        will decrease, miserliness will become widespread in peoples
        hearts, afflictions will appear, and there will be much Harj.
        The people asked, O Messenger of Allah, what is Harj? He said,
        Killing, killing!" </p>
      <p>Ahmad recorded a report by Abd Allah ibn 'Amr, that the Prophet
        (saws) said: "The Hour will not come until Allah takes away the
        best people on earth; only the worst people will be left; they
        will not know any good or forbid any evil." </p>
      <p>Ahmad also quotes Mohammed (pboh) via Alba'al-Salami, thus: "I
        heard the Prophet (saws) say: 'The Hour will only come upon the
        worst of the people'." </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            <i>Sahih</i> of Al-Bukhari transmits this warning from
            Mohammed (pboh): "The least of the signs of the Last Hour
            will be a fire which will gather mankind together from the
            East and West... </font></font>Finally, a cold wind will
        come and kill all believers, leaving only unbelievers on the
        earth who will then witness the Last Hour. The angel Israfil
        will blow a trumpet, and the resurrection of all human beings
        will begin... </p>
      <p>"The Hour will come suddenly: when a man has milked his
        she-camel and taken away the milk, but he will not have time to
        drink it; before a man repairing a tank for his livestock will
        be able to put water in it for his animals; and before a man who
        has raised a morsel of food to his mouth will be able to eat
        it." </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Mohammed
(pboh)
speaks






            of the Day of Doom, thus in <i>Quran</i> 56: "Say: The
            ancients, and the later folk shall be gathered at the
            appointed time of a known day. Then you erring ones, you
            that cried lies, you shall eat of a tree called Zakkoum, and
            you shall fill therewith your bellies and drink on top of
            that boiling water, lapping it down like thirsty camels.
            This shall be their hospitality on the Day of Doom."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"So,
            when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast and the earth
            and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single
            blow, then, on that day, the Terror shall come to pass, and
            heaven shall be split, for upon that day it shall be very
            frail, and the angels shall stand upon its borders, and upon
            that day eight shall carry above them the throne of the
            Lord. On that day you shall be exposed, not one secret of
            yours concealed..." (<i>Quran</i> 69)</font></font> </p>
      <p>Another version of the Trumpet prophecy states that, at the
        first sounding everyone will be struck with terror, at the
        second blast, all will be struck down, and all will be
        resurrected at the third. <font face="Times New Roman, Times,
          serif"><font size="-0">The <i>Qur'an</i> emphatically
            describes two trumpet blasts, which have been interpreted to
            represent two Resurrections:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            there shall be a blast on the Trumpet, and all who are in
            the Heaven and all who are on the earth shall expire, save
            those whom God shall vouchsafe to live. Then there shall be
            another blast on it, and lo! Arising they shall gaze around
            them: and the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord."
            (<i>Qur'an</i> 39: 68-69)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"One
            day, the disturbing trumpet blast shall disturb it which the
            second blast shall follow. Verily, it will be but a single
            blast." (<i>Qur'an</i> 79: 6, 7, 13)</font></font> </p>
