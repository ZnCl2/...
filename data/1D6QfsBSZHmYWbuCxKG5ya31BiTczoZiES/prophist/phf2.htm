      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Beginning
with
Genesis





            and continuing through the Revelation of St. John, the
            Hebrew prophets spoke forth in Jehovah's name to promise
            their downtrodden countrymen divine deliverance from their
            oppressors.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Bible contains 1,817 predictions in 8,352 verses; the Old
            Testament includes 1,239 predictions in 6,641 verses, and
            the New Testament contains 578 predictions in 1,711 verses,
            for a total of 27% predictive material. This multitude of
            prophecies assures the Jews and Christians that God will
            deliver Israel from its enemies and itself and build it into
            a glorious empire to which a conquered world will be
            subject.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Christians
hold





            the Bible to be the infallible word of God, but several
            passages in the book caution against taking prophecies as
            gospel: I Samuel 9:9; Jeremiah 23:11, 14, 16, 25-28, 30-32,
            40; Deuteronomy 18:22; Matthew 7:15-23; <i>ibid</i>.,
            13:57;<i> ibid</i>., 24:5, 23, 24. Ezekiel 3:17-19 defines
            the prophets' task:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Son
            of Man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
            Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
            warning from me.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"When





            I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die: and thou
            givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from
            his wicked ways, to save his life; the same wicked man shall
            die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
            hand.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Yet
            if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wicked
            way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered
            thy soul."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Insanity
is
often





            concomitant with prophetic ability. According to Hosea 9:7,
            "The prophet is a fool, and the spiritual man is mad."
            Jeremiah 29:26 described his fellow prophets as "every man
            that is mad", and in II Kings 9:11, the prophet Elijah is
            called a "mad fellow" for his bizarre behavior. Yet there is
            method in their madness: the whole of Jewish and Christian
            belief predicts a personal, enlightened, and divinely
            appointed king --- the Messiah --- by whom the Holy Kingdom
            of God will be established.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Messiah"
is
the





            Anglicized form of the Hebrew word <i>Mashiah</i>
            (anointed). The use of the word derives from its reference
            to Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with oil and
            consecrated to the service of Jehovah (Exodus 28: 41). The
            High Priest of Israel was titled "The Mashiah of God"
            (Leviticus 4: 3, 5, 16) and the Jewish kings were "the
            Anointed of the Lord" (I Samuel 2: 10, 35, etc.). Some of
            the prophets also were anointed (I Kings 19: 16). The
            prophetic concept of a Messiah first appears in Isaiah 11:
            1-12:</font></font> </p>

            Jewish Messianic program calls for two Messiahs. The first,
            Messiah ben Joseph, will be killed in Jerusalem by Armilus
            (the Antichrist). He will be resurrected by Messiah ben
            David, who will kill Armilus in turn.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In <i>Sefer
Ta'am





              Z'qenim</i>, Eliziezer Askenazi transmitted an explicit
            Jewish prophecy, first recorded by Hai Gaon (938-1038 AD),
            which describes to the two Messiahs:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"When
eight
years





            will be left of the years of the end, which are the years of
            the beginning of the redemption... a man will rule over
            Israel for not less than nine months and not more than three
            years. At that time a man will arise from among the Children
            of Joseph... and he will be called Messiah of God. And many
            people will gather around him in Upper Galilee, and he will
            be their king... But most of Israel will be in their exile,
            for it will not be clear to them that the end has come. And
            then Messiah ben Joseph, with the men who rally around him,
            will go up from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they will slay the
            procurator of the king of Edom, and the people who will be
            with him... And when all the nations hear that a king has
            risen among the Children of Israel in Jerusalem, they will
            rise up against them in the other countries and will expel
            them, saying: "Until now you were with us in faith, and so
            that you should have neither king nor prince; but now that
            you have a king you must not dwell in our land."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            many of Israel will go out into the desert... and will dwell
            there in tents, and many of them will lack bread and
            water... and they will suffer in accordance with their
            deeds. And many of them will leave the covenant of Israel,
            for they will become weary of their lives...</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            when Messiah ben Joseph and all the people with him will
            dwell in Jerusalem, Armilus will hear their tidings and will
            come and make magic and sorcery to lead many astray with
            them, and he will go up and wage war against Israel, and
            will defeat Messiah ben Joseph and his people, and will kill
            many of them, and will capture others, and divide their
            booty.. And he will slay Messiah ben Joseph and it will be a
            great calamity for Israel... Why will permission be granted
            to Armilus to slay Messiah ben Joseph? In order that the
            heart of those of Israel who have no faith should break, and
            so they will say: "This is the man for whom we have hoped;
            now he came and was killed and no redemption is left for
            us." And they will leave the covenant of Israel, and attach
            themselves to the nations, and the latter will kill them.</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            most of the slain will be in the land for forty days. When
            Messiah ben Joseph is killed, his body will remain cast out
            for forty days, but no unclean thing will touch him, until
            Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life, as
            commanded by the Lord. And this will be the beginning of the
            signs he will perform, and this is the resurrection of the
            dead which will come to pass. And then Messiah ben David and
            Elijah and Israel, who come from the deserts to Jerusalem,
            will sit in peace and safety for many days, and will build
            houses and plant vineyards, and they will succeed in herds
            and property, until Gog will hear their tidings... And the
            Land of Gog and Magog is of the Land of Edom... And they
            will come to fight and they will wage war against Jerusalem
            and Messiah ben David, and Elijah and all the people who are
            in it..."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Jewish <i>Sephir Zohar</i> (2:7b) contains a similar

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Sufferings
will





            overtake Israel, and all the nations and their kings will
            consult together against her, and many evil decrees will
            arise and will bring trouble upon trouble, and each
            subsequent one will cause the earlier to be forgotten. And
            then a pillar of fire will appear, positioned from Above to
            Below for forty days, and all the nations of the world will
            see it. At that time King Messiah will be stirred up to come
            forth from the Garden of Eden, from that place which is
            called Bird's Nest. And he will arise in the Land of
            Galilee. And on the day on which he comes there the whole
            world will tremble, and all the children of the world will
            hide in caves and crevices, and will think that they cannot
            be saved... The Messiah will arise and reveal himself in the
            Land of Galilee because that was the first place to be
            destroyed in the Holy Land; therefore he will reveal himself
            there of all places, and from thence he will stir up battles
            in the whole world. And after the forty days in which the
            pillar of fire will stand from the earth to heaven in the
            sight of the whole world, and the Messiah will reveal
            himself, there will arise from the east a star flaming with
            all colors. And seven other stars will surround that star
            and attack it in battle from all sides, three times every
            day, for seventy days, and the children of the world will
            see it. And that star will wage war against them with arrows
            of flaming fire which will erupt on all sides, and it will
            crush them until it swallows them every evening. And in the
            morning it will disgorge them, and they will again wage war
            against it in the sight of the whole world, and thus every
            day for seventy days. And after the seventy days that star
            will be hidden, and the Messiah will be hidden for twelve
            months. And that pillar of fire will return as before, and
            in it the Messiah will be hidden, and that pillar will not

            in that pillar to the firmament, and there he will receive
            power and the crown of kingship. And when he descends, that
            pillar of fire will again be visible as before to the eyes

            revealed, and many nations will gather against him, and he
            will stir up wars in the whole world. And at that time the
            Holy One, blessed be He, will manifest His power against all
            the nations of the world, and King Messiah will become known
            in all the world, and all the kings of the world will rise
            up to wage war against him. And many of the wicked among the
            Jews will join them and come with them to wage war against

            concerning the "latter days" of civilization. The prophetic
            message of the New Testament is to announce His imminent

            Advent of the Messiah, the Great Day of Judgment, and the
            Resurrection of the Dead are cornerstones of the Jewish and
            Christian faiths. Ideas about the Resurrection began to
            develop from a possible misinterpretation of Ezekiel 37.
            However, his vision of the Dry Bones restored to life more
            properly symbolizes Zionism, the Restoration of the Jews to
            Israel. This prophecy was transformed and projected into a
            necromantic hope for the revival of the righteous dead so
            that they too can enjoy the good life on Earth with Jesus.
            The idea of the Resurrection goes to show that people will
            believe anything, provided it's incredible. Yet it may well
            happen anyway, for nothing is impossible to God:</font></font>

element





            of New Testament prophecy is called the Rapture or
            Translation, in which event faithful Christians will be
            removed from the Earth. Many Christians believe that the
            Rapture will be timed to rescue them from the misery of the
            Apocalypse. But according to Matthew 24:31, the Rapture
            follows the Apocalypse:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"Immediately

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">This

            no difference between the Resurrection and the Rapture

            transformed into immortal bodies. The Rapture of the living
            Christians is prophesied by other Bible authors. Mark 13:27
            merely repeats Matthew 24:31; Luke 17:34-36 is more

            Biblical Rapture has taken on a modern form in the Great
            Exodus or World Evacuation project that is planned as a
            mission of mercy by extraterrestrials to rescue some
            earthlings from harm in the event of a global disaster. The
            Space Brother Kuthumi explains it thus through a human
            channel:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"The
            situation is greatly related to international affairs. It
            cannot be dogmatically determined the exact nature of the
            event that will precipitate these crucial events. Whether a
            panic button reaction or a polarity that cannot be
            maintained, when a certain critical point is reached in
            planetary affairs, the changing of the auric color and
            magnetic field surrounding the earth will automatically
            trigger the plan into action.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"The
            unpredictable element of human action must be considered.
            The freedom of will of humanity prevents any actual knowing

            action and reaction of humanity to given influences and
            situations are a key factor. The onset of war on a
            devastating level would be a crucial incident, which would
            then precipitate intervention of a cataclysmic nature.
            Geological factors taking place within the orb itself are an
            intricate part of the triggering action. The combination of
            both of these events would trigger the first two phases of
            evacuation immediately in a secret manner. The third phase
            would follow shortly thereafter. For the third phase is a

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            prophet Daniel lived in Babylon during the Jewish exile
            about 600 BC. Daniel's book contains four apocalyptic
            visions that describe the rise of four beasts that symbolize
            the successive empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome.
            The vision describes Rome as a beast with ten horns. In
            recent years, this symbol has been interpreted to mean the
            European Common Market or NATO.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Many
            Bible scholars affirm that the prophecies of Daniel were
            fulfilled long ago, and they have presented sound arguments
            supported by history. For example, in the Sibylline Oracle
            3:381-400, written ca. 140 BC, the ten horns (Daniel 7:7,
            20, 24) are recognized as the ten kings preceding Antiochus
            Epiphanes (175-164 BC). The historian Josephus identified
            the "little horn" (Daniel 7:20-27) with Antiochus Epiphanes.
            In the 4th century AD, the Neo-Platonist philosopher
            Porphyry in his <i>Arguments Against the Christians</i>
            showed that Daniel 11 is not a prophecy, but a history of
            the Seleucids and Ptolemies. However, history seems to
            repeat itself with new actors, so some of Daniel's history
            may well be prophecies that apply to the Antichrist. The
            following are genuine prophecies pertaining to these latter
            days:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"And
            in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors

            he shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation, and
            that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. (Daniel

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            other words, the Antichrist will make a covenant with
            Israel, but he will break it by desecrating Solomon's

            shall begin immediately thereafter. Biblical exegetes hold
            that David's "weeks" are "weeks of years" (seven years), if
            not also of days. Concerning the Tabernacle, see also
            Ezekiel 41-43, Malachi 3:1, Haggai 2:9, and Amos 9:11. The

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Revelation of St. John is the 66th and last book of the
            Bible. It is one of the most prophetic and controversial.
            Although it is attributed to St. John, who allegedly
            received this knowledge when he was imprisoned at Patmos,
            there are many indications that the book actually is a
            plagiarized Mithraic document. The ancient mystery cult of
            Mithra was the official religion of Rome and Christianity's
            chief competitor for men's souls. Eventually Christianity
            dominated and destroyed Mithraism. In the process, the
            Church adopted much of Mithraic doctrine and symbolism into
            Christian dogma and rituals.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            extensive editing suffered by the book (and the entire
            Bible) is highlighted in the closing words of Revelation 22:

            in this book: And if anyone takes away from the words of the
            book of this prophecsy, God will take away his part from the
            Book of Life, from the Holy City, and from the things which
            are written in this book."</font></font> </p>

            Older versions read: "...if any man shall take away an jot
            or tittle from the words of this book.." Jots and tittles
            are the Hebrew equivalent of periods and commas. If this
            prophetic curse is effective, then the editors of the Bible
            are in serious trouble.</font></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Scholarly
exegesis
has





            determined that apart from the Resurrection, Tribulation and
            Millenium, St. John's vision of the Apocalypse refers to
            leading historical events of his time. Since then,
            theological and political editorialists have variously
            identified the Beast and Harlot as Mohammed, the Papacy,
            Napoleon, Hitler, etc.. An acceptable historic
            interpretation, free of theological odium, suggests that the
            beast from the sea (Revelation 13:1) is the Roman Empire.
            The Mark of Beast (Revelation 13:16) is the emperor's image
            on the coin of the realm. The abomination of desolation was
            fulfilled by Caligula, who confiscated several Jewish
            synagogues and defiled them by installing his own statue.
            The historian Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i> XIII, viii, 2) noted
            that Caligula even sought to have a statue of his image
            erected in the Temple of Jerusalem.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            seven heads of the beast were seven emperors, five of whom
            had fallen by St. John's time: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
            Claudius, and Nero, who died in 68 AD. The sixth one was
            Vespasian (70-79 AD), and the seventh, "yet to come," was
            Titus, who reigned a mere two years (79-81 AD): "But when he
            comes he must continue a short space" (Revelation 17:9-11).
            The eighth emperor-head was Domitian (81-96 AD), who was
            identified with the beast "which was, and is not, and shall
            come up out of the bottomless pit... And the beast which was
            and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the
            seven, and goeth into perdition." This mysterious language
            can be explained by thewidespread contemporary belief that
            Nero was still alive (as documented by Tacitus: <i>Hist.</i>
            II, 8and the <i>Sibylline Oracles</i> V, 28-33). In the
            opinion of pagan authors such as Juvenal (IV, 38), Domitian
            was a second Nero and thus "the one that was, that is not,
            and that is to return."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            this scheme of interpretation, the ten horns (Revelation
            17:12-16) represent the vassal rulers under Rome's
            supremacy. The second beast, the False Prophet (Revelation
            13:11), signifies the apostate Christians who tried to
            corrupt their fellows into adopting heathen practices such
            as Christmas (Mithra's birthday) and the Eucharist sacrament
            (another Mithraic ritual). The woman in travail (Revelation
            12) is the Church, whose child is Christ.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">This
            summary interpretation suffers from two difficulties: (1)
            its enumeration passes over three emperors (Galba, Otho, and
            Vitellius), but they may be discounted since each one
            reigned but a few months; (2) the prophet assigned his work
            to the reign of Vespasian, who was "the one that is," rather
            than Domitian as suggested above. However, it was customary
            for apocalyptic authors to predate their writings to give
            them the appearance of being older and thus more accurately
            prophetic. John followed this practice. No fraud was
            intended by this literary device; it was merely a peculiar
            stylistic convenience suited to the subject matter.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            Antichrist legend is the biblical and medieval
            anthropomorphictransformation of the ancient Babylonian
            Dragon myth, adapted to Christian apocalyptic purposes.
            Tiawat ("Sea"), the Dragon of Chaos, was a myth among the
            Akkadian founding fathers of Babylon some 6,000 years ago.
            Tiawat, a crocodilian female monster, presided over the
            confusion of waters prior to the creation of the other
            Babylonian gods. Tiawat rebelled against the new gods, but
            was defeated and imprisoned. Tiawat in fact represented the
            estuary of the Euphrates River, which raged out of control
            until it was confined somewhat and diverted by a vast system

            Little Horn (Daniel 11:21); Assyrian (Isaiah 10:5); Chaldean
            (Habukkuk 1:6); Nebuchadnessar (Ezekiel 29:19); Man of Sin

            Armilus (Sephir Zohar). The first use of the popular term

calls

            Others claim that he will be from the Jewish tribe of Dan.
            He will rise to power through diplomacy and intrigue,
            supported by Arab oil money and the European Common Market.
            He will be assassinated but will revive from a fatal neck
            wound in a "miraculous" manner (and with the aid of modern
            medical science). He will be "born again" and thereafter
            exert enormous charismatic power and demonstrate phenomenal
            magical effects with the aid of his propagandist, the False
            Prophet. Together they will deceive many people (even some
            Christians) into thinking that the Beast is Messiah. He will
            make a covenant with Israel, but will break it after three
            and a half years of relative peace. For another three and a
            half years humanity will live and die in utter misery,
            culminating in the battle of Armageddon. During the

            implementation, probably in the form of subcutaneous
            microcircuit implants. Other interpretations have been
            advanced based on a cabalistic translation of the alphabet
            into numbers. For example, if 6 is added to each successive
            number, so that A=6, B=12, C=18, and so on, then "computer"
            equals 666. So does "Kissinger", who meets several of the
            Biblical qualifications for the Man of Sin. Henry received
            the "wound of the sword" (Revelation 13:3, 12, 14) by
            undergoing open-heart surgery in 1982. His diplomatic career
            produced a "covenant" (the Camp David Treaty) with Israel
            and Egypt. His success has been "conquest by flattery"
            (Daniel 11:21). According to the <i>Sephir Zohar</i>
            (v.i.), the Son of Perdition is a Jew; so is Kissinger. At

            Sidon was an Essene who chronicled the life of Jesus (whom

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            the 1990s, Dr. Eli Rips, a leading expert in group theory,
            used computer analysis to discover a prophetic code hidden
            in the Old Testament. He published his study of "Equidistant
            Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis" in the mathematical
            journal <i>Statistical Science</i> (1994) in collaboration
            with physicist Doron Witztom and cryptologist Harold Gans.
            According to Rips, <i>et al</i>., "When the Book of Genesis
            is written in to-dimensional arrays, letter sequences
            spelling words with related meanings often appear in close
            proximity... Randomization analysis shows that the effect is
            significant at the level of 0.00002..." The odds against the
            code being random are so high as to be impossible; the code
            appears to be genuine, but its origin remains a mystery,
            apparently divine.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Rips,





            <i>et al.</i>, found dozens of prophecies, many of which
            have already been fulfilled. Several warn of disasters in
            our near future. For example, they found the words "Hitler",
            Nazi and enemy", "Evil man", and "Slaughter" in Genesis 8:
            17-21; "Shakespeare", "Hamlet" and "Macbeth" in Leviticus;
            "Wright brothers" and "Airplane" in Genesis 30-43; "Edison",
            "Lightbulb", and "Electricity" in Numbers 11-14; "Newton"
            and "Gravity" in Numbers 18 and 19; "Einstein" and "Science"
            in Numbers; "Atomic holocaust", and "World War" encoded with
            "in the End of Days" in plain text; "Man on Moon" and
            "Spaceship" in Numbers; "President Kennedy", "to die",
            "Dallas", "Oswald", "Ruby", etc., in Genesis and Numbers.</font></font>

            of his assassin, "Amir". The prophecy was dated "In 5756"
            (September 1995) and located ("Tel Aviv"). The Gulf War was
            foretold: "Fire on 3 Shevat" (18 January 1991, the date of
            the first Scud missile attack) and "Hussein picked a day"
            (Genesis 14: 6-17).</font></font> </p>

            raptured Christians with Him (Isaiah 27:13; Joel 2:32; Micah
            2:12; Revelation 14:1). The wrath of God will be temporarily
            suspended (Revelation 8:1). Many Jews will repent and

            of Olives (Ezekiel 47:1-5; Acts 1:1-12; Zechariah 14:4,5).
            Jews will join the Christian forces (Zechariah 12:5; <i>ibid</i>.,

            19:1-10, 17-20, 22-24; Joel 3:19). The Tigris and Euphrates
            Rivers will dry up to prepare the way for the invasion of
            the Middle East by the Chinese army (Revelation 9:14). The
            Nile River also will cease to flow. Concerning the fate of
            Egypt, see also Jeremiah 46:7-9; Deuteronomy 26:68; Isaiah

            armies at Har-Megiddo (Mt. Megiddo), also known as
            Armageddon. Har-Megiddo is about 55 miles north of
            Jerusalem, on the southern rim of the Valley of Jehosaphat
            (Joel 3:2, 9-14). It has been an important battlefield
