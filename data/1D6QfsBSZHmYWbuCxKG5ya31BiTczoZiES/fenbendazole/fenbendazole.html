        <i>WARNING: There have been no trials of fenbendazole for
          treating cancer, there may be risks involved and the
          medication is not recommended by doctors</i><br>
      </blockquote>
      In January 2017, Joe Tippens was certain that he would die of
      small cell lung cancer.<br>
      <br>
      But then a veterinarian suggested he try something unconventional,
      to say the least: a drug for dogs.<br>
      <br>
      The medication, fenbendazole, is an anti-worm compound used to
      treat hookworms, roundworms and other gut parasites in animals,
      primarily dogs.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, studies suggesting anti-worm drugs might have
      cancer-fighting properties have been cropping up in a growing
      number of journals.<br>
      <br>
      It's far from a proven treatment, but with three months to live
      and nothing to lose, Joe decided to take a chance on it.<br>
      <br>
      Joe was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in 2016, turning his
      plans upside down, just two days before he was set to move to
      Switzerland from Oklahoma. <br>
      <br>
      He kept up a fighting attitude, but in January 2017, he got the
      news that no one is prepared to hear.<br>
      <br>
      The aggressive cancer was everywhere. It had spread to his liver,
      pancreas, bladder, stomach, neck and bones.<br>
      <br>
      His PET scan 'lit up like a Christmas tree,' he says on his
      website.<br>
      <br>
      At that late stage of small cell lung cancer, Joe's odds of
      survival were less than one percent, and the average life
      expectancy was three months.<br>
      <br>
      He had a trans-Atlantic move planned. He was expecting a grandson.
      And now everything had to come to a halt.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas told him they
      wouldn't give up, and would put him in a clinical trial that
      wouldn't save Joe, but might give him a year or so to live.<br>
      <br>
      He might get to meet his grandson.<br>
      <br>
      'A year (or so) sounds a lot better than 3 months, so I said
      "let's go for it,"' Joe writes. <br>
      <br>
      Browsing an online forum for his alma mater, Oklahoma State
      University, Joe saw a post that caught his eye that same month:
      'If you have cancer or know someone who does, give me a shout.'<br>
      <br>
      He did, and from the poster, a veterinarian, he learned that
      scientists had accidentally discovered that a dog de-worming drug
      seemed to combat many cancers in mice.<br>
      <br>
      The same scientist that had conducted that research, as it
      happened, had stage 4 brain cancer, and the same prognosis Joe had
      been given, according to the vet.<br>
      <br>
      She started popping the dog pills, and within six weeks, as the
      vet told it, the scientist's cancer was gone.<br>
      <br>
      Joe, who was 'a skeleton with skin hanging off of it' at half his
      previous weight, he told KOCO 5 News, placed an order of
      fenbendazole.<br>
      <br>
      His new dosage of dog pills cost just $5 a week. His insurance
      company had spent '$1.2 million on me with traditional means,' he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      According to a study published in Nature, the drug compound
      essentially starves cancer cells and kills them.<br>
      <br>
      It also is, of course, already in production, cheaper, and,
      according to cell studies and reports from people who have tried
      it, not very toxic, especially compared to chemo and
      immunotherapies.<br>
      <br>
      That said, it was a risk.<br>
      <br>
      Joe stayed in the clinical trial (he does not disclose what
      therapy he received) added vitamin E, CBD, bioavailable curcumin
      and, of course, the dog medicine.<br>
      <br>
      He didn't mention the de-worming drug to his doctors.<br>
      <br>
      In May, Joe's first grandchild, Luke, was born. Joe was there to
      meet him.<br>
      <br>
      Two-and-a-half weeks later, he had another PET scan.<br>
      <br>
      'Three months earlier...There was cancer in my body from head to
      toe. And it was a terrifyingly dangerous metastasis that leaves
      virtually 100% of its victims dead within 3 months. Here I was 3
      months later and the PET scan was completely dark......void of any
      light.....anywhere,' Joe writes.<br>
      <br>
      He was dumbfounded. His oncologist was dumbfounded, according to
      Joe's account.<br>
      <br>
      Joe writes that his doctor told him, 'We don't quite know what to
      make of this as you are the only patient on the clinical trial
      with this kind of response.'<br>
      <br>
      In September 2017, Joe went for yet another scan, and was still
      cancer free. At last he told his doctor what he'd been doing
      outside the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      There was no way at that point to prove that it was the de-worming
      drug that vanished Joe's cancer, but his doctor did tell him that
      he was an 'outlier' of the trial, Joe writes.<br>
      <br>
      Joe's final scan was taken in January of 2018, and when he had a
      follow-up appointment that April, he writes that his oncologist
      kicked him out of the cancer center - because Joe had no cancer to
      treat.<br>
      <br>
      His results seem too-good-to-be true, but Joe claims to have
      collected over 40 examples of similar success stories.<br>
      <br>
      And his results were good enough to pique the interest of the
      president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Dr Stephen
      Prescott.<br>
      <br>
      'I'm usually skeptical, and I was and maybe still am about this
      one, but there's interesting background on this' he told KOCO.<br>
      <br>
      Now, Dr Prescott and Joe are working on a case study report,
      according to KOCO. <br>
      <br>
      Joe is careful to note that he's not a doctor, and is 'only one
      man with limited resources.'<br>
      <br>
      'I am not prescribing medicine and I am not qualified to give
      advice on medical treatments.<br>
      <br>
      BUT.....I am qualified to tell my story to as many people as
      possible.' <br>

      <div align="center"><b>A Drug Made for Animals and Taken by Humans
          to Treat Cancer: Fenbendazole</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>From anti-worms to anti-cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Previously, we discussed on this website the anti-worm drug
      Mebendazole (Ref.), which based on a good amount of scientific and
      clinical evidence, shows relevant anti cancer potential. Indeed,
      there are case reports published in peer review papers showing
      that Mebendazole can induce anti-cancer response in some
      aggressive cancers.<br>
      <br>
      In the same article (Ref.) we explored the mechanism behind the
      anticancer action of Mebendazole, and found out that Mebendazole
      acts in a similar way as a group of chemotherapies such as Taxol.
      Yet, in contrast to chemotherapies, due to the way Mebendazole
      works, its toxicity is incomparably lower. Because of its good
      safety profile, the drug is an over the counter drug in most of
      the countries.<br>
      <br>
      I specifically like the anti-worms, anti-parasites, antibiotics,
      antiviral drugs, as a pattern start to emerge suggesting that the
      origin of cancer may be related to such a trigger (e.g. viruses,
      parasites, etc.) in much more cases than we currently are aware
      of. Multiple findings and observations, that I will discuss in a
      different post, indicate that such triggers may initiate cancer
      when they land in a “fertile ground”, represented by specific
      genetic weaknesses combined with a compromised immune system (due
      to e.g. stress, lifestyle, medication, etc.). This is why, I would
      seriously consider using anti-worms, anti-parasites, antibiotics,
      antiviral drugs as a part of more comprehensive treatment
      approaches that could also include conventional therapies. As long
      as the toxicity is low, it could make sense to cycle various drugs
      of this type.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The anti-worm drug Fenbendazole has anti-cancer potential</b><br>
      <br>
      In the same group of drugs as Mebendazole, a group called
      benzimidazoles, there is another anti-worm drug called
      Fenbendazole. Fenbendazole, is a drug used typically not for
      humans like Mebendazole, but for animals (including fish, birds
      and mammals). It is labelled to kill worms such as roundworms,
      hookworms, whipworms, and some tapeworms. Fenbendazole is found
      under various brand names such as Panacur or Safe-Guard.<br>
      <br>
      I did came across this drug some years ago during my research, but
      only recently I was motivated to look closely at it following
      several e-mails from friends who shared with me the blog of a man
      with Small Cell Lung Cancer, who successfully treated his cancer
      with Fenbendazole (Ref.). On his website,&nbsp; Joe Tippens, not
      only reports his experience but also anecdotally reports being in
      contact with more patients experiencing benefits while using
      Fenbendazole, including two cases of 4th stage Pancreatic Cancer,
      Prostrate Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,
      Melanoma, Colon Cancer.&nbsp; This anecdotal report would not be
      enough to trigger me writing this post, if I would not be
      convinced by the existing scientific evidence indicating the anti
      cancer potential connected with many of the benzimidazoles drugs.
      Therefore, I do believe that if Mebendazole could show relevant
      anti-cancer effects in humans, which it did, Fenbendazole could do
      it as well and hopefully even better.<br>
      <br>
      In some diseases, it has been indeed shown that Fenbendazole can
      be more effective than Mebendazole. For example, when tested
      against Cryptococcus neoformans (an encapsulated fungal organism
      that can cause disease such as meningoencephalitis in
      immunocompromised hosts), it has been shown that Fenbendazole was
      more active than Mebendazole or other drugs against this
      opportunistic fungus (Ref.).<br>
      <br>
      While there is more prior literature suggesting anti cancer
      effectiveness related to Fenbendazole, the paper I found most
      relevant to specifically cite here first is a paper that was just
      published during 2018 in one of the most prestigious scientific
      magazine, that is Nature, which adds a lot of weight to the
      communicated message. This paper, entitled “Fenbendazole acts as a
      moderate microtubule destabilizing agent and causes cancer cell
      death by modulating multiple cellular pathways“, concludes the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      “The results, in conjunction with our earlier data, suggest that
      Fenbendazole is a new microtubule interfering agent that displays
      anti-neoplastic activity and may be evaluated as a potential
      therapeutic agent because of its effect on multiple cellular
      pathways leading to effective elimination of cancer cells.”<br>
      <br>
      In this paper, the authors cite potential anti cancer mechanisms
      associated with Fenbendazole, including disruption of microtubule
      function and proteasomal interference, but it was also associated
      with blocking the glucose uptake by cancer cells (through reducing
      the expression of Glut-4 transporter as well as hexokinase) and
      thus starving cancer cells. This means Fenbendazole could also
      work nicely in supporting chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as
      metabolic therapies. Because of the way it works (interacting with
      a site on tubulin similar to colchicine but distinct from that of
      Vinca alkaloids), Fenbendazole will not compete with Vinca
      alkaloids (such as Taxol) but instead will add to the anti cancer
      effect of these conventional treatments similar to other
      benzimidazoles (Ref.).<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, when insulin stimulates glucose uptake in the
      cells, glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) translocates from
      intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane ready to absorb
      glucose. This movement of GLUT4 towards the plasma membrane takes
      place via both rapid vibrations around a point and short linear
      movements (generally less than 10 microm). The linear movement
      seems to take place along microtubules. When disrupting the
      microtubules with drugs such as Fenbendazole, GLUT4 movements are
      disrupted as well strongly reducing insulin-stimulated glucose
      uptake (Ref.).<br>
      <br>
      While Fenbendazole could be relevant for many types of cancers (as
      also suggested by the anecdotal reports listed above and by
      literature on the anticancer effects of benzimidazoles drugs)
      prior literature has so far indicated it’s anti cancer effects in
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (NSCLC)<br>
      <br>
      Fenbendazole inhibits the cellular proteasome function dose- and
      time-dependently and leads to accumulation of ubiquitylated
      derivatives of various cellular proteins, including p53, which, in
      turn, leads to apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathwaythe cells
      first undergo G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis Fenbendazole
      induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, reactive oxygen<br>
      species production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential,
      and cytochrome c release that eventually led to cancer cell death.

      <br>
      <b>Prostate Cancer (Ref.) and&nbsp; taxane-resistant prostate
        cancer cells Glioblastoma</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The questions, is why I would consider using Fenbendazole, a drug
      used for animals, when we already have Mebendazole made for use in
      humans that is associated to similar anticancer mechanisms? There
      are three major reasons for me to do that and consider trying
      Fenbendazole as well:<br>
      <br>
      First, as discussed above, in some diseases, Fenbendazole was more
      effective than Mebendazole;<br>
      Second, it is known that this type of drugs is not very well
      absorbed in the body and the absorption may differ from person to
      person. Therefore switching between different drugs with similar
      expected mechanisms may make sense as one of them may be better
      absorbed in our specific case;<br>
      Third, there is a good chance that the underlying anti-cancer
      mechanism is different for each of the drugs, even if the
      scientific observations suggest similar mechanisms of action (we
      should always remember that science represents not a complete
      understanding of nature, but only steps towards a better
      understanding).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fenbendazole is well tolerated in humans</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although a drug that is used for animals, according to a report
      available at the European Medicine Agency “Fenbendazole seems to
      be well tolerated in humans after oral exposure (single oral dose
      up to 2,000 mg/per person; 500 mg/per person for 10 consecutive
      days)”<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Type and how is Fenbendazole used</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Taking Panacur C granules from Merck<br>
      <br>
      There are people taking it for deworming and they seem to prefer
      the Fenbendazole version that is meant to be used for fish (Ref.).
      In this case, its is used in the range of 5mg/kg/day to
      10mg/kg/day.<br>
      <br>
      However, on his website,&nbsp; Joe Tippens, shows a picture of
      Panacur C box from Merck, sold as Canine Dewormer, containing
      Fenbendazole granules 22.2%. This means every gram of granules
      contains 222mg of pure Fenbendazole.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dose and treatment regime</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In his treatment protocol, following a discussion with one
      scientist from Merck animals who treated her brain cancer with
      Fenbendazole, Joe Tippens uses 1g granules (containing 222mg pure
      Fenbendazole) each day, and he is taking that 3 consecutive days.
      He than stops taking Fenbendazole for the next 4 days. After that
      he starts again, and he goes like this continuously during the
      year. So the drug administration is 3 days ON and 4 days OFF.<br>
      <br>
      If due to any reason taking Fenbendazole for ever it’s not an
      option, I would at least consider taking it for 3 days, then
      repeat a three day course at three weeks and again at three
      months. This the minimum treatment schedule in my view and is
      inline with the rule of 3’s used when treating whipworms
      (Trichuris vulpis). The idea behind this treatment regime is that
      some warms such as Whipworms take 3 months to mature from an egg
      to an adult. If you kill adults at day 1, then three weeks later
      there will be some immature adults which will have matured, but
      you’ll still have eggs and larval worms present (Ref.).
      Nevertheless, this is the minimum regime I would use but I would
      probably better follow the treatment regime used by Joe Tippens
      (continuous 3 days ON and 4 days OFF) for 2-3 months and check if
      there is a response. If there is response, and tumors are
      shrinking I would continue, if not I would stop. Joe Tippens said
      he will take it for the rest of his life. He states there were no
      side effects for him or for over 50 people he knows taking it.<br>
      <br>
      Since it has been shown that 500 mg/per person for 10 consecutive
      days is well tolerated in humans (Ref.), and since as discussed
      below the absorption of Fenbendazole in humans is poor, it may
      help to use from time to time a higher dose, such as 2g granules
      (each gram containing 222 mg pure Fenbendazole) each day, which
      would lead to a daily dose of 444 mg Fenbendazole.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a suitable daily dose of Fenbendazole for longer term
      use may be between 220 mg (the dose that was effective for Joe
      Tippens) and 500mg (the dose shown tolerable in humans).<br>

      Since there are various produces for Fenbendazole under different
      brands, in different forms (granules, solution, capsules) and for
      different animals, it is best to check on the package to
      understand how much active ingredient (Fenbendazole) is in one
      gram (or ml) of the product we buy. And make sure that the daily
      dose of active ingredient (Fenbendazole) is somewhere between 220
      mg and 500 mg. Better to take it with or after food <br>
      <br>
      Like many benzimidazoles, Fenbendazole is very poorly soluble in
      aqueous systems, which are found in the gastrointestinal tract,
      causing its low absorption to the bloodstream and thus very low
      bioavailability. Maximal plasma concentration levels of
      benzimidazoles in humans is known to be markedly increased if the
      substance is used immediately after a meal (Ref.1, Ref.2).<br>
      <br>
      As for the case of Mebendazole, I expect another way to increase
      its absorption in the body is by combining it with Cimetidine
      (Ref.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Add Vitamin E to possibly enable Fenbendazole effectiveness</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During 2008, at the School of Medicine from Johns Hopkins
      University, it has been found that Fenbendazole could affect the
      growth of a human lymphoma cell line only when combined with
      vitamins (Ref.).&nbsp; Supplemented vitamins included B, D, K, E,
      and A.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, in his treatment regime, Joe Tippens also included&nbsp;
      the following: Tocotrienol form of Vitamin E (800IU per day, 7
      days a week); Bio-Available Curcumin (600mg per day, 7 days a
      week), and CBD (25mg per day, 7 days a week) oil (Ref.).<br>
      <br>
      The common vitamin that is both present in the supplement vitamins
      in the article cited above and Joe’s treatment regime is Vitamin E
      (800IU per day, 7 days a week). He uses a VITAMIN E (AS D-ALPHA
      TOCOPHEROL) complex of 400IU called Perfect E, containing:<br>
      <br>
      MIXED TOCOPHEROLS&nbsp; (~D-GAMMA TOCOPHEROL 400 mg; ~D-DELTA
      TOCOPHEROL 9 mg; ~D-BETA TOCOPHEROL 7 mg) TOCOTRIENOLS (FROM PALM)
      (~GAMMA TOCOTRIENOL 19 mg; ~DELTA TOCOTRIENOL 6 mg; ~ALPHA
      TOCOTRIENOL 12 mg; ~BETA TOCOTRIENOL 1 mg)<br>
      <br>
      Given that each capsule has 400UI, 2 capusles/day should match
      Joe’s schedule.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, other studies have also shown that the combination of
      Fenbendazole and Vitamin E can be effective against cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Where to buy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Panacure C can be found all over the world at online shops. It can
      be found in packages of 3 packets of 1g granules (or 222mg
      Fenbendazole, for small dogs) or 3 packets of 2g granules (or
      444mg Fenbendazole, for adult dogs). Fenbendazole should not be
      confused with Flubendazole.<br>

      <br>
      Benzimidazole anthelmintics have reported anti-neoplastic effects
      both in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the in vitro chemosensitivity of three canine glioma cell
      lines to mebendazole and fenbendazole. The mean inhibitory
      concentration (IC50 ) (±SD) obtained from performing the MTT
      [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
      assay after treating J3T, G06-A, and SDT-3G cells for 72 h with
      mebendazole were 0.030?±?0.003, 0.080?±?0.015 and 0.030?±?0.006 µM
      respectively, while those for fenbendazole were 0.550 ?±?0.015,
      1.530?±?0.159 and 0.690?±?0.095 µM; treatment of primary canine
      fibroblasts for 72?h at IC50 showed no significant effect.
      Immunofluorescence studies showed disruption of tubulin after
      treatment. Mebendazole and fenbendazole are cytotoxic in canine
      glioma cell lines in vitro and may be good candidates for
      treatment of canine gliomas. Further in vivo studies are required.<br>

          N-(6-Phenylsulfanyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate Leads to a</b><b>
          Potent Cytotoxic Effect in Tumor Cells</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in
      proteasome inhibitors as a novel class of anticancer drugs. We
      report that fenbendazole (FZ) (methyl
      N-(6-phenylsulfanyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate) exhibits a
      potent growth-inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines but
      not normal cells. We show here, using fluorogenic substrates, that
      FZ treatment leads to the inhibition of proteasomal activity in
      the cells. Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-methylcoumarinamide (MCA),
      benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-7-amido-4-MCA, and
      t-butoxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amido-4-MCA fluorescent derivatives
      were used to assess chymotrypsin-like, post-glutamyl
      peptidyl-hydrolyzing, and trypsin-like protease activities,
      respectively. Non-small cell lung cancer cells transiently
      transfected with an expression plasmid encoding pd1EGFP and
      treated with FZ showed an accumulation of the green fluorescent
      protein in the cells due to an increase in its half-life. A number
      of apoptosis regulatory proteins that are normally degraded by the
      ubiquitin-proteasome pathway like cyclins, p53, and I?Ba were
      found to be accumulated in FZ-treated cells. In addition, FZ
      induced distinct ER stress-associated genes like GRP78, GADD153,
      ATF3, IRE1a, and NOXA in these cells. Thus, treatment of human
      NSCLC cells with fenbendazole induced endoplasmic reticulum
      stress, reactive oxygen species production, decreased
      mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release that
      eventually led to cancer cell death. This is the first report to
      demonstrate the inhibition of proteasome function and induction of
      endoplasmic reticulum stress/reactive oxygen species-dependent
      apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines by fenbendazole, which
      may represent a new class of anticancer agents showing selective
      toxicity against cancer cells.<br>

          fenbendazole when combined with supplementary vitamins.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Diet containing the anthelminthic fenbendazole is used often to
      treat rodent pinworm infections because it is easy to use and has
      few reported adverse effects on research. However, during
      fenbendazole treatment at our institution, an established human
      lymphoma xenograft model in C.B-17/Icr-prkdcscid/Crl (SCID) mice
      failed to grow. Further investigation revealed that the
      fenbendazole had been incorporated into a sterilizable diet
      supplemented with additional vitamins to compensate for loss
      during autoclaving, but the diet had not been autoclaved. To
      assess the role of fenbendazole and supplementary vitamins on
      tumor suppression, 20 vendor-supplied 4-wk-old SCID mice were
      assigned to 4 treatment groups: standard diet, diet plus
      fenbendazole, diet plus vitamins, and diet plus both vitamins and
      fenbendazole. Diet treatment was initiated 2 wk before
      subcutaneous flank implantation with 3 x 107 lymphoma cells. Tumor
      size was measured by caliper at 4-d intervals until the largest
      tumors reached a calculated volume of 1500 mm3. Neither diet
      supplemented with vitamins alone nor fenbendazole alone caused
      altered tumor growth as compared with that of controls. However,
      the group supplemented with both vitamins and
      fenbendazoleexhibited significant inhibition of tumor growth. The
      mechanism for this synergy is unknown and deserves further
      investigation. Fenbendazoleshould be used with caution during
      tumor studies because it may interact with other treatments and
      confound research results.<br>

          Liver Cancer</b><br>
        <i>UCSF Researchers Use Computational Tools to Quickly Screen,
          Identify Drugs</i><br>
        <b>By Laura Kurtzman</b><br>

      <br>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a cancer associated with
      underlying liver disease and cirrhosis that often only becomes
      symptomatic when it is very advanced, is the second leading cause
      of cancer deaths around the world, and yet it has no effective
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As with other conditions without treatments, the data that
      scientists need to understand and treat the disease may be sitting
      in plain view in databases that have barely been analyzed, says
      Atul Butte, MD, PhD, director of the Institute for Computational
      Health Sciences at UC San Francisco.<br>
      <br>
      Bin Chen, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar in Butte’s lab and
      now a faculty member in Pediatrics in the Institute for
      Computational Health Sciences, recently published a paper in
      Gastroenterology about using data-mining computational tools to
      identify a treatment for HCC.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gene Expression and Drug Targets</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data, he
      first derived a molecular disease signature for HCC – looking at
      274 genes that are either up or down regulated in cancerous liver
      tissues, but not in normal liver tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Then, he looked for drugs that were known to target those genes
      and found, to his surprise, that a close cousin of a deworming
      pill, when used in combination with the standard care drug, was
      highly effective at killing cancerous liver tissue that had been
      engrafted into experimental mice.<br>
      <br>
      “We found these disease genes were reversed after six weeks of
      treatment in a patient-derived tissue in mouse model,” Chen said,
      adding that the advantage of the approach he developed is that it
      targets a host of genes at the same time, rather than simply
      targeting a single mutation.<br>
      <br>
      Chen said finding molecular signatures for diseases then looking
      for drugs that work against those signatures is a promising way of
      treating patients who may each have a different set of cancer
      mutations and might not respond to drugs that just targeted them
      one at a time.<br>
      <br>
      “In this study, patients had similar gene expression profiles, but
      not identical,” Chen said. “In most cases, cancers have many
      mutations, and patients will relapse. Our approach might be used
      to control the disease, to make it a chronic condition rather than
      a lethal one.”<br>
      Head Start to a New Drug Candidate<br>
      <br>
      Only a small number of drugs have been analyzed for their gene
      expression profiles, and so it was somewhat lucky that Chen found
      a hit with niclosamide. But even after discovering a match between
      the drug and the disease, his team of UCSF and Stanford University
      researchers was stymied. The drug, which was designed to kill
      parasites, did not work well in the mouse model, because it was
      not soluble.<br>
      <br>
      It was only after Chen’s team stumbled upon a paper that described
      its close cousin, NEN – an ethanolamine salt that is soluble in
      human cells – that they made it work. When they combined NEN with
      sorafenib, the standard of care for advanced HCC, they found that
      the tumors stopped growing.<br>
      <br>
      While NEN has been found safe to use against tapeworms in dogs and
      cats, scientists do not yet know how it would affect humans, or
      whether it would stop cancerous liver tissue from growing in
      humans.<br>
      <br>
      But Chen said it is a promising drug candidate that could be
      developed at half or less than half the cost of a typical drug
      because of the head start he got by using advanced computational
      techniques to mine freely available data.<br>
      <br>
      “Because our method is literally virtual, we can evaluate hundreds
      of drug candidates very quickly,” Chen said. “We looked at more
      than 1,000 drugs before discovering that the deworming pills were
      effective. This is a very efficient way to do drug discovery.”<br>
