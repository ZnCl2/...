      <p>The Windbelt technology was originally conceived in 2004,
        during a trip to Petite Anse, Haiti. This fishing village near
        the coast was not connected to an electrical grid, and the only
        lighting available was diesel-powered or kerosene-based. </p>
      <p>Shawn Frayne, a member of a team from MIT and Petite Anse
        working in the area, recognized that instead of kerosene lamps,
        white LEDs powered by a very inexpensive wind generator might be
        able to better light homes and schools in the area. However,
        when Shawn tried to design this affordable, turbine-based wind
        generator, he hit a brick wall: turbine technology is too
        inefficient at these scales to be a viable option. </p>
      <p>However, these difficult constraints of cost and local
        manufacture led to a new invention, the world’s first
        turbine-less wind generator. </p>
      <p>The Windbelt generator fulfilled its original design criteria
        while demonstrating10x the efficiency of the state-of-the-art in
        micro-turbine technology on these scales. Now, Humdinger is
        poised to take this technology and apply it to a wide array of
        fields, from rural lighting to energy harvesting for wireless
        sensors in ‘smart buildings’... </p>
      <p>Humdinger Wind Energy, LLC, with its Windbelt technology, is
        the first company to successfully demonstrate an efficient
        device of any design for capturing wind energy on the sub-100W
        scale. </p>
      <p>At the scales we’ve been focused on, our generators are 10X to
        30X more efficient than the published state of the art in
        micro-turbines [1,2]. We have successfully powered continuous
        transmissions from off-the-shelf wireless temperature and
        humidity sensor nodes, in addition to operating motors, and
        charging batteries and capacitors. The Windbelt&nbsp; technology
        has a big role to play in a wide range of markets, from
        harvesting energy to continuously power wireless sensor networks
        in the HVAC ducting of ‘smart buildings’, to rural
        electrification in developing countries. Put simply, Humdinger
        Wind Energy is micro-wind power! </p>

      Working in Haiti, Shawn Frayne, a 28-year-old inventor based in
      Mountain View, Calif., saw the need for small-scale wind power to
      juice LED lamps and radios in the homes of the poor. Conventional
      wind turbines don't scale down well --- there's too much friction
      in the gearbox and other components. With rotary power, theres
      nothing out there that generates under 50 watts", Frayne says. So
      he took a new tack, studying the way vibrations caused by the wind
      led to the collapse in 1940 of Washington's Tacoma Narrows Bridge
      (aka Galloping Gertie).
      <p>Frayne's device, which he calls a Windbelt, is a taut membrane
        fitted with a pair of magnets that oscillate between metal
        coils. Prototypes have generated 40 milliwatts in 10-mph slivers
        of wind, making his device 10 to 30 times as efficient as the
        best microturbines. Frayne envisions the Windbelt costing a few
        dollars and replacing kerosene lamps in Haitian homes. "Kerosene
        is smoky and it's a fire hazard," says Peter Haas, founder of
        the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group, which helps
        people in developing countries to get environmentally sound
        access to clean water, sanitation and energy. "If Shawn's
        innovation breaks, locals can fix it. If a solar panel breaks,
        the family is out a panel." </p>
      <p>Frayne hopes to help fund third-world distribution of his
        Windbelt with revenue from first-world applications, such as
        replacing the batteries used to power temperature and humidity
        sensors in buildings. "There's not a huge amount of innovation
        being done for people making $2 to $4 per day," Haas says.
        "Shawn's work is definitely needed." <br>
        In a conventional wind generator, gears help transfer the motion
        of the spinning blades to a turbine where an electric current is
        induced. The Windbelt is simpler and more efficient in light
        breezes”a magnet mounted on a vibrating membrane simply
        oscillates between wire coils. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --</b>&nbsp; An electrical generator including a
        magnetic field generator and at least one energy converter for
        converting energy present in fluid flows into vibrations or
        oscillations. The converter includes a flexible membrane having
        at least two fixed ends. The membrane vibrates when subject to a
        fluid flow. One of the electrical conductor and the magnetic
        field generator is attached to the membrane and configured to
        move with the membrane. The vibration of the membrane caused by
        the fluid flow causes a relative movement between the electrical
        conductor and the applied magnetic field. The relative movement
        causes a change in the strength of the magnetic field applied to
        the electrical conductor, and the change in the strength of the
        magnetic field applied to the electrical conductor induces a
        current flowing in the conductor. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</b> </p>
      <p>[0001]This application generally relates to harvesting energy
        from flowing fluids, and more specifically, to a unique design
        of an energy converter and generator that induce oscillations by
        flowing fluids and utilize the oscillations to produce
        electricity. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</b> </p>
      <p>[0002]The kinetic energy present in flowing fluids, such as
        wind or water, has been successfully applied towards productive
        human ends, such as grinding grain or pumping water.
        Wind-powered generators were developed to harness these fluid
        flows for the production of electricity. Today, wind-powered
        generators take on the largely ubiquitous form of a turbine, or
        rotating airfoil. While these turbine-based wind generators are
        generally useful in certain open spaces with consistently
        high-speed winds, drawbacks still exist, such as heavy initial
        capital costs, low efficiency at all but a narrow range of wind
        speeds, the lack of cost effectiveness at lower power outputs
        levels (&lt;1 kW), etc. </p>
      <p>[0003]To circumvent the drawbacks of the turbine-based devices,
        various alternative generators were designed to utilize other
        natural flow phenomena. However, these proposals were not
        satisfactory due to design complexities, added cost, the need
        for a complex mounting structure, low efficiency in energy
        production, insufficient power generation, inefficient
        production of vibrations, restriction to high flow speeds, etc.
      </p>
      <p>[0004]This disclosure describes various embodiments of unique
        generators that effectively promote oscillations induced by
        flowing fluids, and utilize the oscillations in generating
        electricity or other types of energy. In one aspect, an
        exemplary generator harnesses the energy of fluid flows by way
        of a combination of flutter and vortices shedding induced along
        a tensioned membrane, or "belt", fixed at two or more points.
        The membrane may have an elongated shape or other kinds of shape
        that are known to promote vibrations with the flowing fluids. </p>
      <p>[0005]An exemplary electrical generator includes at least one
        magnetic field generator, at least one electrical conductor, and
        at least one flexible membrane having at least two fixed ends.
        The membrane vibrates when subject to a fluid flow. One of the
        electrical conductor and the magnetic field generator is
        attached to the membrane and configured to move with the
        membrane. The vibration of the membrane caused by the fluid flow
        causes a relative movement between the electrical conductor and
        the applied magnetic field. The relative movement causes a
        change in the strength of the magnetic field applied to the
        electrical conductor, and the change in the strength of the
        magnetic field applied to the electrical conductor induces a
        current flowing in the conductor. One or all parts of the
        generator may be implemented as a MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical
        Systems) device. In one aspect, the direction of the magnetic
        field may be substantially perpendicular to an area enclosed by
        the electrical conductor, when the membrane does not vibrate. </p>
      <p>[0006]The exemplary generator may further include at least one
        mass attached to the membrane, to promote movements or
        vibrations of the membrane when it is subject to fluid flows. In
        one embodiment, a power conditioning circuit may be provided to
        condition the induced current. The power conditioning circuit
        may include a rectifying circuit configured to rectify the
        current. In another embodiment, the magnetic field generator
        includes at least one permanent magnet. In still another
        embodiment, an exemplary generator includes multiple sets of
        electrical conductors, such as coils. The currents generated by
        the multiple sets of conductors may be combined in a serial
        manner. A rechargeable electrical power storage device, such as
        a battery or capacitor may be provided to be charged by the
        current or currents. </p>
      <p>[0007]In one embodiment, the exemplary generator further
        includes a supporting structure. The fixed ends of the membrane
        are affixed to the supporting structure. The electrical
        conductor is attached to the membrane. The magnetic field
        generator is disposed on the supporting structure. In another
        embodiment, the magnetic field generator is attached to the
        membrane, and the electrical conductor is disposed on the
        supporting structure. In another embodiment, the magnetic field
        generator is oriented so as to project the magnetic field (i.e.,
        pole to pole axis) perpendicular to the plane of the membrane.
        In still another embodiment, the magnetic field generator is
        oriented so as to project the magnetic field parallel to the
        plane of the membrane. Of course, the electrical conductors are
        rearranged in each corresponding embodiment to account for
        changes in the magnetic field direction. </p>
      <p>[0008]According to another embodiment, the exemplary generator
        includes an adjustable tension provider, such as a motor,
        configured to apply an adjustable tension force between the
        fixed ends of the membrane according to the speed of the fluid
        flow. A sensor may be provided to generate a signal indicating
        an effect of the fluid flow. In one aspect, the tension force is
        adjusted based on the current. </p>
      <p>[0009]According to another embodiment, the exemplary generator
        may include multiple flexible membranes. In one aspect, the
        membranes may affix to the same supporting structure. </p>
      <p>[0010]Additional aspects and advantages of the present
        disclosure will become readily apparent to those skilled in this
        art from the following detailed description, wherein only
        exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are shown and
        described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode
        contemplated for carrying out the present disclosure. As will be
        realized, the present disclosure is capable of other and
        different embodiments, and its several details are capable of
        modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing
        from the disclosure. Accordingly, the drawings and description
        are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0019]In the following description, for the purposes of
        explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to
        provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It
        will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the
        present disclosure may be practiced without these specific
        details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices
        are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily
        obscuring the present disclosure. </p>
      <p>[0020]An exemplary electrical generator includes a magnetic
        field generator and a flexible membrane for converting energy
        present in fluid flows, such as air flows, water flows, tides,
        etc., into vibrations or oscillations. The flexible membrane
        includes at least one electrical conductor attached thereto and
        has at least two fixed ends. The membrane vibrates when subject
        to a fluid flow. As used herein, the term "flexible" refers to a
        membrane that has the ability to morph into a large variety of
        determinate and indeterminate shapes without damage, in response
        to the action of an applied force. </p>
      <p>[0021]The at least one electrical conductor may be implemented
        as aluminum or copper coils attached to the membrane and
        configured to move with the membrane. For instance, one or more
        coils are integrated into or onto the oscillating membrane.
        Those coils are suspended over corresponding magnetic field
        generators. In one embodiment, the coils are printed directly
        onto the membrane via techniques that have recently been
        developed for RFID tags and patch antennae. </p>
      <p>[0022]The vibration of the membrane caused by the fluid flow
        causes a relative movement between the electrical conductor and
        the applied magnetic field. The relative movement causes a
        change in the strength of the magnetic field applied to the
        electrical conductor, and the change in the strength of the
        magnetic field applied to the electrical conductor induces a
        current flowing in the conductor. </p>
      <p>[0023]When using wind or air flow to drive the exemplary
        generator, wind flows perpendicularly to the long axis of the
        membrane, such as a membrane having an elongated shape. The
        flowing fluid induces a spontaneous instability in the tensioned
        membrane known as flutter. The flutter of the membrane results
        in a regular, reduced torsion high energy oscillation mode in
        appropriately designed variations. This mode is often referred
        to as the first normal mode of oscillation. Additionally,
        vortices shedding may occur along the edges and surface of the
        membrane, in some cases enhancing the oscillation. </p>
      <p>[0024]The vibration of the membrane thereby causes the coils to
        move relative to the magnets. A changing magnetic field cuts
        through the closed area defined by the coils, thus resulting in
        an EMF within said coils. Thereby an electricity flow results,
        without requiring the physical coupling of the vibrating
        membrane to a piston or cam system for power generation. This
        electric generator operates at a variety of wind speeds,
        including lower speeds than required for most turbine-based wind
        generators. Moreover, the cost of an exemplary generator of this
        disclosure is substantially lower than most other wind-based
        generators, and the absence of physically grinding parts offers
        the possibility of long, quiet, maintenance-free operation. No
        leading bluff bodies are required, although they can be employed
        if desired. </p>
      <p>[0025]Additionally, the exemplary generator achieves better
        efficiencies, particularly at small scales, than that of turbine
        or turbine-less generators, such as those using conventional
        piezoelectric approach. Without the Betz limit restriction of
        airfoil-based rotary turbines, more relaxed efficiency limits
        can be established for this improved wind generator class. </p>
      <p>[0026]The concepts disclosed herein address energy challenges
        in a wide array of fields, from energy harvesting for small
        scale RF sensor arrays to decentralized rural electrification to
        grid-connected large scale power supplies. </p>
      <p>[0027]In some embodiments, the oscillation is in a mode with
        two relatively fixed nodes, while in other embodiments multiple
        nodes across the membrane may be established. Also, in some
        embodiments, the coils are positioned on the membrane and move
        relative to a stationary set of magnets, whereas in other
        embodiments the coils are stationary on the mount, and the
        magnets are affixed to the moving membrane. Additionally, the
        magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets or
        electromagnetic induction, with some of the electricity created
        by the generator being routed into the wiring of electromagnets
        to maintain their field. The coils may assume various shapes,
        configurations or forms. </p>
      <p>[0028]FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary generator 100 according to
        this disclosure. The generator 100 includes an elongated
        membrane 2, two coils 4a, 4b and a support structure 6. The
        supporting structure 6 includes a base 8 and two sections
        thereof for receiving permanent magnets 12a, 12b. Adhesives 14a,
        14b are provided to join the membrane 2 to the base 8. A power
        conditioning circuit is provided on or off the base/membrane to
        process the currents produced by the coils 4a, 4b. The coils 4a,
        4b are adhered to the surface of or within the membrane 2, and
        suspended over the magnets 12a, 12b, respectively. Two leads
        16a, 16b are coupled to coils 4a, 4b, respectively. The tension
        applied to the membrane 2 is a function of the elasticity of the
        membrane 2 and the physical characteristics (i.e., young's
        modulus, etc.) of the base 8, along with the particular distance
        between the ends of the base 8. </p>
      <p>[0029]The exemplary generator 100 shown in FIG. 1 operates as
        follows. A flow of fluid, which may include liquid flows of
        water for instance, or a flow of air such as that found in
        artificial ventilation systems or in natural wind, travels
        across the elongated and tensioned membrane 2. This fluid flow
        travels in a direction approximately perpendicular to the major
        axis of the membrane, after which a self-exciting oscillation of
        the membrane will begin. This oscillation often will initiate
        with a slight torsion of the membrane 2. However, this initial
        condition will quickly (approximately &lt;1 sec) stabilize to an
        oscillation of the lowest normal mode with reduced torsion, such
        as that depicted in FIG. 2. As the membrane 2 vibrates, the
        coils 4a, 4b will likewise oscillate with the membrane 2, above
        the fixed permanent magnets 12a, 12b. A side view of this
        vibration is illustrated in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>[0030]FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary orientation of the
        magnets 12a, 12b beneath the coils 4a, 4b. The magnetic field is
        oriented such that the closed area of the coils 4a, 4b is
        crossed by perpendicular field lines, as originally described by
        Michael Faraday. It should be noted that several orientations of
        the magnets will produce appropriately oriented magnetic fields.
        The strength of that field through the coils 4a, 4b changes as
        the coils 4a, 4b move relative to the stationary magnets 12a,
        12b. This change in the magnetic field produces an electromotive
        force (EMF). The EMF creates a current, i.e., a flow of
        electrons, dependent on the load conditions, internal
        resistance, impedance, and a range of other factors. </p>
      <p>[0031]In the first normal mode of oscillation, the coils 4a, 4b
        oscillate approximately in phase with each other. The
        electricity flowing through respective leads 16a, 16b may be
        combined without significant destructive interference. The leads
        16a, 16b may be joined in parallel or series, depending on the
        desired voltages and currents fed into a power conditioning
        circuit associated with the generator 100. </p>
      <p>[0032]The configuration shown in FIG. 1 effectively
        concentrates the energy of oscillation of the entire membrane at
        one or more discrete zones. This works in a similar fashion to
        the way in which a lever "concentrates" a large translated
        motion into a smaller motion with a greater potential force.
        This greater force nearer the ends of the membrane is what
        allows for the incorporation of heavier and thicker coils
        without dampening out the oscillation. Hence, a smaller magnetic
        field is needed to fill the smaller volume of space traveled by
        the coils, which translates to lesser magnet costs.
        Additionally, by placing the coils largely out of the path of
        the flowing fluid, the majority of the center area of the
        membrane can respond to those flows without impediment of
        wiring. </p>
      <p>[0033]FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an exemplary power
        conditioning circuit 40 using a series connection to achieve
        higher voltages for low wind speeds. The circuit 40 includes a
        rectifier 41, a smoothing capacitor 42, a step-up supply 43, and
        a power storage device 44, such as a rechargeable battery or a
        super capacitor. The rectifier 41 and the smoothing capacitor 42
        convert the output of the coils 4a, 4b, which is in the form of
        an alternating current, into smooth direct current. The DC
        current is then fed into the step-up supply 43, or a boost
        converter, if a particular range of voltages is desired for the
        end application. The power storage device 44 is provided to
        buffer between the current drawn by the application and the
        supply from the coils 4a, 4b of the generator 100. </p>
      <p>[0034]As shown in FIG. 1, the base 8 assumes the shape of a
        bow. The bow-shaped base provides an approximately constant
        tension on the membrane 2 over short deviations. So, as the
        membrane 2 stretches over time, the spring-action of the base 2
        ensures that the membrane 2 remains at a particular tension. It
        is understood that other shapes of bases may be used to
        implement the generator 100. A flat unbowed base can also be
        used, and the natural elasticity of the membrane 2 itself can
        serve this same purpose. In another embodiment, constant force
        springs (such as Belleville washers) or compliant mechanisms may
        be attached to the ends of the membrane or incorporated into the
        structure of the base itself, so that a more reliable constant
        tension on the membrane 2 can be maintained over longer periods
        of time. For embodiments that the membrane(s) are vertically
        oriented, a constant restoring force can be generated with
        gravitational attraction, by attaching weights to the membrane 2
        or base 8. </p>
      <p>[0035]In another embodiment, a feedback system is built into
        the generator 100 to provide or apply greater tensioning of the
        membrane 2 in higher wind speeds. This feedback system may be
        implemented in a variety of ways, such as installing a solenoid
        within the base 2 of the mounting structure. The pushing force
        of the solenoid can then be varied in step with the electrical
        output of the coils 4a, 4b. In another embodiment, memory alloys
        or dielectric materials that change shape with varying input
        voltages are used to alter tension of the membrane 2 in response
        to the wind speeds detected by a sensor. </p>
      <p>[0036]FIG. 5 depicts another embodiment of an exemplary
        generator 500 using the concepts of this disclosure, in which a
        coil 52 covers a larger area of the membrane surface 54. In
        order to maintain a similar electrical power output, more
        permanent magnets 56 would be needed to provide a similarly
        enlarged magnetic field. The design depicted in FIG. 5 is
        particularly useful for very small generators, such as MEMS
        devices or "generators on a chip", wherein a coil that covers a
        greater percentage of the membrane is acceptable, as the
        magnetic field needed to saturate the volume of the coil's
        translation is of a very limited order. </p>
      <p>[0037]FIG. 6 illustrates a variation of the embodiment shown in
        FIG. 1. At least one mass 62 is provided on the membrane 2. The
        mass 62 may include one or more low-profile objects of either
        symmetric or asymmetric shape. For membranes with larger sizes
        (such as &gt;0.5 meters in length), the attached mass 62
        provides a more vigorous oscillation of the membrane 2. In some
        cases, the mass 62 acts to provide a source of instability at
        the onset of oscillation, thereby causing a slight initial
        torsion of the membrane 2. However, the location and geometry of
        the mass 62 and the tension, width, and length of the membrane 2
        can be made such that this instability is quickly transformed
        into an oscillation of the first normal mode with reduced
        torsion. </p>
      <p>[0038]FIG. 7 depicts another embodiment of this disclosure. In
        this embodiment, the arrangement of the coils and the membrane
        are similar to the generator shown in FIG. 1. However, the
        membrane in FIG. 7 is made to oscillate in other normal modes of
        vibration, such as the second mode illustrated in FIG. 7. Some
        simple alterations may be necessary in the power conditioning
        circuitry to accommodate the out of phase oscillation of a
        plurality of coils, but for larger generators these alternate
        modes may offer significant gains in efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0039]While the examples shown in FIGS. 1 and 5-7 involve one
        or more coils moving with reference to a stationary set of
        permanent magnets, it is understood that other embodiments may
        be implemented in which the magnets are placed on the membrane
        and are thus made to move relative to stationary coils. The
        advantage of such an arrangement is that the wire leads coming
        from the coils do not suffer any bending stress, as may occur
        with the moving coil embodiments. </p>
      <p>[0040]Additionally, while the coil may be placed substantially
        parallel to the surface of the elongated membrane 2 as shown in
        FIG. 1, another option is to arrange the coil more substantially
        perpendicular to the membrane, either attached below or above
        the membrane 2. Of course, the orientation of the magnetic field
        to the permanent magnets will need to be altered to accommodate
        such a variation. Similarly, such reorientation options of the
        coil relative to the membrane also apply to embodiments in which
        the magnetic field generator is attached to the membrane 2 and
        the coil is affixed to the base 8. FIG. 8 illustrates a
        sectional view of an example of orienting a magnetic field
        generator, such as a magnet 72, so as to project the magnetic
        field (i.e., pole to pole axis) parallel to the plane of the
        membrane 2, with the corresponding coil flanking the side of
        said magnetic field generator. As shown in FIG. 8, the permanent
        magnet 72 is attached to a substantially rigid member 74, which
        itself is attached in a roughly perpendicular arrangement to the
        flexible membrane 2. The field produced by the permanent magnet
        72 is directed through coil 4a, which is held in close proximity
        to the magnet 72 with a support 76. As the membrane 2
        oscillates, the permanent magnet 72 will also oscillate. This
        oscillation will cause the strength of the magnetic field
        directed through coil 4a to change, thereby producing an EMF.
        This particular embodiment has the advantage of avoiding
        magnet-coil contact over a wide range of oscillation rates, as
        the magnet 72 moves along the face of the coil 4a rather than
        towards and away from said coil. Additional coils may be placed
        on the opposite side of the magnet 72 to benefit from the
        additional pole. According to a variation, the coil 4a and the
        magnet 72 may be backed with ferrous materials so as to form a
        complete magnetic circuit, as described in other sections of
        this application. </p>
      <p>[0041]According to another embodiment, rather than adherring
        the coils to the membrane, a linear generator can be coupled to
        the oscillating membrane 2. While the most straight-forward
        approach to accomplishing this coupling would be to connect a
        shaft or thread between the magnet of the linear generator and
        the membrane, a smaller magnet incorporated onto the membrane
        can be used to stimulate oscillation in the linear generator's
        magnet without contact, by either repulsion or attraction. The
        natural frequency of oscillation of the linear generator's
        magnet is preferably matching that of the driving oscillation of
        the membrane. This embodiment allows large generator
        installments to gain in efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0042]Additional variations may be provided to enhance the
        performance of the exemplary generators for particular
        applications. For instance, it may be desirable to fill the
        coils of the generator with ferrite powder or laminated ferrous
        metals to enhance flux through the coils. Also, as is well known
        in the art, the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets
        can be made into a "complete circuit" by appropriately placing
        laminated or powdered ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic materials
        around the magnet core. This technique ensures that the maximum
        magnetic field can be directed to the area of the coils. </p>
      <p>[0043]A multitude of ferromagnetic materials can be used as the
        source of the magnetic field in the generator. NdFeB rare earth
        magnets, ceramic magnets, Alnico magnets, and Samarium-cobalt
        magnets are a few of the more popular options. </p>
      <p>[0044]Additionally, electromagnets, also known as field coils
        in generator applications, may be used in place of permanent
        magnets as a source of a magnetic field. One or more coils of
        wire with either air cores or with ferromagnetic cores may
        function as the field coils. These field coils are charged with
        a small residual magnetic field in the core, to induce an
        initial small EMF in the moving membrane coils. A portion of
        this electrical flow is diverted back into the field coils,
        resulting in a still greater field. This increased field leads
        to an increasing EMF produced in the oscillating membrane coils,
        and this positive feedback loop continues until an equilibrium
        is reached, at which point the field coils are producing a
        strong field similar to that produced by a permanent magnet.
        These self-excited generators, as they are sometimes called, are
        usually classified into the subsets of "series" generators,
        "shunt" generators, or "compound" generators, the principles of
        which are well known in the art. Another possibility is to use
        field coils that are separately excited, with the electrical
        flows necessary for a field provided by an external source. Both
        of these non-permanent magnet options are particularly useful
        for larger installations, where the cost of large permanent
        magnets would be prohibitive. </p>
      <p>[0045]Some other variations involve the membrane. The form of
        the membrane does not need to be limited to a rectangular shape.
        Rather, tapered membranes and membranes of various geometries
        may offer significant advantages at certain scales. Also, the
        membrane need not be limited to flat webs of film or fabric, but
        can also be made into profiles more closely approximating
        airfoils, to enhance the oscillation characteristics of the
        elongated flexible membrane. Moreover, the web need not be
        continuous throughout, but rather may incorporate holes or
        depressions. In some cases, holes centered on the
        membrane-mounted coils may allow the base-mounted magnets to
        pass partially through said coils, thereby preventing
        membrane-magnet collision in certain embodiments during vigorous
        oscillations. </p>
      <p>[0046]Most embodiments described thus far can also be oriented
        in any direction, such as vertically mounted on a pole, or
        horizontally mounted between two towers, or any combinations or
        variations thereof. A exemplary generator of this disclosure may
        be made with any number of membrane materials, such as ripstock
        nylon, superthin polyester film, mylar-coated taffeta, Kevlar
        tapes, or polyethylene film, to name a very few of a large set
        of possibilities. </p>
      <p>[0047]Multiple generators can also be used in power
        installations to supply electricity at various levels for a
        given area or application. A cost effective embodiment involves
        the use of two membranes with embedded coils, each placed on
        opposite sides of the permanent magnets. This arrangement allows
        for the utilization of both poles of the magnetic field. The AC
        output of each membrane of this dual membrane variation may not
        be in phase, and so can be rectified and conditioned separately,
        and then recombined into an additive DC output. Clearly, a
        multitude of these generators can be stacked onto a tower or
        arranged in a framework to capture the energy of a large
        cross-sectional area of wind, rather than only capturing the
        small area seen by a single generator alone. </p>
      <p>[0048]Another variation of an exemplary generator includes a
        membrane stretched between two distant points, for example,
        between two buildings or between two towers. In this case, a
        base that extends the entire length of the membrane is not
        necessary. Rather, clamps at the ends of the membrane can
        provide support for the membrane and the source of the field
        (whether that source is a set of permanent magnets or field
        coils). A spring or a specifically engineered compliant
        mechanism may be incorporated into the clamps so that constant
        tension is applied to the membrane, even across large distances.
      </p>
      <p>[0049]An advantage of an exemplary generator according to this
        disclosure relates to the response to very high wind speeds.
        Typically, in conventional horizontal-axis turbine or
        vertical-axis generators, a furling mechanism must be
        incorporated into the design of the generator. This furling
        mechanism enables the blades of the generator to bend out of the
        wind flow, to avoid catastrophic damage in high wind conditions.
        This addition is a costly and complex feature in conventional
        wind-based generators. In some cases, the substantial kinetic
        energy of the turbine blades remains a hazard despite the
        precautions of furling. In contrast, an exemplary generator
        according to this disclosure operates under carefully selected
        tension conditions. Therefore, in high winds that may pose a
        danger to the generator, the tension of the membrane can be
        simply reduced, or the membrane twisted slightly to greatly
        reduce coupling of the generator to the wind flows. When that
        occurs, the membrane will cease oscillation until it is safe to
        resume. Moreover, if the membrane does fail catastrophically and
        detaches from the mounting structure, the danger to the
        surrounding area is small comparing to conventional
        turbine-based generators. </p>
      <p>[0050]Generators implemented according to this disclosure have
        many applications across a wide range of power scales. For
        instance, hundreds of small generators according to this
        disclosure can be disposed throughout the HVAC ducting of a
        building. These generators can tap the flows of air throughout
        the ducting network to provide a continuous supply of power to
        wireless sensors in the vicinity. These arrays of sensors are
        critical in the construction of "smart buildings." However, the
        sensors needed in the construction often employ batteries with
        three to five year life spans, which greatly increases the
        maintenance costs of the sensors over their ten or twenty year
        life cycles. The generators implemented according to this
        disclosure and disposed throughout the HAVC ducting reduce the
        reliance on batteries, and expand the reach of this field of
        distributed, long-life sensor arrays. According to another
        embodiment, the exemplary generators themselves may act as both
        a wind sensor and the power source needed for transmitting that
        sensor information, if the voltages produced at different wind
        speeds are known for a given design. </p>
      <p>[0051]Another important application of the generators according
        to this disclosure is rural lighting, largely in emerging
        economies. Most households in the developing world spend up to
        twenty percent of their annual income on kerosene for lighting,
        a type of smoky, fuel-based lighting that is both a fire danger
        and an indoor air quality health hazard. A new lighting system
        may be implemented by coupling generators according to this
        disclosure at scales of tens of watts with highly efficient
        white LEDs. The new system can continuously provide clean, cheap
        lighting over a decade or more and could be paid for with
        several months' worth of kerosene expenses (US$10-$50). A
        related application of an exemplary generator of this disclosure
        is in powering nodes in a wireless data transmission network,
        such as WiFi, or meshed network. </p>
      <p>[0052]According to one embodiment utilizing the configuration
        illustrated in FIG. 1, the membrane has an elongated shape
        having two fixed ends. The membrane is made of Mylar coated
        taffeta, and the measurements are 440 mm long, 25 mm wide and
        0.1-0.15 mm thick. Two coils are adhered to the membrane at 74
        mm from each fixed end. The coils are made of 38 awg enamel
        coated wire, each with approximately 150 turns and having a
        resistance of approximately 25 ohms. The coils are approximately
        3/4'' in inner diameter, and 7/8'' in outer diameter. These
        coils are wired in series to achieve a total resistance of
        approximately 50 ohms. The base is made of acrylic. Two
        cylindrical NdFeB magnets are positioned under the coils. The
        magnets are 1/2'' thick, 3/4'' in diameter, and generate a 5840
        Gauss surface field. The vertical oscillation of the membrane,
        peak to peak, is approximately 20 mm. This embodiment generates
        approximately 15-20 mW across a matched load, in a 9-10 mph wind
        (4-4.5 m/s), sufficient for powering a wireless transceiver for
        continuous RF transmission of information, such as temperature
        and voltage, and charging capacitors in the wireless
        transceiver. The smaller size of this embodiment makes it
        suitable for working in HVAC ducting for harvesting energy of
        air flows to power sensor arrays. </p>
      <p>[0053]In another embodiment, an exemplary generator constructed
        according to the configuration shown in FIG. 1 utilizes a larger
        membrane that is made of mylar coated taffeta or ripstock nylon,
        and is 1.75 meters long, 50 mm wide, on both steel and HDPE
        bases. In one embodiment, a thin rectangular piece of steel
        having a size of approximately 1.5''.times.1.5'' is adhered to
        the middle of the membrane to act as the mass illustrated in
        FIG. 6. Two rectangular coils of 28 awg wire are adhered near
        the ends of the belt and suspended over corresponding
        rectangular NdFeB magnets. This power generated by this
        exemplary generator across a matched load in 10 mph winds is
        approximately 0.5-1 W, suitable for charging cell phones or
        providing power to lighting in rural areas. </p>
      <p>[0054]While the above embodiments have been discussed using
        examples of capturing the energy of air flows, it is understood
        that the same designs may also be applied to capturing the
        energy of water flows. For instance, a generator with a modified
        membrane, with less viscous drag characteristics, could be
        placed at the seafloor to capture the energy of ocean currents.
        Additionally, in a similar fashion to the energy harvesting in
        HVAC systems discussed, a generator based on the principles of
        the present disclosure can be incorporated into water piping. A
        combination of ocean current and wind generators could be used
        to form a remote sensor array on open bodies of water, although
        either the ocean current or wind generator alone could also
        serve this purpose. </p>
      <p>[0055]It is understood that one or more parts or modules of the
        exemplary generators described herein may be sold separately for
        assembly into a generator as described in this disclosure. For
        instance, an energy converter may be provided for use in an
        electrical generator having a magnetic field. The converter
        comprises at least one flexible membrane. Each membrane has at
        least two fixed ends, and is exposed to the magnetic field when
        used in the generator. In addition, the membrane vibrates or
        oscillates when subject to a fluid flow. Each membrane has at
        least one attached electrical conductor. The vibration of each
        membrane caused by the fluid flow creates a movement of the
        conductor relative to the magnetic field. The relative movement
        of the conductor creates a change in the strength of the
        magnetic field applied to the electrical conductor. The change
        in the strength of the magnetic field applied to the electrical
        conductor induces a current flowing in the conductor. It is also
        understood that a generator may utilize multiple sets of energy
        converters to produce power at a larger scale. </p>
      <p>[0056]According to another embodiment, an exemplary energy
        converter is provided for use in an electrical generator
        including one of at least one magnetic field generator and at
        least one electrical conductor. The converter comprises at least
        one flexible membrane and the other one of the at least one
        magnetic field generator and the at least one electrical
        conductor attached to the membrane. Each membrane has at least
        two fixed ends. In addition, each membrane vibrates when subject
        to a fluid flow. The vibration of each membrane caused by the
        fluid flow creates a relative movement between the at least one
        conductor and a magnetic field generated by the at least one
        magnetic field generator. The relative movement creates a change
        in the strength of the magnetic field applied to the at least
        one electrical conductor. The change in the strength of the
        magnetic field applied to the at least one electrical conductor
        induces a current flowing in the at least one electrical
        conductor. </p>
      <p>[0057]The disclosure has been described with reference to
