            detection of a magnetic flux about a current-carrying

            This discovery unified the then separate sciences of
            electricity and magnetism. My experimental discovery that
            this magnetic flux actually moves along the conductor
            electric charges, the electric charges constituting the
            current, has great promise of now unifying the three known

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <a
              href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> and consists in part of many
            insulated linear conductors indicated generally by numeral
            16, all parallel, packed and held in close proximity, and
            connected in series, so as to form a solid package 18
            preferably cylindrical in shape. When a constant direct
            current from a source 20 is caused to flow through wires 22
            this device with its axis in the vertical direction, half of
            the linear conductors 16 will have current flowing upward
            and half downward. It will be a noninductive device, since
            surrounding it the magnetic flux due to the upward currents
            will be superimposed on the flux due to the downward
            currents, so that no magnetic flux can be measured. On the
            well-recognized "Principle of Superposition of Fields", each
            one exists, however, and acts as though the other was
            absent.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the
            package 18 of linear conductors has a circular cross section
            there will exist two systems of circularly directed magnetic
            flux, one directed clockwise and the other counterclockwise
            as seen from above, and one set moving upward and the other
            set moving downward. What is of capital interest, however,
            is that each of these two systems give rise to equal
            radially and inwardly directed BxV motional electric fields
            distributed laterally in horizontal planes in the space
            about the cylindrical device. Here we have a field which is
            not magnetic, is not electrostatic, and which I have shown
            experimentally to be immune to electrostatic shielding. No
            such spacially distributed field is known to Physics today
            except that of gravity. I have shown theoretically that this
            field should act attractively on electrically neutral
            matter. I have shown experimentally that the intensity of
            this field can be measured with the aid of an electrometer
            system 24, 28 driven by the potential difference induced
            electromagnetically in the conductors 30 connecting the
            electrometer to the capacitor plates 26a and 26b of the
            capacitor 26. The electrometer head 24 actuates a visual
            dial indicator 28.</font> <br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At
            cryogenic temperatures the drift velocity of the electrons
            in the linear conductors will be greatly enhanced.
            Theoretical calculations indicate that this velocity in
            copper at 20° C is of the order of 3.6 x 10<sup>10</sup>
            cm/sec in a current density of 480 amp/cm<sup>2</sup>. The
            random velocity of free electrons in conductors is
            theoretically estimated at 10<sup>8</sup> cm/sec. At
            superconducting temperatures when the electrical resistance
            approaches zero, it is generally believed the drift velocity
            of electrons approaches the value of 10<sup>8</sup> cm/sec.
            This velocity is 10<sup>10</sup> times greater than the
            velocity at 20° C. (See "Physics", Halliday and Resnick,
            pages 681 and 691, J. Wiley, 1962). This indicates that the
            intensity of the BxV field about the device, herein
            described, might possibly be enhanced 10<sup>10</sup> times
            at or near the absolute zero of temperature. Hence, the
            invention contemplates that each of the devices described
            hereinafter will preferably be operated at or below the
            critical temperature at which the conductor used becomes
            superconducting. As the state of the art advances new
            superconducting materials will undoubtedly become available
            with critical temperatures very considerably above the
            absolute zero.</font> <br>

            device will exhibit an attractive force on electrically
            neutral matter, better defined as a differential force;
            i.e., the difference between a pull and push, in which the
            pull is greater (See reference to general theorem, p. 125, <i>The







              Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism</i>, by
            Sir James H. Jeans). The BxV field is an electrical field
            acting on all the elementary charges comprising the atoms of
            matter, electrons, protons and even neutrons, as I believe
            neutrons also consist of electrons and protons in close
            bond. The BxV force being relatively weak does not ionize
            the atoms of matter, but being immune to shielding,
            electrically polarizes them. This causes a slight elongation
            of some of the electrons orbits within the atoms in the
            direction of the field. The positive charges move slightly
            into the more intense region of the converging, radially
            directed field while the negative charges move slightly
            further away from the device into the weaker portion of the
            field. Thus the differential force between the pull and the
            push upon the component parts of an atom results in the
            polarization of the atoms and a resultant attractive force,
            equivalent, I believe, to that of gravity.</font> <br>

            collapse. This flux in the act of collapsing should cross
            the walls of the suspended cylinder with a considerable
            inwardly directed horizontal velocity of V meters/sec. This
            should yield a very considerable vertical BxV in the walls
            of the cylinder directed wither up or down, depending on the
            direction of the current in the coil.</font> <br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this
            device the motional electric field BxV is not convergent,
            but is uniformly vertical, hence the pull and push exerted
            on the electric components of the atoms in the cylinder will
            be equal. In other words, the action of this field will
            either enhance or decrease the state of polarization already
            existing within the cylinder and produced by the
            gravitational field of the earth. If the polarization is
            increased, then the gravitational pull of the earth's field
            should be greater. If the polarization is decreased then the
            weight of the cylinder should be less. It is conceivable
            that the polarization could be reduced to zero. In this
            case, the object should be weightless. If the intensity of
            the depolarizing BxV field is still further increased, then
            polarization in the opposite direction to that produced by
            the earth's field should be achieved. In this event the
            earth's gravitational field would act repulsively on the
            cylinder. This would be antigravity in its truest sense.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is
            desirable to have an apparatus with which to experimentally
            study gravitational and antigravitational phenomena under
            steady continuous conditions. In <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>
            of the drawings is shown another modification of the device
            shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. Here I utilize a
            noninductive coil wound in the form of a solid, low,
            thick-walled, hollow, right circular cylinder, and indicated
            generally by numeral 60. DC current is supplied through
            lines 62 to the coil 60. In the region directly beneath this
            coil disk 60 I place a similarly shaped nonferrous disk 64,
            suspended by a carrier 66 to the end of a beam 68. The beam
            68 is pivotal about a fulcrum 70 and is counterbalanced by a
            load 72. For positions of disk 64 below coil 60, the BxV
            field can only be directed vertically upward when a
            continuous DC current is flowing in the wires composing the
            disk 60. It should be noted that this field is practically
            uniform and parallel close to the disk, hence it is not
            attractive in its action on neutral matter. Its action on
            such matter can only change the state of electrical
            polarization in the matter. Any change thus effected in the
            state of polarization should cause the earth's gravitational
            field to act less intensely on any object placed close to
            the under surface of the device, causing it to weigh less,
            become weightless, or to actually be accelerated upward by
            the antigravitational action of the earth's field.</font> <br>

            either simply wound, or noninductively wound, around a
            hollow tube 82. Electrical current is passed to the coil 80
            through wires 84, and at low temperature this coil will
            produce a radially, outward directed, internal BxV field
            from the axis 86 of the cylinder to the internal
            circumference 80a of the coil 80. The electrical wire making

            coated with any appropriate electrical insulation. A minimum
            space between adjacent turns with concentricity between
            adjacent turns is the preferred winding embodiment for coil
            80. As many courses of turns as deemed appropriate to
            generate field strength will meet the objects of the

            water, a BxV electric field generated by the passage of
            current through the coil 80, acts upon the disassociated
            ions of the sodium chloride in solution. Hence, by
            introducing a flwo of saline water at end 82a of tube 82,
            increments of fluid which are concentrated with chlorine and
            depleted of sodium may be drawn off through the stationary
            tube 90, while the increments of fluid which are
            concentrated with sodium and depleted of chlorine may be
            drawn off through the space between the exterior walls of

            country's space projects have become expensive beyond the
            ability of the average man to comprehend. Achieving lift by
            means of costly propellants will some day be seen as akin to
            primitive man's use of awkward clubs as a means of exerting
            force. In a very short interval of time an intense BxV field
            should effect the reversal of the gravitational polarization
            of an object. Once achieved, only a very small expenditure
            of energy would be required to hold the polarization. Energy
            from the atoms of the earth would supply the lift and
            propulsion through the medium of the earth's gravity field.
            The most formidable problem would appear to be the problem
            of holding the BxV generator at cryogenic temperatures. In
            view of the overall possibilities of this invention, this
            problem does not appear to be incapable of solution. A
            breakthrough in finding superconducting materials or even
            near superconducting at slightly elevated temperatures from
            those presently required would greatly aid in the solution
