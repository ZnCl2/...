            produced by a plurality of magnets extending parallel with

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
            invention relates to the generation of motionally induced
            electrical fields as distinct from electrostatic fields, and
            as distinct from the electric field (illustrated by
            transformer action) which is induced by the time rate of
            change of magnetic field induction. Hence, all reference
            herein to a motional electric field means the electric field
            that is generated by the movement of magnetic flux.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            motional electric field generated by rotational motion of
            magnetic flux is non-uniform in both direction and radial
            intensity. Particles (large or small) of matter (solid,
            liquid or gaseous) which are within the ambit if this
            motional electric field are acted upon with a force which
            tends to accelerate them. It is well known that a particle
            carrying a charge <i>Q</i> (coulombs) in an electric field
            of intensity <i>E</i> (Newton/coulomb) will be acted upon
            by a force <i>F</i> (Newton) given by the equation <i>F =
              EQ</i>. The electric intensity of E of a motional electric
            field is given by the vector equation E = B x V, where B is
            the magnetic flux density at a point in space, expressed in
            webers per square meter, and V is the velocity of the moving
            magnetic flux at that point in space, expressed in meters
            per second. What is not so well known, however, is the fact
            that a non-uniform electric field exerts a force upon
            electrically neutral matter. In his celebrated text, "The
            Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism", Sir James
            H. Jeans describes, in the case of a non-uniform
            electrostatic field, how a "slab of dielectric will be
            sucked in between the plates of the condensor", thus
            demonstrating the mechanical force produced by such a field.
            He states (p. 125), "This, as will be seen later, is a
            particular case of a general theorem that any piece of
            dielectric is acted on by forces which tend to drag it from
            the weaker to the stronger parts of an electric field of
            force." According to Clerk Maxwell in "electricity and
            magnetism" (Vol. II, p. 181), faraday discovered that the
            electric field due to electromagnetic induction penetrated
            within and throughout all materials. The motional electric
            field is just such a field. Apparatus for demonstrating the
            "general theorem", stated by Jeans, has, in the case of the
            non-uniform motional electric field, not heretofore been
            provided.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly,
it
is





            one of the objects of the present invention to provide a
            device for generating a non-uniform motional electric field
            whose force is of magnitude such that it can be sensed.</font>
          <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since
            the motional electric field acts within and throughout all
            matter, such a non-uniform field will exert a physical force
            on any kind of electrically neutral matter, in a manner
            quite analogous to that of the electrostatic field with
            respect to dielectric material.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another
            object of the invention is to provide apparatus for
            obtaining useful work from a non-uniform motional electric
            field.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            several objectives of the invention may be accomplished by
            rotating an elongate magnetic field about an axis which is
            concentric with the field and parallel with the field's
            elongation. For example, an array of magnets may be mounted
            on a rotor so that all magnets are parallel with the axis of
            the rotor, and all have the same polar orientation relative
            to the rotor. A solenoidal electromagnet, or another array
            of magnets, with magnetic axis concentric with the
            rotational axis may also be employed to enhance the flux
            density of the array of magnets by flux linking with them.
            When such an array of magnets is rotated about the axis of
            the rotor, the magnetic field of each is rotated with it. As
            another example, an elongate magnetic field can be rotated
            about its axis, without mechanical movement, by provision of
            stationary solenoidal electromagnets arrayed like the staves
            of a barrel and connected to a source of multi-phase
            alternating current (half-wave rectified to prevent reversal
            of sign) in a manner comparable to the stator winding of a
            three-phase motor to produce "revolving field". While the
            composite magnetic field is thus in rotary motion, every
            charged, or uncharged particle of matter (solid, liquid or
            gaseous) within the non-uniform motional electric field thus
            generated in the neighborhood of the rotor, will be acted
            upon by a force due to the electric intensity E. Positively
            charged particles will be forced in the direction of the
            vector E, negatively charged particles will be forced in the
            opposite direction, and electrically neutral matter will be
            pulled from the weaker regions of field intensity to the
            stronger regions. This latter mechanical force is called a
            differential force due to the action of the field on the
            internal electrical polarization of the neutral matter.</font>
          <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            three vectors E, B, and V are always (with a possible
            exception) mutually at right angles to each other. If the
            thumb of the right hand is pointed in the direction of the
            magnetic flux density vector B, and then rotated like a
            right-handed screw so that it points in the direction of the
            velocity V of the moving magnetic flux, then the forefinger
            of the right hand will point in the direction of the
            electric vector E. The rotation of the composite magnetic
            flux about its axis produces a motional electric field which
            will, except at the axial ends of the magnetic field, be
            quite generally directed radially with respect to the axis
            of rotation. The possible exception is in the case of a
            magnet having a homogenous electrically conductive core of
            perfectly circular cross-section, in which case the force of
            the electric field may be somewhat off radial.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With a
            given polar orientation of magnets relative to the axis of
            rotation, rotation of the magnetic field in a clockwise
            direction will generate a motionally induced electric field
            of sign (positive or negative) opposite that which is
            generated when the rotation is counterclockwise. For any
            given sense of rotation, reversing the polar orientation of
            the magnets relative to the axis of rotation likewise
            reverses the sign (positive or negative) of the motionally
            induced electric field. Reversing both the direction of
            rotation and the polar orientation of the magnets (a
            situation exemplified by viewing the apparatus first from
            one axial end, and secondly from the opposite axial end)
            produces no change in sign (positive or negative) of the
            motionally induced electric field.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            accompanying drawings, three embodiments of the invention
            are exemplified. Also, there are two model schematics to
            illustrate in its simplest form the principle of the
            invention, in which a plurality of commonplace permanent
            magnets are mounted upon a rotor.</font> <br>

            motional electric field perceptibly demonstrated.</font> <br>

            provided, on its circumference, with an array of
            electromagnets oriented as aforesaid on each rotor, but
            oppositely oriented on the respective rotors, and wherein
            the effect of the motionally induced electric fields can be

            the principle of the invention is diagrammatically
            illustrated with the utmost simplicity, wherein a catena f
            magnetic flux fields, all with the same polar orientation,
            is produced by arranging an array of rod-type permanent
            magnets parallel with each other, and parallel with the axis
            about which they are to be rotated. In <a href="#fig1">Figure





              1</a>, the axis of rotation is designated 1, and may be
            considered as the center of a shaft of a rotor, preferably
            composed of material having low, if any, magnetic
            permeability, and low, if any, electrical conductivity. The
            periphery of such a rotor is designated by the circle 2. In
            the form shown, a series of permanent magnets 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
            and 8 is appropriately secured to the periphery of the rotor
            with the respective magnets in equi-spaced relationship, and
            all with their north poles addressed in the same direction
            which, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, is in the
            direction of the reader or, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure




              2</a>, to the reader's right. The external flux fields
            from the respective permanent magnets 3, 4, 5, and 6 are
            illustrated in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, where it will
            be observed that the external flux path of all magnets is
            from right to left, a relationship designated by the plus
            (+) marks in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. With such an
            arrangement, the flux fields of all magnets may be
            concurrently rotated about axis 1. Considering the rotation
            to be in the direction of arrows 9 and the polar attraction
            of the several permanent magnets to be as illustrated, a BxV
            motional electric field will be generated both externally
            and internally of rotor periphery 2 upon rotation of the
            rotor. The thus generated motional electric field will exert
            a radially directed force upon every particle of matter,
            neutral or charged, such a particle P, which is within the
            ambit of the catena of magnetic flux fields. The magnitude
            of the so impressed electric field intensity will depend
            upon the magnetic flux concentration at the particle P and
            the relative velocity between the flux field and the
            particle P. While, if particle P is in motion, its velocity
            must be considered in arriving at the relative velocity V
            (in the formula E = B x V) the disclosure will be simplified
            if the particle P be considered as stationary, and in such
            event V will be 2 R times S, where R is the radial
            displacement of particle P from axis 1, and where S is the
            revolutions per unit of time made by the rotor. Hence, with
            the particle P stationary, the magnitude of the force
            impressed upon it is increased when the speed of rotation of
            the rotor is increased at a given flux density; and is
            increased by an increase in the flux density at a given
            speed of rotation. The direction in which the force of the
            motionally induced electric field acts upon particle P is
            always perpendicular to the magnetic flux field B and to its
            velocity V. The sign of the electric field may be either
            positive (acting radially outward from the axis of rotation)
            or negative (acting radially inward toward the axis of
            rotation), which, for any given polar orientation shown in <a
              href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>,
            may be reversed by reversing the direction of rotation of
            the rotor. With the polar orientation shown in <a
              href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>,
            and the direction of rotation indicated by arrow 9, if
            particle P is a proton or a positively charged molecule, the
            force of the B x V electric field will be radially inward as
            indicated by the solid line arrow attached to particle P;
            but if particle P is an electron or a negatively charged
            molecule, the particle will tend to move radially outward as
            shown by the broken line arrow; and if the particle P is
            electrically neutral, it will tend to move in the direction
            of increasing electrical intensity E. Increase of E requires
            either that both B and V be increasing or that one be
            increasing at a sufficiently greater rate than the other is
            decreasing so that the product (BxV) increases. In the
            relationship of field and particle shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure





              1</a>, the product (BxV) increases radially inward.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For
            practical purposes, however, commonplace permanent magnets
            produce insufficient flux density in their external flux
            paths to impress upon a particle of charged matter such as
            P, an electric force of sufficient magnitude that the force
            of the electric field can be measured with ease, at least at
            speed of rotation within practical limits. Consequently, the
            practical embodiments of the invention, later to be
            described, make use of electromagnets of a form capable of
            producing external flux densities of vastly greater flux
            density B, as well as higher velocities V.</font> <br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The term
            "unipolar induction" has been used to indicate the induction
            of an electric field in the vicinity of an axially
            symmetrical magnetic system rotating about its axis of
            symmetry. There has been disagreement about whether as the
            magnetic system is rotated the lines of magnetic induction
            are carried with it or remain stationary while the magnetic
            system rotates through them. For example, when a bar magnet
            is rotated about its magnetic axis, it is believed by many
            that the magnetic field is stationary. I have demonstrated
            that under certain conditions, at least, the magnetic lines
            can be made to move, and I have devised certain methods and
            apparatus for utilizing this phenomenon as in the production
            of localized and high intensity electric fields.</font> <br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Turning
            now to <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> of the drawings, an
            apparatus for demonstrating certain magnetic phenomena is
            illustrated in diagrammatic form. A magnetic system,
            indicated generally by numeral 200, includes a pair of
            permanent magnets 210 and 220 which are axially magnetized
            and mounted in axial alignment between the ends of a
            U-shaped yoke 230 of highly permeable magnetic material. The
            adjacent surfaces of magnets 210 and 220 being of opposed
            polarity are spaced apart, providing an air gap 240
            therebetween. The lines of magnetic flux are shown in the
            drawing and indicated generally by numeral 262. A brass rod
            250 extends axially through magnets 210 and 220. The
            magnetic system 200 is rotatable about rod 250. A stiff
            conductor 260 is electrically connected by a collar 261 at
            one end in rotatable or fixed relation as selectively
            desired, with the brass rod 250 at a point in the gap 240
            between magnets 210 and 220. The other end of conductor 260
            extends substantially perpendicularly from rod 250 to a
            distance in space away from the magnets and yoke where the
            magnetic field falls to approximately zero intensity. In
            order to complete an electrical circuit through galvanometer
            270 and conductor 280 to the brass rod 250 and conductor
            260, a flexible and extensible electrical wire 264 connects
            the end of conductor 260 to the galvanometer 270. A gear 252
            locked alternatively by set screw 254 to rod 250 or by set
            screw 256 to yoke 230 can serve to provide driving motion to
            either the rod 250 or by set screw 256 to yoke 230 as
            selectively desired. Normally, for the purposes of the
            experiment, the driving motion will be reciprocal because of
            the connection of wires 280 and 264.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With
            this apparatus, if the magnetic system 200 is held fixed and
            a given angular displacement imparted to conductor 260 by
            rotating it horizontally about or with rod 250 through the
            air gap at a given angular speed, a voltage is induced which
            provides a deflection of galvanometer 270. Furthermore, when
            the conductor 260 is held fixed and the magnetic system 200
            rotated through the same angular displacement about rod 250,
            at the same given angular speed, a similar voltage of
            exactly the same magnitude but opposite direction is induced
            in the galvanometer circuit. The same deflection is obtained
            whether or not the magnets 210 and 220 rotate with the yoke
            230 or are held stationary while the yoke alone is rotated.
            This indicates clearly that the lines of magnetic induction
            in the quantity rotate about the axis of rotation 250 as if
            they were rigidly attached to the magnetic system 200.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A most
            important aspect of the operation of the apparatus of <a
              href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> is noted when the magnets 210
            and 220 are held fixed in relation to the conductor 260 and
            rod 250 and the yoke 230 is rotated about the rod 250. This
            action causes induction of current in the galvanometer
            circuit exactly as occurs when the entire magnetic structure
            exactly as occurs when the entire magnetic structure or the
            conductor itself are moved. However, if the magnetic yoke
            230 and conductor 260 are held fixed and magnets 210 and 220
            rotated, there is no deflection of the galvanometer. Thus,
            it appears that the yoke structure plays an important part
            in controlling movement of the magnetic flux. Furthermore,
            it should be noted that the magnetic flux does not link the
            galvanometer circuit in the usual sense that this term is
            used, but that a current is induced in the galvanometer
            circuit through the action of the conductor 260 in merely
            cutting across the field extending between adjacent faces of
            magnets 210 and 220.</font> <br>

            the magnetic flux within the air core of a solenoid may be
            rotated about its magnetic axis. A brass tube formed in the
            shape of a toroidal C has a winding applied to its entire

            tube 50 in a position such as to fit, with clearance, into
            the bight of the squat U-shaped solenoids 11-22. Solenoid 51
            may be wound directly on tube 50, but in the form shown, it
            is wound on a cylindrical core 52 of material having little
            or no magnetic permeability, and the core 52 is telescoped
            on tube 50. The stationary solenoid 51 is energized through
            appropriate leads (not shown) from conductors 33 and 34 or
            other source of direct current, and is so connected that its
            magnetic polarity is opposite that of solenoids 11-22, that
            is to say that when, as aforesaid, the core ends 47 are
            North poles, the adjacent end of solenoid 51 will be its
            South pole. Thus, the magnetic flux of solenoids 11-22 has
            an external path, through tube 50, which is coincident with,
            and in the same direction as, the internal path of magnetic
            flux in solenoid 51.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus,
            the magnetic field generated by each of the solenoids 11
            through 22, as well as that generated by solenoid 51,
            penetrates the interior of tube 50, and when the rotor is
            driven in rotation, those magnetic fields rotate
            collectively about the axis of tube 50. During each
            rotation, particles of matter within the tube 50 are within
            the motional electric field generated by the rotating
            magnetic flux. Such an apparatus has a demonstrable effect
            in the separation and concentration of fluids. For example,
            in the desalination of water, the BxV electric field
            generated by the rotating magnetic fields, acts upon the
            disassociated ions of sodium chloride in solution. This is
            explained by the fact that if the rotor 10 be rotated in the
            direction shown by the arrows in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>,
            the BxV field tends to drive the positively charged sodium
            cations toward the center, and tends to drive the negatively
            charged chlorine anions away from the center of tube 50.
            Hence, by introducing a flow of saline water at end 54 of
            tube 50, and by providing a concentric separating tube 55 at
            end 56 of tube 50, increments of fluid which are
            concentrated with sodium and depleted if chlorine may be
            drawn off through the stationary tube 55, while the
            increments of fluid which are concentrated with chlorine and
            depleted of sodium may be drawn of through the space between
            the exterior walls of tube 55 and the interior walls of tube
            50.</font> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another
            utility of the apparatus shown is that of transmuting
            hydrogen into helium, in which event tube 55 is omitted and
            electrodes are provided at opposite ends 54 and 56 of tube
            50, so that an electric arc may be established between them.
            Heretofore, difficulty has been encountered in maintaining
            the plasma of the arc in a relatively straight path between
            the electrodes as it tends to wiggle and extinguish itself
            when it makes contact with one of the confining walls.
            However, by impressing a BxV electric field upon such an
            arc, its path may be confined within controllable limits.
            The BxV electric field has the further effect of driving
            hydrogen protons toward the center of the tube, and driving
            electrons away from the center of the tube. Add one neutron
            to a hydrogen atom nucleus, and there is produced the
            isotope known as Dueterium; add one more neutron to the
            Dueterium nucleus, and it becomes tritium; add one more
            proton to the Tritium nucleus and it becomes Helium.</font>

            embodiment of the apparatus is shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure




              6</a>, <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, and <a href="#fig8">Figure




              8</a>. With the significant exception that the embodiment
            of <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>, 7, and 8 has no moving
            parts, its organization is, in general, quite similar to
            that shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> and <a
              href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>, and hence the last two digits
            of the reference characters utilized in the previous
            embodiment. As shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, a
            cylindrical tube 150 has a solenoid 151 wound on the
            exterior thereof, and is energized with direct current from
            a suitable source through leads 153. A plurality of squat
            U-shaped solenoids 111, 112, and 113, of keystone-shaped
            cross-section, of which there are four each or any multiple
            of four, are wound as described in connection with the
            previous embodiment, and securely mounted in any suitable
            way with their pole faces 147 and 148 contiguous with, and
            addressed toward the axis of, tube 150. In this embodiment,
            however, the several squat U-shaped solenoids 111, 112, and
            113, have cores which are made of material having little or
            no magnetic permeability, such as tubes 146 of paperboard
            wound to a keystone shape with hollow interior. As in the
            previous embodiment, the magnetic polarity of solenoid 151
            is opposite that of the solenoids 111, 112, and 113, which
            is to say that if ends 147 of the solenoids 111-113 are the
            North poles thereof, the adjacent end of solenoid 151 is its
            South pole, so that the external magnetic flux path from
            solenoids 111-113 is coincident with, and in the same
            direction as, the internal flux path of solenoid 151.</font>

          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            embodiment shown in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>-8, the
            several squat U-shaped solenoids 111, 112, and 113 are
            energized with non-interconnected three-phase alternating
            current, each phase of which has been half-wave rectified to
            produce direct current pulsating at alternate half cycles.
            One phase of the alternating current is connected to all
            solenoids 112; and the third phase of the alternating
            current is connected to all solenoids 113, as shown in the
            wiring diagram of Figure 8, where a three-phase alternator
            100 is provided with six leads arranged I three pairs, to
            wit: leads 101 and 101' for the first phase, leads 102 and
            102' for the second phase, leads 103 and 103' for the third
            phase. The respective phases are not electrically
            interconnected. In each of leads 101, 102, and 103, there is
            a rectifier 104, 105, and 106, respectively. Leads 101 and
            101' serve all four of solenoids 111; leads 102 and 102'
            serve all four of solenoids 112; and leads 103 and 103'
            serve all four of solenoids 113. Across leads 101 and 101',
            between the rectifier 104 and the respective solenoids 111,
            there is provided a capacitor 107. Such capacitor is to
            coordinate the capacity and inductance of input, and to
            neutralize the effect of induction in solenoids 111 by
            adjacent solenoids during the off half-cycle of
            energization. Likewise, a capacitor 108 is connected between
            leads 103 and 103'. It will be apparent to those skilled in
            the art that since the four solenoids of like phase are
            arranged in quadrature with each other, and since solenoids
            111 will reach their peak of magnetic flux, and the latter
            120 degrees ahead of solenoids 113 reaching their peak flux,
            a revolving magnetic field is created. Due to the
            rectification of the alternating current, and the consequent
            utilization of the half cycles which all flow in the same
            direction, there will be no reversal of the direction of
            magnetic flux generated by any of solenoids 111, 112, and
            113, and hence, as in the case of the previous embodiment,
            the external path of all magnetic flux generated in the
            solenoids 111, 112, and 113 is coincident with, and in the
            same direction as, the internal flux generated by direct
            current energization of solenoid 151. When such an
            arrangement is supplied with alternating current at high
            frequency, such as a thousand cycles per second, the same
            results are achievable with this embodiment as with the
            previous embodiment but without any mechanical parts.</font>

            the box 70,there is a compound rotor machine, wherein the
            respective rotors are driven in opposite directions. In a
            suitable frame having spaced pedestals 71 and 72, there is
            mounted a shaft 73 and an independent shaft 74.Both shafts
            73 and 74 may be driven at the same rotational speed, but in
            opposite senses. A yoke 75 is fixedly mounted to shaft 73
            for rotation with it. The yoke is cup-shaped with
            cylindrical skirt 76. About the inner periphery of skirt 76,
            a plurality of solenoidal electromagnets 77 are fixedly
            mounted thereto. The several electromagnets extend parallel
            with the common axis of rotation of shafts 73 and 74, and
            are of the same polar orientation with respect to those
            shafts. The several electro magnets 77 have identical
            solenoids wound, in the same manner previously described,
            about identical cores of material having high magnetic
            permeability. The solenoids of the several electromagnets 77
            are energized from a suitable source of direct current
            through conductors 84 and 85,brushes 86 and 87, slip rings
            88 and 89, and conductors 90 and 91. The respective
            solenoids 76 and 76 are preferably connected in parallel
            circuit relationship, but if desired, may be in series so
            long as uniform polar orientation is maintained.</font> <br>

            78, there is mounted a plurality of electromagnets 81, each
            of which is an identical solenoid, and each of which has an
            identical core of material having high magnetic
            permeability. As in the previous case, the several solenoids
            81 are all energized so as to have the same polar
            orientation with respect to their axis of rotation. Each of
            the solenoids is energized from a suitable source of direct

            which rotate with shaft 73 have opposite magnetic polar
            orientation to those (81) which rotate with shaft 74. The
            several solenoids 77 are preferably designed to create
            external magnetic flux fields of flux density approximately
            equal and opposite to those created by electromagnets 81 and
            99, but with the principle of superposition ("Elec. &amp;
            Magn.", by Ralph W. Winch, 1963 Ed., p. 202), each flux
            field acts as if the other were not present. Despite the
            fact that the flux fields created by the responsive series
            of electromagnets 77 and 81 and 89 are oppositely directed,
            since their rotation is in opposite senses, their resultant
            effect, insofar as concerns the generation of a BxV electric
            field, is cumulative. Accordingly, the external BxV electric
            field is intensified at the exterior of the device, and its
            effect on the outside of shielding box 70 is demonstrable,
            even though the resultant magnetic flux density there is
            approximately zero. Such demonstration might be through a
