    <p>This is the written version of a talk given at the Second
      International Symposium on Non-Conventional Energy Technology in
      Atlanta, GA (February 10, 1983). It is based entirely on the
      theory and experimental work of Dr. William J. Hooper, BA, MA, PhD
      in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and
      formerly Professor Emeritus at Principia College, Elsah, IL. </p>

    <p><b>Preface ~</b> </p>
    <p>From 1968 to 1971, my husband, Warren W. Gibson, financed the
      research of Dr. William J. Hooper. I worked with Dr. Hooper as
      secretary and laboratory assistant. He explained his theory and
      the intent of each experiment to me as the work progressed. I was
      personally present when every experiment was performed during this
      time. </p>
    <p>After Dr. Hooper passed on in 1971, I tried to perform an
      experiment with a vacuum tube generator which he had designed. On
      my first attempt I burned out the tube, and with that I lost
      confidence in my ability to do the research on my own. </p>
    <p>I satisfied my desire to continue the work with the publication
      and sale of his manuscript, and with the hope that it would spark
      an interest in someone who would want to carry on the research.
      There has been much interest expressed in his theory and research,
      but to my knowledge there is no one presently continuing the work.
    </p>
    <p>Many people who have read Dr. Hooper's manuscript have asked for
      more experimental data. This paper includes that information. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The history of scientific progress shows that new discoveries
        often are not made until some old assumptions are challenged and
        found to be wrong. Dr. William J. Hooper challenged the
        assumption of electromagnetic theory that there was only one
        electric field in nature, the electrostatic, and that led to
        more challenges of current theory. </p>
      <p>In his manuscript, <i>New Horizons in Electric, Magnetic, and
          Gravitational Field Theory</i>, Dr. Hooper defines three
        electric field with distinct characteristics: the electrostatic,
        which is very familiar, the transformer electric field, which is
        produced by a changing magnetic field intensity; and the
        motionally induced electric field, which is the product of
        relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field. A
        table on page 15 of his book shows the major differences in the
        properties of these fields. </p>
      <p>When all his experiments indicated that the motionally induced
        electric field was incapable of being shielded by ordinary
        electrostatic or magnetic shielding materials, he pondered the
        possibility that this field was akin to gravity, which has
        characteristics similar to an electric field except for its
        inability to be shielded. This paper will not deal with his
        extensive shielding experiments which are thoroughly described
        in his manuscript and were done before my time. </p>
      <p>Let us review again the nature of this motionally induced
        electric field. When magnetic flux is moved perpendicularly
        across a conductor, we say that an emf is electromagnetically
        induced within the conductor. This phenomenon has been little
        thought of as involving the production of a spacially
        distributed electric field. It arises from the operation called
        flux-cutting, wherein the electric field is motionally induced
        within the space occupied by themoving magnetic flux, and is
        present therein, whether a conductor is present in this space or
        not. </p>
      <p>Correctly defined, we can say that when magnetic flux of vector
        intensity <u>B</u> is moved across a region of space with
        vector velocity <u>V</u>, an electromagnetically induced
        electric field of vector intensity <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> makes
        its appearance in this space at right angles to both B and V.
        Therefore, </p>
      <p>(Eq. 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>E</u> = <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> </p>
      <p>It is this field that Dr. Hooper felt might be related to
        gravity. I will hereafter refer to this field as the motional E
        field. </p>
      <p>After contemplating the structure of the atom, Dr. Hooper
        concluded that if the charged particles in the atom, especially
        the electrons and protons, acted like miniature magnets, their
        motion would create in the space surrounding the atom this
        motional E field. The field created by the motion of both the
        positive and negative charges would cancel to some degree, but
        because the velocity of the negative electron in orbit is
        greater than the velocity of the positive proton in the nucleus,
        the induced field of the electron would dominate. He determined
        that the field due to the orbital motion of these charges would
        vary inversely as the square of the distance, the same as
        gravity. He also determined that the field produced by the
        translational motion of these charges would vary inversely as
        the cube of the distance. These observations may totally unite
        electromagnetic and gravitational field theory and account for
        the strong and weak forces in the atom. </p>
      <p>If his theory is correct, Dr. Hooper envisioned the ability to
        tap the gravitational field of any planetary body for electrical
        energy, free from pollutants, with a properly designed
        ultra-high frequency receiving circuit, incorporating an
        antenna, a transistor valve, and oscillating tank circuits. When
        he learned of the work of Thomas Henry moray, he was convinced
        that Moray had tapped the earth's gravitational field, and he
        expected Moray to complete this work for mankind, so he decided
        to concentrate his research on proving his theory. </p>
      <p>When he passed on in 1971, Dr. Hooper was sure he had done
        this, as he had been issued patents on two generators, a
        mechanical one, Patent # 3,656,013, and an all-electric one,
        Patent # 3,610,971. Dr. Hooper spent many years building devices
        to rotate magnets at high speeds, but always found that the
        magnetic field of the magnets, and the vibration and noise of
        the motors interfered with his attempts to measure the field
        with either a capacitor connected to an electrometer or a
        gravity meter. </p>
      <p>In 1968, soon after I began working with Dr. Hooper, he
        conceived and built a device which would eliminate all previous
        problems because there would be no measurable magnetic flux and
        no motors. He called it the All-Electric Motional Electric Field
        Generator. Its design was based completely on his theory of
        gravity, and how he believed gravity was produced in the atoms
        of matter. If his theory was correct, he expected his device to
        produce a motional E field outside the generator by the movement
        of the magnetic field associated with the conduction electrons
        making up the current flowing in the copper wire of the
        generator. </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the design of the generator. It consists of one
        length of #11 formvar insulated copper wire, 924 meters long,
        bent 180 degrees at nine-inch intervals and packed side -by-side
        with the two ends emerging together from the top. These
        nine-inch linear conductors, 4020 in all, were then sealed
        together with epoxy in the shape of a right circular cylinder.
        When energized by direct current, half of the conductors, 2010,
        would be carrying current and magnetic flux vertically downward,
        and the same number would be carrying them vertically upward.
        Thus, the generator is non-inductive, having no measurable
        magnetic field around it. But Dr. Hooper hoped to find something
        else around it, the motional E field, similar to gravity in that
        it could not be shielded. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> [Not shown] </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic induction with no measurable field is not new.
        It is well known that in the space outside a properly wound
        toroidal coil, there is no magnetic field due to the
        superposition of fields, and yet, when alternating current is
        surging back and forth in it, a transformer electric field is
        present in the space surrounding it. </p>
      <p>Let's see what happens when we apply the principle of
        superposition of fields to this device. This principle says that
        in order to find the resultant intensity of superimposed fields,
        each field should be treated as though the other were absent;
        the resultant is obtained by the vector addition of each field
        considered singly. When the current in half the wires in this
        generator is moving up, both the current and the magnetic field
        follow the right hand rule, and the motional E field would be
        vertical to both and inwardly directed. At the same time, the
        current in the other half of the wires is moving down, and both
        the current and the magnetic field follow the right hand rule
        and the motional E field is again vertical to both and inwardly
        directed. Therefore, the resultant field intensity is double the
        intensity attributable to one set of conductors. </p>
      <p>Here is how it is expressed mathematically: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E = (<u>B</u> x <u>V</u>) + (-<u>B</u>
        x -<u>V</u>) = 2(<u>B</u> x <u>V</u>) </p>
      <p>where E is the electric field intensity, <u>B</u> is the
        magnetic field that is moving with the electron drift velocity,
        <u>V</u>. The first <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> in the equation
        represents the flow of the magnetic field when the electrons are
        moving in one direction in the wire, and the second term (-<u>B</u>
        x -<u>V</u>) represents the flow of the magnetic field when the
        electrons are moving in the other direction. E is the sum of
        both <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>'s. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> [Not shown] </p>
      <p>Figure 2 pictures how we measured the presence of this motional
        E field. A highly insulated, stainless steel capacitor was
        placed around the center of the generator. The inner capacitor
        plate was connected to the heavy coat of conductive silver,
        shielding the rest of the generator and then grounded. The outer
        capacitor plate was connected to the input head of a Keithley
        640 Vibrating Capacitor Electrometer. This particular
        electrometer with its high input resistances and its vibrating
        capacitor seemed ideal for this purpose. The generator with its
        capacitor and the head of the electrometer were then placed
        inside a stainless steel cabinet. All the connecting wires
        between the electrometer head inside the box and the
        galvanometer outside the box were electrostatically shielded, as
        well as the leads to the generator from the power supply.
        Everything was grounded through a terminal on the electrometer.
        Now, we were ready to energize the generator with up to 30 amps
        of current from our power supply and measure the motional E
        field on the outside. </p>
      <p>The predicted value of the measurement was in the low microvolt
        region. Dr. Hooper, through working in college physics
        laboratories for over 40 years, was well aware of the many
        problems associated with taking measurements in the microvolt
        region, and we had to test for and guard against them all. Our
        greatest problems came because we were unaware of the tendency
        for an electrostatic field to be generated equally and
        oppositely to this motional E field, and how frequently this
        phenomenon occurs. One time when we used one thick capacitor
        plate and one thin one, we discovered that the motional E field
        set up an electrostatic distribution within the thick capacitor
        plate, and reversed the charge on the outer plate. When
        capacitor plates of equal thickness were used the motional E
        field measurement was always positive. </p>
      <p>Another problem we had involved the unbalance of our power
        supplies. We used two power source: our own specially built one,
        designed to rectify 220 AC voltage to low ripple DC voltage,
        providing a maximum of 275 DC volts and 30 amps, and
        occasionally, 12 volt car batteries connected in series to
        compare results. At one point we discovered that when the
        current from the power source entered from one direction, the
        measurement of the motional E field was less than when it
        entered from the other direction. Here, in Dr. Hooper's own
        words, is how he accounted for this problem: "The question
        arises as to why there would be a difference in readings because
        of an unbalance in the power source, as the inner capacitor
        plate is grounded, and the law is that there would be no
        electrostatic charge on the outside of a grounded enclosure. The
        interesting thing is that the only answer seems to lie in the
        fact that there is a motional E field present. If there is an
        unbalance on the inside of the container due to an unbalance in
        input voltage, the normal thing would be for charge to flow
        through the ground wire to balance the charge in the inside of
        the capacitor. However, if the motional E field was acting in
        the ground wire one way, it would oppose the flow of electrons
        toward the shield and, therefore, would allow an electrostatic
        charge to remain on the inner capacitor plate and affect the
        readings." We had to realize the significance of the fact that
        this field permeates everything. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hooper's explanation seemed to be confirmed by close
        observation of the needle on the electrometer in an experiment
        done immediately following this discovery. In that experiment,
        100 V was applied to the generator; 26 amps was the resulting
        current. When the direction of the current was one way, it was
        recorded that the electrometer needle first went negative to 11
        microvolts, and then positive to 17 microvolts. When the current
        was reversed, the electrometer needle only went positive to 28
        microvolts. The difference between the two final readings was 11
        microvolts, the same as the negative deflection. When the input
        voltage was balanced between positive and ground and between
        negative and ground, the measurements of the motional E field
        were the same when the current was flowing in either direction.
      </p>
      <p>The above figures are not comparable to the measurements that
        will be referred to later because different size capacitor
        plates were on the generator. The measurements I will be using
        were taken before this discovery, but we did not redo them
        because we saw that the unbalance was always a negative factor,
        causing our readings to be less, never more. Dr. Hooper did not
        feel that it changed the conclusions reached, even though the
        exactness of the measurements might be questioned. </p>
      <p>Between February 4 and July 19, 1969, when the generator was in
        the condition shown in Figure 2, we varied temperature,
        resistance, types of current, and types of power supplies.
        Measurements were taken by hand at 5 amp intervals, up to 30
        amps. We did not have the sophisticated equipment that is
        available in many laboratories today. Voltage often was not
        taken because it was felt that if we took our measurements only
        when the generator was cool, the voltage would remain the same,
        and we wanted to move up the scale quickly before the generator
        could heat up. Also, Dr. Hooper felt that the amperage was the
        most important factor because theory predicted that the field
        intensity would be directly proportional to the square of the
        amperage, because it is proportional to the virtual value of the
        magnetic field, which is proportional to the current, and to the
        electron drift velocity, which theory says is proportional to
        the current. </p>
      <p>The following table provides some typical measurements of the
        potential difference measured across the capacitor plates by the
        electrometer at room temperature. The PD reading in the third
        column will be the significant figure to watch from here on.
        This is what we considered to be the measurement of the
        intensity of the motional E field produced by this generator.
        This measurement was never just a swing of the electrometer
        needle and then back. These measurements were steady on the
        electrometer as long as the amperage reading was held the same,
        showing that the field was being produced continuously. Now, I
        don't mean to say that on such a sensitive electrometer the
        needle was completely stable, but when the amperage was turned
        up the needle went up also and the instability was always in the
        area of the measurement; when we turned the amperage up more,
        the needle continued up the scale. If we had jerks of the needle
        in one direction or the other, we knew we had something spurious
        affecting our readings, and we worked until we found out what it
        was, or until it was no longer there. </p>
      <p>The PD readings on the electrometer were always very close to a
        parabola, as Dr. Hooper predicted. However, the magnitude varied
        from day to day. We determined that there were at least two
        possible causes of this. One, there was some evidence that 8 to
        10 degrees variation in room temperature caused variations in
        the readings: the higher the temperature, the higher the
        readings. The reason for this may become clearer later. Two, the
        unbalance of the power supply, already discussed. You will note
        that the fourth column of figures on this chart shows what the
        predicted values of PD would be for the other amperages, based
        on the experimental figure at 30 amps. The predicted parabola
        was always close to the actual readings. </p>
      <p>On July 19, we went up and down the scale several times because
        it had been suggested that our readings might be due to
        thermoelectric effects between the two capacitor plates. This
        proved they were not. If our readings had been due to heat, they
        would not go up and down the scale with the current. These
        readings also show that the reading were not due to an emf
        induced by changing flux. You will note, however, that after a
        few times up and down the scale, the generator did not begin to
        warm up, and the readings on the electrometer began to increase.
        We had noted this many times and had assumed that it was due to
        thermoelectric effects, and immediately stopped experimenting
        until the generator cooled down. However, on June 4, we decided
        to see just what the effect of heating was on the measurements.

      <p>For comparison purposes, the first set of measurements in

        The second measurements were taken the same day when the
        generator was hot to the touch. When the generator was hot, the
        PD at all levels increased, and you will see the curve was no
        longer a parabola. However, the difference was not totally due
        to thermoelectric effects, because there was a substantial jump
        back at 25 amps. Several measurements were taken with the hot
        generator that day with almost identical results. We were sorry
        that the voltage measurements were not taken because they could
        have given us an idea of how hot the generator was. </p>

      <p> Because heat resistance in the generator seemed to increase
        the PD measurements, it was decided to try other forms of
        resistance in the circuit with the generator. The first set of
        numbers in Figure 5 was obtained when we put a carbon pile
        rheostat in the line. The normal resistance of our generator was
        3.7 ohms. The rheostat increased the resistance in the circuit
        to 5.3 ohms. We discovered that these first measurements were
        very similar to the ones where heat was the added resistance, in
        Figure 4. We then increased the resistance to 7.5 ohms, and as
        you can see, there was another substantial increase in the PD
        readings at 20 amps. Then we added photoflood at 1500 watts to
        the circuit, increasing its resistance to 12.3 ohms. In order
        not to burn them up, we only put 13 amps in the line, but if you
        will compare that 13 amps with the 15 amps above, you will find
        a substantial increase. For more comparison, we then returned to
        the rheostat and adjusted it to 12.3 ohms and at 13 amps we got
        exactly the same PD reading. Then when all resistance was
        removed, the reading was substantially less. </p>
      <p> These experiments showed that our PD measurements, believed to
        be the measurement of the motional E field, increased with the
        addition of resistance in the circuit, and that the form of that
        resistance, whether heat, carbon pile rheostat, or photofloods,
        didn't make any difference. </p>
      <p> Since Dr. Hooper anticipated that the best way to intensify
        this field would be through the use of superconductivity, he
        wanted to see the effect that cooling would have on our
        generator. On February 28, we packed the generator, capacitors
        and all, with dry ice for five hours. Then we took the first set
        of measurements, shown in Figure 6. Unfortunately, there is no
        record of voltage, which would have indicated how cold the
        generator had gotten. At first the results were very puzzling to
        us; certainly not what Dr. Hooper had expected. The curve was
        not at all parabolic. When you look at the PD at 30 amps, it is
        not much different than at room temperature. </p>
      <p> We soon discovered, however, that the results almost exactly
        fit the curve having a formula of PD = KI<sup>4</sup>, where K
        is the proportional constant and I is the current, whereas the
        formula for a parabola is PD = KI<sup>2</sup>. Then we became
        excited, for it could mean that a radical change had taken place
        in the drift velocity of the electrons in the copper wire,
        somewhere between room temperature and dry ice temperatures. If
        this as so, it could help explain the phenomenon of
        superconductivity. Whether it was a gradual change or whether
        there was a critical temperature, we could not tell from these
        experiments. </p>

      <p> That night we packed the generator in dry ice overnight, 17
        hours. The readings that were taken the next day all fit the
        formula, PD = KI<sup>4</sup>. Fortunately, the first two sets of
        readings included voltage measurements from which we determined
        that the resistance had dropped from 3.7 ohms to 2.3 ohms, over
        one-third. You will note that sometimes we missed the proper 5
        amp interval; it was because we were taking the measurements
        rapidly before the generator could heat up. I am sure that is
        also why we skipped the voltage measurements on that last run,
        and afterwards we were sorry we had. </p>
      <p> Have you ever tried to visualize what happens to the electrons
        in a wire when AC voltage is applied? We decided to try to find
        out. On several occasions we put AC voltage into our generator
        from the 220 line coming into our laboratory and through our
        power supply. Figure 7 is typical of the results. You will note
        that the PD readings were no longer a parabola, but almost a
        straight line, having its beginning at less than zero. The
        bottom figures are the result of adding resistance to the
        circuit with AC current. Here again, you will note that the PD
        increases with the addition of resistance to the circuit. </p>

      <p> At one point we began to ask ourselves if this is the
        measurement of the motional E field, what is happening in those
        wires. Fortunately, there are formulas available to give us a
        clue. First of all, we determined that there was no reason to
        believe that the intensity of the virtual magnetic field around
        the generator changed with temperature when the current was the
        same, so therefore it must be the drift velocity of the
        electrons that was changing. </p>
      <p> To get a close approximation of v<sub>d</sub>, the drift
        velocity of the electrons, we used the equation: </p>
      <p> (Eq. 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PD = <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>-<i>l</i>
      </p>
      <p> where PD is the measurement of the field's intensity across
        the capacitor plates, <i>l</i> is the distance between the
        plates, <u>B</u> is the virtual magnetic field density, and <u>V</u>
        is the measurement of the drift of <u>B</u>, which is identical
        to the electron drift velocity, v<sub>d</sub>. From the formula,
      </p>
      <p> (Eq. 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = Aenv<sub>d</sub> </p>
      <p> where I is the current, A is the cross-sectional area of the
        wire, e is the charge on the electrons, and n is the number of
        conduction electrons, we see that if v<sub>d</sub> changes, n,
        the number of conduction electrons, must also change, for in
        this particular generator A and e are constants. Therefore, if
        the drift velocity changes with temperature, so must the number
        of conduction electrons. If one goes up, the other goes down. </p>
      <p> Using equation 3, and using the calculus to integrate the line
        integral of the electric field intensity, PD, between the
        capacitor plates, a more exact figure for v<sub>d</sub> can be
        obtained. Doing it this way, suing the PD reading at 10 amps
        from one of the early experiments, Dr. Hooper determined the
        drift velocity to be 1.78 cm/sec. Using the classical derivation
        of the drift velocity, with Avogadro's number, and then
        decreasing it by 100 as indicated by the Fermi-Dirac statistics,
        he arrived at almost the same figure as the experimental, 1.762
        cm/sec. </p>
      <p> These experiments show that the number of conduction electrons
        remains fairly constant at room temperatures and that the drift
        velocity increases linearly with the current. When resistance in
        the form of heat, carbon pile rheostat, or photo floods was
        added to the circuit, the number of conduction electrons
        decreased from that of room temperature and normal resistance
        while the drift velocity increased. At dry ice temperature and
        at low current, there were almost ten times as many conduction
        electrons moving, but moving very slowly, like cars on a crowded
        highway. As the amperage increased, the number of conduction
        electrons decreased rapidly, causing a greatly accelerated
        increase in the electron drift velocity. When AC current was put
        in the generator, it appeared that 3 to 4 times as many
        electrons were moving at low amperage as move under DC current
        at room temperature, but as with dry ice, when more electrons
        were moving, they were moving very slowly. By the time the
        amperage increased to 20 amps the number of electrons had
        decreased to almost the same number as with DC current at room
        temperature. From 20 to 30 amps the number of electrons remained
        fairly constant. The electron drift velocity increased rapidly
        at low amperages and continued to increase but at a decreasing
        rate at higher amperages. </p>
      <p> These observations regarding electron drift velocity and
        number of conduction electrons would appear to be more
        consistent with current theory regarding gases, semiconductors,
        and semi-metals, than with the current theory for metals. If
        these findings are true, they would seem to indicate that the
        conductivity of a metal is related to the number of electrons in
        motion and their velocity, both of which change with temperature
        and resistance. </p>
      <p> In his book, <i>Electromagnetism and Relativity</i>,
        published in 1957, E.G. Cullwick predicted, based on
        experimental evidence, that the magnetic field of the electron
        could move with the electron drift velocity. He also said,
        "Measurements of the normal Hall effect in metals are often
        assumed to confirm the conventional view that all the available
        conduction electrons participate continuously in a conduction
        current." He then shows that this need not be so. </p>
      <p> The question is usually asked about how this motional E field
        fits into the relativity theories. Dr. Hooper has a section in
        his manuscript where he says that he feels there is no conflict
        with the Special Theory of Relativity, only with how it is
        currently being interpreted by some relativists. It does appear
        to conflict with the General Theory of Relativity. </p>
      <p> In the beginning I said that Dr. Hooper began by challenging
        the assumption of electromagnetic theory that there is only one
        electric field, the electrostatic, and that this led him to make
        more challenges of field theory. In formulating his theory of
        gravity, he had to challenge the belief that the magnetic field,
        known to be present when an electron is in motion, does not move
        with the electron. However, if his theory is correct, we have a
        solid basis for a unified field theory, based on the motional E
        fields created when the charges in the atoms are in motion. When
        he built a generator to test his theory, the results challenged
        the belief in current theory that the electron drift velocity in
        metals does not change with temperature, an aspect of current
        theory which makes metals different from all other substances,
        gases, semiconductors, and semi-metals. </p>
      <p> Dr. Hooper not only visualized that if his theory were correct
        that we could tap the gravitational field for energy, "atomic"
        energy in its most usable form; he also saw the possibilities,
        if this motional E field could be intensified enough, of
        gravity-free areas on earth, artificial gravity in space, space
        vehicles, and even off-the-road vehicles on earth. He felt that
        this field could be used for communication through previously
        impenetrable barriers, and to separate ions, such as in the
        desalination of water and the control of thermonuclear plasma. </p>
      <p> Now, let's go back to Equation 1, <u>E</u> = <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>,
        where <u>E</u> represents the intensity of the field we were
        producing. That intensity represents the strength of the field.
        It must be substantially increased before the field can be made
        useful. The V in the equation represents the electron drift
        velocity in the material making up the generator. An increase in
        the drift velocity would increase the field's intensity. This
        research indicates that it can be done at both higher and lower
        temperatures, and with increased resistance in the circuit.
        Hence, it provides a direction for more research. </p>
      <p> To begin, most would want to duplicate the experiments here
        outlined. All the original equipment is still available. That
        might lead to building generators like this from a variety of
        materials, which would give a great deal of information about
        the conductivity of solids, heretofore unknown, which could
        indicate a pattern of activity for electrons in various
        materials, making possible predictions about what happens to
        electron drift velocity at both higher and lower temperatures,
        amperages, and with varying amounts of resistance. There would
        probably be some materials that would be best used at high
        temperatures, others that would be best at low temperatures, and
        still others that might do well at room temperature. </p>
      <p>The possibilities are great that this experimentation begun in
        1969 will transform the world.</p>
