      <p>This book is dedicated to Mr. And Mrs. Warren W. Gibson, who
        have made it possible financially to carry on the last two years
        of fruitful experimental work. The devotion and dedication of
        Mrs. Gibson (Fran) to this project, serving as secretary and
        Research Assistant, has provided a flame which has kept it aglow
        to its present status. </p>
      <p>"It appears to me, that the study of electromagnetism in all

        promoting the progress of science." (James Clerk Maxwell: <i>Treatise

      <p>Nearly everyone believes that gravity is a force emanating from
        matter, but just how, just why, nobody seems to know! In the
        science of physics much is known about electricity and
        magnetism, but of gravity, nothing really, with the exception of
        the inverse square law of Sir Isaac Newton, which we know
        gravity obeys. </p>
      <p>This treatise presents <u>newly discovered</u> unique and
        startling properties of one of our induced electric fields. It
        gives this field a new status among our field forces. Its
        unusual properties are possessed only by gravity. While it is
        too early to claim complete identification of this field and the
        gravitational field, the similarities are amazingly alike. </p>
      <p>Electricity and Magnetism were once two separate sciences. In
        1820, Hans Christian Oersted observed that magnetic flux was
        always looped about a current-carrying conductor. This discovery
        served to unite the two sciences of Electricity and Magnetism
        into one, that of Electromagnetism. </p>
      <p>During World War II the writer, working on an invention for a
        "drift and ground speed meter for aircraft", arrived at a plan
        for utilizing the vertical component of the earth's magnetic
        field. If the voltage induced between the ends of two oriented
        linear conductors traveling horizontally across the vertical
        component could be measured within an aircraft, a self-contained
        meter, independent of ground instrumentalities, would be
        forthcoming. The plan was reviewed by the U.S. Bureau of
        Standards, and its workability confirmed under a certain
        restriction. It was stated that the device would be inoperable
        within a conducting cavity such as a metal-clad aircraft. Our
        textbbooks have taught us that when a linear conductor moves
        with a velocity V across a magnetic flux of intensity B, an
        electric field of vector intensity VxB is induced within the
        wire and gives rise to a voltage at its terminals. This
        electromagnetically induced electric field, often called a
        motional electric field, we have been taught, would be
        electrostatic in character, that is, identical and
        indistinguishable from an electric field arising from charges of
        electricity. We know that radio tubes, silvered on the inside,
        shield the interior from stray electrostatic fields. In the same
        way, it was explained, such a drift and ground speed meter
        within a metal-clad aircraft would be shielded from the electric
        field induced in a conductor by motion across the vertical
        component of the earth's magnetic field. This explanation was a
        jolt to the writer. How could we know, without experimental
        evidence, that such would be the case? This presented a great
        challenge! Some of the foremost thinkers in physics were
        consulted. It was discovered that there was <u>no experimental
          evidence</u> to support the popular belief held by physicists
        that the motionally induced V x B field was electrostatic in its
        fundamental character and therefore subject to shielding. It
        will be shown how, step by step, the writer has been guided over
        a period of 20 years to experimental means which at last reveal
        experimentally, beyond all doubt, the beautiful unique
        properties of the motional electric field. It is not
        electrostatic! Its immunity to shielding, magnetic or
        electrostatic, is the exciting property which it shares with the
        gravitational field and thereby indicates their kinship. By a
        general theorem in electric field theory we know that a
        non-uniform B x V field must also act attractively on matter!
        Thus the motional electric field has acquired a status which
        makes it quite unique. </p>
      <p>Guided by theory the inventor has built a generator of the B x
        V field which projects its field into the surrounding space. The
        writer calls this artificially generated field Electrodynamic
        Gravity because it simulates gravity. Although utilizing
        principles of magnetic field superposition and electromagnetic
        induction, the product field, B x V, like the gravitational
        field displays no evidence that magnetism plays a part in its
        generation. Likewise it is free of electrostatic
        characteristics. Although magnetic flux is moved by the
        generator, there are no mechanically moving parts. </p>
      <p>The guiding concept employed by the inventor was first set
        forth in 1957 by E. G. Cullwick (<i>Electromagnetism &amp;
          Relativity</i>, p. 245, Longsman Green &amp; Co.). His
        research had led him to the conviction that the magnetic flux
        loops discovered by Oersted were actually in motion along the
        linear conductor in the direction of the electron current giving
        rise to it, and moved with the electron drift velocity. Our
        motional electric field generator demonstrates the correctness
        of the foregoing prediction. Its operation makes use of this
        movement of flux to generate the B x V field in space about the
        generator. This confirmation of Cullwick's prediction is an
        experimental contribution to modern electronic theory and it has
        all the earmarks of being the welding link which ties
        gravitation to electricity and magnetism. The oersted flux,
        first its discovery, and now the discovery that it moves with
        the electron drift velocity giving rise to it, thus holds a
        unique role in the process of welding the three sciences into
        one. </p>
      <p>The new generator affords useful instrumentation for directly
        measuring electron drift velocities in metals, as well as
        experimentally determining the number of electrons available at
        various temperatures. Thus, it provides a new experimental
        method f investigation into the realm dealt with by the
        Fermi-Dirac statistics. Theoretically, this device holds
        exciting possibilities of great utility at very low
        temperatures. If sufficiently intense fields can be obtained by
        the use of superconducting wire in our generator at low
        temperatures, as we have good reason to believe is possible, the
        phenomenon of attraction and polarization of materials by this
        field can be studied. This would immediately bring into the
        realm of possible experimental demonstration such effects as
        weightlessness, artificial gravity, and anti-gravitational
        effects. This achievement, the writer believes, will be no more
        difficult of attainment than that which has already been
        demonstrated experimentally. </p>
      <p>Should success follow the forthcoming planned cryogenic (low
        temperature) experiments and we find that very intense B x V
        fields can be generated and identified with the gravitational
        field, the promise of utility to humanity would be beyond all
        description. Free electric power from the earth's gravitational
        field would be obtainable anywhere, under the sea, on earth or
        neighboring space, on the moon or the planets! Gravity-free
        laboratories on earth, and artificial gravity in spacecraft ---
        these are some of the possibilities! With such promises on the
        horizon it is difficult for the writer to rest on his oars for
        one minute. This treatise therefore goes forth with "Great
        Expectations!" </p>

      <p>Forty years have passed since Max Mason and Warren Weever wrote
        in their celebrated book, <i>The Electromagnetic Field</i> (1 ~
        p. xii, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1929): </p>
      <p>"The great scientific task of the next 50 years is the
        development of a new electromagnetic theory. It is impossible to
        forecast the form such a theory will take, so greatly are we
        prejudiced by our present views. It will, however, doubtless be
        based on a quantitative description of the individual behavior
        of charges" </p>
      <p>The new physics under the leadership of such men as Einstein,
        Planck, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Bridgman, has produced a
        series of kaleidoscopic changes in classical concepts. The
        contributions of the first four of these five men have been well
        incorporated into our modern textbooks. It is the work of
        Bridgman, his philosophy as embodied in "The Logic of Modern
        Physics" (2 ~ MacMillan Co., 1928), and paraphrased as "The
        Operational Viewpoint", which has to a large extent inspired
        this treatise, and provided a beacon of illuminated thinking to
        guide contemporary physicists in the development of new ideas.
        What Bridgman has done is to show us how the advent of
        relativity theory has made it necessary to take cognizance of
        the fat that new phenomena spring into existence as the result
        of introducing into an experiment nothing more than motion or a
        change in motion. We must be aware of assuming that because of
        the fact that similarities exist between old and new phenomena
        that they are necessarily equivalent. To be specific, let us
        again turn to Mason and Weaver: </p>
      <p>"It cannot be urged that it has been shown experimentally that
        moving particles and changing currents are rigorously equivalent
        as regards induced electromagnetic forces. It is very easy to
        let the notation carry the burden of the argument and to hold
        that the value of curl E s related to the rate of change of B in
        every case in the way stated by the equation (curl E = -?B/?t).
        It is very important to point out, however, that by doing so one
        may be overlooking something of fundamental physical
        importance." (3 ~ ibid., p. 257) </p>
      <p>It is this "something of fundamental physical importance" which
        is overlooked when the so-called "principle of equivalence" is
        applied without rigorous examination and analysis. This is the
        very essence of Bridgman's thesis. </p>
      <p>There is no evidence that the subject matter of
        electromagnetism, since its earliest inception, has ever been
        given the Bridgman treatment. If we desire to keep our future
        growth on solid scientific ground, we are faced with the
        necessity of review and revision of old and new concepts which
        dominate thinking in the direction of its inevitable expansion.
        We need much to learn how "greatly are we prejudiced by our
        present views". In order to make way for the next great
        breakthrough in physics we must first come face to face with
        facts that reveal how greatly our present concept of fields is
        restricting our thinking and limiting our achievements. </p>
      <p>An example of one of the greatest blind spots in current
        popular field theory will illustrate this point. This blind
        spot, due to an assumed concept, has been upheld by some of our
        most brilliant mathematical physicists. So dogmatic and
        completely certain of the accuracy of his position was one that
        he contributed the following jingle with which to support his
        conviction: </p>
      <p>"There is but one God Allah, And Mohammed is his prophet! There
        is but one electric field E, and Maxwell is its prophet!" (4 ~
        J. Stepian, "Electrostatic or Electromagnetically Induced
        Electric Field?"; <i>Scientific Paper</i> 1451, Westinghouse
        Research Laboratory, 7-14-49) </p>
      <p>That nature has provided us with but one field agency which
        accelerates electrons, one electric field, and that one
        electrostatic in its fundamental character, is perhaps the
        greatest of all our current prejudiced and erroneous views. None
        of Faraday's famous experiments show or prove the existence of
        but one electric field in nature. It is Maxwell's translation of
        these experiments into the language of mathematics that bear the
        tacit <u>assumption</u> of only one such field. But Faraday
        left us a word of warning: </p>
      <p>"and considering the constant tendency of the mind to rest on
        an assumption, and, when it answers every present purpose, to
        forget that it is an assumption, we ought to remember that, in
        such cases, it becomes a prejudice, and inevitably interferes,
        more or less, with clearsighted judgment." (5 ~ <i>Phil.Mag</i>.,
1844)







      </p>
      <p>It will be shown with experimental and theoretical proof that
        this assumed and prejudiced view is incorrect. Indeed, it is as
        obsolete as the concept of the atom as being a single
        indivisible particle, and as obsolete as the concept of a single
        atom for each element. It is as unrealistic as were the
        arguments of the famous Professor Simon Newcomb, recipient of
        honorary degrees from ten European and seven American
        universities, who was demonstrating mathematically that man
        could not fly, while the Wright brothers were assembling their
        aircraft at Kitty hawk. Simply because it can be shown
        mathematically that an electrified particle will trace identical
        trajectories in each of two types of fields, is no proof that
        these fields, these accelerating agencies, are equivalent and
        identical. Penetrating properties of fields, rendering them
        immune to shielding, possessed by some and not by others, have
        no mathematical representation in such so-called proofs, hence
        the proof is not rigorous because it does not include all the
        field properties. </p>
      <p>A second modern prejudice, an assumed concept, which has gained
        considerable popularity, is one which states "the whole concept
        of a magnetic field is a fiction." (6 ~ P. Moon &amp; D.E.
        Spencer: "Electromagnetism Without Magnetism: An Historical
        Sketch"; <i>Amer. J. Phys.,</i> vol. 22, p. 120, 1954) </p>
      <p>By combining two conceptual prejudices, "one electric field"
        (or its equivalent, electric charges only) and "no magnetic
        field", Moon and Spencer have produced what they call "A New
        Electrodynamics" (7 ~ <i>J. Franklin Inst.</i> vol. 257: p.
        369, 1954) which appears on the surface to have revamped the
        whole picture of electromagnetism, in which no reference is made
        of fields, and the formulation is in terms of charges and their
        motions only. It would appear upon first examination that the
        success of their endeavors would constitute a basis for
        establishing the verity of the two basic assumptions. But this
        is not the case, as will be shown. The Bridgman treatment of
        Maxwell's equations clarifies the paradoxes and ambiguities
        previously associated with them and in so doing it retains the
        intrinsic values found in electric and magnetic field concepts (
        8 ~ P. Moon &amp; D.E. Spence: "Some Electromagnetic Paradoxes",
        <i>J. Franklin Inst</i>., vol, 260, p. 373, 1955). Both the
        Maxwell equations and the "New Electrodynamics" formulation take
        on new meanings when analyzed in the light of the Operational
        Viewpoint urged by Bridgman. We will go into this subject in the
        next chapter. </p>
      <p>Wile Moon and Spencer claim that the complete elimination of
        all reference to electric and magnetic field concepts in their
        formulation brings it to "a closer contact with reality", to the
        writer, this constitutes rather a fleeing from the reality of
        fields by burying one's head in sand, like an ostrich, wherein
        only sand particles can be seen, and one's body remains in a
        variety of teeming dynamic forces. </p>
      <p>The idea that magnetism may not have physical reality because
        electric currents which give rise to certain aspects of it may
        be replaced in the equations by moving charges has been given
        much consideration. Page and Adams in discussing elementary
        charge and the force equation state: </p>
      <p>"It is often stated that no magnetic charges exist in nature,
        and that therefore the terms in ?<sub>H</sub> in this equation
        are without physical significance. On the contrary, we shall
        show that, if every elementary charged particle contains
        electric and magnetic charges in the same ratio, no
        electromagnetic experiment can reveal the value of ? ---
        therefore the field equation and the force equation become
        identical in form with the equations obtained on the assumption
        that only electric charge exists in nature. There is no
        experimental evidence, therefore, to justify the common
        assumption that only electric charges and no magnetic charges
        are present in the world of experience. If the reverse were
        true, or if electric and magnetic charges occurred combined in
        any fixed ratio, all electromagnetic phenomena would take place
        in exactly the same way. No electromagnetic experiment would
        reveal the proportions in which the two types of charge might
        exist." (9 ~ Leigh Page &amp; Norman Adams: <i>Electrodynamics</i>,
        pp. 210-211, Van Nostrand &amp; Co, 1940) </p>
      <p>The concept of electric and magnetic fields possessing
        intensities and directions, susceptible to direct experimental
        measurement and mapping, is one of the most fundamental and
        elemental realities of electromagnetism. True it is that
        perplexing and incongruous problems in field theory, heretofor
        seemingly unsolvable, have plagued it, and indeed these problems
        are largely responsible for the current trend to avoid field
        theory, especially magnetic, wherever possible. It is right in
        this area that Bridgman's Operational Philosophy comes to our
        rescue and affords a solution which is both satisfying and
        illuminating. </p>
      <p>Electric and magnetic fields are manifestation of force, and
        force is always associated with energy. Our understanding of the
        energy nature of electric and magnetic fields up to the present
        time appears clouded and uncertain. A clear adequate description
        has not been found by the writer in any contemporary text. In
        place thereof is found confusion worse confounded. In order to
        fully comprehend the significance of this treatise we must have
        some acquaintance with the present status of our knowledge of
        fields, both energy-wise and otherwise. A glimpse of this state
        of affairs may be gained from a few quotations from <i>The
          Electromagnetic Field</i> (10 ~ Mason &amp; Weaver, <i>op.
          cit</i>., pp. 266-269). Speaking of the special density of
        electric and magnetic energy and of the Poynting Vector which
        measures the flux of energy at any point, we read: "The authors
        do not pretend to understand these concepts, but discuss them as
        adequately as they are able". They further say that they "are
        not able to ascribe any significance whatever to the phrase
        'localized energy'". Nothwithstanding these views, they state,
        "The hypothesis of a spacially distributed electrostatic energy
        of volume density ha, however, played a large role in the
        development of electromagnetic theory" (11 ~ ibid., p. 162). And
        again, "in both electrostatics and magnetostatics, energy
        densities in space have, to be sure, been calculated" (12 ~
        ibid., p. 269). It is an object of this treatise to completely
        clarify this area of electric and magnetic field energy. </p>
      <p>Energy, in the many forms it assumes, appears today to play a
        leading role in the great drama of physical science. Whether it
        is kinetic or potential, mechanical, electric, magnetic,
        electromagnetic, binding energy of nuclear structure, or any
        other of its myriad manifestation, it is some form of energy,
        pure or bottled up in particle form, which we encounter and
        cognize at every turn in this physical world. Everything in the
        material universe is some form or manifestation of energy. </p>
      <p>In the light of fundamentals it would seem most natural that a
        proper scientific description and classification of anything
        would include terms which reveal its energy nature, or status
        with respect to energy. In a comparison of one thing with
        another, one recognizes as a mere self-evident truism the fact
        that for any two things to be identical in nature, they must
        necessarily be identical from an energy standpoint, and this
        truism especially applies to force fields, both electric and
        magnetic. </p>
      <p>This treatise will especially concern itself with one of the
        most important underlying properties of one of our electric
        fields, the "motional electric field <u>B </u>x <u>V</u>" and
        its immunity to shielding. It will present new theoretical and
        experimental knowledge which must have consequences of vital
        importance to the science and philosophy of modern physics. The
        picture presented will be based entirely upon conceptions of
        electromagnetic theory which are found in complete agreement
        with experiment. This picture, it is believed, will reveal not
        only the cause of many of our difficulties, but the way out of
        them. It will reveal a vista of new opportunities for research.
        It is confidently believed that as a result of the clarified
        picture thus attained, new horizons in field theory are in the
        offing. A glimpse of these horizons, together with an
        electromagnetic theory of gravitation leading up to the
        derivation of Newton's Inverse Square Law, will be presented
        with experimental proposals for its verification. Finally the
        subject of antigravity will be discussed and, in the light of
        this thesis, how a practical approach to this problem is clearly
        indicated with its thrilling possibilities. </p>

      <p>Webster defines science as "knowledge classified and made
        available in the search for truth". A correct <u>classification</u>
        of knowledge thus becomes the basic foundation of a science. The
        word classification has been underlined by the writer, because
        of its great importance. A wrong classification of anything can
        result in greatly impeding the progress of the branch of science
        in which it exists. Thus great treasures in science can be
        hidden and obscured for ages until some prospector comes along
        and reveals its true nature. A critical survey of the present
        status if electrodynamics reveals a considerable number of
        electric and magnetic fields which are brought into being by
        operations which are unique and seemingly unrelated. So
        entrenched is the present <u>tacit</u> assumption of physicists
        that nature has provide nature with <u>one</u> and only <u>one</u>
        electric field and <u>one</u> and only <u>one</u> magnetic
        field that no pioneer has as yet attempted to seriously
        penetrate this prejudice and venture into the possibilities of
        classification which might bring law and order to some of our
        current problems. </p>
      <p>The advent of relativity theory was instrumental in forcing
        physicists to reexamine and alter many of their most cherished
        and fundamental concepts in physics. Consdier, for instance, the
        concept of time. None other than the great Sir Isaac Newton has
        defined time, in his <i>Principia</i>, in the following manner:
      </p>
      <p>"Absolute, True, and Mathematical Time, of itself, and from its
        own nature flows equably without regard to anything external,
        and by another name is called Duration." </p>
      <p>Bridgman points out with great clarity that f we examine the
        definition of absolute time in the light of experiment, we find
        nothing in nature with such properties. By example after example
        he points out that many of the stumbling blocks which have
        clogged the progress of physics, and then he does something
        about it. He has contributed what is called the Operational
        Viewpoint as a guiding beacon to enable us to avoid making these
        kinds of mistakes in the future. In brief, he tells us what we
        should define and classify our concepts in terms of the
        operations which are necessary in order to detect and measure
        them, and not in terms which have no counterpart reality in
        nature, no direct experimental evidence to support them. Only as
        we do this, he points out, can we avoid treacherous pitfalls and
        embarrassments in the future growth of our science. He states,
        "It is evident that if we adopt this point of view toward
        concepts, namely that the proper definition of a concept is not
        in terms of its properties but in terms of actual operations, we
        need run no danger of having to revise our attitude toward
        nature. For if experience is always described in terms of
        experience, there must always be correspondence between
        experience and description of it, and we need never be
        embarrassed, as we were in attempting to find in nature the
        prototype of Newton's absolute time" (13 ~ Bridgman, op. cit.,
        p. 6). While stating that "operational thinking will at first
        prove to be an unsocial virtue", he nevertheless predicts that,
        "In this self-conscious search for phenomena which increase he
        number of operationally independent concepts, we expect to find
        a powerful systematic method directing the discovery of new and
        essentially important physical facts" (14 ~ ibid., p. 224). </p>
      <p>The writer has classified operationally the three most
        prominent electric and the three most prominent magnetic fields
        which we find in nature. They are as follows: </p>
      <p>Fundamental Electric &amp; Magnetic Fields (m.k.s. units) </p>
      <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E<sub>c</sub> = Qr/4 pi e<sub>o</sub>r<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The electrostatic or Coulomb field arising from the presence of
        charges </p>
      <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E<sub>m</sub> = v x B<sub>s</sub> </p>
      <p>The motional electric field which acts on charges traveling
        with velocity V across a magnetic induction B<sub>s</sub>. This
        field is produced by flux cutting and should not be confused
        with E<sub>t</sub> arising from flux linking </p>
      <p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curl Et = ?<sup>B</sup>/?<sup>t</sup> </p>
      <p>or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Et = ?<u>A</u>/?t <br>
        <img src="0eq1a.gif" height="83" width="141"></p>
      <p>The electric field E<sub>t</sub>, in this formula arises from
        flux linking, or transformer electromagnetic induction
        discovered by Henry and Faraday. In this field B changes
        intrinsically with time. <u>A</u> is the magnetic vector
        potential. </p>
      <p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curl H<sub>s</sub> = J </p>
      <p>This magnetostatic field H arising from a conduction current
        density J within a conducting medium was first discovered by
        Oersted. It is at rest with respect to the current circuit
        source producing it. </p>
      <p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H<sub>m</sub> = -v x D<sub>c</sub> </p>
      <p>The motional magnetic field arising from relative velocity v
        with respect to electric charges producing the electric
        induction D<sub>c</sub>. </p>
      <p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curl <u>H</u><sub>R</sub> = ?<u>D</u>c/?t







      </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1b.gif" height="36" width="129"></p>
      <p>The magnetic field H<sub>R</sub> surrounding a changing
        electric induction called a displacement current. This magnetic
        field plays a prominent part in the production of
        electromagnetic radiation. It was first theoretically predicted
        by Clerk Maxwell. </p>
      <p>Particularly illuminating is the analysis of Cullwick with
        respect to the salient operational differences in the sources of
        the three types of electric field E<sub>c</sub>, E<sub>m</sub>
        and E<sub>t</sub> (15 ~ E. Geoffrey Cullwick: <i>The
          Fundamentals of Electromagnetism</i>, p. 285; Cambridge Univ.
        Press, 1949). In brief, he pictures them as follows. </p>
      <p>All electromagnetic phenomena applied in electrical technology
        have, as their fundamental basis, the mutual forces experienced
        by electric charges, and we have seen that these arise in three
        ways: </p>
      <p>E<sub>c</sub> ~ Two charges experience mutual forces in virtue
        of their positions. This is the electrostatic force of
        attraction or repulsion. </p>
      <p>E<sub>m</sub> ~ They experience additional forces in virtue of
        their velocities. Thence arise the forces experienced by a
        conductor carrying a steady current in a constant magnetic
        field, the forces between current-carrying conductors, and the
        induction of en emf in a conductor moving relatively to the
        source of a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>E<sub>t</sub> ~ They also experience additional forces by
        virtue of their accelerations, from which arise the induction of
        an emf by transformer actions, and electromagnetic radiation of
        energy. </p>
      <p>The thing we are especially interested in, in this thesis, is
        that each of these unique operations with charges brings into
        existence a new force field which will act upon charges of
        electricity to accelerate them. The intensity of an electric
        field is defined at a point as the force per unit of charge will
        be exerted. The great mistake of the past has been the
        assumption that each of the above accelerating agencies are, in
        their intrinsic physical natures, in every way equivalent and
        identical since they each produce the same end product, the
        acceleration of a charged particle. Now in my human experience I
        may desire to move across a lake in a boat. As accelerating
        agencies I may select several which are one unique: (a) a set of
        oars, (b) a sail, (c) an outboard motor, (d) an engine-driven
        air propeller. </p>
      <p>There is no question with respect to the uniqueness of these
        agencies in spite of the fact that each one produces the same
        end result --- namely, a force on the boat. Because we cannot
        cognize directly the unique accelerating agencies in
        electrodynamics by means of the five physical senses, they have
        been assumed to be all alike in nature, in spite of the known
        fact that operationally they arise from manipulations which are
        as uniquely different as in the case of the three accelerating
        agencies applied to the movement of a boat. </p>
      <p>Had Bridgman's Operational Theory been published at an earlier
        date, it is dubious that the present popular view of these
        electric and magnetic fields would be as they are. Why? Because
        the three electric and the three magnetic fields listed above
        are each one produced by operational means which are
        experimentally just about as different as they could possibly
        be. This fact alone should be sufficient to challenge
        complacency and initiate a searching investigation of the facts.
        Contrary to popular belief, each one of these fields is unique
        in nature. It is self-evident that each of these six fields
        requires unique operations necessary to produce, detect, and
        measure it. Both theoretical and experimental evidence will be
        presented to show that at least some of our conceptions of these
        fields are fundamentally misconceptions, and in these cases the
        misconceptions are due to the fact that these fields are unique
        in nature, each one possessing characteristic properties of is
        own which entitle it to a distinct identity in nature. This
        discovery must inevitably render a great service in clarifying
        the confusion existent in the present state of our knowledge,
        and afford new opportunities for research, new possibilities in
        applied physics and new horizons for a unified field theory. An
        analysis of the properties of these fields will next be
        considered so that their unique properties may be apparent. </p>
      <p>Table 1 has been prepared to show the outstanding differences
        in the properties of each of the first three operationally
        different electric fields. The recognition of the uniqueness of
        each field is aided by a comparative study of these properties.
        The properties of the electrostatic field are well known and
        need no elaboration in this treatise. Scientific literature
        dealing with this field is replete with its well-known
        characteristics. </p>

      <p>In order that the unique character of each of the
        electromagnetically induced fields may be understood,
        considerable discussion will be required in view of the fact
        that so many texts emphasize the similarity of these fields in
        certain instances and fail to point out the vital, outstanding
        differences in their fundamental properties, which make it
        impossible for them to be identical in nature. Some of these
        differences have been revealed in scientific literature (16 ~ G.
        I. Cohn: <i>Electrical Engineering</i> 63: 441, 1949; E. G.
        Cullwick: <i>The Fundamentals of Electromagnetism</i>, pp.
        84-87, Macmillan Co., 1939; W.V. Houston: <i>American Physics
          Teacher</i> 7: 373, 1939; Page &amp; Adams: <i>American
          Physics Teacher</i> 3: 57, 1935)) but do not as yet seem to be
        generally incorporated in our textbooks. Cohn, in particular,
        has rendered an outstanding contribution… </p>
      <p>[missing text?] </p>
      <p>different ways of expressing one and the same fundamental
        phenomenon is because it is basically incorrect. Not only are
        the two types of field Em and Et fundamentally different and
        each one unique in nature, but an examination of the Faraday
        Lay, E.M.F. = -dN/dt, reveals that this equation itself does not
        hold true in general. In other words, it has been shown that the
        flux linking with a closed circuit can be either partially or
        completely removed from the circuit without inducing any
        electromotive force whatsoever! 17 ~ G. I. Cohn: <i>Paradoxes
          of Electromagnetic Induction</i>; Thesis, Illinois Inst. of
        Technology Library) </p>
      <p>This can be accomplished by a cleverly designed switching
        circuit, one version of which is shown in Figure 1. This
        illustrates the fact that the flux linking with a closed circuit
        may be changed by three different unique operations: (1) Flux
        cutting, (2) Flux linking caused by -dB/dt, where the source of
        B is intrinsically changed with time, and (3) A uniquely
        designed switching circuit. Only the first two sets of
        operations produces an emf. The third set of operations produces
        no emf and for this reason the present manner of presenting
        Faraday's Law is invalid. There are two unique operational
        methods of inducing an emf, and we should not endeavor to derive
        them from one simple mathematical expression -dN/dt, because
        this expression includes or implies operations which will not
        induce and emf. It is therefore obsolete! As Cohn and others
        have shown, there are actually two kinds of electromagnetic
        induction and in general case both types are involved and each
        must clearly be understood and differentiated from the other.
        That the flux linking law, attributed to Faraday, does not hold
        for his own Faraday-disk unipolar generator, which requires the
        flux cutting law for its correct descriptive behavior, is
        perhaps one of the most outstanding examples of how vitally
        unique and essential is the role of each law and each of the
        corresponding electric fields produced by these laws. </p>

      <p>In the Faraday generator there is no time rate of change in the
        magnetic induction B, since it originates from a permanent
        magnet and is constant. The circuit can even be made so as to
        link with no flux whatsoever. In any case, there is no change of
        B with time. This very fact that all contemporary authorities
        (18 ~ Slater &amp; Frank: <i>Electromagnetism</i>, p. 86,
        McGraw-Hill, 1947) on this subject have found it necessary to
        add the flux cutting law to the famous Maxwell equations in
        order to satisfactorily explain all cases of electromagnetic
        induction is itself indicative of the uniqueness of the electric
        field so produced. </p>
      <p>Many of my colleagues have said that it was not difficult for
        them to distinguish fundamental differences in the Coulomb field
        E<sub>c</sub> and the magnetically induced fields E<sub>t</sub>
        and E<sub>m</sub>, but they were unable to see any clearly
        defined difference between the E<sub>t</sub> and the E<sub>m</sub>
        field. Let us, therefore, discuss some of the most outstanding
        differences between these two fields. </p>
      <p>What is our concept of an electric field? Most physicists will
        reply that it is a force which acts upon an electric charge and
        tends to accelerate it in a definite direction termed the
        direction of the field. With this concept in mind, let us
        analyze the two electric fields E<sub>t</sub> and E<sub>m</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 below is shown a cross-section of a long straight
        solenoid in which a gradually increasing current is flowing
        counterclockwise. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The uniformly distributed magnetic flux density B within this
        area is therefore increasing with time and according to
        Faraday's law of Electromagnetic Induction, the emf around any
        closed circuit placed wholly within the area shown in Figure 2
        would be given by: emf = dN/dt = ?QE<sub>t</sub>-ds where N
        equals the total flux linking the circuit. <br>
        <img src="0eq1d.gif" height="43" width="195"><br>
        Our interest centers on E<sub>t</sub>, the electric field within
        the conductor of such a circuit, giving rise to the emf.
        Obviously, Faraday's Law gives us absolutely no information
        about this field Et other than to say that the line integral of
        this field around the closed circuit will give us a value of the
        emf induced in it. If this closed circuit A lies in the plane of
        the area, Figure 2, then at point P in this circuit, it is
        obvious that E<sub>t</sub> is directed toward the bottom of the
        paper. If, however, we select the circuit B instead of A, then
        at this same point P the electric field E<sub>t</sub> is
        directed horizontally to the right. If we select circuit C
        instead of B, we then find E<sub>t</sub> directed toward the top
        of the paper at P exactly the opposite direction from that in
        circuit A. And if we select circuit D then E<sub>t</sub> at P is
        directed horizontally to the left, in exactly the opposite
        direction that it had in circuit B. That an electric field E<sub>t</sub>
        exists in this area there seems to be no doubt since an emf
        arises within each of these circuits. But this field E<sub>t</sub>
        is very peculiar, since it is impossible to define it at the
        point P unless we first select a particular circuit through P
        which will then enable us to determine its direction at P. </p>
      <p>Now let us remove the conducting circuits from within the area
        of Figure 2, and place a stationary free charged particle Q at
        the point P. Will it move? If so, in what direction will it
        move? If it remains stationary, and is free to move, then does
        an electric field exist at this point? Certainly the magnetic
        flux density exists there and is changing with time, but we have
        no assurance whatsoever that it will act upon a stationary
        charge, nor is the direction in which it will act unless it is
        first given an initial velocity, or unless it is confined within
        the conducting medium of a closed circuit. No other electric
        field has this unique operational prerequisite, which in this
        case appears to require that the charged particle upon which it
        acts must either have an initial velocity within the electric
        field, or that it must exist within a conducting circuit before
        it will make itself manifest. A free stationary charged particle
        placed within an E<sub>m</sub> or E<sub>c</sub> field will be
        immediately acted upon in both magnitude and definite direction.
        About all that we can say in a descriptive manner of E<sub>t</sub>
        at a point P, such as shown in Figure 2, is that this
        transformer type field has curl at that point, as shown by
        Maxwell's formula. For a clarifying conception of just what curl
        means one will find it helpful to study Skilling's treatment of
        it where he defines it as the limiting value of circulation per
        unit area (19 ~ H. H. Skilling: <i>Fundamentals of Electric
          Waves</i>, 2nd Ed., p. 41; J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1948).
        This means simply, as applied to Figure 2, that if a small
        conducting disk of ink, say a dot made with India ink, were
        placed at point P, negative electrons would circulate in this
        dot in a counterclockwise direction. The dot of ink would be
        everywhere at the same potential, and therefore uncharged. Curl
        is one of the most outstanding characteristics of the E<sub>t</sub>
        field which may or may not be possessed by the E<sub>m</sub>
        field, but never by E<sub>c</sub>. Now place this same dot of
        India ink in a uniform E<sub>m</sub> field and it will become an
        electric dipole. The action of a uniform Et field on this dot is
        therefore very much different from that of an E<sub>m</sub>
        uniform field. </p>
      <p>With the exception of mason and Weaver's text, little
        literature appears to exist which directs attention to the
        ambiguous nature of the concept of the spatial distribution of
        energy as concerns the two electromagnetically induced electric
        fields. That the electric field induced by a magnetic flux
        intensity which is changing with time has a spatial distribution
        of energy, whereas the motionally induce electric field does not
        have any such identical distribution of electric field in space
        is one of the most crucial of the fundamental differences in
        their properties. Since the establishment of this fact that
        these two fields differ radically in their relation to field
        energy is all-important to the objectives of this treatise, let
        us now take up a digression at this point. </p>
      <p>Insofar as this writer is informed, no one questions the
        actuality of the special distribution of energy in the case of
        the electrostatic field or the E<sub>t</sub> field, due to a
        magnetic vector potential intensity varying with time (20 ~ The
        transformer law is usually stated in terms of the negative time
        ration of change of magnetic flux linking with the circuit and
        this gives the total induced emf. The electric field produced by
        this type of induction is most conveniently designated by the
        time rate of change of the magnetic vector potential.).
        Calculations involving field energy in the electrostatic case
        have long been made without difficulty, and the transfer of
        energy between the primary and secondary coils of a transformer
        without any movement of its component parts give direct evidence
        that electric energy is distributed in the space occupied by the
        E<sub>t</sub> field. The very nature of this electric field
        requires the concept of the spatial distribution of field
        energy. </p>
      <p>An analysis of the nature of the motional electric field will
        reveal, on the other hand, that this concept of spatially
        distributed electric field energy, is not only required for a
        satisfying understanding of phenomena where this field is
        involved, but it actually induces basic ambiguities and
        impossible conceptions. </p>
      <p>Let us now examine the origin and basic nature of the motional
        electric field with its unusual property. </p>
      <p><u>E</u><sub>m</sub> = <u>V</u> x <u>B</u>. This vector field
        equation was derived by Lorentz from the empirical force formula
        of Biot and Savart. This is the electric field which is present
        in the moving wires constituting the armature coils of an
        electric generator. It causes an emf to exist in a conductor by
        virtue of motion across magnetic flux. Such induction is called
        a motionally induced emf or flux cutting emf. As we shall see,
        this field has some of the most unusual and interesting
        properties conceivable. Page and Adams have emphasized one of
        these unique properties. They point out in the case of the
        generator with a rotating armature coil that this field, "exists
        only in the moving conductor" --- where moving electric charges
        are present --- "since no electric field is present in the
        observer's reference frame" (21 ~ Page &amp; Adams, op. cit., p.
        16). Let us examine this aspect of the field more closely, for
        neither the electrostatic field nor the E<sub>t</sub> field
        possesses this property, for these fields can exist in an
        observer's reference frame, whether a conducting circuit, or
        conductor, or charge is at hand or not. </p>
      <p>Three essential operational ingredients are necessary to bring
        this E<sub>m</sub> field into existence: (1) A constant magnetic
        induction <u>B</u>, (2) an electrically charged particle <i>e</i>
        (22 ~ the charged particle may be an electron in a piece of
        matter, or free as in a gas), a relative velocity <u>v</u>
        between the particle and the reference frame of the magnetic
        source producing <u>B</u>. A deflecting force will act upon the
        particle wherever it moves across magnetic flux lines. As viewed
        from the reference frame of the particle, this force (<u>v</u> x
        <u>B</u>) has many aspects of a real electric field and in fact
        it is termed a motionally induced electric field having an
        intensity (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>) per unit charge. In the
        reference frame of the magnetic source giving rise to B only a
        magnetic field is present. One observes that the moving charge
        is acted upon by a force which to all appearances is wholly
        magnetic in nature. Whether we think of it as a deflecting
        magnetic force or an electric field, it is obvious that it
        exists only at the points in space where moving charges, either
        free or in matter, are present, for stationary electric charges
        are unaffected. In a vacuum, or in space between moving electric
        charges, no E<sub>m</sub> field or deflecting magnetic force
        exists. Hence it must necessarily have a spotty, or
        discontinuous nature. How can this be possible? </p>
      <p>Let us proceed as Mason and Weaver have suggested by
        considering "a quantitative description of the individual
        behavior of charges". Let a positively charged particle with
        mass <i>m</i> and charge <i>e</i> be projected into a vacuum
        chamber with uniform velocity <u>v</u><sub>o</sub> at right
        angles to the direction of uniform magnetic flux <u>B</u>. The
        particle has initial kinetic energy T = 1/2 m v<sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>.
        By Ampere's Law, the moving particle (or current element) is
        surrounded by a concentric distribution of magnetic flux. </p>
      <center>
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="0fig3.gif" height="118" width="333"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It will be acted upon by a mechanical deflecting force <u>F</u>
        = e v<sub>o</sub> x <u>B</u>. </p>
      <p>It will also be readily seen that this force on the charged
        particle exists only when there is a magnetic field about the
        particle. The force is actually the force of lateral repulsion
        between two magnetic fields. Without the presence of both
        magnetic fields, no such force exists, hence the existence of <u>f</u>
        requires the simultaneous presence of all three of its essential
        components, e, <u>v</u> and <u>B</u>. The actual action on the
        charged particle is magnetic in character, rather than
        electrical. </p>
      <p>Let us next observe that the force <u>f</u> always acts at
        right angles to both <u>v</u> and <u>B</u>. Since the
        displacement of the particle is always in a direction at right
        angles to the force, this force can do no work on the charged
        particle upon which it acts, and no energy is extracted from <u>B</u>.
        This force, arising from the magnetic repulsion between two
        magnetic fields, one due to the moving particle, and the other
        due to the applied <u>B</u>, acts like a circular deflecting
        constraint or baffle, which only changes the direction but not
        the magnitude of the velocity of the particle. The speed of the
        particle and hence its kinetic energy remain unchanged. It is
        well known that such force will cause the particle to travel in
        a circular path, the radius of which is readily obtained by
        equating the force Bev<sub>o</sub> to the centrifugal force mv<sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>/r
and







        solving for <i>r</i>, r = mv<sub>o</sub>/eB. The particle is
        thus trapped by the magnetic field, which will hold it to a
        circular path until its original kinetic energy is dissipated by
        collisions with neighboring particles, or by radiation. </p>
      <p>It is of particular importance to this discussion and is again
        repeated, that since the deflecting force is always at right
        angles to the relative velocity <u>v</u><sub>o</sub> of the
        particle and also to <u>B</u>, no work is done on the particle
        by the deflecting force. </p>
      <p>Whether the particle is confined within the boundaries of a
        wire or not, (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>) will always be at right
        angles to <u>v</u> and <u>B</u>. For clarification let us
        suppose the particle is enclosed within a frictionless tube the
        axis of which is at right angles to <u>v</u><sub>o</sub> and to
        <u>B</u>. Few further impose the condition the velocity <u>v</u><sub>o</sub>
        of the tube be kept constant in magnitude and direction. Let us
        examine the behavior of the particle within it. As the tube
        moves forward, the particle is prevented from moving in a
        circular path by the walls of the tube, but it can and will
        begin to move along the axis of the tube under the deflecting
        action of the magnetic field. To maintain the original forward
        component of its velocity v<sub>o</sub> constant, the external
        agency moving the tube will have to supply the particle with
        additional kinetic force in this direction. </p>
      <p>As the particle acquires a velocity component v<sub>t</sub>
        along the axis of the tube, the resultant force v x B acquires
        two components, one along the tube, which will be constant (v<sub>o</sub>
        x B), and one at right angles to the tube (v<sub>t</sub> x B),
        opposing to the forward motion (Lenz's Law). We thus see the
        that the additional kinetic energy imparted to the charged
        particle moving down the tube is transmitted to the particle
        directly by the external force moving the tube. This kinetic
        energy is continuously channeled along the tube by the
        deflecting action of the magnetic induction <u>B</u>
        interacting with the magnetic field formed around the moving
        charged particle and the constraint of the tube itself. </p>
      <p>The modus operandi of <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> is thus seen to be
        wholly magnetic in character. The conception of this force, when
        viewed from the standpoint of an observer at rest in the
        reference frame which is traveling with velocity <u>v</u><sub>o</sub>,
        as being an electric field similar in character to that of an
        electrostatic field is therefore an artificial figment of the
        imagination which instead of clarifying the understanding of
        motional electromagnetic induction, often befogs it. The concept
        of <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> as an electric field is a convenient
        mathematical construct, however, for computing induced emf's,
        but the actual nature of the phenomenon with which one is
        dealing must be kept clearly in mind to avoid mistakes. The
        electromotive force induced between the terminals of a short
        straight linear conductor of length <u>l</u> moving with
        relative velocity across a magnetic induction B is given by the
        formula: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E = <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> • <u>l</u>
      </p>
      <p>whereas that induced in a closed circuit is given by: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E = ? <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> • d<u>l</u>
      </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1e.gif" height="34" width="125"></p>
      <p>and is often difficult to evaluate. In these formulae the term
        <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> represents the direction and magnitude of
        the fictitious electric field intensity e<sub>m</sub>. The
        energy associated with this field is directly imparted to the
        charged particles by a mechanical prime mover which produces the
        relative velocity instead of by an actual electric field. </p>
      <p>An important point in the foregoing analysis is that it serves
        to illustrate the fact that since the E<sub>m</sub> field is by
        its intrinsic nature only the repulsive force between two
        magnetic sources, that of <u>B</u> and that of the moving
        charge, it cannot exist except a those points where electric
        charges with magnetic fields about them exist. The E<sub>m</sub>
        field is only at those points where a magnetic field exists that
        can interact repulsively with the magnetic induction B<u>.</u> </p>
      <p>Therefore, it is evident that there can be no continuous
        spatial distribution of E<sub>m</sub> electric field energy as
        there is in the case of the E<sub>o</sub> or E<sub>t</sub>
        fields. Since no electric E<sub>m</sub> field exists in a space
        without charges, there is no E<sub>m</sub> field energy in a
        vacuum or in free space such as can exist with an electrostatic
        field. We need to remember this fact when we think of the E<sub>m</sub>
        field phenomenon from the viewpoint of a moving magnetic flux
        acting on a stationary electric charge. A single phenomenon when
        viewed from two different reference frames can appear to be
        fundamentally different, but such relative viewing does not
        alter the fundamental basic cause giving rise to it. Since the
        real basic nature of the <u>v</u> x <u>B</u> phenomenon has
        not hitherto been exposed in detail and hence is to a large
        extent currently taught and believed to be of an electrostatic
        nature by theoretical physicists, it will be worth our while to
        go into some of the subtle aspects it presents when it is so
        conceived. </p>
      <p>Let us consider the popular view of this phenomenon as
        presented by most interpreters of relativity theory. The Special
        Theory of Relativity as applied to electrodynamics states that
        if we have a uniform electric field of intensity <u>E</u>, due
        to charges, and a uniform magnetic induction <u>B</u>, due to
        magnets, both at rest in a reference frame S, then in frame S'
        moving with uniform velocity <u>v</u> with respect to S an
        observer will find an electric intensity <u>E</u>', and a
        magnetic induction <u>B</u>' given in vector notation in
        absolute gaussian (c.g.s.) units by: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>E</u>' = ? {<u>E</u> - (1/c) <u>v</u>
        x <u>B</u>} </p>
      <p>(Eq. 5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>B</u>' = ? {<u>B</u> - (1/c) <u>v</u>
        x <u>E</u>} </p>
      <p>where ? = 1/? 1 - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1f.gif" height="77" width="430"></p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p>c = 3 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec. </p>
      <p>The current confusion among physicists is that many interpret
        relativity theory as showing that ? <u>v</u> x <u>B</u>/c&nbsp;<img
          src="0eq1g.gif" height="26" width="72">&nbsp; is an electric
        field, identical in nature to an electrostatic field. The reader
        will note that <u>E</u>' is the vector sum of two electric
        intensities, ?E&nbsp;<img src="0eq1h.gif" height="28" width="27">
        , which is an electrostatic field, and V(<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c.






        Added in this manner, many physicists have tacitly assumed that
        E' and ?<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>/c&nbsp;<img src="0eq1g.gif"
          height="26" width="72"> must likewise be interpreted as
        electrostatic in nature. Jeans, however, points out that nothing
        in the postulates of the Special Theory require such an
        interpretation. He states, "the equations may be taken merely as
        an expressing relations between quantities as measured by one
        observer S and another S' moving at velocity v relative to S"
        (23 ~ J. H. Jeans: <i>The Mathematical theory of Electricity
          &amp; Magnetism</i>, p. 606, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1923).
        Cullwick states, "R is an attribute of the relativity equations,
        that they do not claim to include any physical interpretation of
        the phenomena" (24 ~ Cullwick, op cit., p. 119). Smythe states
        that the forces represented by the added terms "differ from
        electrostatic forces. One might call these additional forces
        electrokinetic forces, but as we shall see, they are identical
        with those we have already called magnetic forces" (25 ~ William
        R. Smythe: <i>Static &amp; Dynamic Electricity</i>, p. 488;
        McGraw Hill Book Co., 1939). </p>
      <p>Winch in his excellent treatise states, "Notice that (<u>v</u>
        x <u>B</u>) is not an electrostatic field intensity for it is
        not due to a distribution of charges. We have shown that the
        line integral of electrostatic field intensity around any closed
        path is always zero and there is no exception in this case,
        i.e., the electrostatic field intensity set up by the displaced
        charges integrates to zero around any closed path. (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)
        is due to the motion of the conductor in the magnetic field, and
        an external agency is feeding energy into the system, and a net
        amount of work is done by a charge in moving completely around
        the circuit. Notice also the (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>) does not
        exist in the absence of moving charges, because it is the
        magnetic force on the charges moving with the wire which sets up
        the electric field intensity" (25 ~ Ralph P. Winch: <i>Electricity







          &amp; Magnetism</i>, p. 536; Prentice &amp; Hall, Inc., 1955).
      </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding such pronouncements, the writer has discussed
        the subject with many exponents of relativity theory who are
        quite insistent that all the terms in Equation (4) must be
        considered identical to, and indistinguishable from, an
        electrostatic field. A personal letter from a colleague at our
        National Bureau of Standards also takes this position, as well a
        several Nobel Laureates with whom he has consulted. And this
        stand is taken admittedly by these physicists without a single
        iota of direct experimental evidence with which to support it! </p>
      <p>During the early stages of the work on this project, I called
        on several Nobel Laureates to discuss the worthwhileness of this
        endeavor, one of whom was the distinguished physicist and
        authority in the field of electrodynamics, Enrico Fermi, who had
        delivered a lecture at the 1944 Public Affairs Conference at
        Principia College. Among the questions asked, two will be of
        interest to the reader. (1) "If it were ever discovered that the
        motional electric field v x B/c was unique and not identical to,
        and indistinguishable from, an electrostatic field, would this
        discovery be of any great value to our scientific knowledge?"
        His answer in substance was: It would indeed be of very great
        significance and consequence. (2) "To your knowledge, do you
        know of the existence of any direct experimental evidence which
        confirms the belief that the motional electric field and the
        electrostatic field are identical in nature?" After considerable
        thought, his reply was, "Come to think of it, I can recall of no
        such existent evidence." </p>
      <p>It will now be shown that the relativity equations themselves
        provide a means for obtaining a fuller understanding of the
        physical nature of the terms they contain. It is important to
        observe mathematically that in the general case every term of
        both of these equations (4) and (5) is a function of B where B =
        v/c. By a binomial expansion it can be readily shown that: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ? = [l + (<i>l</i>/2) ?<sup>2</sup> +
        (3/?) ?<sup>4</sup> + …] </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1i.gif" height="32" width="202"></p>
      <p>Substitution in the two right hand terms of Equation (4) yields
      </p>
      <p>(Eq. 7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>E</u><sub>s </sub>= ? = [<i>l</i>
        + (<i>l</i>/2) <i>B</i><sup>2</sup>] <u>E</u> </p>

        have been dropped. </p>
      <p>Equations (7) and (8) represent respectively the electrostatic,
        and the motional electric, field components of the resultant
        electric intensity E' in the reference frame S' moving with
        uniform velocity <u>v</u> with respect to S. If now <u>E</u>
        and <u>B</u> in reference frame S are adjusted so that they are
        both perpendicular to v and to each other and their intensities
        fixed at constant values such that: </p>
      <p>E'<sub>s</sub> -E'<sub>m</sub> = 0 </p>
      <p>Then these two electric field intensities will be equal in
        magnitude and opposite in direction (27 ~ Two large, similar,
        rectangular, parallel, and vertical plates separated by a
        distance <i>d</i> could be oppositely charged and electrically
        isolated in <i>s</i>. Above and below the air space between the
        condenser plates two large circular horizontal Helmholtz coils
        could next be fastened so that when connected in series a
        constant current through them would produce a uniform vertical
        magnetic induction B in the space between the condenser plates.
        Let S' be a frame of reference moving horizontally through this
        space with velocity <u>v</u> at right angles to both <u>E</u>
        and <u>B</u>.) </p>
      <p>A stationary electron in S' will therefore experience no force
        acting upon it because the resultant electric intensity in this
        frame is zero. Most relativists claim that under this situation
        there will be complete cancellation of electric fields. It will
        be observed that <u>E</u>'<sub>s</sub> and <u>E</u>'<sub>m</sub>
        are parabolic and linear functions of <i>B</i> respectively. It
        will at once be evident that although <u>E</u>'<sub>s</sub> and
        <u>E</u>'<sub>m</sub> can be made equal to each other in
        magnitude and opposite in direction for any one reference frame
        S', moving with an assigned value of <u>v</u> and a fixed
        proper adjustment of <u>E</u> and <u>B</u> in frame S, such
        that v = cE/B, nevertheless such equality of <u>E</u>'<sub>s</sub>
        and <u>E</u>'<sub>m</sub> would be possible for only two frames
        at the most, for a straight line can cut a parabola in not more
        than two points. It is thus self-evident that in the general
        case it would not be possible to make these two oppositely
        directed fields continuously equal in more than two possible
        reference frames at the most, by assigning fixed values to <u>E</u>
        and <u>B</u> in S. This is a clear-cut case of the simple
        superposition of two distinct types of fields. If the <u>E</u>'<sub>m</sub>
        term represented an electric field which is identical to and
        indistinguishable from an electrostatic field, then it would
        have to behave like one, which would require that it vary
        parabolically with ? instead of linearly. How could there be
        complete cancellation of fields in a particular frame if there
        is a real difference in their intensities manifest in the
        reference frames having both greater and lesser velocities than
        this particular frame? Surely such a situation calls for fields
        which are distinct and unique, balanced against each other with
        a zero resultant in one (or possibly two) particular frames, but
        not in neighboring frames of reference. </p>
      <p>The (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c term most clearly simulates the
        characteristics of an electrostatic field when it is isolated by
        itself, without the presence of a resultant magnetic induction!
        It is this case which has been mostly responsible for the
        popular belief that the two fields are identical in nature. To
        simplify the picture, let us first assume a vertical uniform
        magnetic induction <u>B</u> in frame S and no electrostatic
        field present. In the reference frame S', moving with uniform
        horizontal velocity <u>v</u>, with respect to S, an observer
        will discover a horizontal electrical field, (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c






        and a vertical magnetic induction B' = <u>B</u> (assuming
        velocities small with respect to c), the path of a free
        electrified particle in frame S' under the action of the two
        fields which are at right angles to each other will be that of a
        cycloid traced on a horizontal plane. The path of the particle
        as seen in frame S would be circular, as previously shown. This
        motion projected on frame S' moving with velocity <u>v</u>, is
        that of a point on the circumference of a circle rolling in a
        horizontal plane along a line in the direction of -<u>v</u>. If
        we now superimpose a uniform magnetic induction <u>B</u>" equal
        in magnitude and opposite in direction to <u>B</u>', in frame
        S', then in this frame we will have only the isolated electric
        field <u>v</u> x <u>B</u>/c, with the resultant vertical
        magnetic induction of zero intensity. Now this electric field
        very greatly simulates that of an electrostatic field, and it is
        readily understandable that many physicists have so interpreted
        it. The path of the particle in this field is now rectilinearly
        in the direction of <u>v</u> x <u>B</u>/c in S', and parabolic
        as seen from S. Furthermore, since the curl and divergence of <u>v</u>
        x <u>B</u>/c in S' are both zero, as they are in the case of a
        uniform electrostatic field, mathematicians can call upon what
        is known as the identity theorem as a proof that the E<sub>m</sub>
        field is identical to an indistinguishable from an electrostatic
        field. This proof amounts to nothing more than saying that the
        dynamic behavior of a charged particle will be the same in both
        fields. In the following chapters we will show experimentally
        that this is not always true. Also analysis shows that a prime
        mover is required for moving the source of B" and supplies
        energy to the particle continuously. </p>
      <p>Let us again analyze this case carefully because of its great
        importance. Kinetic energy is imparted to a free charged
        particle and gives it a velocity v<sub>o</sub> with respect to
        frame S. At the commencement of its motion the particle is at
        rest in frame S', which is moving with the same velocity. It
        appears to an observer in this frame that the particle starts
        from rest and begins to move in the direction of (<u>v</u><sub>o</sub>
        x <u>B</u>)/c. If the magnetic induction is S' is only that due
        to <u>B</u>, then its motion <u>v</u>' with respect to S' will
        produce a new deflecting intensity <u>v</u>' x <u>B</u>'/c in
        frame S' in the direction of -<u>v</u><sub>o</sub>. If, however,
        the equal and opposite magnetic induction <u>B</u>" is
        introduced in this frame, the effect would be to produce another
        deflecting intensity <u>v</u>' x <u>B</u>'/c which would be
        equal and opposite in direction to the intensity <u>v</u>' x <u>B</u>"/c.






        At this point one needs to think carefully. The deflecting
        intensity <u>v</u> x <u>B</u>'/c in S' directed against the
        forward motion of the particle arises by virtue of Lenz's Law.
        The force on the particle due to this intensity will act
        continuously as long as the particle moves at right angles to v<sub>o</sub>.
        To enable the particle to maintain constantly it original
        forward velocity v<sub>o</sub>, the kinetic energy which is
        being channeled at right angles to v<sub>o</sub> must be
        continuously replaced. To do this, work must be done
        continuously upon the magnet giving rise to B" in S', because
        the action of B" on the particle is to assist its forward motion
        with respect to S in exactly the same amount that <u>v</u> x <u>B</u>'/c






        depresses it. Two magnets are involved in this action. (1) The
        magnet giving rise to B' in S' and which is at rest in S. (2)
        The magnet giving rise to B" in S' and which must be
        continuously supplied with energy from a prime mover. </p>
      <p>The particle can thus be made to travel rectilinearly in S', in
        the direction of (<u>v</u><sub>o</sub> x <u>B</u>)/c provided
        energy is continuously given to it via the role played by B".
        This is the situation which appears on first inspection to be
        exactly like an electrostatic field. A free electron originally
        at rest in S' will be accelerated rectilinearly in S' at right
        angles to v<sub>o</sub>. The electron is seemingly without
        contact with any material body, hence the electric field (<u>v</u><sub>o</sub>
        x <u>B</u>)/c appears to be the only source of its steadily
        accumulating kinetic energy. The energy would appear to have
        come from a spatial distribution also as in the electrostatic
        case, since (<u>v</u><sub>o</sub> x <u>B</u>)/c is the only
        electric field present in S', and the resultant magnetic
        induction is zero. This appearance is exceedingly deceptive and
        is the basis of this current false assumption with respect to
        the motional electric field. No prime mover is required in the
        electrostatic case! The energy in this case comes from the field
        itself. </p>
      <p>In the first place, we must remember that an electric field of
        the type (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c cannot of itself impart energy
        to the electron because its line of action is always normal to
        the velocity of the electron with respect to S, and to the
        direction of <u>B</u>. We will remember in one of our previous
        discussions, that this deflecting intensity was shown to channel
        the kinetic energy of the particle down a tube without itself
        imparting energy. The function of the tube actuated by a prime
        mover was to continuously supply to the particle the energy to
        so channel and prevent the particle from taking up a circular
        path in S or a cycloidal path in S'. We now discover that the
        superposition of a magnetic induction B" in S' accomplishes the
        same thing that the tube did. But this accomplishment can only
        be achieved by feeding energy to the particle continuously in
        the forward direction as the tube did and this is done by a
        prime mover acting on the magnet giving rise to B".This magnetic
        induction B" interacts with the magnetic field around the
        charged particle so as to continuously push the particle in the
        forward direction v<sub>o</sub>, thus replacing continuously the
        kinetic energy channeled at right angles by (<u>v</u><sub>o</sub>
        x <u>B</u>)/c and thus keeping the velocity of the particle in
        this forward direction constant, thereby making its path in S'
        one that is wholly at right angles to <u>v</u><sub>o</sub>. A
        prime mover gives kinetic energy to a magnet, and its magnetic
        field pushes on the magnetic field around the particle, and thus
        does work continuously, which in frame S' appears as increasing
        kinetic energy of the rectilinear motion of the charged
        particle. No magnetic field energy is used up in this transfer
        of energy to the particle. The magnetic field of the magnet is a
        physical part of the magnet which pushes against the magnetic
        particle with exactly the same force that the tube did in our
        earlier description. It performs the same function as that of
        the tube. There is no real electric field involved in this
        picture except that around the charged particle, which when
        moving (by Ampere's Law) gives rise to the magnetic field around
        it. Thus the whole action of an isolated (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c






        field on a charged particle, instead of being electrostatic has
        a description which is essentially the direct transfer of
        mechanical kinetic energy from prime movers to the particle. No
        spatially distributed motional electric field energy enters the
        picture of this field. The uniform and relative motion of two
        magnets with equal and oppositely directed fields and the
        presence of an electric charge released with kinetic energy from
        its position of rest in the reference frame of one of the
        magnets produces a combination of pushing and deflecting
        magnetic forces which causes the particle to behave as though it
        were in an electrostatic field. This should not surprise us.
        What should surprise is that physicists should have assumed,
        without direct experimental evidence, that these combined
        magnetic forces could be identical to and indistinguishable from
        an electrostatic field. A monkey and a man are two distinctly
        different agencies (we hope)! They can, however, exert identical
        forces on one and the same object, and if oppositely directed
        hold the object in equilibrium. But surely no one will use such
        an argument as evidence that a monkey is a man, or that a man is
        a monkey! Such, however, appears to be the nature of some
        arguments that (<u>v</u> x <u>B</u>)/c is intrinsically
        electrostatic. Cajori states: "The unscientific physical
        speculations of Aristotle held the world bound within their
        grasp for two thousand years; the unfortunate corpuscular theory
        of Newton controlled scientific thought for over a century" (28
        ~ Florian Cajori: <i>A History of Physics</i>, p. 101,
        Macmillan Co., 1922). </p>
      <p>It has taken over a century to pierce the fog created by the
        assumption of one, and only one, electric field by Maxwell. This
        assumption having served him well in formulating his beautiful
        electromagnetic equations, nevertheless became a prejudice, and
        interfered, more or less, with clear-sighted judgment. </p>

      <p>Three outstanding electric field intensities when added

        ~ Moon &amp; Spencer, op. cit., p. 369). These authors show that
        all possible electric intensities can be exerted by charge Q<sub>1</sub>
        and Q<sub>2</sub> due to (a) constant Q<sub>1</sub>, no relative
        motion, (b) constant Q<sub>1</sub>, uniform relative velocity,
        and (c) constant Q<sub>1</sub>, accelerated motion, when added

      <p>Note that the Coulomb intensity <u>E</u><sub>c</sub> is the
        same in (9) and (10). The motional intensity E<sub>m</sub> and
        the transformer intensity E<sub>t</sub> differ in form but
        represent in each of the two equations the same identical
        accelerating agencies. The outstanding difference between the
        two equations is that with (10), one can calculate electric
        intensities without having to entertain any field concepts,
        electric or magnetic! The authors claim considerable advantages
        for their formulation (10) over that of (9), and show five
        examples, each of which involves difficulties and incorrect
        answers if the classical Maxwell equations are employed
        indiscriminately, but which find correct answers in every
        instance with their formulation (10) (31 ~ P. Moon &amp; D. E.
        Spencer: "On Electromagnetic Induction, <i>J. Franklin Inst.</i>,
        vol. 260, p. 213, 1955). What they do not point out is that when
        the terms of (9) are applied in the same discriminating manner
        with respect to the operational aspects of the problems, as was
        (10), the ambiguities disappear and correct answers are
        forthcoming. </p>
      <p>The Principle of Superposition as applied to fields, states
        that when several fields are superimposed on one another, each
        will act as though the others were absent. The simple addition
        of the separate terms in both (9) and (10), tacitly implies that
        this principle holds true in all cases. This tacit assumption in
        turn stems from the assumption that there is but one electric
        field, and each of the three terms being of this one nature, can
        be superimposed and added vectorially. If there was but one
        electric field in nature, then one would have to admit that the
        simple addition of these terms is scientifically correct. If,
        however, we have several unique electric fields in nature, each
        with its own unique physical properties, then the Principle of
        Superposition as applied to these fields is open to question. To
        illustrate this point, let us consider a case where we have only
        the two uniform E<sub>c</sub> and E<sub>m</sub> fields present,
        superimposed so as to be equal in intensity, parallel, and
        oppositely directed. Equations (9) and (10) then reduce to: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>E</u> = <u>E</u><sub>c</sub> -
        <u>E</u><sub>m</sub> = 0 </p>
      <p>It becomes obvious at once that if there is but one electric
        field in nature, then the resultant field is zero. If, however,
        each of these fields is unique, and a physical experiment can be
        so arranged as to permit only one to act, while the action of
        the other is restricted (due to their unique properties) then,
        in this case, the resultant field will not be zero as required
        by equation (11). If then we can arrange such a unique
        experiment which will pit these two agencies E<sub>c</sub> and E<sub>m</sub>
        against each other equally, we will have a critical means
        whereby experiment alone, not assumption nor dogma, will give us
        a clear cut answer to the question of fields, and the
        application of the Principle of Superposition. It becomes
        obvious that nature alone can give us the answer to the
        questions we have raised. If in such an experiment the equation
        (11) is unambiguously not zero, i.e., if one field can be made
        to act alone, in the presence of the other, then this experiment
        will prove experimentally the spatial existence of unique
        electric fields, one of which is unique by virtue of
        electromagnetic properties not possessed by the other. </p>
      <p>In the next chapter we will describe in detail experiments
        which answer the questions we have raised. </p>

              Electrostatic Shielding</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the first part of this chapter we will deal theoretically
        with the subject of shielding in order that the full
        significance of the experimental work to be described in the
        latter part may be transparent to the reader. </p>
      <p>Among the properties of electric fields, there is no single one
        which more clearly characterizes the uniqueness of the
        electrostatic field, in contrast to the electromagnetically
        induced fields, than the singular behavior of this field with
        respect to shielding. In order that this phenomenon may be
        thoroughly understood, let us first review the electrostatic
        behavior and then contrast this with that of the other two
        electric fields. This behavior has been termed the fundamental
        law of electrostatics first stated by Poisson: </p>
      <p>"The equilibrium distribution of the charges on conductors must
        be such that the force on any particle of electricity in the
        interior of a conductor, whether solid or hollow, is zero, since
        in a conductor electricity can move freely and the existence of
        a force on the particle will cause a flow of electricity. Thus,
        the equilibrium condition requires that all charge resides on
        the outside surfaces and that no charge or electric field
        whatsoever exist in the interior." </p>
      <p>Physicists are well acquainted with the fact that the E<sub>t</sub>
        field, present in transformer coils, caused by a varying
        magnetic induction with time, does not obey this law at low
        frequencies, and only at high frequencies and with heavy
        shielding can this field even approach being effectively
        screened out. Since Poisson's law is a fundamental law, which
        applies to all electrostatic fields, it becomes evident at once
        that the Et electric field cannot and does not qualify as being
        electrostatic in character. This means that the Et electric
        field must be unique in nature. Although most physicists are
        willing to admit that this field, which arises from the growth
        or decay of a magnetic flux with time, is not electrostatic,
        nevertheless they cling tenaciously to the belief that there is
        only one electric field in nature (32 ~ Sleplan, op. cit.).
        Believing that the isolated motional electric field <u>v</u> x
        <u>B</u>/c has been shown mathematically to be electrostatic in
        character because teachers of relativity theory have taught
        this, it is not difficult to stretch the imagination a little
        further to include the E<sub>t</sub> field. We will, however,
        proceed to present direct experimental evidence which confirms
        the claim presented in this thesis that the isolated motional
        electric field is note and cannot be electrostatic in character.
        As we have seen, nevertheless, this field had deceptive aspects
        which cause it to resemble in many ways the electrostatic field.
      </p>
      <p>In order that the case may be transparently understood, let us
        consider a very simple case of relative motion. Let us assume
        that we have an inertial system S which has only a uniform
        downward magnetostatic induction <u>B</u>, and no electrostatic
        field is present. In the inertial system S', which is moving
        with uniform horizontal velocity <u>v</u> with respect to S,

      <p>For convenience, let us think of the system S' as a completely
        closed rectangularly shaped coach, made of aluminum, traveling
        due North with velocity <u>v</u>. Let us think of B as the
        magnetic induction due to the earth's magnetic field (presumed
        vertical). The transformation equations (12) and (13) inform us
        that an observer riding in his car would find a vertical
        magnetostatic induction <u>B</u>', both inside and outside the
        car, which for ordinary speeds would be identical to <u>B</u>.
        This induction would be reduced to zero by building around and
        attached to the car a large Helmholtz coil which would produce
        within and throughout the car an equal but oppositely directed
        induction <u>B</u>". By doing so we isolate the electric field
        <u>E</u>' within the car. An observer would find outside the car
        a uniform electric field <u>E</u>', directed from East to West,
        given by (12). Within the car, however, we know from experience
        that an ordinary electric field intensity probe would register
        zero, or no resultant electric field intensity. According to
        most interpreters of the Special Theory of Relativity, this is
        exactly what should be expected, since they claim ?(v x B)/c is
        identical to, and indistinguishable from, an electrostatic
        field, and it must, therefore, behave similarly with respect to
        shielding. Hence, according to this view, the aluminum coach,
        being a good conductor, has produced within it in accordance
        with the fundamental law of electrostatics a surface
        redistribution of charge which brings about the complete
        cancellation of all electric field within the car so that no
        charge or electric field whatsoever exists inside the exterior
        bounding surface of the car. </p>
      <p>An entirely logical and different conclusion may now be arrived
        at by reasoning based upon our known laws of electromagnetism.
        The car is moving across a magnetic induction <u>B</u> directed
        vertically downward. Therefore every free electron within the
        aluminum shield will experience a force due to the
        electromagnetically induced field ?(<u>v </u>x <u>B</u>)/c
        urging it toward the right hand side of the car. Under the
        influence of this field a redistribution of charge thus takes
        place until an electrostatic field E<sub>s</sub> directed
        horizontally across the inside of the car from the West wall to
        the East wall, equal in intensity and oppositely directed to the
        inducing field is established. When equilibrium is thus
        established, there will be within the car two oppositely
        directed coterminous electric fields, of types E<sub>c</sub> and
        E<sub>m</sub>, in balance such as to produce a zero resultant
        electric intensity. </p>
      <p>The question before us now is, which picture is correct? Can it
        be that E<sub>s</sub> and E<sub>m</sub> are actually identical
        in nature and complete cancellation within the car takes place?
        Experimental evidence must answer this question, and it does,
        clearly and decisively. Before presenting this answer, however,
        it will be of interest to note some of the comments made by
        physicists with respect to this question and the dense fog which
        has surrounded it. A colleague at the National Bureau of
        Standards, giving a view in harmony with most interpreters of
        relativity theory, has, in a letter, written with respect to the
        inside of the shield: </p>
      <p>"If it is assumed that magnetic induction has a certain
        property not in conflict with anything observed experimentally,
        it follows that there are two electric fields which at every
        point are equal and opposite in direction. One of these fields
        results from electromagnetic induction and the other from
        electric charges. </p>
      <p>"If it is assumed that magnetic induction has another property,
        not in conflict with anything observed experimentally, it
        follows that at no point is there an electric field and on no
        element of surface is there an electric charge. Therefore, any
        prediction not in accord with both of these assumptions should
        be considered as lacking an experimental basis. </p>
      <p>Smythe, in commenting upon the problem of measuring ground
        speed in an aircraft by measuring the emf induced in a device by
        translation across the vertical component of the earth's
        magnetic field, states: </p>
      <p>"The question arises as to whether the effect disappears if the
        apparatus is electrically shielded in the airplane. We know that
        the magnetic field will penetrate nonmagnetic metallic
        conductors, but we also know that the induced electromotive
        forces in the shields will set up electric fields tending to
        counteract the fields induced inside." (33 ~ William R. Smythe,
        <i>Static &amp; Dynamic Electricity</i>, p. 500, McGraw-Hill,
        1939) </p>
      <p>Thus, S' finds his airplane in a transverse electric field, (<u>v</u>
        x <u>B</u>)/c. he cannot therefore use any metallic shields
        about his apparatus. </p>
      <p>Here again we have the uncertain popular view among physicists
        as to whether E<sub>s</sub> and E<sub>m</sub> are in this case
        identically equivalent concepts which completely cancel each
        other. We will now show that this does not occur. </p>
      <p><b>The Ironing Board Experiment&nbsp; ~</b> (34 ~ Egbert Jones
        &amp; W. J. Hooper: <i>Physics 401 Project</i>, March 26, 1954,
        Principia College Library) </p>
      <p>This crucial experiment was so named because the apparatus
        resembled somewhat an ironing board on wheels. The object of the
        experiment was to detect and measure the voltage induced in a
        test coil by the motional electric field E<sub>m</sub> while it
        was in a balanced and uncancelled state with an equal and
        oppositely directed electrostatic field E<sub>c</sub>: </p>

      <p>Three electrical circuits were employed, all lying in
        horizontal planes, parallel to a large laboratory lecture table.
        The test circuit consisted of a coil of 100 turns of #27 B&amp;S
        gauge insulated copper wire wound in a groove on the 3/4" edge
        of a plywood form in the approximate shape of an ironing board
        1' x 7' 4", as shown in the scale diagram Figure 4. The
        terminals of this coil were connected to a Leeds &amp; Northrup
        Microvoltmeter which was mounted on the plywood form, which in
        turn was equipped with rubber-tire wheels so that it could be
        pulled at a uniform North-South velocity along the lecture table
        by an electric motor coupled to a reduction gar. The precise
        velocity was calculated with the use of a meter stick and an
        electric timer. Surrounding the forward end of the test coil, a
        second circuit was wound on a plywood extension consisting of a
        single strand of #16 B&amp;S copper wire held at a constant
        two-inch distance from the test circuit, and carried a uniform
        direct current so adjusted that the magnetic flux <u>B</u>"
        surrounding it would exactly cancel out the vertical component <u>B</u>
        of the earth's magnetic field at the location of the test
        circuit. The third circuit was a largely accurately constructed
        Helmholtz coil so mounted in the laboratory and adjusted that
        the trailing end of the test circuit moved horizontally in the
        central region (between the two coils) in which the vertical
        component of the earth's field was completely cancelled. The
        entire test circuit including the microvoltmeter was
        electrostatically shielded. A very heavy coat of aquadag was
        applied over the test coil and the top and bottom of the
        supporting plywood frame. In addition, aluminum foil was wrapped
        around the forward semicircular part of the test coil, and
        finally put over the entire front portion of the apparatus. When
        moved uniformly along the table, the shielded wires of the test
        coil along the two sides of the frame move horizontally in the
        earth's magnetic meridian and therefore cannot cut any flux. The
        trailing edge of the test coil in the central region of the
        Helmholtz coil likewise can cut no flux. The forward end of the
        test coil alone cuts the vertical component of the earth's
        field, and is not at rest with respect to the canceling flux B"
        of the secondary circuit. The shield, with the exception of the
        portion within the Helmholtz coil, likewise cuts the vertical
        component of the earth's magnetic field. We now have a perfect
        set-up with which to test experimentally whether or not the
        uniform isolated motional electric field is equivalent and
        identical to the electrostatic field. The walls of the shield
        have induced in them an emf which drives electrons to the west
        side and leaves a positive charge on the east side of the
        shield. We know that these charges will build up until the
        electrostatic field caused by this separation of charge will be
        everywhere within the shield equal and opposite to the intensity
        of the motional electric field giving rise to it. If they are
        equivalent and identical in nature, they will completely cancel
        each other out and the leading wires of the test coil will be in
        a field-free space. If a voltage is induced in the test coil, it
        will be because these two fields do not cancel each other,
        because they are unique and different in their fundamental
        physical natures. Table II gives the results of 19 different
        velocities which were carefully measured: </p>

      <p>The experimental average value of induced voltage is lower than
        the calculated theoretical average value by only 1.11% and is
        well within the possible experimental error. </p>
      <p>The argument has been advanced that this experiment proves
        nothing since by Faraday's law an emf is induced where there is
        a time rate of change in total flux linking the circuit, and
        this experiment involved such a time rate of change and,
        therefore, the results should have been expected, for it is
        known that shielding is not effective in transformer cases in
        which this law is applicable. This argument is not valid for the
        following reason. We have shown in Chapter 1 that the flux
        linking a closed circuit can be changed in only three possible
        ways: (1) flux cutting, (2) the growth and death of flux as in
        transformer phenomena, (3) special switching arrangements. Items
        (2) and (3) were obviously not involved in this experiment.
        Therefore there can be no appeal to transformer phenomena. The
        flux density B is constant throughout the experiment and
        therefore Maxwell's equation Curl E = ?B/?t, which is his
        interpretation of Faraday's Law, cannot be invoked. The
        experiment is so designed that the only possible seat of induced
        emf would have to be in the aluminum shielded leading wires of
        the test coil. The motional electric field alone is involved. </p>
      <p>A brief account of two other shielding experiments carried out
        in the writer's laboratory to provide interesting qualitative
        demonstration equipment will now be described. </p>
      <p><b>The Trapeze Experiment</b> </p>
      <p>The trapeze bar was made of six one-meter length pieces of soft
        iron pipe telescoped within the other. A single strand of
        insulated and electrostatically shielded wire was threaded
        through the innermost pipe of the bar and fastened at two places
        in the ceiling of the laboratory in such a manner as to permit
        the trapeze to swing horizontally in a North-South direction
        while the supporting wires on each side moved in the magnetic
        meridian and therefore could cut no magnetic flux. The shielded
        wire was connected to a sensitive wall galvanometer which was
        also shielded. Here again we have only the isolated motional
        electric field involved, for it is well known that the iron pipe
        would completely screen out the earth's magnetic field from the
        interior. With this simple apparatus, it ca be readily
        demonstrated that any small horizontal movement of the bar
        causes a deflection of the galvanometer directly proportional to
        its velocity. No measurable magnetic flux exists within the
        innermost pipe, but the electric field <u>V</u>x <u>B</u> is
        present without diminution, and uncancelled by the equal and
        oppositely directed electrostatic field set up by the separation
        of charge in the shield. The wire in the pipe cut the vertical
        component of the earth's magnetic field, but was at rest with
        respect to the bar. The deflections of the wall galvanometer for
        a given speed were identical with or without the iron pipe and
        electrostatic shielding around the wire in the trapeze bar. </p>
      <p><b>The Aluminum Box Experiment</b> </p>
      <p>In this experiment the entire apparatus was contained in a
        closed aluminum box which was moved horizontally in a
        North-South direction on a laboratory table. The test coil was
        rectangular in shape, made up of many turns of fine, flexible,
        insulated copper wire. The North and South sides of the
        rectangular coil were rigidized and supported in the same
        horizontal plane within the box. The South side was fastened to
        the inside South wall of the aluminum box and the terminals of
        the coil were connected to a sensitive portable galvanometer
        also mounted on this wall so that the pointer could be read
        through an opening in the box. The North side of the coil was
        supported in a fixed position by two plastic rods which were
        clamped to fixed vertical support rods on the table, and
        extended horizontally through holes in the aluminum box. The
        flexible East and West sides of the test coil hung in the
        magnetic meridian of the earth's field. Any movement North or
        South of the box thus caused these wires to either sag or become
        taut respectively. The presence of the uncancelled motional
        electric field can be demonstrated to be existent in the test
        coil when the box is completely closed and moved with various
        speed, North or South, across the earth's vertical magnetic
        field component. The deflections of the galvanometer with
        various speeds of the box are identical with those obtained when
        the shielded box is eliminated from the experiment and just the
        south side of the coils and the galvanometer were moved as
        before. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>Let us make a brief summary of what we have thus far presented
        with respect to the motional electric field. Mathematical,
        operational, theoretical and experimental evidence convincingly
        confirm the concept of the motional electric field as physically
        real and distinctly unique. Its magnitude varies with reference
        frames in a manner unlike the electrostatic field. The crux of
        the theoretical argument involving this field amounted to the
        fact that the direct transfer of kinetic energy from a prime
        mover to a charged particle can be logically traced in detail
        and in accordance with known laws, and fully accounts for all
        energy transfer, whereas the conception of motional electric
        field energy existing at all and being distributed spatially, in
        addition to being capable of transfer, is next to impossible.
        The crucial evidence of uniqueness is experimental and it has
        been shown that this field does not obey Poisson's Fundamental
        Law of Electrostatics with respect to shielding. If the magnetic
        field has no physical reality, then when the motional electric
        field was balanced against an equal and opposite electrostatic
        field, the magnitude of the two terms in Equation (5) of the
        "New Electrodynamics" would have been identically equal and
        opposite and their algebraic sum equal to zero. The foregoing
        experimental evidence requires a concept of something real to
        account for the real difference experimentally measured. The
        magnetic field and the motional electric field concepts
        constitute that "something of fundamental physical significance"
        which was intentionally but ill-advisedly omitted in the new
        formulation in terms of particle electrodynamics. </p>
      <p>Upon the foregoing evidence we rest our case that this motional
        field is unequivocally a unique electric field possessing its
        own nature, behavior and properties. We have asked nature a
        question and the reply is clear and unequivocal. Quantitative
        and qualitative experimental evidence such as has been carefully
        obtained in this case always has the last word. It closes the
        door on controversy and opens it wide toward the dawn of new
        horizons. Nature herself has given the answer which, in the
        words of Enrico Fermi, should "indeed be of great significance
        and consequence" to our scientific knowledge. The implications
        and consequences of this discovery will be discussed more fully
        later. They do, however, lead us immediately to the necessity
        for making inquiry into the basic nature of the analogous
        motional <u>V</u> x <u>E</u>/c magnetic field. This we will do
        in the next chapter. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The classical belief that nature has provide us with one and
        only one magnetic field has so befuddled reason that physicists
        have sought to eliminate the magnetic field concept entirely. To
        illustrate the ambiguity, the magnetic field arising from two
        operationally different sources will be described. The
        impossibility of these two fields beings identically the same
        becomes apparent upon comparison: </p>
      <p>(1) The magnetic flux arising from the steady flow of
        electricity in a solenoid can be measured in intensity and in
        spatial energy content at any point in the surrounding space by
        an observer, either at rest or in motion with respect to the
        solenoid. </p>
      <p>(2) The second source can best be described by a quotation from
        Sir Arthur Eddington: </p>
      <p>"Consider an electrically charged body at rest on the earth.
        Since it is at rest, it gives an electric field, but no magnetic
        field. But for the nebular physicist it is a charged body moving
        at 1000 miles a second. A moving charge constitutes an electric
        current which in accordance with the laws of electrodynamics
        gives rise to a magnetic field. How can the same body both give
        and not give rise to a magnetic field? On the classical theory
        we would have to explain one of these results as an illusion. On
        the relativity theory, both results are accepted, magnetic
        fields are relative." (35 ~ A.S. Eddington: <i>The Nature of
          the Physical World</i>, p. 22, Macmillan Co., 1929) </p>
      <p>The magnetic field arising from the solenoid is obviously born
        by the cooperative relative motion between unlike electric
        charges, such as the flow of negative electrons past the
        positively charged atoms in a copper wire. This type of
        magnetostatic field intensity is given the symbol <u>H</u><sub>s</sub>
        and is identified in Maxwell's equations by Curl <u>H</u><sub>s</sub>
        = <u>J</u> where <u>J</u> is the current density. <u>B</u> =
        mu <u>H</u><sub>s</sub>. Mu&nbsp; is the permeability (mks
        units). </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1m.gif" height="28" width="227"></p>
      <p>The second type identify by the symbol <u>H</u><sub>m</sub>
        and arises wholly from relative motion v with respect to
        electric charges. This intensity <u>H</u><sub>m</sub> = <u>V</u>
        x <u>D</u><sub>c</sub> = <i>E</i><u>V</u> x <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>
        (mks units) where <i>E</i> [Epsilon] is the permitivity, and <u>D</u><sub>c</sub>
        = <i>E</i><u>E</u><sub>c.</sub> </p>
      <p>That the two magnetic fields <u>H</u><sub>s</sub> and <u>H</u><sub>m</sub>
        cannot possibly be identical in nature is proved mathematically
        as in the case of the <u>E</u><sub>c</sub> and the <u>E</u><sub>m</sub>
        electric fields. The general mathematical expression for these
        two fields are obtained from the Einstein transformation
        equation (5) in free space where B = H in absolute gaussian
        (cgs) units as follows: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 14) <u>H</u>'<sub>s</sub> = <u>B</u>'<sub>s</sub> = ?<u>H</u><sub>s</sub>
      </p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p>(Eq. 15) <u>H</u>'<sub>m</sub> = <u>B</u>'<sub>m</sub> = ?<u>V</u>
        x <u>E</u><sub>c</sub> </p>
      <p>where ? = 1/?<i>l</i> - (v/c)<sup>2</sup> and c = 3 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec. </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1n.gif" height="101" width="419"></p>
      <p>Inspection shows that if the two magnetic fields <u>H</u>'<sub>s
        </sub>= ?<u>H</u><sub>s<img src="0eq1o.gif" height="24"
            width="67"></sub> and <u>H</u>'<sub>m</sub> = ?<u>V</u> x <u>E</u><sub>c<img
            src="0eq1p.gif" height="30" width="103"></sub> were parallel
        and balanced against each other, for constant values of <u>E</u><sub>s</sub>
        and <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>, there is one and only one possible
        value of v for which these two fields would have the same
        numerical value. In other words, if they were balanced against
        each other in one reference frame, they would immediately be out
        of balance and could not possibly cancel each other in any other
        frame of reference. Hence they cannot possibly be the same kinds
        of magnetic field, because they behave differently with change
        in reference frames. </p>
      <p>Because <u>H</u><sub>m</sub> = <u>V</u> x <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>
        is a magnetic vector directed at right angles both to <u>V</u>
        and <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>, the electric field <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>
        can do no work, since any displacement of a magnetic particle
        will be a deflection at right angles to this field. The <u>H</u><sub>s</sub>
        magnetic field, however, can impart energy directly to a
        magnetic particle from its field energy. </p>
      <p>The two types of magnetic fields described above have such
        obvious dissimilarities that the only possibility of a
        consistent satisfying picture of them is obtained by the
        application of Bridgman's Operational Viewpoint. When this is
        done we see these fields as unique. The first type <u>H</u><sub>s</sub>
        is analogous to the Coulomb electrical field <u>E</u><sub>c</sub>
        in that it has physical reality, and has a spatial distribution
        of magnetic energy ?H<sup>2</sup>/8? ergs/cm<sup>3&nbsp;<img
            src="0eq1q.gif" height="30" width="106"></sup>. The motional
        magnetic field <u>H</u><sub>m</sub> is analogous to the <u>E</u><sub>m</sub>
        field in that it too disappears when there is no relative
        velocity. </p>
      <p>The intimate relationship and unity between electricity and
        magnetism is seen in these two fields. The motional electric
        field can be described as a magnetic deflection phenomenon
        produced on moving charges, and the motional magnetic field can
        be viewed as an electric field deflection which will act on
        moving magnetic poles. </p>
      <p>One of the thrills of this research project was predicted by
        Bridgman when he wrote, "In this self-conscious search for
        phenomena which increase the number of operationally independent
        concepts, we may expect to find a powerful systematic method
        directing the discovery of new and essentially important
        physical facts." (36 ~ ibid., p.224) </p>
      <p>It is worth our while to note that we have six such unique
        field concepts shown on page 11 instead of the classical two, or
        the modern particle dynamics with none! These new field concepts
        when understood in connection with the equations of modern
        electrodynamics completely eliminate the paradoxes and
        ambiguities which have plagued this subject for years and
        explain electromagnetic induction which particle electrodynamics
        cannot handle. Most of all, they open up new horizons for the
        unification of the three great fields of electricity, magnetism
        and gravitation </p>

      <p>"In the limited nature of the mathematically existent simple
        fields and the simple equations possible between them, lies the
        theorists' hope of grasping the real in all its depths." (37 ~
        Albert Einstein: <i>Essays in Science</i>, p. 110;
        Philosophical Library, NY, 1934) </p>
      <p>"It may well be that the approach of a new theory cannot begin
        until the mathematical nature of the old ones is clearly
        understood." (38 ~ Freeman J. Dyson: <i>Scientific American</i>,
        September 1958) </p>
      <p>In the previous chapter we have shown how Bridgman's
        Operational Viewpoint applied to our "existent simple fields and
        the simple equations possible between them" has enabled us to
        gain an understanding of "the mathematical nature of the old"
        classical equations of electrodynamics which were beset with
        limitations, ambiguities, and paradoxes. </p>
      <p>In order to obtain correct answers to our problems, it has been
        taught us that they must be analyzed operationally (40 ~ This
        becomes self-evident to anyone who will review the publications
        already cited, referring to Cohn, and to Moon and Spencer) to
        determine the particular types of fields that are involved, and
        the particular formulae among the six field types available must
        be selected and employed for the solution. The properties of
        each field type must be taken into consideration in working out
        problems. This clarified, straightforward procedure, working
        with unique field types, affords present possibilities that were
        not available to Einstein, due to mental doors which were
        closed. </p>
      <p>It was without question Professor Einstein's life ambition to
        find the link between the gravitational field and the phenomena
        of electricity and magnetism. The reason for his failure appears
        now to be transparent in the light of this thesis. Most
        interpreters of his special theory, including Einstein himself,
        recognize the existence of but one electric field, in spite of
        the fact that Sir James Jeans has pointed out that such an
        interpretation of the terms in the transformation equation of
        his theory is not required by the postulates of the theory
        itself. (41 ~ J. H. Jeans: <i>The Mathematical Theory of
          Electricity &amp; Magnetism</i>, p. 606, Cambridge Univ.
        Press, 1923) </p>
      <p>In the English translation of his volume, <i>Mein Weltbild</i>,
        Einstein makes several very pertinent remarks which bear upon
        this thesis: </p>
      <p>"It would of course be a great step forward if we succeeded in
        combining the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field
        into a single structure. Only so could the era in theoretical
        physics inaugurated by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell be brought to a
        satisfactory close." (42 ~ Albert Einstein: <i>Essays in
          Science</i>, p. 19; Philosophical Library, NY, 1934) </p>
      <p>In this chapter we deal with one of the "simple fields" which
        has been known for years and universally employed in the
        generators of our electrical power plants, the unique nature of
        which has been unrecognized and its usefulness only partly
        exploited. </p>
      <p>The greatest hurdle to be overcome in attempting to link
        gravitational force with any of the other known field forces of
        nature, is that property of gravity which enables it to act
        without apparent diminution in and throughout all kinds and
        combinations of matter. Insofar as we are aware there is no kind
        of matter which acts as an effective reflector or absorber of
        this force. </p>
      <p>Let us now review the results of the experiments described in
        Chapter 3, the Ironing Board Experiment, the Trapeze Experiment,
        and the Aluminum Box Experiment. In all of these experiments the
        motional <u>V</u> x <u>B</u> suffered no diminution by virtue
        of the kinds of electrostatic shielding employed (i.e., iron,
        aluminum, brass, aquadag). We knew with certainty where the seat
        of action of the induced motional electric field was localized
        in these experiments. The behavior of this field in these
        experiments, therefore, has aspects which are exactly similar to
        gravity. Even when the resultant B itself is reduced to zero, <u>V</u>x<u>B</u>
        exists unaltered! No other force exists, to our knowledge, with
        such an unalterable and penetrating nature except that of
        gravity! </p>
      <p>With the experimental evidence of the fact that the <u>V</u> x
        <u>B</u> field can in no instance be shielded from a region of
        space by a conducting shell and that it does not possess the
        properties of an electrostatic field, as has been tacitly
        assumed by theoretical physicists without experimental evidence
        to support it, we are brought face to face with the fact that
        this <u>V</u> x <u>B</u> field is really something entirely
        different than it has been hitherto thought to be, in spite of
        the fact that it is the generating field so active in our
        electrical power plants. Indeed it will be shown that this field
        should behave in a manner that is identical to gravity. </p>
      <p>Let us remember that this VxB field is an electric field, that
        is, it will exert a force on, and will cause the acceleration of
        electric charges. In this respect it is similar to an
        electrostatic field. But an electrically neutral conductor
        places in a VxB field is acted upon differently than when it is
        places in an electrostatic field. In the latter field only an
        outside surface redistribution of charge and field take place
        whereas in a VxB field the neutral conductor experiences an
        internal redistribution of charge throughout its entire interior
        with two types of electric fields existent within the interior,
        balanced against each other in the equilibrium state. This state
        of affairs has been experimentally verified in the writer's
        laboratory and this evidence is the crucial blow which
        overthrows the popular view that the VxB field is electrostatic
        in nature. In the electrostatic case the field is entirely on
        the outside of the conductor, whereas in the VxB case, this
        field exists both within and without the conductor. </p>
      <p>Within a conducting enclosure which is placed in an
        electrostatic field, this field is well known to be
        self-cancelled, whereas when placed in a motional electric
        field, this field gives rise to what has been thought to be a
        canceling electrostatic field equal in magnitude and oppositely
        directed, but contrary to popular belief this motional electric
        field is uncancelled by this induced electrostatic field and
        remains undiminished in intensity and in balance with it. This
        immunity to cancellation by shielding is the property which it
        has in common with gravity. </p>
      <p>It is the penetrating property of the <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field which qualifies it to play the role of a gravitational
        field (43 ~ The term <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> is use when one
        refers to a source which causes a magnetic flux <u>B</u> to
        move with a velocity <u>V</u> as would be the case when the
        field originates in atoms of matter. Mathematically, <u>V</u> x
        <u>B</u> = -<u>B</u> x <u>V</u>). This field can reach to every
        part of atomic structure and in and throughout the nucleus.
        Magnetic shielding cannot prevent it because <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        exists, regardless of the presence of a resultant <u>B</u>,
        which may or may not be zero. It seems incredible that this
        penetrating nature was discovered even in the days of Faraday
        and yet so little attention has been given to it. </p>
      <p>In describing the work of Faraday on electromagnetic induction,
        Maxwell stated that the intensity of the induced electric field
        "is entirely independent of the nature of the substance of the
        conductor in which it acts" (44 ~ Clerk Maxwell: <i>Electricity
          &amp; Magnetism</i>, vol. 11, p. 181). This was also later
        found to be true for dielectric substances as well as
        conductors. </p>
      <p>Matter, as we know it, consists of electrons, protons and
        neutrons. The actual nature of the neutron is not known with
        certainty. This we do know, that a neutron does emit a beta
        particle, an electron. We also know that a proton can by
        electron capture turn into a neutron. While the present tendency
        is against the belief that the neutron consists of a proton and
        an electron in close bond, this thesis assumes that it does have
        an internal structure composed of opposite electrical charges.
        We so know that it has a magnetic moment. If magnetism is due to
        charges in motion, then we cannot be far wrong in this
        assumption. Electrons and protons also have magnetic moments. In
        other words, each of the elementary particles which make up
        ordinary matter has associated with it a magnetic moment,
        electric charge, or charges. In the experiments of Stern and
        Gerlach, magnetic moments were measured by causing a beam of
        particles to pass through a wedge-shaped magnetic field which
        deflected them. </p>
      <p>Let us consider a solid cylindrical bar magnet of circular
        cross section rapidly rotated about its longitudinal axis. While
        it is well known that in this case the magnetic field does not
        rotate with the magnet, let us assume for convenience that it
        does rotate with the magnet. If the axis of this magnet is
        vertical with the North pole uppermost, then in the equatorial
        plane midway between the poles of the magnet we will have a
        magnetic field everywhere directed vertically downward, and the
        motion of this field will be toward the observer on one side and
        away from the observer on the other side of the magnet. In this
        equatorial plane there will also be a radial horizontal <u>B</u>x<u>V</u>
        electric field. This field will be convergent or divergent
        depending on the direction of rotation of the magnet. </p>
      <p>Let us consider what would happen if an atom of any kind of
        matter is placed in a convergent or divergent <u>B</u>x<u>V</u>
        electric field. The planetary electrons will all experience a
        force which will shift their orbits slightly, say away from the
        axis, whereas the nucleus would be pulled toward it. There will
        be a very small differential in the magnitude of these two
        forces due to the slight shift in the position of the center of
        mass of the electrons with respect to the position of the
        nucleus. In this case, the push on the electrons will be less
        than the pull on the nucleus. The net effect of this will be a
        small attractive force which will tend to move the atom toward
        the axis of the magnet. Even a single neutron placed in a
        convergent <u>B</u>x<u>V</u> electric field might experience
        this attractive force if its constituents are oppositely charged
        attractive particles. Such a field might be employed to
        investigate the composition of the neutron! <u>The crux of this
          paper is that it proposes that gravitational force is none
          other than the difference between the pull and the push of a
          convergent or divergent BxV electric field acting on the
          electrical constituents of atoms.</u> </p>
      <p>The consequences of this proposal would mean that the
        phenomenon of mass is independent of weight. An electron alone
        in such a field might be repelled while a proton would be
        attracted. This is a staggering thought, but we know of a
        certainty that an electron or a proton by itself actually has
        weight? Might not the negative charge which the earth is known
        to possess be due to a radical convergent <u>B</u>x<u>V</u>
        field emanating from the atoms composing the earth? If all
        neutral matter consists of equal numbers of oppositely charged
        electrical particles then the total mass of a body would be
        proportional to the total charge of one sign contained within
        it. <u>It is here proposed that the earth's gravitational field
          might well be a convergent BxV field</u>. We know that such a
        radial field is uniquely qualified to penetrate all space
        occupied by matter and produce a differential attractive force
        toward the earth's center of gravity by separating elementary
        charges of opposite sign only a trifle from their normal mean
        positions and thus making the pulling force on the positive
        charges slightly greater than the pushing force on the negative
        charges. </p>
      <p>Each of the elementary particles of which all matter is
        composed is also an elementary magnet. The atom of today is a
        dynamic model. Each of these magnets has motion of some kind ---
        orbital, vibrational, precessional. In addition to possessing a
        magnetic moment due to spin, planetary electrons orbiting nuclei
        generate magnetic fields. These motions of the elementary
        magnets produce <u>B</u>x<u>V</u> fields which extend into
        space outside the atom. Nowhere in modern theory is an account
        given of these super-imposed <u>B</u>x<u>V</u> fields emanating
        from all matter. On might think that in ordinary nonmagnetic
        matter they would all cancel out since this is what happens with
        the magnetic fields in such matter. The electrons are paired in
        the various energy shells (of most atoms) in such a way as to
        effect this cancellation of magnetic fields outside the atom.
        Theory shows that if two such paired planetary electrons revolve
        in opposite directions, one clockwise and the other
        counter-clockwise, their magnetic fields due to spin at a point
        outside the atom can cancel each other out and that their <u>B</u>x<u>V</u>
        fields can constructively reinforce each other. The capital
        theoretical discovery, however, comes from a study of the
        magnetic field generated by the orbital motion of the planetary
        electrons. The negative electron, revolving about a positive
        nucleus, clockwise or counter-clockwise, gives rise to a <u>B</u>x<u>V</u>
        field which is, in either case, always directed radially inward
        toward the nucleus from points outside of atoms. The magnetic
        fields of two such oppositely revolving electrons will cancel,
        but the <u>B</u>x<u>V</u> fields reinforce each other. That
        these fields are directed radially inward makes it possible for
        them to account for the known drift of positive ions in the
        atmosphere down toward the earth and the opposite movement of
        negative ions upward. Because of its promising potentialities
        let us now take up an analysis of the magnetic field and
        motional electric field arising from orbiting planetary
        electrons. </p>
      <p>Let us take for our model the simplest possible example, the
        Bohr Hydrogen Atom. Consider the nuclear proton at rest and the
        negative electron as revolving in a circular orbit of radius r<sub>o</sub>
        about it with angular velocity <i>v</i>. The Ampere-Biot-Savart
        expression for the magnetic field B generated about a charge <i>q</i>
        moving with velocity <i>v</i> is in mks units: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 16) <u>B</u> = q <u>v</u> x <u>r</u>/r3 </p>
      <p>where <u>r</u> is the radius vector from q to a point P where
        <u>B</u> is measured. If the electronic charge -q is moving
        through free space without association with neighboring charges
        then we know that <u>B</u> appears as a motional magnetic field
        due to relative velocity of the electric field of the charge
        with respect to the observer at P. In this case, if the observer
        moves with the same velocity v as the charge, then the magnetic
        field at P disappears. On the other hand, if -q is moving in a
        linear conductor with relative velocity v, then an observer at
        the point P will observe a magnetic energy field <u>B</u>,
        whether or not he is stationary or moving. The actual value of <u>B</u>
        will of course be altered if the observer takes on relativistic
        velocities. But <u>B</u> will be observed in any frame of
        reference moving through, or stationary at, the point P. We now
        inquire with regard to the status of <u>B</u> at a point P when
        the planetary electron is revolving about the proton in a Bohr
        atom. Since we know this field is generated by cooperative
        action with the positive nucleus and that planetary electrons in
        magnets contribute components of orbital magnetic moment, we
        know that <u>B</u> must be an energy type magnetic field. The
        Ampere-Biot-Savant formula requires that at any instant the
        maximum values of B will be found at points along a rotating
        radius vector drawn from the proton through -q to the point.
        This means that the magnetic field energy of B is moving in a
        concentric orbit with the electron, with a tangential velocity V
        = (r<sub>o</sub> + r)w at any point a distance r from -q. If the
        magnetic field which the electron carries about it as it
        revolves in its orbit were of the motional magnetic field type <u>E</u><sub>s</sub>
        x <u>V</u> generated solely by the relative motion of a single
        electric charge and an observer, then one could hardly impute
        motion to it. However, in this case we know the magnetic energy
        is itself a physical reality by virtue of its known type. This
        toroidal-like band of energy obviously holds a fixed relative
        position with respect to the orbiting electron, and hence moves
        with it. </p>
      <p>This moving magnetic field, we know, will in turn give rise to
        a motional electric field <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>. This is
        illustrated in the accompanying Figure 5. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 5</b> </p>
      <center><img src="0fig5.gif" height="240" width="169"></center>
      <p>When the electron has a counter-clockwise motion in its orbit,
        it will give rise to a <u>B</u> at point P which will be
        directed up out of the page. <u>V</u> will have the same
        direction as <u>v</u>, and <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> will be
        directed radially inward toward the proton. We will call this a
        convergent motional electric field. Let us now calculate the
        value of this field at any point P on the radius vector from the
        nucleus through -q when the electron is the upper part of its
        orbit. </p>

      <p>(Eq. 17)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E<sub>m</sub> = -qr<sub>o</sub>w<sup>2</sup>/r
approximately







      </p>
      <p>We note that as the electron swings through the upper half of
        its orbit a motional electric pulse directed toward the nuclear
        proton with a maximum intensity varying inversely as the
        distance from the electron should be present at point P. As it
        continues to swing through the lower part of its orbit it is at
        this time not clear just what effect will be present at P. Our
        knowledge of the structure of the fundamental particles is so
        small that we cannot say whether or not the electric field about
        the proton itself will rotate about it as the electron revolves
        in its orbit. The electron is the particle in motion and there
        appears to be good reason to believe that the magnetic flux
        generated around it will be confined, on one side mostly between
        the electron and the proton, and on the other side of the
        electron out into space with its maximum intensity lying in the
        electron's equatorial plane at right angles to its orbital
        velocity. This is clearly not the equivalent of the effect due
        to a continuous current flowing in a conducting circular loop.
        In this latter case one would have a magnetic dipole at any
        instant in time, whereas in the case of a single electron we are
        dealing at each instant in time with circular loops of flux,
        without poles, with the electron located eccentrically within
        the circles. </p>
      <p>Let us digress at this point and consider another phenomenon to
        which we should give some attention. An electron has spin, and
        is itself a small magnetic flux emanating from it. Out
        experimental knowledge regarding the behavior of magnetic fields
        with respect to rotation about axes of magnetic symmetry is such
        that we can state with considerable certainty that the magnetic
        field of the spinning electron should undergo a motion of
        translation only, as its axis revolves in the electron orbit.
        This means that at the point P in Figure 6, the magnetic flux
        due to the electron will partake simultaneously of two
        superimposed linear simple harmonic motions, one toward and away
        from the atomic nucleus and the other at right angles to this
        direction. As the magnetic flux moves across the point with
        these two motions, two component motional electric fields will
        be induced there. The motion of flux toward and away from the
        proton will induce an alternating electric field which will
        always be at right angles to the line d. The motion of flux at
        right angles to this line will likewise induce an alternating
        electric field which will always be directed along this line but
        will have a greater intensity in one direction than the other.
        The vector resultant of the motional electric field E at the
        point P will be a variable vector, rotating counter-clockwise
        with angular velocity v and it will trace out a pear-shaped
        figure with the major axis directed along the line d. The point
        P is near the top of the figure farthest removed from the atom.

      <p>Our analysis thus far has led us to two quite dissimilar
        motional electric field which should be found emanating from all
        matter. The first one we found arises from the rotary movement
        of the magnetic flux which forms around the planetary electrons
        in their orbital travel. The second arose by virtue of the
        translational motion of the magnetic flux of the spinning
        electrons as they revolve in their orbits. The first effect
        generates a radial electric intensity which varies inversely as
        the distance from the planetary electron. The second effect
        varies inversely as the cube of the distance. We shall now show
        that the first effect could very well be the agency giving rise
        to gravitational attraction, whereas the second effect would
        produce a very short range attractive field varying inversely as
        the fourth power of the distance, which obviously disqualifies
        it for the role of gravity, although it may prove to have some
        utility otherwise, as we shall see. </p>
      <p>As stated earlier in this text, any material object placed in a
        convergent motional electric field should experience a force
        tending to move it into a more intense region of the field. When
        placed in the field, the body becomes electrically polarized and
        a very small separation of charge distribution should take place
        in every atom of the body. The charge nearest to the more
        intense region of the field will experience a pull which will be
        slightly greater than the push on the charge which is more
        remote, hence the resultant attractive force. Let us calculate
        this force in the case of the motional electric field generated
        by the electron as it orbits around the nucleus of an atom. </p>
      <p>Returning to Figure 5, let us imagine that another hydrogen
        atom is placed at point P. Every time the electron swings around
        in its orbit at a frequency of 6.8 x 10<sup>15</sup> rev/sec,
        the atom at P finds itself momentarily enveloped in a convergent
        <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> field. The positive nucleus will experience
        a pull toward the attracting atom while the electron will
        experience a push away from it. The field E<sub>m</sub> at the
        point P is given by equation (17). A charge Q placed in an
        electric field E<sub>m</sub> experiences a force <u>F</u> given
        by: </p>
      <p><u>F</u> = Q<u>E</u><sub>m</sub> </p>
      <p>Differentiating this equation with respect to r in order to
        obtain the difference between the pull and the push, we have: </p>
      <p>dF/dr = Q (dE<sub>m</sub>/dr) </p>
      <p>Hence, if the difference dF causes a small separation dr of
        change in the mean distance between the proton and electron in
        the attracted atom, we have: </p>
      <p>dF = Q(dE<sub>m</sub>/dr)dr </p>
      <p>Differentiating (17) with respect to r, to obtain dE<sub>m</sub>/dr
and







        inserting this in (19) and solving for ?F, which is the
        difference between the pull and the push, we have: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?F = Qqr<sub>o</sub>w<sup>2</sup>
        ?F/r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1t.gif" height="31" width="160"></p>
      <p>It is important to understand just what equation (20)
        represents. The motional electric field intensity E<sub>m</sub>
        given by equation (17) represents a radially convergent field.
        The intensity of the field decreases inversely as the distance <i>r</i>.
        When an H atom is placed in this field the positive proton is
        attracted toward the source of the field while the electron is
        repelled. If a separation of the center of charges takes place
        (polarization), i.e., if the proton moves slightly toward the
        source and the center of the deformed, somewhat elliptical,
        electron orbit shifts slightly away from the proton, so that
        these two centers are separated by a distance delta <i>r</i>,
        equation (20) expresses how much greater the pull on the proton
        will be than the effective push on the electron in its new
        orbit. This we call the gravitational force since it is an
        attractive force which pulls the H atom toward the source if it
        is free to move. We assume that it is not completely free to
        move but is restrained by elastic forces, somewhat equivalent to
        that of a spring. When the attracted atomic system is moved a
        distance delta <i>r'</i> by delta F, work is done. If we assume
        that delta <i>r</i>' is directly proportional to delta <i>r</i>,
        we then have for the work: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 21)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?W = ?F ? ?r' = L-Qqr<sub>o</sub>w<sup>2</sup>
        ?r<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1u.gif" height="25" width="273"></p>
      <p>Since there are approximately 10<sup>15</sup> simultaneous
        pulls and pushes delta P each second which as a function of time
        would be approximately sinusoidal it should give rise to a high
        frequency vibratory motion which should be approximately simple
        harmonic in character. The polarization displacement delta <i>r</i>
        produced by the field E<sub>m</sub> should be directly
        proportional to its intensity. Let us assume that upon release
        from the pull of a single pulse the H atom would be pulled back
        to its original position with an elastic force negatively
        proportional to the displacement delta <i>r</i>'. We have
        therefore laid the foundation for a simple harmonic vibratory
        motion of the atom: </p>

      </p>

      <p>where the k values are all constants. Equation (23) in (21)
        gives: </p>

      </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1w.gif" height="23" width="353"></p>
      <p>and since Q = q in the H atom: </p>

      <p>For this type of motion we know that the maximum amplitude
        would be proportional to the square root of the total energy
        (25). If the maximum amplitude is proportional to the maximum
        value of ?F then we have: </p>

      <p>which is Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. </p>
      <p>The foregoing derivation is obviously a very elementary and
        non-rigorous attempt by the author to indicate how two hydrogen
        atoms could conceivably attract each other by means of their
        motional electric fields giving rise to Newton's Universal Law
        of Gravity. We teach that two such atoms do attract each other
        according to this law. It seems reasonable therefore to expect
        that such a derivation as is here suggested cannot be too far
        from representing the electromagnetic basis behind the
        phenomenon. </p>
      <p>A motional electric field is an electric field because it acts
        with force on electric charges. The essential ingredients of
        this field consist of a magnetic field, a charge of electricity
        and relative motion between them. It is preeminently an
        electromagnetic field. We have theoretically seen just how this
        field could very well be the vital agency which produces the
        attractive force we call gravity. We have also presented
        experimental evidence that this field possesses in common with
        gravity its chief property of being immune to shielding. Whether
        or not this field will ultimately be identified with gravity
        remains to be shown experimentally. We have made a closely
        reasoned approach to what may ultimately prove to be the missing
        link in a unified theory between the three great forces of
        nature, electricity and magnetism on the one hand and gravity on
        the other. </p>
      <p>We have shown theoretically that two electromagnetic fields
        should emanate from all atoms, the intensity of one varying
        inversely with the distance and the other inversely as the cube
        of the distance. While these fields radiate or extend into space
        surrounding material atoms, there is no experimental evidence
        extent that these fields transmit energy by means of quanta or
        ions. These fields, therefore, cannot properly be defined as
        radiant energy any more than one can think of the motional
        electric field in an alternating current generator as a form of
        radiant energy. The modus operandi of these two fields is one of
        electromagnetic induction even as it is in our electric
        generators and motors. Persuasive and excellent reasons exist to
        predict that these two fields, emanating from the earth, might
        prove to be the source of free electric power, in a measure
        exceeding our present comprehension. A properly designed
        ultra-high frequency receiving circuit incorporating a
        transistor valve should by electromagnetic energy of induction
        not only detect but transform and convert to usable form the
        kinetic energy of planetary electrons in the atoms comprising
        the earth. This would be atomic energy in its most usable and
        nonpoisonous form. Through the medium of the motional electric
        field emanating from atoms, both gravitational dominion and free
        electrical power would seem to be within the possible grasp of
        our age. </p>
      <p>High-sounding and speculative as the previous paragraph may
        sound, we have considerable evidence in support of it. In 1933
        at the age of 77, Nikola Tesla predicted essentially what has
        just been stated: </p>
      <p>"Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by
        power obtainable at any point in the universe. Is this energy
        static or kinetic? If static, our hopes are in vain; if kinetic,
        and we know this for certain, then it is a mere question of time
        when man will succeed in attaching his machinery to the very
        Wheel-Work of nature." </p>
      <p>At this point in our thesis, a recent statement by a
        contemporary scientist seems most timely and fitting: </p>
      <p>"When the great innovation appears, it will almost certainly be
        in a muddled, incomplete, and confusing form. To the discoverer
        himself, it will be only half-understood; to everybody else, it
        will be a mystery. For any speculation which does not at first
        glance look crazy, there is no hope." (45 ~ Freeman Dyson: <i>Scientific






          American</i>, September 1958). </p>
      <p>For many years the writer has known of the somewhat obscure
        research activities of Mr. T. Henry Moray. His claims, which
        appear to have been well documented, of having invented a device
        which would capture cosmic radiant energy continuously, to the
        extent of 50 kw, sounded almost crazy upon first reading. His
        research work on this device extends back into the period around
        1926. An account of his work has been written up in several
        pamphlets (46 ~ T. H. Moray: <i>The Sea of Energy in which the
          Earth Floats</i>; see also: "A Revolutionary Invention",
        published by himself, SLC, UT). The work of Mr. Moray is of
        vital interest to this thesis, especially in view of the
        comments made by Dr. Carl Eyring (in 1925, then head of the
        Department of Physics of Brigham Young University) who, after
        examining and studying the device in operation, could come to no
        other conclusion but that the electrical energy was obtained (at
        least in part) from field energy generated "in the earth itself"
        (47 ~ <i>ibid.</i>, p. 144-145). While not then understood,
        this conclusion of Dr. Eyring made so many years ago is now of
        capital interest. </p>
      <p>Not understanding the nature of the source and form of the
        energy his device absorbed, and his consequent inability to
        explain in understandable its operation in patent applications,
        and his fear of losing patent rights and a fortune, have cost
        this man much disappointment and frustration resulting in
        virtually isolating him and his device from contact with those
        who could have been of great help. It would appear on the
        surface of things that Moray may well have tapped, without
        knowing it, either one or both of the energy sources which have
        been described and mathematically predicted as originating from
        the atoms composing the earth. </p>

      <p>The thrilling thing about this research project is the
        potential possibilities it presents, for overcoming that which
        keeps us down, and for providing us with free electrical power!
        These two possibilities, levitation and electric power appear to
        be practical when the experimental and engineering work of
        making an electronic generator of, and a receiver for, the
        ultra-high frequency direct pulsating motional electric fields
        such as are emanating from the atoms in the earth. Every piece
        of matter on the earth is of course such a very weak generator
        and receiver. What is needed in this project is something
        somewhat analogous to what lasers have provided for radiant
        energy in the form of an intense beam of concentrated coherent
        light. Such a generator of artificially produced gravitational
        waves could make anti-gravity possible. Fastened to, and
        directly above a space platform, such a generator with its <u>B</u>
        x <u>V</u> field acting in the opposite direction to the
        earth's <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> gravity field on the already
        polarized atoms in the platform would proceed to depolarize them
        and release them from the earth's gravitational pull. A space
        vehicle en route to the moon passes through such a depolarized
        state as the gravitational attraction of the moon on it
        gradually becomes equal to and oppositely directed to the
        earth's gravity field. If sufficiently intense, the <u>B</u> x
        <u>V</u> field form a generator might conceivably completely
        depolarize a space platform and make it weightless. Further
        intense action by the generator might conceivable repolarize it
        in a reverse direction. This would cause the earth's field to
        then act antigravitationally upward on the platform, and with
        controlled speed, carry it upward with not only the generator
        itself and operators, but with a payload! </p>
      <p>The possibilities of obtaining free electrical power from the
        earth's <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> fields appear equally exciting.
        Not only from stationary land installed power plant receivers,
        but from receivers installed on aircraft and space vehicles. The
        research and experimentation needed to reduce to practice this
        exploitation of the earth's <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> fields appears
        to have relatively few hurdles before it. The development of
        ultra-high frequency rectifiers appears to be its first
        requirement, and there are no roadblocks on the horizon to this
        accomplishment! What the consummation of this project could mean
        for the economic development of remote, mountainous,
        inaccessible regions of the earth is beyond all imagination at
        this time. In the light of this thesis, the new horizons in
        field theory herald that the heritage of mankind is dominion
        over all the earth! </p>

      <p>During the past two years the writer has devoted his full time
        to the task of producing experimental sources of <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        fields which speak for themselves. Nature has the last word in
        any controversy in physics and when she speaks her words are
        final! </p>
      <p>A generator of a motional electric field, all electric and with
        no mechanical motions involved, has been built and
        experimentally demonstrated. This device projects its field into
        the space surrounding the generator. Being immune to shielding,
        the <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> field readily passes through the
        stainless steel walls of a grounded housing chamber. Surrounding
        the generator is mounted a cylindrical parallel plate capacitor.
        The outer plate is connected to a very sensitive vibrating
        capacitor electrometer (Keithley 640). The inner plate is
        connected to the other terminal of the electrometer, one
        terminal of which is grounded. Voltages are induces in these
        wires. The net result of these induced voltages is that the
        potential difference induced in that portion of the wire between
        the capacitor plates, charges these plates, and in doing so is
        measured by the electrometer. The generator, capacitor and
        electrometer are completely surrounded by a grounded
        electrostatic field. Housing them in a stainless steel box with
        a door has served this purpose very well. </p>
      <p>Two papers describing the construction of the all-electric
        generator and the experiments performed with it have been
        presented to meetings of the American Physical Society. The
        abstracts and papers will be found in the appendix. </p>

      <p>A simple lecture table demonstration of the pure <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field is illustrated in Figure 8. Two short similar bars magnets
        are spaced apart as shown. Midway between them a long, straight
        insulated wire (surrounded by a grounded conducting shield),
        perpendicular to the paper is fixed with its terminals connected
        to a sensitive galvanometer placed outside the immediate
        vicinity of the magnets, say overhead. The resultant magnetic
        flux density B from the two magnets, at the wire, is zero by the
        principle of superposition. If the magnet on the left be given a
        slow uniform velocity V and the one on the right a velocity V'
        equal and opposite to V, then one will note a deflection of the
        galvanometer needle due to the pure induced <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field acting in the wire. Note that in this simple experiment we
        have two sources of <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>. Both the B and the V
        of each source are identical in magnitude but opposite in
        direction; therefore, since <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> = (-<u>B</u>)
        x (-<u>V</u>), the products are both positive and additive. The
        movement of one magnet alone will be found to yield a
        galvanometer deflection of half that obtained when both magnets
        are moved simultaneously. Note also that the wire is always in a
        region where B = 0, but where <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> is present
        and active. </p>
      <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of our discoveries is that
        by the use of the phenomenon of superposition of fields,
        electromagnetic induction can seemingly be separated from
        magnetic flux energy. In other words, our all-electric motional
        electric field generator operates without the presence of
        detectable magnetic flux energy as such. It is a non-inductive
        device. The magnetic flux intensity has been reduced to zero by
        the principle of superposition, and the virtual undestroyed
        field associated with uncancelled flux is still active and
        present; hence, the name "virtual" is used to describe it. It is
        this virtual field which produces the pure motional electric
        field in the space surrounding the generator. This newly
        discovered pure <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> field is the most unique
        phenomenon known to electromagnetism because it is devoid of the
        electrostatic and magnetic field characteristics we have
        hitherto known. It is a <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> field with the
        resultant B = 0. Its immunity to shielding gives it a stature
        and a character of its own, beautifully unique and isolated from
        all hitherto known special fields! Our generator produces
        nothing but this pure previously unknown field! </p>
      <p>Perhaps the closest approach to the V phenomenon inherent in
        our motional electric field generator, is the toroidal
        transformer. In this device we are dealing with a transformer
        type of induced electric field caused by the growth and death of
        flux. It is of great interest, however, to note that the wires
        of the secondary windings where the field is induced may be
        entirely existent in a region devoid of measurable magnetic
        flux, since B = 0 there. This phenomenon is always of interest
        to students, because the induction in the wires takes place in a
        region of space where, by superposition of fields the resultant
        magnetic flux intensity is reduced to zero without in any way
        impairing the electromagnetic induction of the virtual flux
        which is operative. It is of interest to note that our research
        simply extends this phenomenon to include flux cutting as well
        as transformer types of induction where B has been reduced to
        zero. </p>
      <p>It is not surprising that many physical scientists listen to
        this thesis with incredulity. This is not disturbing to the
        author. It is but the natural path of all new discovery. Nature
        herself bears the burden of proof and she has spoken out clearly
        in behalf of the uniqueness of the motional electric field. What
        the role of this new electric force field will be in the future
        development of electromagnetism is at present an open question.
        Our critics point to the very small values of the induced
        voltages we have measured in the field of our generator. The
        field intensity close to our generator is at present, at room
        temperature, approximately of the order of ~10<sup>-2</sup>
        volts/meter, with a current of 30 amperes. At cryogenic
        temperatures, i.e., around 4.7° K, we could expect to increase
        the <u>B</u> factor in a <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> superconducting
        generator, consisting of 12,000 linear conductors, approximately
        100 times. Our hope in achieving an intense <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field rests, therefore, on how much we can increase the <u>V</u>
        factor in the vector product <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>. This we know
        could be greatly enhanced in an electronic design of our
        generator. We have experimentally shown that operating our
        present model at the temperature of dry ice, i.e., -50° C, at
        high current densities, approximately doubles the value of <u>V</u>,
        the electron drift velocity. Our generator is itself a unique
        and novel instrument for directly measuring <u>V</u> with
        considerable precision. The experimental fact that this quantity
        does not increase with decreasing temperature encourages us in
        our anticipation that in the superconducting state where all
        resistance to electron motion disappears that <u>V</u> will be
        very great. The author endorses the statement of Wehr and
        Richards (48 ~ <i>Introductory Atomic Physics</i>, p. 218,
        Addison &amp; Wesley, 1962), "At absolute zero the atom would
        have no significant cross-section and electrons could streak
        through a conductor without encountering any resistance at all".
        Should very high values of <u>V</u> be realized in our
        cryogenic experiments, it is the writer's belief that a new era
        in gravitational dominion will be at hand. </p>

      <p>That the magnetic flux surrounding a current-carrying linear
        conductor moves with the electron drift velocity is demonstrated
        in a motional field out into the surrounding space. This field
        is not electrostatic. It is immune to shielding. Magnetic flux
        has been eliminated. The presence of this unique, special
        electric field is detectable and its intensity is measurable
        with an electrometer. From such measurements, electron drift
        velocities can be directly determined. The unique properties of
        this field strongly suggest its equivalence to the gravitational
        field. If equivalence proves to be a fact, then direct
        absorption of gravitational field energy becomes possible for
        electric power without pollution. If generation in great
        intensity becomes possible, theory indicates that the concepts
        of artificial gravity is space vehicles, weightlessness in
        limited earthly laboratories, and even anti-gravity, or lift
        instead of pull from the earth's gravity, have possibilities of
        attainment. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>How can a force like gravity originate and emanate from atoms
        of matter made up primarily of three elementary particles ---
        electrons, protons and neutrons? Einstein wrote, "It would be a
        great step forward if we succeeded in combining the
        gravitational field and the electromagnetic field into a single
        structure" (1). A very considerable step in this direction may
        have been made by the advent of the recently invented motional
        electric field generator and the newly revealed properties of
        this field. (2) </p>
      <p>When magnetic flux is moved perpendicularly across a conductor,
        we say that an emf is electromagnetically induced within the
        conductor. This phenomenon has been little thought of as
        involving the production of a spacially distributed electric
        field. It arises from the operation called flux-cutting; wherein
        the electric field is motionally induced within the space
        occupied by the moving magnetic flux, and is present therein,
        whether a conductor is present in this space or not. Correctly
        defined, we can say that when magnetic flux of vector intensity
        <u>B</u> is moved across a region of space with vector velocity
        <u>V</u>, an electromagnetically induced electric field of
        vector intensity <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> makes its appearance in
        this space, at right angles to both <u>B</u> and <u>V</u>. For
        short, this induced field is called a motional electric field. A
        study of its properties is exciting. </p>
      <p>Clerk Maxwell wrote in his description of the work of Michael
        Faraday that the intensity of the induced electric field "is
        entirely independent of the nature of the substance in which it
        acts" (3). The origin of this field, being electromagnetic
        induction, and non-electrostatic in nature, gives this field its
        penetrating nature which enables it to be present within either
        magnetic or non-magnetic conductors or insulators, entirely
        independent of the nature of the substance. The writer's
        extended experiments (4) involving shielding confirms Maxwell's
        description of this field. </p>
      <p><b>The Motional Electric Field Generator</b> </p>
      <p>The motional electric field generator was designed and built to
        provide a device which would project a pure motionally induced
        electric field into the space surrounding it, devoid of
        electrostatic and magnetic accompaniments. It involves a newly
        discovered, non-mechanical method for moving magnetic flux,
        combined with one of the most basic and orthodox laws of
        physics, "the principle of superposition of fields". This
        principle states that in order to find the resultant intensity
        of the superimposed fields, each field should be treated as
        though the other is absent. The resultant is obtained by the
        vector addition of each field considered singly. </p>
      <p>In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that a
        current-carrying conductor has magnetic flux looped about it.
        This discovery served to unify the then separate sciences of
        electricity and magnetism. In 1957, B.G. Cullwick (5), in a
        careful, thought-provoking analysis of moving charges, set forth
        three documented experimental fats to support the idea that the
        Oersted flux around a moving conduction electron should move
        with it. The writer had independently been led to the same
        conclusion. A plan for experimentally investigating this
        phenomenon was evolved. The design of the motional electric
        field generator was the result, and its production required the
        skill of an expert maker of generators and motors. This
        generator demonstrates and confirms that the Oersted flux
        actually does move with the electron drift velocity of the
        current giving rise to it. This discovery is a basic and
        fundamental contribution to electromagnetism. It also shows how
        this motion may possibly serve to explain the origin of
        gravitation from atoms of matter. The design of the generator
        itself will aid in seeing this possibility. </p>
      <p>Momentarily, consider yourself in the place of a Maxwell demon,
        one who can see, from without, the planetary electrons of an
        atom orbiting about the nucleus. On the average, we may assume
        that there are as many going in one direction as in the opposite
        direction, in an approximate orbital plane. If these charges
        carry their Oersted magnetic fluxes with them, in the space
        surrounding an atom of matter, these moving fluxes will project
        an induced motional electric field, radially directed toward the
        nucleus. </p>
      <p>The design of the motional electric field generator was such as
        to imitate in an elementary way the planetary electrons in an
        atom. The device involves no mechanically moving parts. It is
        wholly electrical. </p>
      <p>The generator consists of 4020 insulated parallel linear
        conductors, #11, formvar insulated copper wire, nine inches in
        length, all connected in series and packed orderly side-by-side
        and tightly sealed together with epoxy into the shape of a
        solid, right circular cylinder. The series connections were
        accomplished by turning the wired through 180 degree angles
        without breaking the insulation. The two terminals connected to
        this composite of linear conductors are brought together at the
        axis of the cylinder and connected to a shielded and grounded
        two-wire cable. When energized by a direct current, 2010
        conductors are at any instant carrying current and magnetic flux
        vertically downward, and the same number of conductors are doing
        the same thing vertically upward. This composite cylinder is
        thus non-inductive with no measurable magnetic flux surrounding
        it. The principle of super-position of fields shows that each of
        the two sets of linear conductors contributes a motional
        electric field directed radially inward toward the axis of the
        cylinder. The superimposed magnetic flux from these two sets of
        conductors consists of horizontal circular flux loops, half
        directed clockwise and the other half counter-clockwise, half
        moving upward and half moving downward. Thus, we have a unique
        condition in the space surrounding the cylinder: the resultant
        magnetic flux, due to superposition of fields, is zero; and the
        resultant motional electric field intensity is <u>E</u> = <u>B</u><sub>1</sub>
        x <u>V</u><sub>1</sub> + (-<u>B</u><sub>1</sub> x -<u>V</u><sub>2</sub>)
        = 2B<u>1</u>x <u>V</u><sub>1</sub>, or double the intensity
        attributable to one set of conductors alone, where <u>B</u><sub>1</sub>
        is the magnetic flux intensity due to 2010 linear conductors and
        <u>V</u><sub>1</sub>, the electron drift velocity in, say, the
        positive upward direction. Although the magnetic flux energy in
        this device is reduced to zero, the electromagnetic induction
        giving rise to what we term the motional electric field has by
        no means been cancelled nor reduced. </p>
      <p>The motional electric field is projected into the space
        surrounding our generator when the DC current therein is 30
        amperes, equivalent to that which would be associated with the
        uncancelled magnetic flux around a single conductor carrying a
        current of over 120,000 amperes (4020 x 30 = 120,600 ampere
        turns). </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Measurements</b> </p>
      <p>The motional electric field intensity is studied an measured by
        the use of a highly insulated, stainless steel cylindrical
        capacitor, placed around the generator, the inner cylinder of
        which is grounded and the outer cylinder is connected to the
        input head of a Keithley 640 Vibrating Capacitor Electrometer. A
        diagram of the circuitry employed in operating our generator is
        shown in Figure 1. The generator with its cylindrical capacitor
        about it is placed within a large grounded stainless steel
        cabinet. The vibrating capacitor electrometer head is also
        placed in the cabinet, close to the cylindrical capacitor, and
        connections are made to each plate. All connecting wires between
        the electrometer head and the galvanometer are electrostatically
        protected by grounded shielding. The electrometer galvanometer
        is outside the cabinet and has a grounding terminal for the
        whole electrometer system. The vibrating capacitor in the
        electrometer is energized by a small storage battery built into
        the electrometer galvanometer case. The inner capacitor
        cylinder, made of 1/8" stainless steel, is insulated from the
        generator conductors by epoxy, and forms a partial housing. The
        epoxy covering the two ends of the generator is covered with a
        heavy coat of sprayed silver and this, with the inner capacitor
        cylinder, forms a completely grounded electrostatic shield
        around it. The motional electric field, caused by the up and
        down movement of the slowly moving (virtual) magnetic flux
        loops, induces an emf in the surrounding space and in the wire
        connected to the electrometer head and its ground connection.
        The capacitor plates are thus charged, the potential difference
        of which is registered by the electrometer galvanometer. </p>
      <p>The potential difference is obtained by integrating the line
        integral of the electric field intensity E between the capacitor
        plates. It is given in mks units by: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 1) P.D. = /<sub>r1</sub> <sup>r2 </sup>E dr =&nbsp; /<sub>r1</sub><sup>r2








        </sup>BxV dr = /<sub>r1</sub><sup>r2 </sup>?<sub>o</sub>nIV
        dr/2 pi r </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1z2.gif" height="71" width="377"></p>
      <p>where B = ?<sub>o</sub>nI/2?r webers/meter<sup>2<img
            src="0eq1z3.gif" height="24" width="226"></sup> and r<sub>1</sub>
        and r<sub>2</sub> are the distances respectively from the axis
        of the generator to the outer surface of the inner capacitor
        plate, and the inner surface of the outside capacitor plate.
        Thus, we have a typical example of how we can obtain the drift
        velocity V, when r<sub>1</sub> = 0.1 meter, r<sub>2</sub> =
        0.1035 meter,&nbsp; mu<sub>o</sub> = 4 pi x 10<sup>-7</sup>, n =
        4020, I = 10 amps, P.D. = 5 x 10<sup>-6</sup> volts. Integrating
        (1), we have: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 2) P.D. = mu<sub>o</sub> n IV/2 pi =&nbsp; ?<sub>r1</sub><sup>r2








        </sup>dr/r = mu<sub>o n</sub> nIV/2 pi (ln r<sub>2</sub> - ln r<sub>1</sub>)
      </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1z4.gif" height="71" width="381"></p>
      <p>Solving for the drift velocity V, we have: </p>
      <p>(Eq. 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V = 2 pi P.D./ mu<sub>o</sub>nI (1n r<sub>2</sub>
        - 1n r<sub>1</sub>) (meters/sec) </p>
      <p><img src="0eq1z5.gif" height="30" width="385"></p>
      <p>V = 1.78 x 10<sup>-2</sup> meters/sec = 1.78 cm/sec </p>
      <p>The classical derivation of the electron drift velocity is
        given by V = j/ne where <i>j</i> is the current density (j =
        10/0.04172 amp/cm<sup>2</sup>), and <i>n</i> is the number of
        conduction electrons per cubic centimeter, and <i>e</i> is the
        charge on the electron (1.6021 x 10<sup>-19</sup> coul.). Using
        Avogadro's number, N = 6.02252 x 10<sup>23</sup> for
        calculating, n = dN/M, where <i>d</i> is the density, 9.96
        gm/cm<sup>3</sup>, and M is the atomic weight, 63.546 gm/mole,
        for copper, we have </p>
      <p>V = 239.69/(8.96 x 10<sup>22</sup> x 1.6021 x 10<sup>-19</sup>)
        = 1.762 x 10<sup>-2</sup> cm/sec. A decrease of 100-fold in <i>n</i>,
        as indicated by Fermi-Dirac statistics would bring the
        experimental value of the same order of magnitude as the
        theoretical. </p>
      <p>Measurements of electrometer potential differences P.D. versus
        direct current values <i>I</i>, when taken quickly so as to
        prevent appreciable change in the temperature of the generator,
        due to electrical heat loss, yields a most interesting curve.
        Typical of most of the curves is the one shown in Figure 2. The
        magnitude of the motional electric field intensity will be seen
        to be directly proportional to the virtual value of the flux B
        involved, and hence to the current. The value of the electron
        drift velocity will also be directly proportional to the
        current. Thus the potential difference measured versus current
        values yield a parabola. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that when alternating current values
        were plotted against electrometer deflections that a straight
        line was obtained instead of a parabola. This is illustrated in
        Figure 3. </p>
      <p><b>New Research Instrumentation</b> </p>
      <p>When improved and perfected, this motional electric field
        generator, together with a capacitor and an electrometer, appear
        to offer unique instrumentation for directly measuring the
        electron drift velocity in metals. Experimental values obtained
        with our generator are in good agreement with accepted values.
        Making measurements at various temperatures will afford a method
        of directly determining the quantity <i>n</i>, the number of
        free conduction electrons available per nit volume, thus
        affording an experimental check on the Fermi-Dirac statistics
        method for obtaining this quantity. </p>
      <p><b>Crucial Experimental Evidence</b> </p>
      <p>It was, of course, necessary to run down every conceivable
        possible source of error. The question has been raised as to
        whether or not the potential difference electrometer
        measurements that we have observed as a function of input
        current to our device might arise from the thermoelectric
        effects instead of from the assumed <u>B</u>x<u>V</u> field. It
        is true that at 30 amperes input, approximately 3300 watts of
        electrical power is being poured into our device, and it heats
        up at this rate, perceptibly to the hand, in a time interval of
        four to five minutes. It has been suggested that the juncture
        between the copper wire and the inner cylinder of the capacitor
        might be raised in temperature more rapidly than the juncture on
        the outer cylinder and thus give rise to an observed emf. To
        examine such a possibility, we have made a series of
        measurements requiring only a few seconds for each reading.
        Starting with a 30 ampere input, we have gone down to 25, and
        then to 20, 15 and 10, then back up the scale in 5 ampere steps
        to 30 and again back down to 10 amperes. The observed values of
        potential difference at each value of current were substantially
        identical. It does not seem reasonable to think that the
        innermost juncture could jump up and down in temperature values
        in a matter of seconds, permitting the electrometer galvanometer
        needle to return to its zero position immediately after each
        input value of current. When the device really warms up, each of
        the observed potential differences becomes enhanced and the
        plotted curves retain a nearly parabolic shape. We have,
        therefore, ruled out thermoelectric effects as giving rise to
        our observed measurements. </p>
      <p>It has been suggested that possible non-cancelled magnetic
        fringing from the linear conductors acting on the innermost
        stainless steel cylinder might change the Fermi level of the
        metal and alter the contact differences of potential between the
        inner and outer cylinders of the capacitor. To eliminate this as
        a possible cause, a much larger diameter cylindrical capacitor
        was placed around the original one. The two plates of the first
        capacitor were grounded and measurements were made from the
        outermost capacitor alone. </p>
      <p>The possibility that stray magnetic flux from the composite
        linear conductors, linking with the electrometer circuit, might
        give rise to the observed measurements was considered. A
        sensitive gaussmeter probe was employed to test for the
        existence of such flux. The maximum value found for such flux
        was of the order of half a gauss, found in one spot. To dispel
        all doubt, however, as to stray magnetic flux, a fairly large
        circuit, consisting of five wires was formed so that one side of
        the circuit came in radially from a distance of one foot to the
        central equatorial surface of the device, where it was held by
        tape and brought along parallel to the axis for several feet.
        This circuit loop was connected to a very sensitive
        microvoltmeter which was observed while various values of input
        current up to 30 amperes was sent into the linear conductors. No
        indication of an induced emf could be observed. </p>
      <p>It is evident that the charging of the capacitor plates might
        possibly be due to charges carried by the current in the two
        wires leading onto the generator. If these wires are each at
        different potential differences with regard to the round, they
        carry an electric charge into the interior of the conducting
        housing enclosure of the generator and thus cause a charge of
        similar amount to appear on the outside of it and to produce a
        potential difference between the capacitor plates. This was
        experimentally confirmed by the inventor. When the generator
        housing was this raised to a positive potential difference with
        respect to ground, the electrometer deflections were to the
        right of center. When the housing was raised to a negative
        potential with respect to the ground, the electrometer
        deflections were to the left of center. These tests were made in
        two ways: (1) with no current flowing to the generator and 92)
        with current flowing, but one lead wire at a higher, or lower,
        potential with respect to ground than the other. Thus, it became
        evident that the two wires leading to the generator, with the
        grounded shielding, can be prevented from carrying a charge into
        the interior of the generator of the two wires are each
        constantly maintained at exactly the same value of potential
        difference above and below ground potential. A special power
        supply was built to provide this requirement. The voltage of
        each wire entering the generator was tested for various values
        of current and the potential differences were found to be
        accurately identical, above and below ground. Now, the
        deflections of the electrometer for various values of current
        were always to the right of center, indicating a electric field
        directed toward the generator was charging the plates. This
        field could not have come from a charge on the grounded
        generator housing with no net charge entering the generator,
        since such a possibility was carefully eliminated. Thus, the
        electric field must be due to the predicted <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field. It is always directed toward the generator. This is a
        distinguishing characteristic of the <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> when
        it is due to the movement of electrons. If the current were due
        to the movement of positrons or protons, then the <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>
        field produced would be directed away from these currents
        instead of towards them! Alternating current thus produces
        electrometer deflections to the right of zero center the same as
        direct current, and this can be explained only in terms of the <u>B</u>
        x <u>V</u>. Had the electrometer deflections been due to
        electrostatic charging, the electrometer needle would have
        remained under the alternating impulses, 60 times each second,
        when AC current was used. </p>
      <p>The argument has been advanced that the movement of the
        magnetic field with the free as well as the orbital electrons in
        a piece of metal would result in a considerably inwardly
        directed motional electric field in the space all around this
        metal piece, contrary to experience. Our reply to this argument
        is that the motional electric field, thus undoubtedly built up
        in the space around the metal, is in fact the weak gravitational
        field emanating from it. True, it has never been detected as an
        electric field, and we claim that this probably is due to its
        very high composite frequency nature. We know from gravitational
        experiments that there exists just such an inwardly directed
        force around the metal. We know that it cannot be electrostatic
        nor magnetic. Yet, it does emanate from an aggregate of
        electromagnetic sources. We have good reason to believe that in
        view of the immunity of the motional electric field to shielding
        that this field could provide the field agency for gravitation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Electromagnetic Induction With Zero B Is Not New</b> </p>
      <p>Our generator somewhat resembles a properly wound toroidal coil
        in that, in the same space outside such a coil, carrying
        current, we know that B is zero due to the principle of
        superposition of fields. We know that when alternating current
        is surging back and forth in its coils that a non-electrostatic,
        electromagnetically induced electric field is present
        continuously in this space around it, where the magnetic field
        intensity is continuously zero. The resultant magnetic flux
        energy in our generator is reduced to zero while the
        electromagnetic induction due to the movement of virtual Oersted
        flux, in each of the two vertical directions, gives rise to what
        we call the motional electric field in the space surrounding the
        generator. </p>
      <p>A simple experiment can be performed to convince one that
        electromagnetic induction takes place in a space where the
        resultant magnetic intensity has been reduced to zero by
        superposition of fields. With soft iron sheet, form a
        cylindrical magnetic shield about a meter in length and a few
        centimeters in diameter. A stiff wire should be held centrally
        within the cylindrical tube, and both tube and wire moved
        horizontally in a North and South direction across the vertical
        component of the earth's magnetic field, while the two ends of
        the stiff wire are connected to a sensitive galvanometer. A
        deflection of the galvanometer needle will readily measure the
        induced emf produced within the shielded wire, where the
        magnetic field intensity has been reduced to zero. The wire was
        not in motion with respect to the shielding magnetic flux
        induced in the shield, but it was in motion across the earth's
        vertical magnetic component. Now, hold the stiff horizontal wire
        stationary and move the cylindrical shielding horizontally at
        right angles to its length a permissible distance, approximately
        that of its inside diameter. Again a deflection of the
        galvanometer will measure the induced emf within the stiff wire
        which was stationary with respect to the earth's field, but was
        cut by the magnetic field within the shield, which reduced the
        resultant field therein to zero. If accurately measured, the emf
        induced in the shielded wire will be found identical for the
        same movement when no shield at all is employed. In one case, B
        = 0; in the other case, it is a real measurable value. </p>
      <p><b>Mechanical Generation &amp; Confirmation</b> </p>
      <p>The special distribution of motional electric field directed
        radially about the equatorial region of the generator was
        explored by means of a squirrel cage-like rotor, made up of
        parallel electromagnets all similarly directed so that, in some
        respects, it simulated the rotation of a unipolar magnet about
        its magnetic axis of symmetry. This apparatus is by no means
        such a magnet because its design is such to preclude a
        symmetrically uniform distribution of magnetic flux about its
        rotational axis. The rotation of this system of electromagnets
        affords an interesting experiment because here we have loops of
        magnetic flux of constant intensity completely filling the space
        about the rotor, all similarly directed from one end of the
        system to the other, and all in rotation about the same axis
        with the same angular velocity, and having a definite and
        constant flux pattern in space, not symmetrical nor uniform in
        the sense of a unipolar magnet though in a sense simulating one.
        That this magnetic field system rotates was readily demonstrated
        by means of a rectangular pickup coil placed close to the rotor
        and parallel to the array of electromagnets. When rotating at a
        speed of 10,000 rpm an AC voltage of 15 volts was obtained due
        to the humps of similarly directed magnetic flux which entered
        and left the coil. With a very sensitive zero-centered
        voltmeter, one could rotate the rotor by hand and demonstrate
        the rotation of the flux very visibly. A semi-cylindrical
        capacitor was next placed over the top of the rotor, with two
        wires centrally and radially directed (from the rotor axis) to
        an electrometer. In this experiment, the wires from the
        capacitor plates to the electrometer are cut by the
        unidirectionlly rotating magnetic flux which induces the
        motionally induced emf in this space, and is detected and
        measured by the DC voltage to which the capacitor plates are
        raised. With this apparatus one can demonstrate that rotation of
        the rotor in one direction yields a radial inwardly directed
        motional electric field, while rotation of the rotor in the
        opposite direction reverses the direction of the motional
        electric field, thus demonstrating the vector nature of the
        field by changing the sign of <u>V</u> in the vector product <u>E</u>
        = <u>B</u> x <u>V</u>, and -<u>E</u> = <u>B</u> x (-<u>V</u>).







        By keeping a constant rotation and reversing the direction of
        the current to the electromagnets, the direction of <u>B</u>
        can be changed while <u>V</u> is held constant. In this manner
        the direction of the motionally induced electric field can also
        be reversed in the surrounding space and can be made either
        radially inward or radially outward as evidenced by the
        zero-centered galvanometer needle of the Keithley 640 vibrating
        capacitor electrometer which was used to make the DC voltage
        measurements. The demonstration that a spacially distributed
        motional electric field exists around either our mechanical or
        our all-electric generator appears to us to be amply
        demonstrated. To be more certain, however, we obtained the
        services of a disinterested expert in electronics measurements
        to come in and check our work with a sensitive Tectronic
        electron oscillograph, which confirmed our observations with the
        Keithley Electrometer. </p>
      <p><b>Relation To Relativity</b> </p>
      <p>The question arises as to how this new field fits into the
        Relativity theories? It definitely provides an interesting
        clarification of a hitherto speculative deduction which many
        relativitists have ventured to make with respect to the <u>V</u>
        x <u>B</u> motional electric term which enters into the
        transformation equations of the Special Theory as applied to
        electrodynamics. It has been claimed that this <u>V</u> x <u>B</u>
        term is electrostatic in its fundamental nature. This conclusion
        is now definitely shown to be incorrect by the advent of the new
        motional electric field generator, the field of which emanates
        from a grounded conducting metallic container and passes readily
        through any shield. The non-electrostatic nature of the <u>V</u>
        x <u>B</u> has also been pointed out by Winch: "Notice that the
        <u>E</u> of (<u>E</u> = <u>V</u> x <u>B</u>) is not an
        electrostatic field intensity for it is not due to a
        distribution of charges" (6). Nature has definitely not limited
        us to one type of electric field. The motional electric field is
        different in origin and fundamental properties from the
        electrostatic field arising from charges. </p>
      <p>The writer embraces the position taken by Sir James H. Jeans in
        his explanation of the Special Theory of Relativity and its
        bearing upon the two electric fields in the transformation
        equations. He points out that there is nothing in the postulates
        of the Special Theory that requires a physical interpretation of
        the two electric field terms <u>E</u> and <u>V</u> x <u>B</u>/c






        in the transformation equation <u>E</u>' = [<u>E</u> - (l/c) <u>V</u>
        x <u>B</u>]. He states: "The equations may be taken merely as
        expressing relations between quantities as measured by the
        observer S and another S' moving with a velocity <u>V</u>
        relative to S" (7). Thus we see that there is no conflict with
        the Special Theory of Relativity. The philosophy of the
        Nobelist, P. W. Bridgman, whose "Operational Viewpoint" as set
        forth in his text, <i>The Logic of Modern Physics</i> (8), has
        guided the inventor in his work on this project. As Bridgman
        predicted, it has led to new and fundamentally basic knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>That the gravitational field may possibly be identified as a
        motional electric field is at least very strongly suggested by
        the experimental work described herein. The claim of the General
        Theory of Relativity that the Gravitational field is equivalent
        to that of centrifugal force would appear to be a concept far
        removed form that of presenting it as a motional electric field.
        The experimental fact remains, however, that a pure motional
        electric field projected into space does simulate, in some
        respects, the gravitational field. </p>
      <p>When the current flowing into this generator is constant, the
        motional electric field surrounding it is also constant and
        static, but not electrostatic, because it does not originate or
        terminate on charges. It readily passes through two 1/8" thick
        sheets, or 1/4" of stainless steel, constituting the cylindrical
        capacitor plates. The exciting thing about this generator is
        that it throws this <u>B</u> x <u>V</u> electric field out
        into the space around it. It is not electrostatic, not magnetic,
        and is immune to shielding. These properties make it a unique
        force in nature with possibly great utility to mankind. </p>
      <p><b>Polarization &amp; Absorption</b> </p>
      <p>Objects placed in this field are electrically polarized, and in
        making measurements of its intensity, the electrostatic fields
        arising from such polarization have to be reckoned with. From a
        well-known general theorem (9) we know that an intense
        convergent motional electric field would be attractive on any
        material object placed within it, due to this internal
        polarization. The recent experimental work of L. Brauner on the
        electric polarization due to gravity, is most interesting, as
        reported in the January 1969 issue of <i>Endeavor</i> magazine
        (10). His experiments convincingly show that the shoots and
        roots of plants when lying in a horizontal plane become
        electrically polarized. When turned into a vertical plane, this
        polarization soon disappears. Brauner presents excellent
        evidence in support of the conclusion that this phenomenon is
        due to the electrical nature of the earth's gravitational field.

      <p>This indicates in a limited way direct absorption of
        gravitational field energy. Of course, our hydro-electric plants
        are utilizing this energy in large quantities where advantageous
        sites for such plants can be found. The greatest potential
        inherent in the research described herein, the writer believes,
        will ultimately be in the direct absorption and conversion into
        useful electric power the vast reservoir of gravitational field
        energy which as yet has hardly been tapped. The insight into
        what we believe to be the mechanism within atoms which gives
        rise to the phenomenon of gravity, encourages us in the
        conviction that we can directly absorb and convert it to the
        service of mankind. Our research in this direction has commenced
        and is very encouraging. </p>
      <p>Spacewise, this project has some speculative possibility, if
        and when this generated field can be made sufficiently intense.
        We have very considerable reason to believe that by the use of
        superconducting wire and liquid helium temperatures, this can be
        accomplished. To what extent is speculation at present, but
        theory would indicate that if intense fields are ever possible
        of generation, then the phenomenon of changing the weight of
        objects, and of even producing weightlessness and anti-gravity
        (that is, lift instead of downward pull on objects) would be
        possible. </p>
      <p>Domestic and foreign patent applications covering the various
        generators and devies employed in our work have been field and
        some have been granted. </p>
