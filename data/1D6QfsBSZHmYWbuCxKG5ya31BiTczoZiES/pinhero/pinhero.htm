      Imagine mobile phones charged by their own power generating skins,
      buildings cooled without the need for external power, or solar
      collectors that produced energy around the clock. Sounds fanciful
      doesn't it? Well, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's
      Idaho National Laboratory have made a breakthrough that may see
      such startling advances being made within just a few years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">nanoantenna array</span><br>
      <img style=" width: 255px; height: 200px;" alt=""
        src="nantenna1.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      By embossing thin sheets of plastic with tiny nanoantennas, the
      team of researchers have been able to capture electromagnetic
      energy at the mid-infrared range and convert it to electricity.
      Similar antennas have been created in the past to harvest lower
      frequency electromagnetic radiation such as microwaves, but
      capturing the higher frequency infrared radiation has, until now,
      been difficult. Infrared radiation is the means by which heat is
      transmitted between objects. And therein lies the problem because
      when objects heat up, their shape and other characteristics
      change.<br>
      <br>
      The size and shape of the nanoantennas is crucial to their ability
      to capture energy. Even small amounts of heat could have a huge
      effect on such small objects. The team have overcome the
      difficulty of heat absorption by surrounding the nanoantennas with
      specially treated polyethylene, a material typically found in
      plastic shopping bags. Each nanoantenna is a gold spiral
      approximately 1/25 the width of a human hair. Plastic sheets
      containing billions of interconnected nanoantennas collect heat
      energy emitted by the sun and other sources and release it as
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">nanoantenna</span><br>
      <img style=" width: 600px; height: 467px;" alt=""
        src="nantenna2.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough came after the team had constructed several
      computer models to examine the reaction of various materials to
      infrared radiation. Gold, copper and manganese were tested. The
      simulations confirmed that nanoantennas of the correct shape, size
      and material could capture over 92% of the infrared energy to
      which they were exposed. Then, using a technique usually used in
      the manufacture of electronics, actual gold nanoantennas were
      etched into thin wafers of silicon. These prototypes converted
      over 80% of the infrared energy to electrical energy. Finally a
      stamp-and-repeat method was used to emboss billions of the
      nanoantennas onto thin plastic sheets. These, too, demonstrated a
      more than 80% conversion rate while traditional solar cells
      convert roughly 20% of the solar energy that strikes their surface
      into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The beauty of the discovery lies in the abundance of infrared
      energy all around us. Unlike visible light, on which typical solar
      cells rely, infrared energy is not only given off by the sun.
      "Every process in our industrial world creates waste heat. It's
      energy that we just throw away," says Steven Novack, the leader of
      the team responsible for the discovery. The heat radiated from
      electronics, industrial processes and even the Earth itself could
      be captured by arrays of nanoantennas.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoantennas can also be tweaked to capture different
      wavelengths of electromagnetic energy.&nbsp; This gives them a
      distinct advantage over traditional solar cells that focus on a
      relatively small range of energies within the electromagnetic
      spectrum. In the future, specialised double-sided solar panels
      could capture solar energy during the day on one side and infrared
      energy emitted by the earth at night. In addition, because
      infrared energy is the mechanism used to transmit heat between
      objects, arrays of nanoantennas could be used to cool buildings
      and other structures, transforming the once wasted heat into
      electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Some problems remain to be solved, however. The infrared radiation
      causes the nanoantennas to oscillate trillions of times per
      second, producing alternating current (AC). A device known as a
      rectifier is needed to convert the current into usable direct
      current (DC). However, modern rectifiers cannot handle AC at such
      high frequencies. "We need to design nanorectifiers to go with our
      nanoantennas," says Dale Cotter, a member of the research team.
      However, the team are confident that they can overcome the
      remaining barriers. One possibility is that a diode could be
      placed at the centre of each nanoantenna to slow down the current.<br>

      <br>
      Team leader Steven Novack believes that using their computer
      modelling techniques, commercially viable nanoantenna arrays will
      be possible within a few years. The stamp-and-repeat process used
      to develop the prototypes could be extended to a large scale
      roll-to-roll manufacturing process. Novack believes that such a
      process could produce sheets of nanoarrays at a rate of several
      yards per minute at a cost of a mere few dollars per yard.<br>

      Update: The team's study, "Solar Nantenna Electromagnetic
      Collectors," won an award for best photovoltaics paper at the
      American Society of Mechanical Engineers 2008 2nd International
      Conference on Energy Sustainability.&nbsp; The paper was one of
      five top papers recognized at the conference.<br>
      <br>
      JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Researchers have devised an inexpensive way
      to produce plastic sheets containing billions of nanoantennas that
      collect heat energy generated by the sun and other sources. The
      technology, developed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho
      National Laboratory, is the first step toward a solar energy
      collector that could be mass-produced on flexible materials.<br>
      <br>
      While methods to convert the energy into usable electricity still
      need to be developed, the sheets could one day be manufactured as
      lightweight "skins" that power everything from hybrid cars to
      iPods with higher efficiency than traditional solar cells, say the
      researchers, who report their findings Aug. 13 at the American
      Society of Mechanical Engineers 2008 2nd International Conference
      on Energy Sustainability in Jacksonville, Fla. The nanoantennas
      also have the potential to act as cooling devices that draw waste
      heat from buildings or electronics without using electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoantennas target mid-infrared rays, which the Earth
      continuously radiates as heat after absorbing energy from the sun
      during the day. In contrast, traditional solar cells can only use
      visible light, rendering them idle after dark. Infrared radiation
      is an especially rich energy source because it also is generated
      by industrial processes such as coal-fired plants.<br>
      <br>
      "Every process in our industrial world creates waste heat," says
      INL physicist Steven Novack. "It's energy that we just throw
      away." Novack led the research team, which included INL engineer
      Dale Kotter, W. Dennis Slafer of MicroContinuum, Inc. (Cambridge,
      Mass.) and Patrick Pinhero, now at the University of Missouri.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoantennas are tiny gold squares set in a specially treated
      form of polyethylene, a material used in plastic bags. While
      others have successfully invented antennas that collect energy
      from lower-frequency regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such
      as microwaves, infrared rays have proven more elusive. Part of the
      reason is that materials' properties change drastically at
      high-frequency wavelengths, Kotter says.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers studied the behavior of various materials --
      including gold, manganese and copper -- under infrared rays and
      used the resulting data to build computer models of nanoantennas.
      They found that with the right materials, shape and size, the
      simulated nanoantennas could harvest up to 92 percent of the
      energy at infrared wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      The team then created real-life prototypes to test their computer
      models. First, they used conventional production methods to etch a
      silicon wafer with the nanoantenna pattern. The silicon-based
      nanoantennas matched the computer simulations, absorbing more than
      80 percent of the energy over the intended wavelength range. Next,
      they used a stamp-and-repeat process to emboss the nanoantennas on
      thin sheets of plastic. While the plastic prototype is still being
      tested, initial experiments suggest that it also captures energy
      at the expected infrared wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoantennas' ability to absorb infrared radiation makes them
      promising cooling devices. Since objects give off heat as infrared
      rays, the nanoantennas could collect those rays and re-emit the
      energy at harmless wavelengths. Such a system could cool down
      buildings and computers without the external power source required
      by air-conditioners and fans.<br>
      <br>
      But more technological advances are needed before the nanoantennas
      can funnel their energy into usable electricity. The infrared rays
      create alternating currents in the nanoantennas that oscillate
      trillions of times per second, requiring a component called a
      rectifier to convert the alternating current to direct current.
      Today's rectifiers can't handle such high frequencies. "We need to
      design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas," says Kotter,
      noting that a nanoscale rectifier would need to be about 1,000
      times smaller than current commercial devices and will require new
      manufacturing methods. Another possibility is to develop
      electrical circuitry that might slow down the current to usable
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      If these technical hurdles can be overcome, nanoantennas have the
      potential to be a cheaper, more efficient alternative to solar
      cells. Traditional solar cells rely on a chemical reaction that
      only works for up to 20 percent of the visible light they collect.
      Scientists have developed more complex solar cells with higher
      efficiency, but these models are too expensive for widespread use.<br>
      <br>
      Nanoantennas, on the other hand, can be tweaked to pick up
      specific wavelengths depending on their shape and size. This
      flexibility would make it possible to create double-sided
      nanoantenna sheets that harvest energy from different parts of the
      sun's spectrum, Novack says. The team's stamp-and-repeat process
      could also be extended to large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing
      techniques that could print the arrays at a rate of several yards
      per minute. The sheets could potentially cover building roofs or
      form the "skin" of consumer gadgets like cell phones and iPods,
      providing a continuous and inexpensive source of renewable energy.<br>

      The yellow dwarf star at the center of our solar system that
      reliably illuminates and warms this planet was considered a deity
      in ancient cultures. The science behind the sun’s energy only
      gradually occurred to the curious and the ingenious. Today, the
      ability to harvest solar energy is viewed as one of the foremost
      solutions to this country’s energy challenges, and rightly so, as
      the advent of new technologies has initiated novel and exciting
      possibilities…<br>
      <br>
      Patrick Pinhero, an associate professor of chemical engineering at
      the University of Missouri, along with colleagues at Idaho
      National Laboratories (INL), MicroContinuum Inc. in Cambridge,
      Mass., and the University of Colorado (CU), is developing a solar
      nanoantenna (nantenna) device that could potentially revolutionize
      our approach to solar power and the harvest of industrial waste
      heat.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Solar energy

      <br>
      French physicist Edmond Becquerel discovered the photoelectric
      effect — that sunlight could be converted to electricity — and 92
      years later, an explanation of the process earned Albert Einstein
      a Nobel Prize.<br>
      <br>
      Solar cells are made of a semi-conductor material, such as
      silicon, specially treated to form an electric field, positive on
      one side and negative on the other. A conductor is attached to
      both sides, forming an electric circuit. When photons hit the
      silicon and electrons are released, the energy is captured in the
      form of direct-current (DC) energy that is then converted into
      alternating current (AC) to power electrical devices.<br>
      <br>
      It is the wavelength, or frequency, of light and not its intensity
      that determines the amount of energy released: the shorter its
      wavelength, the greater its frequency. Visible light has a shorter
      wavelength than infrared light. But because solar cells can’t
      cover the entire light spectrum, they are relatively inefficient,
      converting only eight to 25 percent of available light to
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, solar panels, made up of many cells, are expensive to
      manufacture and operate at extremely high temperatures, up to few
      hundred degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      Pinhero and his team have developed an alternative direct
      collection process to collect solar energy and convert it into
      power that addresses the limitations in prevailing solar
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      At left, Patrick Pinhero, an associate professor of chemical
      engineering, gestures to a poster detailing the solar nanoantennas
      that he and fellow researchers have developed that can harvest up
      to 90 percent of direct and indirect light energy.<br>
      Solar power of the future<br>
      <br>
      In partnership with Dale Kotter and Steven Novack of INL, and
      Dennis Slafer of MicroContinuum, Pinhero helped conceive and
      fabricate nanoantenna electromagnetic collectors of various
      geometries — including square spirals that are 1/25 the width of a
      human hair — that can collect energy from the entire light
      spectrum in the same way a radio antenna collects electromagnetic
      waves — by resonance.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Garett Moddel at CU is working to fabricate diode
      devices that can convert the very high frequency of these
      resonators into an electrical direct current. It is the research
      team’s plan to integrate the diodes, which work as one-way valves
      for the oscillating electrons, directly into the nantannas.<br>
      <br>
      An array of these nantennas can be printed using conductive metals
      like gold onto a flexible sheet of polymer or a thin metal foil.
      One early prototype contained 1.4 billion nantennas on a six-foot
      square sheet. The device is predicted to have the ability to
      potentially collect on the order of 90 percent of light energy,
      direct and indirect.<br>
      <br>
      Slafer fabricates the arrays using a roll-to-roll technology to
      keep manufacturing costs low and thus commercially viable.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s inexpensive, non-toxic, lightweight, and operates at room
      temperature,” said Pinhero. “And it [the array] also has a wide
      angle of acceptance, so you don’t have to change its angle with
      respect to the emitter to maintain its efficiency.”<br>
      <br>
      The team is seeking funds from the Department of Energy, and in
      January formed a consortium with the help of Pat Brady of RedWave
      Energy, Inc. in Chicago, Ill., to raise capital from private
      investors. They believe that within five years the nantenna
      technology will be able to harvest direct sunlight with an
      efficiency that Pinhero describes as orders of magnitude better
      than current solar energy technologies.<br>
      <br>
      An array of nanoantennas printed in gold create a flexible panel
      of interconnected nantennas could eventually replace solar panels.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoantennas are imaged with a scanning electron microscope.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">In the
        meantime</span><br>
      <br>
      The researchers are still fine-tuning the device, getting the
      nantennas and the diodes to “talk” to each other.<br>
      <br>
      Because the nantennas have the ability to collect energy from the
      infrared spectrum, the next step will be to tweak the technology
      to harvest industrial waste heat. As such, nantennas will be
      complementary to photovoltaics, offering increased energy
      efficiencies through thermal harvesting when coupled to existing
      solar PV collection devices.<br>
      <br>
      “Efficiencies are proportional to the change in temperature. You
      could potentially harvest waste heat from an aluminum smelting
      operation with greater than 60 percent efficiency,” said Pinhero.
      “The hotter the better for harvesting infrared energy from waste
      heat.”<br>
      <br>
      Pinhero speculated that the nantennas might be integrated into
      building materials or electronics. “They potentially could be used
      in electric vehicles, and there may be no need for a battery in a
      car,” Pinhero said.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s what nations need to proceed: renewable resources with
      well-thought out manufacturing and scale-up. That’s our goal: a
      quality product that is inexpensive enough to be accessible to all
      people,” said Pinhero.<br>

      harvesting devices include a substrate coupled with a photovoltaic
      material and a plurality of resonance elements associated with the
      substrate. The resonance elements are configured to collect energy
      in at least visible and infrared light spectra. Each resonance
      element is capacitively coupled with the photovoltaic material,
      and may be configured to resonate at a bandgap energy of the
      photovoltaic material. Systems include a photovoltaic material
      coupled with a feedpoint of a resonance element. Methods for
      harvesting energy include exposing a resonance element having a
      resonant electromagnetic radiation having a frequency between
      approximately 20 THz and approximately 1,000 THz, absorbing at
      least a portion of the electromagnetic radiation with the
      resonance element, and resonating the resonance element at a
      bandgap energy of an underlying photovoltaic material. Methods for
      forming an energy harvesting device include forming resonance
      elements on a substrate and capacitively coupling the resonance
      elements with a photovoltaic material.<br>

      <br>
      [0002] This invention was made with government support under
      Contract No. DE-AC07-05-1D14517 awarded by the United States
      Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the
      invention.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TECHNICAL FIELD</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to
      structures and methods for harvesting energy from electromagnetic
      radiation and, more specifically, for nanostructures and related
      methods and systems for harvesting energy from, for example, the
      infrared, near-infrared and visible spectrums and capturing
      millimeter and Terahertz energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Conventionally, energy harvesting techniques and systems
      are focused on renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy,
      and wave action energy. Solar energy is conventionally harvested
      by arrays of solar cells, such as photovoltaic cells, that convert
      radiant energy to DC power. Such energy collection is limited in
      low-light conditions such as at night or even during cloudy or
      overcast conditions. Conventional solar technologies are also
      limited with respect to the locations and orientations of
      installment. For example, conventional photovoltaic cells must be
      installed such that the light of the sun strikes them at specific
      angles such that they are receiving relatively direct incident
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Additionally, current photovoltaic cells are relatively
      large and are limited in where they may be installed. As such,
      while providing some utility in harvesting energy from the
      electromagnetic radiation provided by the sun, current solar
      technologies are not yet developed to take full advantage of the
      potential electromagnetic energy available. Further, the
      apparatuses and systems used in capturing and converting solar
      energy are not particularly amenable to installation in numerous
      locations or situations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Moreover, photovoltaic cells are conventionally limited to
      collection of energy in a very narrow band of light (e.g.,
      approximately 0.8 micrometer to 0.9 micrometer ([mu]m)
      wavelengths). The spectrum of potentially available
      electromagnetic energy is much greater than the narrow band in
      which conventional photovoltaic cells operate. For example,
      electromagnetic energy provided by the sun falls within the
      wavelength spectrum of approximately 0.1 [mu]m to approximately 6
      [mu]m. Additionally, energy absorbed by the earth and reradiated
      (e.g., at night) falls within the wavelength spectrum of
      approximately 3 [mu]m to approximately 70 [mu]m. Current energy
      harvesting technologies fail to take advantage of such available
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Turning to another technology, frequency selective surfaces
      (FSSs) are used in a wide variety of applications including
      radomes, dichoric surfaces, circuit analog absorbers, and
      meanderline polarizers. An FSS is a two-dimensional periodic array
      of electromagnetic antenna elements. Such antenna elements may be
      in the form of, for example, conductive dipoles, loop patches,
      slots or other antenna elements. An FSS structure generally
      includes a metallic grid of antenna elements deposited on a
      dielectric substrate. Each of the antenna elements within the grid
      defines a receiving unit cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] An electromagnetic wave incident on the FSS structure will
      pass through, be reflected by, or be absorbed by the FSS
      structure. This behavior of the FSS structure generally depends on
      the electromagnetic characteristics of the antenna elements, which
      can act as small resonance elements. As a result, the FSS
      structure can be configured to perform as low-pass, high-pass, or
      dichoric filters. Thus, the antenna elements may be designed with
      different geometries and different materials to generate different
      spectral responses.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Conventionally, FSS structures have been successfully
      designed and implemented for use in radio frequency (RF) and
      microwave frequency applications. As previously discussed, there
      is a large amount of renewable electromagnetic radiation available
      that has been largely untapped as an energy source using currently
      available techniques. For instance, radiation in the ultraviolet
      (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) spectra are energy sources that
      show considerable potential. However, the scaling of existing FSSs
      or other similar structures for use in harvesting such potential
      energy sources comes at the cost of reduced gain for given
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Additionally, scaling FSSs or other transmitting or
      receptive structures for use with, for example, the IR or near-IR
      spectra presents numerous challenges due to the fact that
      materials do not behave in the same manner at the so-called
      "nano-scale" as they do at scales that enable such structures to
      operate in, for example, the radio frequency (RF) spectra. For
      example, materials that behave homogenously at scales associated
      with the RF spectra often behave inhomogenously at scales
      associated with the IR or near-IR spectra.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] There remains a desire in the art to improve upon existing
      technologies and to provide methods, structures and systems
      associated with harvesting energy including structures, methods
      and systems that provide access to greater bands of the
      electromagnetic spectrum and, thus greater access to available,
      yet-unused energy sources.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0012] In one embodiment of the present invention, an energy
      harvesting device is provided. The energy harvesting device
      includes a substrate and at least one resonance element associated
      with the substrate. The at least one resonance element is
      configured to have a resonant frequency between approximately 20
      THz and approximately 1,000 THz. A layer of conductive material
      substantially covers a surface of the substrate. An optical
      resonance gap extends a distance between the at least one
      resonance element and the layer of conductive material of
      approximately one-quarter wavelength of a wavelength of the at
      least one resonance element's resonant frequency. At least one
      energy transfer element is associated with the at least one
      resonance element.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention, another energy harvesting device is provided. The
      energy harvesting device includes a ground plane, a first
      substrate disposed on a first side of the ground plane and a
      second substrate disposed on a second, opposing side of the ground
      plane. At least a first resonance element is associated with the
      first substrate and located on the first side of the ground plane.
      The first resonance element is sized and configured to have a
      resonant frequency between approximately 20 THz and approximately
      1,000 THz. At least a second resonance element is associated with
      the second substrate and located on the second, opposing side of
      the ground plane. The second resonance element is sized and
      configured to have a resonant frequency different from the
      resonant frequency of the at least a first resonance element.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
      invention, a method of harvesting energy is provided. The method
      includes providing at least one resonance element formed of an
      electrically conductive material and having a resonant frequency
      between approximately 20 THz and approximately 1,000 THz. The at
      least one resonance element is exposed to electromagnetic
      radiation having a frequency substantially the same as the
      resonant frequency. At least a first portion of the
      electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by the at least one
      resonance element. At least a second portion of the
      electromagnetic radiation is reflected off of a defined surface.
      At least a portion of the at least a second portion of the
      electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by the at least one
      resonance element. Induced AC (alternating current) energy is
      transferred via an energy transfer element.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention, another method of harvesting energy is provided. The
      method includes providing at least one resonance element formed of
      an electrically conductive material and exposing the at least one
      resonance element to electromagnetic radiation radiated from the
      earth. Resonance is induced in the at least one resonance element
      to produce AC energy. The AC induced energy is transferred from
      the at least one resonance element via at least one energy
      transfer element.<br>

        INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0030] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which
      is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the
      invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in
      sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to
      practice the invention. It should be understood; however, that the
      detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating
      examples of embodiments of the invention, are given by way of
      illustration only and not by way of limitation. From this
      disclosure, various substitutions, modifications, additions,
      rearrangements, or combinations thereof within the scope of the
      present invention may be made and will become apparent to those
      skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Embodiments of the present invention provide methods,
      structures and systems for harvesting energy from electromagnetic
      radiation including, for example, harvesting energy from radiation
      in the infrared, near-infrared and visible light spectra.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Nano electromagnetic concentrator (NEC) structures may
      include an array or other periodic arrangement of resonant
      structures (also referred to as antennas, micro-antennas, and
      nano-antennas). It is noted that NEC structures may include, but
      are not limited to, FSS structures. Generally, the NEC structures
      may be formed by a conductive material formed in a specific
      pattern on a dielectric substrate to create the resonance
      elements. These NEC structures may be used for spectral
      modification of reflected or transmitted incident radiation. The
      resonant properties of these structures are largely dependent on
      the structure's layout in terms of shape, dimension, periodicity,
      the structure's material properties, and optical parameters of the
      surrounding media. It has been demonstrated that by varying the
      NEC geometry, material properties, or combinations thereof, it is
      possible to tune the resonance of an NEC structure to meet
      specific design requirements. However, as previously noted,
      attempts to scale NEC structures for use in, for example, the
      infrared (IR), near-IR and visible light spectra have posed
      particular problems because of the inhomogenous behavior of
      materials at the scales necessary to function at such wavelengths
      and frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring to FIG. 1, a partial plan view, or top view, of
      an energy harvesting device 100 is shown that includes various
      resonance structures or elements 102 (sometimes referred to herein
      as nanoantennas) formed in a substrate 104. In the embodiment
      described with respect to FIG. 1, the resonance elements 102 are
      shown as exhibiting substantially square loop geometries. However,
      as will be shown with other embodiments described herein, the
      resonance elements 102 may exhibit other geometries and the
      example embodiments described herein are not to be taken as
      limiting with respect to such potential geometries.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] With continued reference to FIG. 1, FIG. 2 is a
      cross-sectional view of the device 100 shown in FIG. 1. As seen in
      FIG. 2, the resonance elements 102 may be partially disposed
      within the substrate 104. In other embodiments, such resonance
      elements 102 may be substantially on an exterior surface of
      substrate 104. A ground surface or ground plane 106 may be formed,
      for example, on a surface of the substrate 104 at a desired
      distance from the resonance elements 102. Cavities 108 may be
      formed in the substrate 104 between resonance elements 102 and the
      ground plane 106. In one embodiment, the cavities 108 may be
      substantially unfilled (or, in other words, filled with air), or
      they may be filled with a desired substance, including dielectric
      material 110, that exhibits, for example, one or more desired
      optical properties or characteristics. In one embodiment, the
      distance S extending between the resonance elements 102 and the
      ground plane 106 (which distance may also be the height of the
      cavities 108), may be approximately equal to one-quarter ([1/4])
      of a wavelength of an associated frequency at which the resonance
      elements 102 are intended to resonate. This spacing forms what may
      be termed an optical resonance gap or an optical resonance
      stand-off layer between the resonance elements 102 and the ground
      plane 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The resonance elements 102 may be formed of an electrically
      conductive material. The conductive material may include, for
      example, a metal or combination of metals such as manganese (Mn),
      gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), platinum (Pt),
      nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), or any other suitable
      electrically conductive material. In one embodiment, the
      conductivity of the material used to form the resonance elements
      102 may be from approximately 1.0*10&lt;6
      &gt;Ohms&lt;-1&gt;-cm&lt;-1 &gt;to approximately 106.0*10&lt;6
      &gt;Ohms&lt;-1&gt;-cm&lt;-1&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Additionally, as noted above, the resonance elements 102
      may exhibit a variety of geometries. As non-limiting examples,
      such geometries may include circular loops, concentric loops,
      square spirals, circular spirals, slots, and crosses. Moreoever,
      an energy harvesting device 100 may include numerous different
      geometries of resonance elements 102 formed on or in the substrate
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The substrate 104 of the device 100 may include a
      dielectric material. As non-limiting examples, the substrate 104
      may comprise a semiconductor-based material including silicon,
      silicon-on-insulator (SOI) or silicon-on-sapphire (SOS)
      technology, doped and undoped semiconductor materials, epitaxial
      layers of silicon supported by a base semiconductor foundation,
      and other semiconductor structures. In addition, the semiconductor
      material need not be silicon-based, but may be based on
      silicon-germanium, silicon-on-insulator, silicon-on-sapphire,
      germanium, or gallium arsenide, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As other non-limiting examples, the substrate 104 may
      comprise a flexible material selected to be compatible with energy
      transmission of a desired wavelength, or range of wavelengths, of
      light. The substrate 104 may be formed from a variety of flexible
      materials such as a thermoplastic polymer or a moldable plastic.
      By way of other non-limiting examples, the substrate 104 may
      comprise polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylic, fluoropolymer,
      polystyrene, poly methylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyethylene
      terephthalate (MYLAR(R)), polyimide (e.g., KAPTON(R)), polyolefin,
      or any other material suitable for use as a substrate 104. In
      additional embodiments, the substrate 104 may comprise a binder
      with nanoparticles distributed therein, such as silicon
      nanoparticles distributed in a polyethylene binder, or ceramic
      nanoparticles distributed in an acrylic binder. Any type of
      substrate 104 may be used as long as it is compatible with the
      transmission of a desired wavelength within the spectrum of
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The ground plane 106 may also be formed of an electrically
      conductive material. The conductive material may include, for
      example, a metal or combination of metals such as manganese (Mn),
      gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), platinum (Pt),
      nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), or any other material
      suitable for use as an electrically conductive material. The
      ground plane 106 may also exhibit surface properties that make it
      a good optical reflector, with minimal diffusion and scattering of
      the electromagnetic energy. In one embodiment, the conductivity of
      the material used to form the resonance elements 102 may be from
      approximately 40.0*10&lt;6 &gt;Ohms&lt;-1&gt;-cm&lt;-1 &gt;to
      approximately 106.0*10&lt;6 &gt;Ohms&lt;-1&gt;-cm&lt;-1&gt;.
      Additionally, the ground plane 106 may exhibit a reflectivity of
      approximately 95% or greater over the full bandwidth of intended
      operation of the device 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] As noted hereinabove, in one embodiment, the cavities 108
      may simply be filled with air. The use of air may provide
      desirable performance characteristics of the device 100 with
      respect to optical refraction and permittivity at locations
      extending immediately between the resonance elements 102 and the
      ground plane 106. However in other embodiments, a dielectric
      material 110 may be disposed within the cavity 108. For example,
      the cavities 108 may include a material 110 such as silicon
      nanoparticles dispersed in a polyethylene binder, silicon dioxide
      (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), aluminum oxynitride (AlON), or silicon
      nitride (Si3N4). In additional embodiments, material such as
      polymers, rubbers, silicone rubbers, cellulose materials,
      ceramics, glass, or crystals may be disposed in the cavities 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In some embodiments, an overcoat or protective layer may be
      formed on one or more surfaces of the device 100. For example, a
      protective layer 112 (shown by dashed lines in FIG. 2) may
      comprise a flexible material such as polyethylene, silicon
      nanoparticles dispersed in a polyethylene binder, polypropylene,
      MYLAR(R) polymer, or KAPTON(R) polymer. In some embodiments, the
      protective layer 112 may be configured to protect one or more
      components of the device 100 from environmental damage, such as
      corrosion caused by moisture or caustic chemicals. The material
      used to form the protective layer 112 may be based on desired
      electro-optic properties so as to enhance transmission, or at
      least not impede transmission, of electromagnetic radiation to the
      resonance elements 102, the ground plane 106 and the cavities 108.
      In this manner, the overcoat may be used to emulate environmental
      conditions that could otherwise influence the resonance properties
      of the resonance elements 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It is noted that, in some instances, the protective layer
      112 might introduce some undesirable behavior in the solar region,
      including trapped antenna grating lobes resulting in loss of
      energy and a reduction in omni-directional reception of solar
      energy or other electromagnetic radiation. As such, an
      anti-reflective coating may be used to compensate for these
      undesirable features in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one embodiment, a coating may be applied as a final "top
      coat" and may be sputtered on using, for example, a
      plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The
      coating may be applied as a thin-film having a tailored refractive
      index. Materials from which the top coat may be formed include,
      for example, silicon nitride, titanium dioxide, and amorphous
      silicon. The thickness of the protective layer 112 may be selected
      to produce destructive interference in undesired reflected energy
      and constructive interference in the desired transmitted energy.
      In some embodiments, protective layer 112 may be manufactured as a
      separate layer and subsequently over-laid and adhered to the
      device 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The energy harvesting device 100 may be manufactured using
      a variety of techniques including a variety of semiconductor
      fabrication techniques, nanofabrication techniques and other
      processes as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the
      art depending, in part, on the materials used to form the device
      100.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Still referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, one particular embodiment
      of the invention may include a substrate 104 formed of
      polyethylene, with the resonance elements 102 and the ground plane
      106 formed of gold. The cavities 108 may be filled with air or
      with a material 110 including silicon nanoparticles dispersed in a
      polyethylene binder. It is noted that the use of polyethylene as a
      substrate 104 (or other similar material) provides the device 100
      with flexibility such that it may be mounted and installed in a
      variety of locations and adapted to a variety of uses.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The dimensions of the various components may vary
      depending, for example, on the frequency at which the resonance
      elements 102 are desired to resonate and the materials used to
      form the various components of the device 100. For example, in one
      embodiment, the thickness H of the substrate 104 may be from 3
      [mu]m to approximately 15 [mu]m. The width W of the traces or
      individual elements forming the resonance elements 102 may be from
      approximately 100 nanometers (nm) to approximately 400 nm. In one
      particular example, the width W may be from approximately 200 nm
      to approximately 300 nm. The thickness T of the resonance elements
      102 may be from approximately 30 nm to approximately 150 nm. The
      inside length L between traces or individual elements of a given
      resonance element 102 may be from approximately 1 [mu]m to
      approximately 10 [mu]m. The distance X between individual
      resonance elements 102 may be from approximately 100 nm to
      approximately 400 nm. In one particular example, the distance X
      between resonance elements 102 may be from approximately 200 nm to
      approximately 300 nm. The thickness Y of the ground plane 106 may
      be approximately 20 nm to approximately 1 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Various geometries and dimensions of components of the
      device 100 may be determined, for example, using appropriate
      modeling techniques. For example, copending U.S. Pat. No.
      7,792,644, titled "METHODS, COMPUTER READABLE MEDIA, AND GRAPHICAL
      USER INTERFACES FOR ANALYSIS OF FREQUENCY SELECTIVE SURFACES,"
      describes a method of analyzing structures and components that may
      be used as an NEC (such as the device 100 of the presently
      described embodiments) and determining the response of such
      structures using, in one example, a Periodic Method of Moments
      analysis and taking into consideration a number of different
      variables such as anticipated operational frequencies, material
      properties, and component dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] During operation of the energy harvesting device 100, the
      device 100 may be exposed to electromagnetic radiation such as,
      for example, that which is provided by the sun or that which is
      reradiated by the earth after having absorbed energy from the sun.
      Some of the radiation will be absorbed by the resonance elements
      102 as incident radiation and as indicated by reference numeral
      120. In one embodiment, the resonance elements 102 are configured
      to resonate at a frequency that corresponds with the frequency of
      the radiation to which the energy harvesting device 100 is
      exposed. For example, the resonance elements 102 may be configured
      to resonate at a frequency in one of the infrared, near-infrared,
      or visible light spectra. In one embodiment, the resonance
      elements 102 may be configured with a resonant frequency of
      between approximately 20 Terahertz (THz) and approximately 1,000
      THz (or at wavelengths of approximately 0.3 [mu]m to approximately
      15.0 [mu]m), which corresponds generally to the visible to the
      mid-infrared spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As such, an electrical resonance takes place in the
      resonance elements 102 such that electrons on the surface of the
      resonance elements 102 oscillate and produce an electrical
      current. Radiation that is not immediately absorbed by the
      resonance elements 102 may pass through the substrate 104 and
      reflect off of the ground plane 106. Some of the reflected
      radiation may then be absorbed by the resonance elements 102 as
      indicated by reference numeral 122. Some of the radiation that is
      reflected, but not immediately absorbed, may resonate within the
      optical resonance gap as indicated by reference numeral 124. The
      optical resonance gap or stand-off layer helps to increase the
      efficiency of the energy captured or absorbed by the resonance
      elements 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] As schematically indicated in FIGS. 1 and 2, an energy
      transfer element 130, as shown by dashed lines, may be associated
      with the resonance elements 102 to assist in harvesting the energy
      produced by the resonance elements 102 when exposed to
      electromagnetic radiation at the appropriate frequency. For
      example, the energy transfer element 130 may include a capacitor
      structure coupled with a resonance element 102 so as to develop a
      charge based on the current produced within the associated
      resonance element 102. Such an energy transfer element 130 may,
      for example, be disposed adjacent a resonance element 102 such as
      adjacent or within an associated cavity 108. As noted above, the
      energy transfer element 130 is shown schematically in FIGS. 1 and
      2. Additional details regarding potential embodiments utilizing
      more specific embodiments of energy transfer elements are
      discussed hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, there may be an energy transfer element
      130 associated with each resonance element 102 and a plurality of
      energy transfer elements 130 may be coupled together to a common
      storage device, such as a battery, or to processing equipment such
      as a system for converting or conditioning the power provided by
      the resonance elements 102 and the plurality of energy transfer
      elements 130. In another embodiment, multiple resonance elements
      102 may be electrically coupled with a common energy transfer
      element 130. In one such embodiment, a plurality of resonance
      elements 102 may have feedpoints coupled to a common energy
      transfer element 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Turning now to FIG. 3, a resonance element 102' according
      to another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The
      resonance element 102' may be configured to exhibit a geometry of
      what may be termed square or angular spirals. Such spirals may
      include a first portion 140 that spirals inwardly to a termination
      point 142 and a second portion 144 that is essentially a reversed
      image (both vertically and horizontally) and spirals inwardly to a
      termination point 146. The first portion 140 and the second
      portion 144 are cooperatively interleaved with one another such
      that their respective termination points 142 and 146 are
      positioned proximate one another. The termination points 142 and
      146 may act as feedpoints for an energy transfer element 130' such
      as further described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As shown in FIG. 4, an array of resonance elements 102' may
      be used to form an apparatus configured generally similarly to the
      embodiment previously described with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2. For
      example, while not specifically shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the
      resonance elements 102' may be disposed on or in a substrate
      material that has a ground plane associated therewith.
      Additionally, optical resonance gaps or stand-off layers may be
      formed in the substrate material and associated with the resonance
      elements 102'. Such resonance elements 102' may be sized and
      configured to resonate at a desired frequency (e.g., at a
      frequency in the visible, IR or near-IR spectra or at frequencies
      or wavelengths described elsewhere herein). Similarly, optical
      resonance gaps or stand-off layers may be configured in accordance
      with an identified frequency of radiation at which the apparatus
      is intended to be exposed. A density of resonance elements on the
      array may be from approximately fifty billion per square meter to
      approximately one hundred ten billion per square meter.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Turning now to FIGS. 5 and 6, another embodiment of an
      apparatus 200 is shown. The apparatus 200 may include one or more
      resonance elements 102 exhibiting a first configuration (e.g.,
      exhibiting a desired geometry, size, material property or
      combination thereof) and one or more resonance elements 202
      exhibiting a second configuration. For the sake of convenience and
      clarity in describing such an embodiment, only one of each
      configuration of resonance elements 102 and 202 is shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In the embodiment shown, one resonance element 202 may be
      nested within the other resonance element 102, although in other
      embodiments the resonance elements 102 and 202 may be positioned
      laterally adjacent to one another or in other spatial
      arrangements. In one embodiment, such as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6,
      each of the resonance elements 102 and 202 may exhibit similar
      geometries but different dimensions. In another embodiment, while
      not specifically shown, a first resonance element may be
      configured to exhibit a different geometry than that of a second
      resonance element. For example, a first resonance element may be
      configured as a loop, while a second resonance element may be
      configured as a spiral.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] As previously described, a cavity 108 may be associated
      with the resonance element 102 of the first configuration.
      Likewise, a cavity 208 may be associated with the resonance
      element 202 exhibiting the second configuration. The two resonance
      elements 102 and 202, along with their associated cavities 108 and
      208, may be located on the same side of a common ground plane 206,
      as shown in FIG. 6. The two different resonant elements 102 and
      202 may be spaced different distances from the common ground plane
      106 so as to effectively define two different optical resonant
      gaps or stand-off layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The two resonance elements 102 and 202 are configured to
      resonate at different frequencies. For example, in one embodiment,
      one array of resonance elements may be configured to resonate at a
      frequency associated with visible light, while another array of
      resonance elements may be configured to resonate at frequencies
      associated with what may be referred to as "long wavelength IR."
      Thus, the two resonance elements 102 and 202 may provide an
      ability to simultaneously harvest energy at multiple,
      substantially different frequencies, or to harvest energy at
      substantially different frequencies at different times based on
      anticipated changing radiation conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Referring briefly to FIG. 7, a cross-sectional view of an
      apparatus 300 in accordance with yet another embodiment of the
      present invention is shown. The apparatus 300 includes one or more
      resonance elements 102 of a first configuration (e.g., exhibiting
      a desired geometry, size, material property or combination
      thereof) and one or more resonance elements 302 exhibiting a
      second configuration. For the sake of convenience and clarity in
      describing such an embodiment, only one of each configuration of
      resonance elements 102 and 302 is shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As previously described, a cavity 108 may be associated
      with the resonance element 102 of the first configuration.
      Likewise, a cavity 308 may be associated with the resonance
      element 302 exhibiting the second configuration. The first
      resonance element 102 and associated cavity 108 (or the plurality
      of resonance elements 102 and associated cavities 108) may be
      associated with a first substrate 304A located on a first side of
      a ground plane 306 while the second resonance element 302 and
      associated cavity 308 (or plurality thereof) may be associated
      with another substrate 304B located on an opposing side of the
      ground plane 306.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The two resonance elements 102 and 302 are configured to
      resonate at different frequencies. Being on opposite sides of the
      ground plane 306, the resonance elements 102 and 302 are also
      oriented for exposure to different sources of radiation. For
      example, the resonance element or elements 102 of the first
      configuration may be configured and oriented to harvest energy
      based on incident radiation from the sun. On the other hand, the
      resonance element or elements 302 of the second configuration may
      be configured and oriented to harvest energy that is reradiated
      from the earth (e.g., at nighttime). Such an apparatus 300 would
      enable collection of energy from dual sources at different
      frequencies and being transmitted from different locations.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the
      art, the different embodiments described herein may be combined or
      modified in a variety of ways. For example, the embodiments
      described with respect to FIGS. 6 and 7 may be combined such that
      multiple different configurations of resonance elements 102, 202,
      302 may be disposed in or on the associated substrates (e.g.,
      substrates 104, 304A and 304B). Additionally, when multiple
      resonance elements are being utilized, different geometries may be
      intermixed in a device. In other words, a single device may
      include a variety of combinations of geometries including those
      previously described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Referring now to FIG. 8, a block diagram is shown of an
      illustrative energy harvesting system 400 according to an
      embodiment of the present invention. The energy harvesting system
      400 includes device 100, and apparatus 200, 300 that capture and
      concentrate electromagnetic radiation at desired resonant
      frequencies. The system 400 may further include at least one
      energy conversion element 402 (that may include energy transfer
      elements 130 or 130', FIGS. 1-3), which may convert and transfer
      the electromagnetic energy captured by the device 100, and
      apparatus 200, 300 during the harvesting process. The system 400
      may further comprise an energy storage device 404 such as, for
      example, a lithium or polymer-form factor battery. In one example,
      the energy storage device 404 may be trickle-charged by voltage
      from the energy conversion element 402. The system 400 may further
      include a power management system 406 for controlling the flow of
      energy between the energy conversion element 402 and the energy
      storage device 404. The energy storage device 404 may also be
      operatively coupled to an external component or system requiring
      energy (not shown). In some embodiments, one or more systems 400
      may be coupled to provide higher currents or voltages as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Referring now to FIG. 9, a schematic is shown (showing
      cross-sections of certain components) of an energy conversion
      system 450 according to one embodiment of the invention. The
      energy conversion system 450 includes antenna elements 452 (or
      resonance elements) parasitically coupled to a capacitive storage
      element 458. The antenna elements 452 may be configured as a
      dipole planar array.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Capacitive coupling is the transfer of energy within an
      electrical network by means of the capacitance between circuit
      nodes. Parasitic capacitive coupling can be effected by placing
      two conductors within close enough proximity such that radiated
      E-fields crosstalk. Such a system is generally analogous to a
      charge-coupled device (CCD). Thus, the transfer of Terahertz
      current from the antenna elements 452 does not require a direct or
      "physical" electrical connection (e.g., a wire or conductive
      trace).<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The antenna element 452 has a known resistance, such
      resistance being a function of sheet resistance of, for example, a
      bulk metal of which the antenna element 452 is fabricated.
      Electromagnetic energy, as shown by arrows in FIG. 9, impinges on
      the antenna elements 452 and induces surface currents. The
      currents propagate to the center feedpoint 456 of each antenna
      element 452. Each antenna element 452 has a dedicated and
      electrically isolated capacitive plate 460 that serves as a node
      for collection of charge, which is proportional to the
      electromagnetic energy intensity that is exciting the antenna
      element 452 to a resonance condition. An E-field transfers energy
      from the center feedpoint 456 to a capacitive plate 458. The
      capacitive plates 458 and 460 share a common dielectric region 462
      and a common underlying grid or plate 464. In effect this serves
      as a capacitor array, and accumulates an electric charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The rate of charge of the capacitor array is a function of
      the RC (resistance-capacitance) time constant of the system. This
      time constant is determined by the antenna impedance and
      capacitance of an associated storage element. The time constant is
      the time required for the charge (or discharge) current to fall to
      1/e being Euler's number or the natural logarithm base) of its
      initial value. After approximately five time constants the
      capacitor is 99% charged. The capacitor will charge and discharge
      as the THz alternating current fluctuates.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] At some period associated with the rate of charge, a
      control circuit will transfer the collected charge into an
      amplifier that converts the charge into a voltage. The control
      circuit may be implemented with conventional electronic circuitry
      as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. The
      charge circuit, in effect, rectifies the THz current. The power
      may be further filtered, conditioned and stored for long-term use.
      Multiple devices may be interconnected in series to increase
      wattage.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Referring to FIG. 10, a perspective view is shown of an
      energy conversion system 500 according to another embodiment of
      the present invention. The energy conversion system 500 includes
      antenna elements directly coupled to capacitive storage elements.
      The antenna elements may include an array of apertures or slots
      502 configured as antenna structures. The slots 502 may be formed,
      for example, by systematic removal of material from a
      substantially uniform conductive sheet 506. The electric field
      induced in a slot by an incident electromagnetic wave is
      equivalent to magnetic current density. A voltage distribution
      results that can be used for capacitive storage of energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] As noted above, the slots 502 may be fabricated into an
      electrically conductive layer 506. This electrically conductive
      layer 506 may also function as an upper capacitive plate. The
      capacitive storage device is completed by placing a dielectric
      material 508 between the slot layer 506 and an electrically
      conductive material layer 510 (which may also serve as a ground
      plane of the energy conversion system 500, such as discussed
      hereinabove). In one embodiment, the dielectric material 508 may
      exhibit a thickness (i.e., the distance between the slot layer 506
      and the electrically conductive material layer 510) that is a
      quarter ([1/4]) wavelength of the wavelength of radiation (shown
      by arrows) that is anticipated to impinge on the energy conversion
      system 500. This thickness provides an optical resonance gap or
      stand-off layer to properly phase the electromagnetic wave for
      maximum absorption in the antenna plane. Additionally, the
      dielectric material 508 exhibits a desired permittivity to enable
      concentration and storage of electrostatic lines of flux.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The capacitance is proportional to the surface area of the
      conductive plates (506 and 510) and the permittivity of the
      dielectric material 508. Due to the resonance behavior of the slot
      antennas, a charge will accumulate on the upper capacitor plate
      (slot layer 506). A voltage develops across the slot layer 506 and
      the electrically conductive material layer 510. When there is a
      difference in electric charge between the plates or layers 506 and
      510, an electric field is created in the region therebetween, the
      electric field being proportional to the amount of charge that has
      been moved from one plate to the other.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The presently described embodiment provides the ability to
      directly acquire a capacitor voltage by electrical discharge
      across the capacitor. The slot layer 506 is configured as a
      continuous conductor, rather than as the discrete conducting
      elements, such as have been described with respect to other
      embodiments hereinabove. The slot layer 506 serves as the upper
      electrode and the electrically conductive material layer 510, or
      ground plane, serves as the lower electrode. The dielectric
      material 508 serves as the stand-off layer. A control circuit will
      transfer the collected voltage to a storage device (not shown).
      The control circuit may be implemented with conventional
      electronic circuitry components known to those of ordinary skill
      in the art. As with other embodiments described herein, multiple
      devices may be interconnected in series to increase wattage.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Referring to FIGS. 11A and 11B, schematics are shown of an
      energy conversion system 550 according to another embodiment of
      the present invention. The energy conversion system 550 includes
      one or more antenna elements 552 with a rectifier diode element
      554 embedded into the antenna element 552. At optical frequencies,
      the skin depth of an electromagnetic wave in metals is just a few
      nanometers. This results in a high resistivity causing THz AC
      (alternating current) currents to dissipate in the form of Joule
      heating if the transmission line is over a few microns in length.
      To reduce transmission losses the AC current is substantially
      immediately rectified. Rectification may be performed using a
      metal-semiconductor-metal Schottky junction. THz radiation excites
      surface current waves in the antenna elements 552. The received AC
      waves are rectified to DC (direct current) with the rectifier
      diode element 554.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Conventional rectification devices are not suitable for use
      at the frequencies at which the antenna elements 552 will
      resonate. Rather, the rectification of electromagnetic waves at
      the high frequency range of THz radiation is performed with using
      metal-on-metal (MoM) Schottky-diodes. Such MoM devices include a
      thin barrier layer and an oxide layer sandwiched between two metal
      electrodes. An MoM device works when a large enough field causes
      the tunneling of electrons across the barrier layer. A difference
      in the work function between the metal Schottky junctions results
      in high speed rectification. Examples of MoM materials include
      Au-Si-Ti and InGaAs/InP.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The increased cutoff frequency (to THz) is achieved by
      reducing the diode capacitance to the atto-farad range and also by
      reducing contact resistance. This is achieved by forming a gate
      region on the order of, for example, 30 nm in a T-gate
      configuration. Due to the small junction area, it is believed that
      low enough junction capacitance will be maintained to sustain
      THz-rate switching times.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Components may be impedance matched to ensure maximum power
      transfer between components, to minimize reflection losses, and
      achieve THz switch speeds. Proper impedance matching may be
      achieved by connecting the feedpoint of the antenna structure
      through a co-planar strip (CPS) transmission line 556 to the
      rectifier diode elements 554. The output of the rectifier diode
      elements 554 may be DC coupled together. In one embodiment, the
      rectifier diode elements 554 may be interconnected in series,
      resulting in a summation of DC voltage. This enables the use of a
      common power bus 558.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] It is noted that in certain embodiments, such as the one
      described with respect to FIGS. 11A and 11B, the collection
      elements (i.e., the antenna or resonance elements) may have a
      termination or feedpoint such as has been described herein, and
      that electrical current is transferred from the collection element
      (e.g., antenna element 552) to the transfer or conversion element
      (e.g., rectifier diode element 554). The current produced by the
      collection element is AC with a sinusoidal frequency of between
      10&lt;12 &gt;and 10&lt;14 &gt;hertz. The high-efficiency
      transmission of electrons along a wire at THz frequencies is not a
      conventional practice. Thus, as described with respect to FIGS.
      11A and 11B, this may be accomplished through the use of a
      co-planar strip transmission line (e.g., transmission line 556)
      that is specifically designed for high speed and low propagation
      loss.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Conventional design methods commonly used to design strip
      transmission lines at microwave frequencies are not fully valid at
      IR frequencies. Thus, frequency dependent modeling may be employed
      to characterize transmission line behavior such as has been
      indicated hereinabove with respect to other components of various
      embodiments. At THz frequencies the propagating electromagnetic
      field is not totally confined to the conductor. The resulting
      dispersive nature of the E-fields may result in potential losses
      from impacts of the surrounding media, including stray leakage
      through dielectric materials and substrate boundaries. Design of
      the CPS takes into account, for example, impedance matching to
      reduce standing wave ratio (SWR) and tailoring permittivity of
      adjacent media to reduce refraction in order to improve power
      transfer from the antenna elements to the conversion elements and
      improve the efficiency of the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] It is noted that the CPS conductor size and spacing between
      the balanced transmission lines also impact characteristic
      impedance. The optical properties of the strip line metal,
      including index of refraction (n) and extinction coefficient (k)
      may be analyzed and used to derive frequency dependent
      conductivity properties. Tailoring the physical design of the
      strip line helps to maximize power transfer. The strip line may be
      designed to match the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of
      the conversion element. In another embodiment, to further reduce
      transmission line loss, the conversion element may be physically
      located substantially co-planar with the antenna.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Referring to FIG. 12, a perspective, partial
      cross-sectional view is shown of an energy conversion system 600
      system according to another embodiment of the present invention.
      The energy conversion system 600 may include antenna elements 602
      formed on a thin film substrate 604. The thin film substrate 604
      may include a flexible material such as, for example,
      polyethylene. A ground plane is not utilized in this embodiment.
      The antenna elements 602 may be configured to collect
      electromagnetic radiation in the visible and infrared bands. As
      shown in FIG. 12, the antenna elements 602 may include spiral loop
      antenna elements having a central feedpoint 606. The complementary
      geometry of the antenna elements 602 generate surface currents
      that are additive and focus radiant energy at the central
      feedpoint 606 of the antenna elements 602. A photovoltaic (PV)
      material 608 may be placed in proximity to the antenna's feedpoint
      606 for conversion of the energy collected by the antenna elements
      602.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In the currently described embodiment, the thin-film
      substrate 604 and associated antenna elements 602 may be overlaid,
      laminated or bonded to photovoltaic (PV) material 608, which may
      include, for example, commercially available PV materials. The
      antenna elements 602 capture and focus energy (shown by arrows)
      into each associated feedpoint 606 of each antenna element 602
      analogous to the focal point of an optical lens. The antenna
      elements 602 are designed for resonance at the bandgap energy of
      the PV material 608. The concentrated, radiant energy is
      capacitively coupled (no direct wiring required) to the PV
      material 608. This induces electron-hole transfer in the PV
      material 608 and initiates the solar energy conversion process.
      Conventional methods used to collect and store DC energy from the
      PV material 608 may then be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The use of antenna elements (e.g., micro-antennas or
      nano-antennas), with an omni-directional field-of-view, such as
      provided by the antenna elements described herein, enables
      modification of the angular reception characteristics of
      conventional solar cells, leading to higher collection efficiency
      independent of the angle of incidence of the sun. It is further
      noted that a-Si, amorphous silicon (a leading material for PV) has
      an intrinsic light induced degradation. In the presently described
      embodiment, the antenna layer serves as a "top coat" or protective
      layer for the PV material 608 providing environmental protection
      and reducing the effects of degradation.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Referring to FIG. 13, a schematic is shown of an energy
      conversion system 650 according to another embodiment of the
      present invention. In this embodiment, an antenna element 652 may
      have a PV material 654 embedded in, or coupled with, the feedpoint
      656 thereof. The THz currents of the antenna element 652 are
      directly coupled to the PV material 654, achieving a high
      efficiency electron-hole transfer in the PV material 654 and
      corresponding generation of DC current. Different antenna
      geometries may be designed with peak resonances to match
      specialized multi-band gapped engineered PV materials. By
      combining the efficiency, bandwidth, and omni-directional
      field-of-view of the antenna element 652 with exotic energy
      capturing materials, it is possible to reduce the amount and cost
      of PV material 654 required. This enables an economical
      manufacturing of high power density PV devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The embodiments described with respect to FIGS. 12 and 13
      effectively concentrate infrared and visible energy onto
      photovoltaic materials to greatly improve operational efficiency,
      durability, and cost effectiveness of solar generated electricity.
      The use of micro-antennas and nano-antennas make it possible to
      use sub-wavelength sized PV materials such as bandgap-engineering
      superlattice materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Referring now to FIG. 14, a schematic of an energy
      conversion system 700 is shown in accordance with yet another
      embodiment of the present invention. The energy conversion system
      700 includes a plurality of antenna elements 702 disposed in
      cavities 704 formed in a substrate 706. Capacitors 708 may also be
      disposed in the cavities 704 between the antenna elements 702 and
      the ground plane 710 to function as energy transfer elements. For
      example, a dielectric material 712 may be disposed on top of the
      antenna elements 702 to electrically insulate them from other
      components. The sidewalls of the cavities 704 may be lined with,
      for example, carbon nanotubes 714. Carbon nanostructures have
      excellent nanoporosity geometries which, it is believed, will
      enable high efficiency dielectric and energy storage properties. A
      dielectric material 716 may be disposed in the remaining portion
      of the cavity 704 to complete the capacitor structure. The
      capacitors 708 may be coupled to a common power bus 718.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Embodiments of the present invention, such as have been
      described above, may include apparatuses or devices that are
      amenable to installation and use in a variety of locations and
      conjunction with a variety of applications. For example, since the
      apparatuses may be formed using flexible substrates, they may be
      integrated into structures or devices having complex and contoured
      surfaces. Such apparatuses may be integrated into, for example,
      clothing, backpacks, automobiles (or other transportation
      apparatuses), consumer electronics, and a variety of other types
      of devices and structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Although the present invention has been described with
      reference to particular embodiments, the present invention is not
      limited to these described embodiments. Rather, the present
      invention is limited only by the appended claims, which include
      within their scope all equivalent devices or methods that operate
      according to the principles of the present invention as described.<br>
