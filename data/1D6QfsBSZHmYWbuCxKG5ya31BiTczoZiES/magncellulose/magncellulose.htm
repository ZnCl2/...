            Loudspeakers: <br>
            Potential for Magnetic Cellulose Comes in Crisp and Clear</b></big><br>

      <br>
      Nov. 20, 2013 — They're flat, ultra-thin and great-sounding. The
      world's first known magnetic cellulose loudspeakers have been
      demonstrated at KTH.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the ages, Swedes have relied on their country's vast
      forests as a source of sustenance and economic growth. Now add the
      world's first magnetic cellulose membrane loudspeakers to the list
      of products that can be produced from wood.<br>
      <br>
      These flat, sonorous and environmentally-friendly speakers are
      made with a new material derived from wood pulp -- magnetic
      cellulose gel -- which was developed at Stockholm's KTH Royal
      Institute of Technology. Unlike ordinary speakers, they require no
      heavy permanent magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Richard Olsson, a KTH researcher in chemical sciences who
      supervised the doctoral research behind the magnetic cellulose
      gel, says the new material may open the way for innovations in
      such areas as acoustic applications for automobiles.<br>
      <br>
      Olsson and his colleagues at KTH, Lars Berglund, also a researcher
      in chemical sciences, and Valter Ström, a scientist in engineering
      physics of materials, recently demonstrated the speakers for the
      first time. Their paper is published by the Royal Society of
      Chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      "This is, to our knowledge, the first reported magnetic speaker
      membrane," Olsson says. He adds that the sound quality is at least
      as good as in conventional speakers -- possibly better because of
      the even distribution of forces created in the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      The idea is to show the potential of natural and
      environmentally-sustainable materials in everyday products. "We
      want to use this first prototype to see how the cellulose can be
      used in new applications," he says.<br>
      <br>
      He and his research colleagues have patented the material, which
      was created by attaching magnetic nanoparticles to cellulose
      nanofibrils. The cellulose comes from renewable wood pulp and
      involves environmentally-friendly water chemistry. The gel is cast
      into a membrane which is then allowed to dry. The membrane's
      strength is that it has a rapid reaction capability, which means a
      high degree of precision in sound reproduction.<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary speakers include a large permanent magnet. The speaker
      cone's movement, which creates sound waves, is driven by a voice
      coil that is wrapped around the permanent magnet and attached to
      the cone.<br>
      <br>
      With the cellulose membrane speakers, the magnetic particles are
      part of the membrane itself. The KTH speaker has a coil, but it
      has no direct contact with the cone, so the only thing that
      creates sound is the movement of air. All of these components can
      be manufactured at a very small scale.<br>
      <br>
      The technology has potentially other uses, he says. "We want to
      look at applications for the material that are driven by magnetic
      fields. It may, for example, be a form of active damping for cars
      and trains." It could also involve technology that cancels out
      noise.<br>
      <br>
      Research in materials from the Swedish forests is conducted at
      Wallenberg Wood Science Center (WWSC). The doctoral students in
      the project are Sylvain Gallan, Richard Andersson and Michaela
      Salajkova.<br>

      The present invention relates to cellulose nanofibrils decorated
      with magnetic nanoparticles as well as a method for the
      preparation thereof and a material comprising the nanofibrils.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Magnetic nanoparticles with large surface to bulk ratio is a
      growing area of interest. Considering the potentially large area
      of application of magnetic nanoparticles, as filler materials of
      various polymer materials, it can easily be understood that their
      relatively poor representation in comparison to micron-sized
      filler materials in polymers is an effect of the difficulties
      related to the processing of high-surface area nanoparticles. The
      explanation mainly lies in the fact that large surface areas also
      brings problems in achieving uniformly distributed nanoparticle
      systems due to the favoured particle-particle interaction in com-
      parison to particle-polymer/liquid interactions. The result is
      often severe agglomeration and aggregates of nanoparticles. The
      agglomerates in turn affect many macroscopic properties, such as
      mechanical, optical and magnetic etc. since these properties on a
      macroscopic scale are affected by the degree of close interaction
      at the nano scale level. In order to exploit the effects of
      nano-sized magnetic nanoparticles employed as fillers in organic
      matrix materials, the control over dispersion is therefore an
      unavoidable prerequisite.<br>
      <br>
      Ferrite-loaded membranes of microfibrillated cellulose have been
      prepared by mixing metal ions to a suspension of bacterial
      cellulose under N2 atmosphere before precipitation by NaOH
      followed by oxidation in atmospheric air. Ferrite particles were
      inclined to ag- gregate into lumps in the fibrillar network Sourty
      H.; et al., Chem. Mater. 1998, 10 7), 1755-1757). A magnetic paper
      made of kenaf has been prepared by precipitation of magnetic
      nanoparticles in a pulp suspension under anaerobic conditions.
      Chia C.H. et al., Am. Appl. Sci., 2006, 3 3), 1750-1754). Magnetic
      membranes with improved and controlled properties are of interest
      for purification/filtration (Dai Q., et al., Chem Soc Rev, 2010,
      39, 4057), magneto-responsive actuators (Hoare, T. et al., Nano
      Lett, 2009, 9, 3651. Behrens S., Nanoscale, 2011, 3, 877) as well
      as for large scale manufacturing of e.g. magneto-acoustic
      membranes, anti-counterfeiting papers, radio-frequency materials
      and flexible data storage. The magnetic nanocomposite membranes
      and films are classically derived from polymers mixed with surface
      modified functional magnetic nanoparticles (Behrens S., Nanoscale,
      2011, 3, 877). However, the dispersion of the high surface area
      nanoparticles is more challenging and nanoparticle agglomerates
      tend to form easily. Strength and failure properties are sensitive
      to such agglomerates so that the materials become brittle even at
      moderate nanoparticle loadings. The presence of agglomerates also
      makes it difficult to predict magnetic composite properties as
      related to intrinsic nanoparticle magnetics due to dipolar
      interactions (Ols- son R.T., et al., Polym Eng Sci, 2011, Article
      in Press). In addition, the classical preparation methods (Behrens
      S., Nanoscale, 2011, 3, 877) are time consuming and costly since
      in most cases they rely on empirical attempts to find particle
      surface coatings for improved dispersions (Balazs A.C., et al.,
      Science, 2006, 314, 1107). Recent progress in the field of
      bio-nanotechnologies has shed light on the possibilities offered
      by some naturally occurring nano-building blocks (Eichorn S.J., et
      al. J Mater Sci, 2010, 45, 1). At the smallest scales of the wood
      cell wall organization, cellulose I microfibrils (3-5nm wide)
      aggregate during wood pulping to form nanofibrils with dimensions
      in the range 5-20 nm in width and up to few micrometers in length.
      These entities can be re- leased from the pulp fiber cell wall by
      mechanical disintegration (A.F.Turbak, et al, J Appl Polym Sci,
      1983, 37, 815), which is facilitated by an enzymatic or chemical
      pre-treatment of the pulp fibers (M. Henriksson, et al., Eur Polym
      J, 2007, 43, 3434 and Saito T. et al., Biomacromolecules, 2007, 8,
      2485). Due to their intrinsically high strength and stiffness
      (modulus of crystal exceeding 130GPa (Sakurada I. et al., J Polym
      Sci, 1962, 57, 651)), long and slender cellulose nanofibrils (NFC)
      have interesting potential as nanoreinforce- ments in various
      composite materials. Furthermore, strong interfibril interactions
      allows formation of a variety of nanostructures, from dense
      nanopapersto ultra-light aerogels and foams (Henriksson, M. et
      al., Eur Polym J, 2007, 43, 3434; Paakko, M. et al., Soft Matter,
      2008,4, 2492; Sehaqui, H. et al., Soft Matter, 2010, 6, 1824; and
      Svagan, A.J. et al., JMa- ter Chem, 2010, 20, 6646). Here, the
      fibrillar interactions and the corresponding network structure
      provide favourable mechanical properties. Large-scale
      availability, origin from renewable resources, and low resource
      cost are advantages of forest-derived nano-building blocks.
      Bacterial cellulose nanofibril networks have been used as a
      template for precipitation of magnetic nanoparticles (R.T. Olsson,
      et al., Nat Nanotechnol, 2010, 5, 584). The method allowed to form
      cellulose-based magnetic aerogels, as well as dense membranes. A
      two- step method for preparing a magnetic nanoparticle cellulose
      material, wherein cobalt ferrite nanoparticles are evenly/finely
      distributed arranged on the scaffold of fibres inside the material
      is disclosed in WO2008/121069. The disclosed material is in the
      form of a hydrogel or aerogel and the fibres in the material are
      physically entangled. However, the methods are energy consuming
      due to the freeze-drying steps of the cellulose network prior to
      nanoparticle precipitation. Furthermore, the versatility for
      nanostructure formation is restricted by the characteristics of
      the network synthesized by the bacteria, which to some extent
      predicted the relative density/frequency of the magnetic
      nanoparticles as related to reactive sites for grafting the
      inorganic nanoparticles. A common problem with previous methods is
      to achieve reproducibly coated nanoparticles, making the combined
      mechanical and magnetic functionality of "classical" polymer
      matrix nanocomposites difficult to achieve. There is a need within
      the technical field of magnetic nanoparticle cellulose material to
      be able to tailor the magnetic properties of the material...<br>
