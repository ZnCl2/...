              Economy Technology</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The PICC, Pre-Ignition Catalytic Converter is a breakthrough
        new technology that could get your car up to five times the gas
        mileage!&nbsp; Its genius is its simplicity. Here’s how it
        works: </p>
      <p>Our scientific testing has led us to believe that the PICC will
        increase the mileage of all personal vehicles to over 100 miles
        per gallon (city or highway). </p>
      <p>Every car has a Catalytic Converter.&nbsp; The Catalytic
        Converter that is currently installed on your car is intended to
        help eliminate pollution and is located in your exhaust
        pipe.&nbsp; It works by breaking down the large gas molecules
        that were not burned in your engine and turns them into smaller
        particles that can be burned in your tailpipe before being
        released into the air, so less exhaust hits the
        environment.&nbsp; What if we could turn the gases you are
        throwing away via your exhaust into added mileage and power for
        your vehicle? </p>
      <p>In other words, what if we “cracked” the gas and broke it down
        into smaller particles before it went into the engine — not
        after the engine had wasted it?&nbsp; Everything you would
        otherwise be throwing away would now be burned IN YOUR ENGINE,
        providing additional mileage and power!&nbsp; Well, that is what
        we did!&nbsp; Using a magnetic and electrical reaction to break
        down the fuel molecules into their elemental state, the PICC
        creates a plasma, which burns super efficiently and
        cleanly!&nbsp; Our “Pre-Ignition” Catalytic Converter feeds the
        engine instead of the environment.&nbsp; So the gasoline you pay
        for goes further and the exhaust is so negligible it hardly
        registers. </p>
      <p><b>How To Get Started With Your PICC Conversion Now</b> </p>
      <p>The PICC is a customized application which is the second step
        in a two step process. While the PICC is being developed for
        your vehicle, the first step to savings can be acquired
        immediately, so you can begin the process and start increasing
        your gas mileage right away.&nbsp; Here’s how it works: </p>
      <p><b>The Hydro-Assist Fuel Cell (HAFC)</b> is a kit that is ready
        to install and give you savings while preparing the way for the
        PICC Revolution.&nbsp; Since the PICC will use the HAFC to
        pre-condition the fuel and help turn it into plasma, you can
        start saving with the HAFC and later upgrade to the completed
        PICC at your option.&nbsp; The HAFC is an established and proven
        technology that is already on the market.&nbsp; You may be so
        happy with the savings you get with the HAFC, you may not even
        want to upgrade.&nbsp; When you get a PICC Upgrade Quote, we
        will notify you of your expected increase in savings, and the
        decision will be yours.&nbsp; The best part is that you get all
        the savings from driving with the HAFC while you are waiting for
        even more of an increase in savings with the PICC. </p>

      <p>Inventors:&nbsp; Lee; Dennis; (Newfoundland, NJ) ; Holler;
        Michael; (Honey Grove, PA) <br>
        U.S. Current Class:&nbsp; 123/538; 123/3; 123/557 <br>
        Intern'l Class:&nbsp; F02M 27/02 20060101 F02M027/02 </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention improves combustion efficiency and
        reduces polluting combustion by-products of internal combustion
        engines by reforming the hydrocarbon fuel to render it more
        readily and completely combustible. This is accomplished by a
        pre-ignition fuel treatment system in which large, complex
        hydrocarbon molecules are "cracked" or broken down into smaller,
        simpler molecules. These simpler hydrocarbons are more readily
        combustible and produce fewer combustion by-products.
        Hydrocarbon "cracking" is a highly endothermic reaction, which
        means it requires a large amount of energy to complete the
        reaction. Therefore, hydrocarbon cracking must take place under
        conditions of high temperature and high pressure. The cracking
        process is facilitated by the presence of a catalystic material
        and/or by an electrochemical quasi-catalytic reaction. </p>
      <p>[0003] The present invention takes advantage of the high
        temperature, high pressure environment of the engine's exhaust
        gases to create a reaction zone in which the hydrocarbon
        molecules of the fuel are cracked. The hydrocarbon cracking
        reaction is facilitated by the insertion into the reaction zone
        of a reactor rod made of a magnetic material, which is
        preferably iron. Under the high temperature conditions of the
        reaction zone, the surface of the iron reactor rod becomes
        oxidized. It is known that iron oxides act as catalysts for
        various hydrocarbon cracking processes, as for example, in the
        hydrocarbon reforming processes taught by Setzer, et al., U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,451,578. </p>
      <p>[0004] As ionized fuel molecules and atoms are produced during
        the cracking process, moreover, their motion around the reactor
        rod generates an electromagnetic field which magnetizes the iron
        in the rod. As the iron rod itself magnetizes, the rod generates
        its own magnetic field, which further ionizes the fuel and
        accelerates the motion of the ionized particles. These
        accelerated ions then generate a still stronger electromagnetic
        field, which in turn induces even greater magnetism in the iron
        rod. Thus, the electrical-magnetic interaction of the ionized
        fuel and the reactor rod becomes a feedback loop that drives the
        process toward ever greater ionization until the complex
        hydrocarbons in the fuel are broken down into simpler
        hydrocarbons, which are in a plasma state. This is an
        electrochemical quasi-catalytic reaction that can proceed even
        in the absence of a catalytic material in the reactor rod. </p>
      <p>[0005] The "Background of the Invention" discussion of
        application Ser. No. 11/889,226, which is incorporated herein by
        reference, explains that the prior art patents in this field,
        and specifically Pantone, U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,601, and Jonson,
        U.S. Pat. No. 7,194,984, fail to provide the proper environment
        in the reaction zone to sustain an endothermic hydrocarbon
        cracking process. An important distinction between the present
        invention and the Pantone and Jonson patents is the total
        absence in the prior art of either catalytic reactor rods or an
        electrochemical quasi-catalytic process. Without such catalytic
        and/or quasi-catalytic reactions, hydrocarbon cracking simply
        cannot occur in the temperature range of engine exhaust gases.
        Consequently, the prior art fails to disclose an apparatus and
        process capable of cracking hydrocarbon fuel and converting it
        into a genuine plasma so as to truly improve the fuel's
        combustibility and increase the overall combustion efficiency of
        the internal combustion engine in which the fuel is burned. </p>
      <p>[0006] The present invention represents an improvement over the
        "Pre-Ignition Fuel Treatment System" described in application
        Ser. No. 11/889,226, insofar as it provides for a multi-pass
        reaction zone. In the previous application, the fuel makes only
        a single pass through the reaction zone, which results in some
        portion of the fuel that goes to the engine remaining
        unreformed. This factor will limit the improvement in fuel
        efficiency that the invention seeks to achieve. </p>
      <p>[0007] In the present invention, however, the fuel is
        re-circulated through the reaction zone in multiple passes until
        virtually all of the fuel is reformed. After each pass through
        the reaction zone, the reformed fuel components will be in a
        plasma state containing large numbers of anions (i.e.,
        negatively charged ions). In order to stabilize the reformed
        fuel plasma, hydrogen cations (H.sup.+ ions) are injected
        downstream of the reaction zone. Still further downstream, the
        fuel is cooled and condensed, so that the unreformed fuel (e.g.,
        gasoline) will revert to a liquid state, while the reformed fuel
        components (typically comprising methane, ethane, propane, and
        butane) remain in a gaseous state. </p>
      <p>[0008] The stabilized reformed fuel gas is then stored in an
        auxiliary fuel tank, while the unreformed liquid fuel is
        collected in the main fuel tank, from where it is re-circulated
        back through the reaction zone, and the process is repeated in
        recurring cycles. From the auxiliary fuel tank, some of the
        reformed gaseous fuel is pumped to the engine as needed, while
        some of it is pumped back into the reaction zone to act as a
        "carrier-gas" into which atomized unreformed liquid fuel is
        injected. This latter step enables the present invention to
        avoid injecting air as a carrier-gas for the atomized fuel
        entering the reaction zone. The present invention thereby averts
        one of the principal disadvantages of the system disclosed in
        application Ser. No. 11/889,226, namely the potential for
        partial combustion of the fuel in the reaction zone due to the
        presence of oxygen there. Such partial combustion generates
        pollutants (CO and CO.sub.2) and reduces fuel efficiency.
        Moreover, the exclusion of air from the reaction zone in the
        present invention eliminates nitrogen as well as oxygen and
        thereby prevents the formation of NO.sub.x pollutants. </p>
      <p>[0009] Therefore, the present invention represents an
        improvement over the "Pre-Ignition Fuel Treatment System"
        described in application Ser. No. 11/889,226 by reforming a
        greater percentage of the fuel through use of a multi-pass
        reaction zone, and by eliminating partial fuel combustion and
        NO.sub.x formation within the reaction zone. The present
        invention also has the advantage over the prior art of producing
        a stabilized reformed gaseous fuel that can be stored in an
        auxiliary fuel tank and used as needed. The prior art, including
        this inventor's prior application Ser. No. 11/889,226, has no
        storage capability for reformed fuel and thus requires
        continuous operation of the fuel treatment system while the
        engine is running. This is particularly problematic during the
        initial cold start of an engine and during rapid acceleration,
        when the output of reformed fuel will not keep pace with the
        real-time fuel demand of the engine. </p>
      <p>[0010] The reformed fuel storage capability of the present
        invention, on the other hand, allows the fuel treatment system
        of the current invention to cycle on and off as needed to
        maintain an adequate reserve of reformed gaseous fuel. Unlike
        the prior art, the present invention maintains the same high
        level of fuel efficiency and low level of pollutants during cold
        engine starting and rapid acceleration. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0011] It is an object of the present invention to create a
        reaction zone in a motor vehicle wherein the hydrocarbon fuel is
        reformed at high temperature and pressure, such that large
        hydrocarbon molecules are "cracked" to produce smaller, more
        readily combustible molecules. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is another object of the present invention to take
        advantage of the high temperature, high pressure environment of
        the engine's exhaust gases by locating the reaction zone within
        the exhaust pipe, such that some of the energy of exhaust gases
        is transferred to the fuel molecules and helps induce molecular
        cracking. </p>
      <p>[0013] It is a further object of the present invention to
        promote in the reaction zone catalytic and/or electrochemical
        quasi-catalytic reactions in order to facilitate the hydrocarbon
        cracking process and to enable that process to take place at a
        lower temperature and pressure than would otherwise be feasible.
      </p>
      <p>[0014] It is yet another object of the present invention to
        utilize a reactor rod composed of a material that also has
        magnetic properties, such that when ions from the cracking
        process flow around the reactor rod, the rod becomes magnetized
        and generates a magnetic field which interacts with ionized
        hydrocarbon molecules, causing them to accelerate. </p>
      <p>[0015] It is yet a further object of the present invention to
        create in the reaction zone a positive feedback loop between the
        magnetization of the reactor rod and the acceleration of the
        hydrocarbon molecules, such that the accelerated motion of the
        ionized molecules induces a progressively stronger magnetism in
        the rod, which in turn generates a stronger magnetic field that
        further accelerates the molecules. </p>
      <p>[0016] It is still another object of the present invention to
        utilize the electromagnetic feedback loop created in the
        reaction zone to accelerate the hydrocarbon fuel molecules to
        such an elevated energy level that the reformed portion of the
        fuel is transformed into a plasma. </p>
      <p>[0017] It is still a further object of the present invention to
        crack virtually all of the hydrocarbon fuel molecules by
        utilizing a multi-pass reaction zone, such that, after each pass
        through the reaction zone, the treated fuel is cooled and the
        larger unreformed hydrocarbon molecules condense into a liquid,
        which is then separated from the smaller reformed hydrocarbon
        molecules that remain in a gaseous state, with the unreformed
        liquid fuel being re-circulated back through the reaction zone.
      </p>
      <p>[0018] It is yet one more object of the present invention to
        produce a stable reformed hydrocarbon fuel, which can be stored
        and used as needed by the engine, by injecting hydrogen cations
        (H.sup.+ ions) into the reformed fuel plasma downstream of the
        reaction zone, so that the hydrogen cations combine with the
        reformed fuel anions (e.g., CH.sub.3.sup.-, CH.sub.2.sup.-,
        C.sub.2H.sub.5.sup.-, etc.) to produce stable, neutral molecules
        of reformed fuel (e.g., CH.sub.4, C.sub.2H.sub.6, etc.). </p>
      <p>[0019] It is still one more object of the present invention to
        avoid the partial combustion of fuel in the reaction zone and
        the concomitant generation of pollutants (such as CO and
        NO.sub.x) by excluding air from the reaction zone and instead
        using a portion of the reformed gaseous hydrocarbon fuel as a
        "carrier-gas" into which atomized unreformed fuel is injected at
        the inlet end of the reaction zone. </p>
      <p>[0020] These and other beneficial objects are achieved by a
        process in which a multi-pass reaction zone is established
        within the outflow of exhaust gases downstream of the exhaust
        manifold of an internal combustion engine. The reaction zone
        comprises a reactor vessel that is installed within the exhaust
        pipe, such that the exhaust gases flow around the reactor vessel
        on all sides. The reactor vessel is an oblong plenum formed by a
        rigid reactor enclosure, which is non-contiguously affixed to
        the exhaust pipe. Within the reactor enclosure is a reactor rod,
        which is axially positioned within the reactor vessel such that
        a uniform annular plenum is formed between the surface of the
        reactor rod and the walls of the reactor enclosure. The reactor
        rod is centrally located along the length of the reactor vessel,
        and it is composed of a material that has magnetic properties
        and preferably has catalytic properties as well. </p>
      <p>[0021] On the inlet end of the reactor vessel is an injection
        assembly, comprising one or more fuel injection ports and one or
        more carrier-gas injection ports. The fuel injection ports are
        hydraulically connected to a fuel line, through which a
        hydrocarbon fuel flows from a main fuel tank. The carrier-gas
        injection ports are pneumatically connected to an auxiliary fuel
        tank in which gaseous reformed hydrocarbon fuel is stored. </p>
      <p>[0022] Downstream of the outlet end of the reactor vessel is a
        condenser in which the partially reformed fuel is cooled,
        thereby causing the larger, unreformed hydrocarbon molecules to
        condense as a liquid, while the smaller, reformed hydrocarbon
        molecules remain as a gas. The unreformed liquid fuel then flows
        into the main fuel tank, from where it is re-circulated back
        through the reaction zone. Upstream of the condenser, the
        partially reformed fuel is injected with hydrogen cations so as
        to convert the reformed fuel plasma into a stable molecular
        state in order to facilitate storage of the reformed fuel. The
        stabilized reformed fuel is pumped into the auxiliary fuel tank,
        which is pneumatically connected to the engine's carburetor and
        to the carrier-gas injection ports. </p>
      <p>[0023] The mixture of unreformed fuel and reformed carrier-gas
        (hereafter referred to as the "fuel-gas mixture") flows within
        the reactor vessel in the opposite direction to the flow of
        exhaust gases around the reactor enclosure. At the distal side
        of this cross-flow process (i.e., the side furthest from the
        exhaust manifold), the fuel-gas mixture is heated by the exhaust
        gases to a temperature at which the unreformed fuel is
        completely vaporized. The vaporized fuel-gas mixture then
        encounters the reactor rod at its distal end, which preferably
        has a convex shape to promote laminar flow around it. As the
        vaporized fuel-gas mixture enters the annular plenum around the
        reactor rod, its flow path becomes constricted, which causes its
        pressure and velocity to increase. The increased pressure and
        kinetic energy of the vaporized fuel-gas mixture is further
        augmented by its absorption of thermal energy from the exhaust
        gases, which are becoming progressively hotter as the exhaust
        manifold is approached. </p>
      <p>[0024] As the temperature and pressure of the vaporized
        fuel-gas mixture becomes progressively elevated, some of the
        vaporized unreformed fuel molecules reach a sufficient energy to
        become ionized and/or to undergo at the surface of the reactor
        rod catalytic cracking reactions that produce ionized molecules.
        The motion of the ionized fuel molecules generates an
        electromagnetic field around the reactor rod, and this
        electromagnetic field magnetizes the reactor rod itself. As the
        reactor rod becomes magnetized, it generates its own magnetic
        field which causes the motion of the ionized fuel molecules to
        accelerate. The accelerated motion of the ionized fuel molecules
        has two effects. First, the accelerated ionic flow generates a
        stronger electromagnetic field around the reactor rod, which
        causes the reactor rod to become more strongly magnetized, which
        then further accelerates the ionic flow. Second, the accelerated
        flow increases the kinetic energy of the unreformed fuel
        molecules, thereby increasing the temperature and pressure of
        the vaporized fuel, so that an increasing number of molecules
        undergo catalytic and/or quasi-catalytic cracking along the
        surface of the reactor rod. </p>
      <p>[0025] The electrochemical quasi-catalytic cracking process
        occurs as follows: As more fuel molecules ionize and/or crack,
        more ions are produced and their increasing number and
        acceleration generates a progressively stronger electromagnetic
        field around the reactor rod. This strengthening electromagnetic
        field, in turn, progressively increases the magnetization of the
        rod. The progressively stronger magnetic field generated by the
        reactor rod then further accelerates the molecular flow, further
        increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules and causing more
        of them to crack and ionize. </p>
      <p>[0026] Thus, a positive feedback loop is established which
        drives the hydrocarbon molecules to progressively higher kinetic
        energy levels. This is an endothermic process that increasingly
        draws energy from the cross-flow of exhaust gases as those gases
        become hotter toward the proximal side of the reactor vessel
        (i.e., the side closest to the exhaust manifold). This positive
        feedback loop continues until the vaporized fuel-gas mixture
        reaches the proximal end of the reactor rod and has been ionized
        to a degree corresponding to the physical state known as plasma.
      </p>
      <p>[0027] The present invention represents an improvement over the
        "Pre-Ignition Fuel Treatment System" disclosed in application
        Ser. No. 11/889,226 in three principal respects: </p>
      <p>[0028] (1) Recognizing that all of the hydrocarbon fuel
        molecules will not be cracked in a single pass through the
        reaction zone, the present invention provides a multi-pass
        reaction zone, through which the unreformed fuel molecules are
        re-circulated in multiple passes as many times as it takes to
        crack them. This multi-pass system assures that virtually 100%
        of the hydrocarbon fuel molecules will ultimately be cracked,
        thereby producing a reformed hydrocarbon fuel comprising smaller
        molecules (typically methane, ethane, propane and butane) which
        are more readily combustible and which generate less pollutants
        when combusted. </p>
      <p>[0029] (2) Recognizing that the presence of air in the reaction
        zone has undesirable consequences, the present invention
        eliminates the use of air as a carrier-gas for the atomized fuel
        injected at the inlet end of the reactor vessel and instead uses
        a portion of the gaseous reformed fuel as a carrier-gas. This
        airless reaction zone excludes oxygen and nitrogen (except to
        the extent they are present in the fuel) and thereby prevents
        the partial combustion of the fuel before it gets to the engine,
        which reduces overall fuel efficiency. The airless reaction zone
        also prevents the formation of pollutants such as carbon
        monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen. </p>
      <p>[0030] (3) Recognizing that direct flow of the reformed fuel
        from the reaction zone to the engine's intake manifold will be
        insufficient during cold start-up and rapid acceleration, the
        present invention stabilizes the reformed fuel, thereby allowing
        it to be stored for use as needed by the engine. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0034] Referring to FIG. 1, an improved pre-ignition fuel
        treatment system 10 is installed in a motor vehicle 11 having an
        internal combustion engine 12, a main fuel tank 13, an exhaust
        pipe 14, an auxiliary fuel tank 15, an engine control module
        (ECM) 16, and one or more engine/emissions sensor(s) 17. The
        main fuel tank 13 stores an unreformed hydrocarbon fuel, such as
        gasoline, that is mixed with a carrier-gas 37 stored in the
        auxiliary fuel tank 15 to make a fuel-gas mixture 33. Combustion
        by-products and excess air, collectively referred to as exhaust
        gases 34, exit from the vehicle to the external atmosphere
        through the exhaust pipe 14. The engine/emissions sensors 17
        monitor the air-to-fuel ratio and/or the amount of oxygen in the
        exhaust gases 34. </p>
      <p>[0035] The engine 12 comprises a combustion zone 18, an intake
        manifold 19, an air filter 20, an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)
        carburetor 21, and an exhaust manifold 22. In the combustion
        zone 18 a fuel-air mixture is combusted and the exhaust gases 34
        are expelled into the exhaust manifold 22, which then expels the
        exhaust gases 34 into the exhaust pipe 14. The combustion
        process in the combustion zone 18 has the effect of creating a
        partial vacuum in the intake manifold 19, which draws air from
        the external atmosphere into the engine 12 through an air filter
        20. The air drawn into the intake manifold 19 is mixed with fuel
        in the LPG carburetor 21 that is located between the air filter
        20 and the intake manifold 19. The air-to-fuel ratio produced by
        the LPG carburetor 21 is controlled by the ECM 16, which is a
        microprocessor that computes the optimal air-to-fuel ratio based
        on the readings of the engine/emissions sensor(s) 17. </p>
      <p>[0036] Referring now to both FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the present
        invention 10 establishes a multi-pass reaction zone 23 in the
        exhaust pipe 14 by inserting into a section of the exhaust pipe
        14 a reactor vessel 24. The reactor vessel 24 is an oblong
        plenum formed by a rigid reactor enclosure 25, which is
        non-contiguously affixed to the exhaust pipe 14. In the
        preferred embodiment 10, the reactor vessel 24 is a tubular
        structure fabricated of a material having a high thermal
        conductivity that can withstand a high temperature, high
        pressure environment. Optionally, the interior surface of the
        reactor vessel 24 at its distal end can be textured to increase
        its area so as to improve heat transfer across the surface. The
        reactor vessel 24 is axially installed within the exhaust pipe
        14 such that the exhaust gases 34 flow around the entire
        perimeter of the reactor vessel 24. In the preferred embodiment
        10, the longitudinal axis of the reactor vessel 24 is aligned
        with that of the section of exhaust pipe 14 into which it is
        inserted. </p>
      <p>[0037] In addition to the reactor enclosure 25, the reactor
        vessel 24 comprises a reactor rod 26, an annular plenum 27, and
        an injection assembly 28. The reactor rod 26 is an oblong
        structure axially positioned within the reactor enclosure 25,
        such that the annular plenum 27 is formed between the reactor
        rod 26 and the reactor enclosure 25. In the preferred
        embodiment, the reactor rod 26 has an elongated cylindrical
        shape with a convex distal end (i.e., the end furthest from the
        exhaust manifold 22) and a concave proximal end (i.e., the end
        closest to the exhaust manifold 22). The diameter of the reactor
        rod 26 is such that the width of the annular plenum 27 is
        approximately 1/16 inch. Optionally, the reactor rod 26, can
        have a slightly tapered diameter in the midsection of the rod.
        Also optionally, the reactor rod 26 can have a tapered distal
        side transitioning into a cylindrical proximal side, with both
        ends being convex, as shown in FIG. 3. The tapered distal end of
        the latter reactor rod 26 configuration helps reduce turbulence
        by facilitating a more gradual acceleration of the fuel-gas
        mixture 33. The length of the reactor rod 26 is in the range of
        4 to 12 inches, depending on the type of fuel and the size of
        the engine 12. </p>
      <p>[0038] The material composition of the reactor rod 26 is
        crucial importance to the process of cracking the hydrocarbon
        fuel and transforming it into a plasma. The reactor rod 26
        preferably serves the dual roles of providing a catalyst for the
        cracking process and participating in the "feedback loop"
        electromagnetic interaction with ionized fuel molecules, as
        described hereinabove, which drives the fuel-gas mixture 33
        toward a plasma state. In order to fulfill both of these roles,
        the reactor rod 26 must contain materials that are both highly
        magnetic and good catalysts for the hydrocarbon cracking
        process. While the preferred embodiment 10 uses an iron reactor
        rod 26, other suitable material are steel, nickel, cobalt,
        rare-earth metals, alloys of the foregoing metals, and magnetic
        ceramics. Nickel, cobalt and rare-earth metals have known
        applications as catalysts in hydrocarbon cracking, as disclosed
        in Cornelius et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,376, Sie, U.S. Pat. No.
        4,579,986, and Kumar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,642,
        respectively. The reactor rod 26 can also consist of a magnetic
        core with a catalytic coating or plating. For example, a reactor
        rod 26 with a steel core covered by a layer of platinum plating
        is also suitable. </p>
      <p>[0039] While it is preferable to use a reactor rod 26 having
        catalytic properties, the present invention 10 does not depend
        exclusively on a catalytic reactor rod 26. The electrochemical
        quasi-catalytic reactions promoted by a reactor rod 26 made of a
        non-catalytic magnetic material are also capable of sustaining
        the hydrocarbon reformation process. </p>
      <p>[0040] The shape of the reactor rod 26 is also plays an
        important role in the cracking and plasma-formation processes.
        The distal end of the reactor rod 26 has a convex shape, so that
        the flow of the fuel-gas mixture 33 around the end of the rod is
        laminar. The goal in forcing the fuel-gas mixture 33 into the
        constrained annular plenum 27 is to accelerate the flow rate and
        thereby increase the velocity and kinetic energy of the fuel
        molecules so that some of them will attain the energy level
        needed for ionization and cracking to begin. Therefore,
        turbulent flow around the reactor rod 26 is to be avoided, since
        turbulence dissipates the molecular kinetic energy and thus
        retards the ionization and cracking processes. Accordingly, in
        the preferred embodiment, the proximal end of the reactor rod 26
        has a concave shape, which has the effect of creating an area of
        reduced pressure downstream of the reactor rod 26. This area of
        reduced pressure has the effect of drawing the flow of fuel-gas
        mixture 33 evenly along the surface of the reactor rod 26, so
        that energy-dissipating areas of turbulent flow are avoided. </p>
      <p>[0041] On the distal end of the reactor vessel 24 is the
        injection assembly 28, comprising one or more fuel injection
        port(s) 29 and one or more carrier-gas injection port(s) 30. The
        fuel injection port(s) are hydraulically connected to a fuel
        line 31, through which the unreformed hydrocarbon fuel is pumped
        by a primary pump 39 from the main fuel tank 13. The carrier-gas
        injection port(s) 30 are pneumatically connected to the
        auxiliary fuel tank 15, in which is stored the gaseous reformed
        hydrocarbon fuel 37, which serves as the carrier-gas. </p>
      <p>[0042] Downstream of the proximal end of the reactor vessel 24,
        is a condenser 36, in which the fuel-gas mixture 33 is cooled,
        thereby causing the larger, unreformed hydrocarbon molecules to
        condense into a liquid phase, while the smaller, reformed
        hydrocarbon molecules remain in a gaseous phase. The liquid and
        gaseous phases separate from one another in the liquid-vapor
        separator 38, which comprises an upper gas chamber 41 and a
        lower sump chamber 42. The liquid unreformed fuel collects in
        the sump chamber 42 and is drawn into the main fuel tank 13,
        which is at lower pressure than the sump chamber 42. The flow of
        liquid unreformed fuel from the sump chamber 42 to the main fuel
        tank 13 is controlled by a solenoid valve (not shown) based on
        the liquid level in the sump chamber 42. From the main fuel tank
        13, the unreformed liquid fuel is pumped into the fuel injection
        port(s) 29 by the primary pump 39, and it is re-circulated
        through the reactor vessel 24 in multiple passes as many times
        as it takes to crack it. The reformed gaseous fuel 37 collects
        in the gas chamber 41, from which a secondary pump 40 pumps it
        into the auxiliary fuel tank 15. </p>
      <p>[0043] Between the reactor vessel 24 and the condenser 36 is a
        hydrogen-mixing manifold 43, in which hydrogen cations (H.sup.+
        ions) are injected into the flow of the fuel-gas mixture 33. The
        hydrogen cations are generated by an electrolysis cell 44. The
        hydrogen cations are drawn out of the cathode side of the
        electrolysis cell 44 by a Venturi injector, which utilizes a
        partial vacuum created by the flow of the fuel-gas mixture 33
        across a Venturi opening or tube. The hydrogen cations combine
        with the anions of the reformed hydrocarbon fuel plasma to
        convert the ions into neutral molecules and thereby stabilize
        the reformed fuel gas. Optionally, the oxygen anions from the
        anode side of the electrolysis cell 44 can be injected into the
        engine's air filter 20 through an oxygen inlet 45 in order to
        improve combustion. </p>
      <p>[0044] The stabilized reformed fuel gas 37 is then separated
        from the unreformed liquid fuel by the condenser 36 and the
        liquid-vapor separator 38, and then it is pumped into the
        auxiliary fuel tank 15 by the secondary pump 40. From the
        auxiliary fuel tank 15, some of the stabilized reformed fuel gas
        37 is drawn into the intake manifold 19 of the engine 18 through
        the vacuum conduit 32. Some of the stabilized reformed fuel gas
        37 is also injected into the reactor vessel 24 through the
        carrier-gas injection port(s) 30. </p>
      <p>[0045] In the present invention 10, unlike that disclosed in
        application Ser. No. 11/889,226, the partial vacuum of the
        intake manifold 19 need no longer be used to create a pressure
        drop across the reactor vessel 24. Instead, the primary and
        secondary pumps 39 40 create the pressure drop needed to
        maintain the flow of fuel-gas mixture 33 from the distal to the
        proximal end of the reactor vessel 24. </p>
      <p>[0046] The flow direction of fuel-gas mixture 33 through the
        reactor vessel 24 is in the opposite direction to the flow
        direction the exhaust gases 34 through the exhaust pipe 14, thus
        creating a cross-flow that optimizes the transfer to thermal
        energy from the exhaust gases 34 to the fuel-gas mixture 33. As
        the fuel-gas mixture 33 is drawn into the reactor enclosure 25
        through the injector assembly 28, the cross-flow heats the
        fuel-gas mixture to the point at which the fuel component is
        vaporized. As the vaporized fuel-gas mixture 33 enters the
        annular plenum 27 around the reactor rod 26, its flow path
        becomes constricted, which causes its pressure and velocity to
        increase. The increased pressure and kinetic energy of the
        vaporized fuel-gas mixture 33 is further augmented by its
        absorption of thermal energy from the exhaust gases, which are
        becoming progressively hotter as the cross-flow approaches the
        exhaust manifold 22. </p>
      <p>[0047] As the fuel-gas mixture 33 flows through the annular
        plenum 27, the unreformed fuel component undergoes the process
        of ionization, cracking and plasma-formation described
        hereinabove. At the proximal end of the reactor vessel 24,
        hydrogen cations from the electrolysis cell 38 are injected into
        the fuel-gas mixture 33 in order to stabilize the reformed fuel
        molecules. The fuel-gas mixture 33 then flows into the condenser
        36, where the unreformed liquid fuel is separated from the
        stabilized reformed gaseous fuel 37, with the former being
        pumped to the auxiliary fuel tank 15 and the latter being drawn
        into the main fuel tank 13. </p>
      <p>[0048] The stabilized reformed gaseous fuel 37 is drawn into
        the intake manifold 19 through the vacuum conduit 32. At this
        juncture, the engine control module (ECM) 16 will determine the
        appropriate air-to-fuel ratio, which will be set either richer
        (lower ratio) or leaner (higher ratio) based on the readings of
        the engine/emissions monitor(s) 17. Since, the ECM 16 bases its
        determination of air-to-fuel ratio on the stoichiometry of
        conventional fuel (gasoline or diesel) combustion, its
        operations must be modified to account for the higher energy
        content of the stabilized reformed gaseous fuel 37 generated by
        the present invention 10. Therefore, the preferred embodiment of
        the present invention 10 includes an auxiliary microprocessor
        35, which interfaces with the ECM 16 so as to adjust the
        air-to-fuel ratio to reflect the combustion stoichiometry of the
        reformed gaseous fuel 37. </p>
      <p>[0049] An example will illustrate the need for the auxiliary
        microprocessor 35. Because of the higher energy content of the
        stabilized reformed gaseous fuel 37, less of it will be consumed
        to release the same amount of energy as conventional fuel.
        Therefore, its combustion will consume less oxygen, causing the
        concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gases 34 to rise. This
        rise will be reflected in the readings of the engine/emissions
        sensors 17 and communicated to the ECM 16. Since the ECM 16 does
        its calculations based on the energy content of conventional
        fuel, its normal response would be to infer from the rise in
        oxygen concentration in the exhaust gases that the air-to-fuel
        ratio is too lean. Therefore, the ECM 16 standing alone would,
        under the circumstances of this example, signal the engine 12 to
        increase the concentration of fuel being sent to the combustion
        zone 18. In so doing, however, the ECM 16 would undo the fuel
        economy advantage of the stabilized reformed gaseous fuel 37.
        When the auxiliary microprocessor 35 interfaces with the ECM 16,
        however, the air-to-fuel ratio is adjusted to account for the
        higher energy content of the stabilized reformed gaseous fuel
        37, thus enabling the present invention 10 to achieve greater
        savings in fuel consumption. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an integrated system and process for
        improving the performance of internal combustion engines.
        Combustion efficiency is increased and exhaust emissions are
        reduced by the combined effects of: (1) introducing an
        acetone-based fuel additive in the fuel tank. (2) pre-heating
        and polarizing the fuel, and (3) mixing a plasma of ionized
        hydrogen and oxygen with the intake air. This integrated system
        and process produces synergistic fuel additives with superior
        combustion characteristics. </p>
      <p>With respect to the first component of the present invention,
        the use of acetone-based fuel additives to improve fuel
        efficiency is known in the prior art. One example of such a fuel
        additive is disclosed in Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,742. Acetone
        acts as a surfactant with respect to gasoline, reducing the
        surface tension of the liquid fuel so that it forms finer
        droplets that vaporize more readily. In the Smith patent
        disclosure, as in the present invention, acetone is mixed with
        xylene, the latter being an aromatic hydrocarbon which boosts
        the fuel's octane rating. </p>
      <p>The acetone-based fuel additive component of the present
        invention differs from those disclosed in the prior art because
        it is formulated specifically to work in concert with the other
        two components of this invention. The composition of the
        additive and the ratio of its fuel mixture are optimized to
        complement the other fuel enhancement features of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>With respect to the second component of this invention, a
        number of fuel preheaters are disclosed in the prior art,
        including Zabenskie, U.S. Pat. No. 4,015,567; Laramee, U.S. Pat.
        No. 4,527,533; Favreau et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,943; Ray,
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,137; Huang, U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,555; and
        Lambert, Sr., et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,451. These preheaters
        operate on the basis of a heat-exchange process between the fuel
        and hot-water side of the engine cooling system, as does the
        present invention. The prior art fuel preheaters in some
        instances produce a super-heated fuel (e.g., Favreau, et al.)
        and in other instances a vaporized fuel (e.g., Lambert, Sr., et
        al.). But none of the prior art devices produce a polarized
        preheated fuel, as does the present invention. The effect of the
        second component of the present invention is not only to preheat
        the fuel, but also to polarize the fuel's covalent hydrocarbon
        bonds, thereby rendering the hydrocarbon molecules more rapidly
        and completely combustible. </p>
      <p>With respect to the third component of this invention, the
        prior art encompasses several devices for generating gaseous
        hydrogen-oxygen mixtures to be mixed with fuel prior to
        combustion. Examples are Ross, U.S. Pat. No. 7,143,722,
        Larocque, U.S. Pat. No. 6,311,648 and DeSouza, Pub. No. U.S.
        2001/0003276. These devices all use an electrolysis cell to
        electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen. </p>
      <p>In the electrolysis process, positively-charged hydrogen ions
        are generated at the cathode, while negatively charged oxygen
        ions are generated at the anode. In the prior art electrolysis
        devices, however, no effort is made to retain the ionized state
        of the generated gases, which simply revert to molecular
        hydrogen H.sub.2 and oxygen O.sub.2. Consequently, these devices
        fail to take advantage of the superior combustion
        characteristics of an ionized hydrogen-oxygen mixture. </p>
      <p>In the present invention, on the other hand, the ionized
        H.sup.+/O.sup.- plasma is not mixed with the fuel, but instead
        it is drawn from an electrolysis cell directly into the engine's
        air intake manifold by a Venturi injector. Consequently, the
        gaseous hydrogen and oxygen remain in an ionized state when they
        mix with the atomized fuel at the fuel injection ports. Since
        the fuel itself has already been polarized by the second
        component of this invention, moreover, the resulting air-fuel
        mixture is a highly combustible blend of ionized hydrogen-oxygen
        plasma and enhanced, pre-heated polarized fuel. </p>
      <p>Consequently, the present invention presents a unique
        combination of synergistic fuel additives, fuel pre-heating,
        fuel polarization, and ionized hydrogen-oxygen injection. The
        overall result is an ionized gaseous plasma containing enhanced
        fuel which, when introduced into the engine's cylinders,
        combusts within optimum efficiency, both maximizing energy
        recovery and minimizing polluting residuals. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to maximize the fuel
        energy efficiency of internal combustion engines while
        simultaneously minimizing combustion residuals that cause
        harmful emissions. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to increase
        internal combustion engine efficiency by recovering waste heat
        from the engine cooling system and using that heat to pre-heat
        the fuel so as to make it more readily combustible. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to further
        improve the combustibility of the fuel by passing it through an
        annular array of magnets during the preheating process in order
        to polarize the fuel, thereby weakening its covalent bonds and
        rendering the fuel more readily combustible. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to inject
        directly into the engine's intake manifold ionized hydrogen and
        oxygen gases generated by the electrolysis of water, and to have
        the ionized H.sup.+/O.sup.- plasma mix with the atomized
        polarized fuel downstream of the fuel injectors to produce a
        highly combustible combination of hydrogen-oxygen plasma and
        enhanced, pre-heated polarized fuel. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of the present invention to
        introduce an acetone-based additive to the fuel in a vehicle's
        fuel tank, with the additive being so formulated and so
        proportioned to the fuel as to render the fuel more tractable to
        the pre-heating, polarization and plasma injection processes. </p>
      <p>These and other beneficial results are achieved through a
        three-stage fuel enhancement process, comprising: </p>
      <p>1. An acetone-based fuel additive stage, </p>
      <p>2. A fuel preheating and polarization stage, and </p>
      <p>3. An ionized hydrogen-oxygen plasma injection stage. </p>
      <p>The fuel additive stage is implemented by introducing an
        acetone-based fuel additive directly into a vehicle's tank. By
        reducing the surface tension of the liquid fuel, the acetone in
        the additive enables the fuel to atomize into finer droplets and
        to vaporize more readily. Inclusion of xylene in the additive
        works to weaken the covalent hydrocarbon bonds of the fuel. Thus
        the fuel is pre-conditioned and rendered more tractable to the
        subsequent preheating and polarization stage. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fuel
        additive comprises equal volumes of three constituents: acetone,
        xylene and a conditioning lubricant. The xylene boosts the
        fuel's octane rating and thus improves engine performance. The
        conditioning lubricant, which serves to protect the engine and
        further condition the fuel, comprises, by volume: one part
        Accelerator.TM. octane booster; one part Energy Release.TM.
        cylinder coating; three parts GP-7 two-cycle auto racing oil,
        and three parts Lucas.TM. auto racing oil. The additive is mixed
        with fuel in the vehicle's fuel tank at a ratio of 3 fluid
        ounces of additive to 10 gallons of fuel. </p>
      <p>The fuel preheating and ionization stage utilizes a
        heat-exchanger manifold which is installed in the hot-water side
        of the engine cooling system, typically upstream of the
        radiator. The heat-exchanger manifold comprises an inner sleeve,
        through which the fuel flows, and an outer sleeve, through which
        or along which the hot engine coolant circulates, thereby
        transferring heat to the fuel. The inner sleeve comprises a
        series of interconnected annular or tubular magnets, such that
        the fuel flows through the apertures of the magnets and is
        polarized by the magnetic field. The heated and polarized fuel
        then flows from the heat-exchanger manifold into the fuel
        injectors, where it is atomized and injected into the airflow to
        the engine cylinders at the fuel injection ports. </p>
      <p>The ionized hydrogen-oxygen fuel enhancement stage utilizes an
        electrolysis cell, preferably of the type disclosed in the
        patents of Yull Brown, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,014,777 and 4,081,656,
        to generate a plasma consisting of two parts H.sup.+ ions to one
        part O.sup.- ions. The hydrogen-oxygen plasma is drawn out of
        the electrolysis cell by a Venturi injector, which utilizes a
        partial vacuum created by the flow of intake air across a
        Venturi opening or tube. An microprocessor optimizer is used in
        conjunction with the vehicle's engine and emissions sensors to
        set the air-to-fuel ratio in order to adjust for the increased
        energy content of the enhanced fuel-plasma mixture. </p>
      <p>As a result of the process and associated apparatus of this
        invention, the fuel injectors receive an additive-conditioned
        preheated polarized fuel with optimal atomization/vaporization
        characteristics, and inject it into an intake airflow containing
        ionized hydrogen and oxygen plasma. This highly combustible
        mixture is fed to the engine cylinders at the optimal
        air-to-fuel ratio set by the optimizer. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, the preferred embodiment of the present
        invention 10 is designed to be implemented and installed in a
        motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine 11, a fuel
        tank 12, a fuel pump 13, a water pump 14, a radiator 15, an
        exhaust manifold 16, one or more engine/emissions sensors 17,
        and a catalytic converter 18. Comprising the engine 11 are a
        throttle plate 19, a plurality of cylinders 20, a plurality of
        fuel injectors 21, a plurality of injection ports 22, an intake
        manifold 23, and an engine control module (ECM) 24. </p>
      <p>In the conventional functioning of the engine 11, fuel from the
        fuel tank 12 is pumped by the fuel pump 13 to the fuel injectors
        21. The fuel injectors 21 atomize the fuel and periodically
        dispense it in discrete pulses through the injection ports 22
        into an airflow that enters the engine through the intake
        manifold 23 under the regulation of the throttle plate 19. The
        resulting air-fuel mixture is then drawn into multiple intake
        valves 25, through which the air-fuel mixture passes into the
        cylinders 20 and is combusted. The air-to-fuel ratio of the
        mixture is regulated by the duration of the fuel injection
        pulses, which is in turn controlled by the ECM 24 based on
        monitoring of oxygen levels in the exhaust manifold 16 upstream
        of the catalytic converter 18 by the engine/emissions sensors
        17. </p>
      <p>An acetone-based fuel additive 26 is introduced directly into
        the fuel tank 12, preferably at a ratio of 3 fluid ounces of
        additive to 10 gallons of fuel. Preferably, the fuel additive 26
        comprises equal volumes of acetone, xylene and a conditioning
        lubricant. By volume, the conditioning lubricant component
        consists of one part Accelerator.TM. octane booster, one part
        Energy Release.TM. cylinder coating, three parts GP-7 two-cycle
        racing oil, and three parts Lucas.TM. racing oil. </p>
      <p>From the fuel tank 12, the additive-conditioned fuel passes
        through a heat-exchanger manifold 27, which is installed on the
        hot-water side of the engine's cooling system, typically in or
        on a section of radiator hose 28 upstream of the radiator 15.
        The heat-exchanger manifold 27 can be installed alternately
        either within the upstream section of radiator hose 28 or on its
        outer surface. Referring to FIGS. 2, 3A and 3B, the
        heat-exchanger manifold 27 comprises an inner sleeve 29, through
        which the fuel flows, and an outer sleeve 30, through which or
        across which hot engine coolant circulates and thereby transfers
        heat to the fuel. In the alternative embodiment, in which the
        heat-exchanger manifold 27 is attached to the outer surface of
        the upstream section of radiator hose 28, heat is transferred
        from the hot engine coolant to the outer sleeve 30 through the
        radiator hose 28. </p>
      <p>The inner sleeve 29 comprises a series of interconnected
        annular or tubular magnets 31, such that the fuel flows through
        the apertures 32 of the magnets 31 and is polarized by the
        magnetic field. The heated and polarized fuel then flows from
        the heat-exchanger manifold 27 into the fuel injectors 21, where
        it is atomized and injected into the gases drawn into the intake
        manifold 23. </p>
      <p>The electrolysis cell 33 generates a plasma consisting of two
        parts H.sup.+ ions to one part O.sup.- ions. The hydrogen-oxygen
        plasma is drawn out of the electrolysis cell by a Venturi
        injector 34, which utilizes a partial vacuum created by the flow
        of intake air across a Venturi opening or tube. A microprocessor
        optimizer 35 interfaces with the vehicle's engine/emissions
        sensors 17 and ECM 24 to control the pulse duration of the fuel
        injectors 21 so that the air-to-fuel ratio is adjusted for the
        increased energy content of the enhanced fuel-plasma mixture.
        This function of the optimizer will typically result in a leaner
        air-to-fuel ratio than would otherwise be imposed by the ECM 24
        alone as dictated by its default settings. </p>
      <p>As a result of the process and associated apparatus of this
        invention, the cylinders 20 receive the pre-heated, polarized,
        additive-conditioned fuel optimally atomized and mixed with
        ionized hydrogen-oxygen plasma, such that the combustion
        efficiency is maximized and residual pollutants are minimized. </p>
      <p>While this invention has been described with reference to a
        specific embodiment, the description is not to be construed in a
        limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed
        embodiment, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will
        be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to this
        description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended
        claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments that
        fall within the true scope of this invention. </p>
