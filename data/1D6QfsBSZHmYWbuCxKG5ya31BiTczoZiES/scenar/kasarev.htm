      <b> </b><b>History</b><br>
      <br>
      The S.C.E.N.A.R., Self-Controlled Energo Neuro Adaptive
      Regulation, was developed for the Russian space program to
      overcome the unique problems of space travel. Pharmaceuticals were
      impractical due to the specificity of each drug, leading to a need
      to store a large variety and quantity of drugs, and also due to
      the introduction of toxins into the water recycling system, such
      that one treatment may well treat the whole crew.<br>
      <br>
      A Russian team of doctors and scientists, based at Sochi
      University and led by Alexander Karasev in the late 1970s,
      developed a method of treatment that was energy efficient,
      multi-applicable, portable and also non-invasive. They were the
      first people to achieve repeatable therapeutic treatment using
      electrical signals to stimulate the immune system. Head scientist
      Professor Revenko claimed that there were very few illnesses
      SCENAR could not treat and often cure. Tests conducted in Russia
      have since shown the Scenar is proves effective in 80% of cases.<br>
      <br>
      The S.C.E.N.A.R. was immediately dubbed the ‘Star Trek’ Device by
      the press because of its origins and its similarity to the
      ‘all-curing’ medical scanner used in the series, Star Trek.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How it works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The scenar uses biofeedback -- by stimulating the nervous system,
      it is able to teach the body to heal itself. The device sends out
      a series of signals through the skin and measures the response.
      Each signal is only sent out when a change, in response to the
      previous signal, is recorded in the electrical properties of the
      skin. Visible responses include reddening of the skin, numbness,
      stickiness (the device will have the feeling of being magnetically
      dragged), a change in the numerical readout and an increase in the
      electronic clattering of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The C-fibres, which comprise 85% of all nerves in the body, react
      most readily to the electro-stimulation and are responsible for
      the production of neuropeptides and other regulatory peptides.<br>
      <br>
      The body can get accustomed to a stable pathological state, which
      may have been caused by injury, disease or toxicity. The scenar
      catalyses the process to produce regulatory peptides by
      stimulation of C-fibres for the body to use where necessary. It is
      these neuropeptides that in turn reestablish the body’s natural
      physiological state and are responsible for the healing process.
      As these peptides last up to several hours, the healing process
      will continue long after the treatment is over. The large quantity
      of neuropeptides and C-fibres in the Central Nervous System can
      also result in the treatment on one area aiding with other
      chemical imbalances, correcting sleeplessness, appetite and
      behavioral problems.<br>
      <br>
      In Russia, there are over 50,000 cases of the device’s use and
      some 600 practitioners currently use the device as their principal
      treatment instrument. A vast wealth of information is available
      from research papers, clinical reports and training manuals. The
      device is used on most types of disease or injury: circulatory,
      sensory, respiratory, neurological, genito-urinary,
      musculo-skeletal, gastro-intestinal, endocrine, immune and
      psychological disorders.<br>
      <br>
      The scenar is also credited with vastly reducing recovery times.
      Russian athletes have been known not only to compete after serious
      injuries, but even to break world-records. In accident and
      emergency wards, its ability to aid recovery is used to help
      victims of cardiac arrest, massive trauma and coma. It has
      recently been discovered to also aid in improving learning
      ability, memory, sexual function and improved physical health.
      Finally trials in Russia have also realised scenar’s usage for
      pain relief. Both cancer and fracture patients have found more
      pain relief from the release of natural opoids after scenar
      treatment than from administered opiates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Scenar weighs approximately 300 grams, is 200mm in length,
      with an electrical contact at one end and runs off a 9V battery.
      This is run over the spine and abdomen or the infected area,
      recording the resistive response to its signals and using its
      sophisticated software to return a fresh signal. A gentle
      tingling/stroking sensation will be felt. The practitioner is
      looking for anomalies on the skin surface, which may be
      highlighted by redness, numbness, stickiness or a change in
      numerical display or sound. Although these areas may not seem to
      directly relate to the obvious symptom, by treating these
      ‘asymmetries’, (as the Russians call them), the healing process
      will commence.<br>
      <br>
      Patients having Scenar treatment need to take responsibility for
      their health and are advised to participate actively in the
      treatment and recovery process. The chemical compounds, released
      by the nerves, affect not only the problem areas, but also
      circulate in the blood treating other areas of the body. This goes
      some way to explaining how old and often forgotten problems are
      brought to the surface for treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The Russians state that a chronic problem that the patient has may
      take up to 6 weeks treatment, with long-lasting effectiveness.
      Acute problems may just take one or two treatments. They say that
      the Scenar proves effective in 80% of all cases, of which full
      recovery occurs in 2/3rds of them and significant healing in the
      remainder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What conditions can Scenar treat?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the UK, the devices are licensed by the British Standards
      Institute for pain relief only. However, because of the nature of
      the device, viz., stimulating the nervous system, the Russian
      experience is that Scenar affects all the body systems.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian experience suggests that it can be effective for a
      very broad range of diseases, including diseases of the digestive,
      cardio-vascular, respiratory, musculo-skeletal, urinary,
      reproductive and nervous systems.<br>
      <br>
      It is also useful for managing ENT diseases, eye diseases, skin
      conditions and dental problems. It has also been found beneficial
      in burns, fractures, insect bites, allergic reactions, diseases of
      the blood and disorders involving immune mechanisms; endocrine,
      nutritional and metabolic disorders; stress and mental depression,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      It is known to give real relief from many types of pain<br>
      <br>
      <b>How often will I need a treatment?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to create a continuous flow of circulating regulative
      peptides Scenar action must be given quite often. For any fresh
      injury or any acute inflammatory process treatment needs to be
      intensive, ideally once or even twice daily. For chronic
      conditions, treatments are ideally given three or four times a
      week initially. As things improve the frequency can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      A course of treatments will vary from individual to individual,
      and takes into account such factors as the stage of the
      pathological process, the person's age, state of health, and so
      on.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is it safe?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As the Scenar impulse is similar to endogenous nerve impulses, it
      is non-damaging and safe. Only people with cardiac pacemakers are
      not allowed to have Scenar treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Children and pregnant women can be treated, and even animals enjoy
      it!<br>
      <br>
      What about my conventional treatment?<br>
      <br>
      If you are receiving treatment from your doctor it makes sense to
      inform him about Scenar therapy. Treatment with Scenar may enable
      you to reduce or even stop taking some medication, and this can be
      done under the supervision of your doctor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What else do I need to know?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During the treatment of chronic conditions, occasionally a healing
      crisis may occur (experienced as a complete lack of energy and
      malaise). This arises if the body is getting rid of toxic energy
      too rapidly. There are techniques that can be used with the Scenar
      to manage this.<br>
      <br>
      For best results it is advisable not to bathe or shower for two
      hours before and after treatment. It may be necessary to shave an
      area of skin to ensure good communication between the device and
      the nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      Patients generally experience an increase in energy, more
      refreshing sleep and an improved sense of wellbeing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How does it differ from other therapies?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are several ways in which it differs from other electrical
      therapies.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike TENS machines, each impulse is different from the previous
      one so the body is unable to adapt to the signal.<br>
      <br>
      The Scenar impulse is high amplitude so it stimulates C-fibres,
      which make up about 85% of the nerves in the body. This explains
      the quick effectiveness of Scenar therapy on the whole body.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>STAR TREK MEDICINE IS HERE! NOW!!</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Can a simple hand-held device work miracle cures? If it's the
      Russian SCENAR, you bet! (sometimes spelled SKENAR)<br>
      <br>
      One of the most brilliant healing machines I discovered in my
      search for future trends while writing my book VIRTUAL MEDICINE is
      the Russian SCENAR device (self-controlled
      energo-neuro-adaptive-regulation.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, it's a whole family of machines and I predicted they
      will completely change the face of medicine in the next 20 years.
      They are fast, portable, cheap and effective against almost any
      condition, from treat sports injuries, strokes, angina, acute
      infections, back pains and irritable bowel disease (as well as
      pre-menstrual tension and post-surgical complications) and even
      defibrillating hearts!<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The origin of the machine is surrounded in secrecy from the
      Russian military. But it clearly springs from research into the
      electro-magnetic field effects of the body's biological energy.
      Eventually, a team of scientists and doctors was assembled to
      study possible medical applications of the technology. The SCENAR
      researchers subsequently used it to study an Eastern therapy known
      as zonal contact massage. The intention had been to develop some
      way of altering the pressure of the massage, according to skin
      response (in VIRTUAL MEDICINE chapter 3, I described how the
      dielectric potential of collagen tissue is stimulated by
      pressure).<br>
      <br>
      Equipment was developed to monitor magnetic effects taking place
      in the skin and use these to modulate changes in pressure of the
      massage. The establishment of a biofeedback mechanism led to the
      creation of a device whose output would depend on skin energetic
      response.<br>
      <br>
      The aim is to stimulate the body's own endogenous energies to
      effect the cure, creating a cascade of endogenous neuropeptides.
      This allows the body its own choice of healing ingredients; a sort
      of on-board pharmacy. Through biofeedback an interaction is formed
      between the tissues and the instrument, each new signal evolves as
      a new output. No two consecutive signals from the device are the
      same. This allows the treatment to be truly dynamic, adjusting for
      changes in the body through time and in different physiological
      states.<br>
      <br>
      The term SCENAR was born. It is yet another brilliant marriage of
      Western electronic technology and Eastern energetic healing skills
      (which is what VIRTUAL MEDICINE is all about).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SPACE RACE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When the Soviet Union decided to send cosmonauts into orbit for
      prolonged periods, it was clear that they needed to have a means
      of treating any illnesses that could befall them. Unlike the
      American system, there were no convenient re-usable shuttles to
      bring back an ailing cosmonaut back to Earth, should the need have
      arisen. The possibility of incapacitating disease was a major
      worry.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical approach was not tenable, bearing in mind the
      rigorous weight and space limitations and the fact that
      drug-oriented medicine is based on the principle of one substance
      for each (potential) condition. Even a very modest medicine range
      would be weighty. Also, in an environment where recycling of water
      is such an essential feature, any drug entering the water
      circulation system would remain, passing through the cosmonaut
      many times.<br>
      <br>
      This was at a time when the Russian space programme was being
      watched by the rest of the world and maintaining national prestige
      was of paramount concern to the Soviet government. It was
      essential to come up with something radically new. It had to be
      light, easy to use and, of course, really effective.<br>
      <br>
      Bioenergetic technology was the only extant medical paradigm
      capable of delivering these stringent requirements. The SCENAR
      came to the fore.<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, no SCENAR device has been used in space to date. There
      were delays caused by the authorities insisting on a waterproofing
      process. Before this matter was resolved, funds were suddenly
      stopped at the time of perestroika; the so-called ‘space race' was
      called off and the team disbanded. The USA began working on
      combined space projects with the Russians and they introduced the
      capability of evacuating sick cosmonauts on the shuttle, which
      meant there was no further need of on-board therapy.<br>
      <br>
      However, four of the original team felt they had designed a very
      worthwhile system, capable of changing the face of medicine, and
      decided to take it onto the open market. So far, around 600
      doctors in Russia are using it as their principal treatment
      modality and it is now available to select and trained
      practitioners in the West. VIRTUAL MEDICINE has crossed-over into
      the mainstream!<br>
      <br>
      The promise of a small hand-held device that is capable of curing
      most illness, such as was portrayed in the cult 1970s TV series
      "STAR TREK", has become a reality.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BOFFINS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The original inventor of the Scenar was A.A.Karasev an electronics
      engineer back in 1973 who made one for himself after some of his
      family members died and the conventional medicine of the day could
      not help.<br>
      <br>
      Karasev later worked for the Russian Cosmonaut programme and
      showed his invention to his superiors who were very interested, so
      much so that a team was set up with funding to develop the idea
      further.<br>
      <br>
      Manufacturing was (and still is for some models) carried out by
      the Priboy company which supplies military hardware.<br>
      <br>
      The device was never actually used in space as they were unable to
      come up with a watertight model which was what had been specified.<br>
      <br>
      The end of the communist era led to a cessation of funding but
      some of the members of the team decided to continue and formed the
      OKB Ritm company in 1983. Names you repeatedly come across are
      A.N.Revenko, Y.Grinberg, and Y.Gorfinkel as well as Karasev. They
      managed to get approval in 1986 from the Russian Ministry of
      Health for the device to be used in health clinics.<br>
      <br>
      The OKB Ritm company still produces several models using names
      such as Scenar 97, Scenar NT, Scenar 2003, Autoscenar and Kosmed.
      (http://www.scenar.com.ru/index_eng.html) They have a branch
      office in the Netherlands. (http://www.ritmedic.com/home.html)<br>
      <br>
      Karasev decided to go his own way in 1990 and set up the LET
      Medical company which produces a range of models under the Scenar
      and Cosmodic brands. (http://www.scenar.ru/en/)<br>
      <br>
      The Rema company in Belorussia started producing Prologue and
      Enart models in 1993. (http://rema.by/) Check out their English
      powerpoint presentation where it says 'english version'
      (http://rema.by/?module=about)<br>
      <br>
      CCC Invet is a reseller of several of the above companies products
      and has an English website.
      (http://www.invet.net/32/e/about_e.shtml)<br>
      <br>
      Another company RTS ART was set up in 1995 and now trades as Denas
      MS producing the Denas and DiaDens models.
      (http://www.denascorp.ru/) They have many resellers some with
      English websites such as Diadens.com. (http://www.diadens.com/)<br>
      <br>
      The Pervade Wave company in Hong Kong has a regional (Asia)
      licence to produce the Space Healer model. These are sold in HK
      (http://www.naturalhealing.com.hk/spacehealer.php) and in
      Australia (http://www.enlightenedtherapies.com/index.htm)<br>
      <br>
      There is also supposed to be a US made model the Inter X 5000 from
      NRG (Neuro Research Group) but it is taking a very long time to
      come to fruition..<br>
      <br>
      It seems that Ritm was originally happy to licence the Scenar idea
      to other companies, but then when they started to make their own
      variants disputes arose as to who could use the brand name Scenar
      and whose model was better etc. Hence there is quite a lot of
      mudslinging and you sometimes have to read between the lines.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the companies originally targeted the health care market
      with expensive products although there are now some cheaper
      home-use models with reduced features. They also tended to sell
      training courses to their customers and provided little written
      documentation.<br>
      <br>
      The exception seems to be the Denas company which decided to go
      down the network marketing route with large numbers of resellers
      and reasonable prices. They have four current models including a
      Euro Denas one with CE certification and an English version of
      their printed 240 page Denas Therapy Manual and its accompanying 2
      hour video, although the English translation could be much
      improved. Their latest model the Diadens-DT even includes two
      electro acupuncture modes.<br>
      <br>
      You can download a good 172 page English manual from
      Transformation Technologies website.
      (http://www.braintuner.com/skenar.htm). It is not stated where
      this manual came from but the preface is signed Sergey Solomko and
      he is the owner of the Invet company.<br>
      <br>
      I also discovered that there is a wealth of Scenar related
      information on the internet but unsurprisingly mostly in Russian.
      However I have had great success using the free online translation
      engine WorldLingo. (http://www.worldlingo.com)<br>

      On a slightly separate issue you might have noticed that many
      sellers of Scenar devices also offer a multilayer therapeutic
      healing blanket. These were invented by A.A.Datchenko of the
      Victoria company (http://www.odeialo.ru/) who also licensed other
      producers including OKB Ritm.. They are approved by the Russian
      Ministry of Health and apparently very effective.<br>
      <br>
      It was only when I translated some websites that I found out what
      these are. They seem to be a modern day equivalent of Wilhelm
      Reich's 'orgone accumulators' where patients lay in a metal lined
      wooden box for treatment.
      (http://www.orgonomic.narod.ru/w/aboutr/)<br>
      <br>
      There are interesting blanket articles on the Victoria website
      including some fascinating feedback from LET Medical quoting the
      words of 'the well known medium Elsa' when they treated her with
      one.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OPERATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The device weighs around 300 gm, resembles a TV remote control and
      is powered by an ordinary 9v. battery. It is placed on the skin of
      the chest, head, abdomen or any diseased part, where it collects
      electromagnetic signals. These are then modulated according to the
      on-board software programme and played back to the tissues.
      Essentially, SCENAR is using the patient's own endogenous signals
      on a cybernetic feedback basis, scanning and re-transmitting many
      times a second. As described to me, the device ‘evolves' a new
      signal pattern for the disordered tissues, the machine literally
      entering into an information dialogue with the body. New
      frequencies and energy patterns are established, which in turn
      become fresh input signals, to be further modified, and so on.
      This output-equals-new- input is much the way that fractals are
      generated and thus, biologically-speaking, we seem to be on good
      ground here. On the premise that disease signals are generally
      fixed and unnatural, anything which breaks up the existing order
      has the capability of disease-busting.<br>

      <b>CASEBOOK</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Male, 69 years old. This man who was a gardener by profession had
      chronic suppurating osteomyelitis of the foot which could not be
      controlled. He was scheduled for an amputation of the lower leg in
      four days time, largely due to intractable pain. Someone decided
      to try a SCENAR device on him. It was run over the affected limb
      for about 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Next day, the pain had vanished for the first time in 8 months.
      Later that day another 30-minute treatment was given. By next
      morning the recovery was so dramatic the amputation was called
      off. A third treatment was given and seven days after the first
      SCENAR this man was back at work, digging in the garden. His leg
      has completely recovered.<br>
      <br>
      Female, age 68 years. This lady had attended for successful
      treatment of her asthma. She commented on painful arthritic knees.
      I decided to try the SCENAR. In order to gauge the effectiveness
      of the treatment I suggested that we concentrate on the left knee
      only and she could compare any improvements with the status of the
      right knee.<br>
      <br>
      Next morning she rang and was delighted that the pain had vanished
      from BOTH knees. One week later, as of the time she returned to
      the UK, she had no further pain.<br>
      <br>
      Female, age 41 years. This lady is the presenter of a
      radio-programme on which I appear each month as the visiting
      alternative doctor. On this occasion (early-April) she was
      struggling with her hay-fever, with streaming eyes and nose and
      constant sniffing which sounded awful on-air.<br>
      <br>
      In a 3-minute gap for advertisements I grabbed the SCENAR device
      and gave her a fast treatment over the forehead and cheeks. Just
      before going back on-air she breathed in and was delighted to note
      that virtually all symptoms had vanished! She needed a further
      treatment 2 days later, as the symptoms were back. But again, just
      a few minutes cleared her sinuses completely.<br>
      <br>
      She has opted for regular treatments, until we can do an allergy
      work up for her condition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CLINICAL ASPECTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The device is very safe; the impulse times are very short. No pain
      is felt but the patient is usually aware of a tingling sensation
      while it works. The practitioner seeks for what the Russians term
      asymmetry, meaning something different about the tissue
      characteristics in the vicinity. There are five main criteria:<br>
      <br>
      discolouration (reddening or pallor)<br>
      sensation (numbness or hyper-aesthesia)<br>
      stickiness' in which the machine drags with a magnet-like quality
      as it is drawn over certain tracts of the skin<br>
      sound changes (the machine begins to chatter electronically as it
      hits certain zones)<br>
      change in numerical output display<br>
      <br>
      Even though it may not coincide with the obvious area of symptoms
      or pathology, the important point is to treat the asymmetry. For
      reasons we do not fully understand, when this is eliminated,
      recovery will rapidly follow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A summary of findings in different clinical groups on 50,000 cases
      from 3,000 SCENAR doctors and other practitioners includes
      cumulative percentages in which effectiveness' is defined as a
      cure in 66% of cases and some improvement in 33% of cases:<br>
      <br>
      Circulatory 82%<br>
      Musculoskeletal 79%<br>
      Respiratory 84%<br>
      Ear and Mastoid 82%<br>
      Gastrointestinal 93<br>
      Eye and adnexae 93%<br>
      Genito-urinary 89%<br>
      Mouth/jaw/saliva 91%<br>
      Gynae and obstetrics 78%<br>
      <br>
      This list is far from exhaustive and I have been able to establish
      that there are many other areas in which SCENAR is highly
      effective. For example, there is a current 98% cure rate
      achievement for benign prostatic hypertrophy and in the case of
      acute mastitis the device is 100% effective to date. Nothing I
      know of can come close to its figures against frigidity, impotence
      and infertility (60th percentile).<br>
      <br>
      There are remarkably few contra-indications, notably heart
      pacemakers and, after 20 years, a complete absence of negative
      side-effects. SCENAR technology can be used as a valuable addition
      to other therapies or could be a stand-alone treatment. The
      extra-ordinary feature is that the same small device can be used
      to treat the heart of one patient, the knee of the next, the
      breasts and reproductive adnexae of the next - all relying on one
      small battery as an energy source!<br>

      <br>
      The method comprises generating pulses of a specified repetition
      rate, duration modulating each pulse, composing packets of
      stimulating pulses with a specified packet duration and specified
      pause duration between pulse packets, and modifying the duration
      of the pulse packet applied to the object in accordance with an
      assessment of the electrophysiologic parameters of the state of
      the biological object's interelectrode section, this assessment
      being performed simultaneously with object stimulation. The
      apparatus comprises a pulse generator, a pulse duration modulator,
      a stimulating pulse power amplifier, a first signal shaper
      generating a signal indicative of the object's response to
      stimulating pulses, a variable-duration pulse generator providing
      pulse packet duration signals, a second signal shaper providing
      signals of pulse packet duration, and a modulation control signal
      clipper.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to electrotherapeutic apparatuses and, more
      specifically, to methods for generating electric pulses intended
      to stimulate biological objects and apparatuses thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can be used in clinical and sports medicine and as a
      personal instrument, in particular for the prophylaxis and
      treatment of diseases and pathologic states with affected
      compensatory and adaptation processes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Known in the art is a method for biological object stimulation,
      wherein electric pulses for stimulation are generated.<br>
      <br>
      This method involves the following sequence of operations:
      stimulation by a standard stimulus is executed, followed by a test
      stimulation to detect the object's reaction, and then treatment
      stimulation by specially generated electric pulses of preset
      duration and repetition rate. These pulses are generated,
      amplified and used for stimulation during a certain time interval.
      After this, test stimulation is repeated to evaluate the effect of
      treatment stimulation and its results determine whether treatment
      should be continued or not (U.S. Pat. No. 4,505,275).<br>
      <br>
      During the stimulation treatment interval the parameters of
      electric pulses generated according to this method remain
      unvariable and are not adaptable to the current state of the
      object. Multiple treatment stimulation prolongs the procedure,
      thus making overdosage more probable. All these factors lead to a
      reduced therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      Known in the art is a method for generating electric pulses for
      stimulating neural and muscular structures of the vehicular system
      and organs, residing in that pulses of a specified repetition rate
      are generated, each pulse is then duration-modulated and a pulse
      train of pulses of specified duration and duty factor is formed,
      with ramp (increase or decrease) variarion of the duration of
      pulses of a preset repetition rate. This pulse train is then
      amplified and applied to the biological object, setting an upper
      limit to the pulse duration in the train in accordance with the
      individual sensitivity of the biological object (SU, A, 1169669).<br>
      <br>
      The parameters of the stimulating pulse trains are selected
      experimentally by the maximal object's response at physiologically
      comfortable conditions. Individual dosage is not provided, thus
      overdosage is possible. Pulses are not adapted to the current
      state of the object and all these factors reduce the overall
      therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      Known in the art is an apparatus for generating electric
      stimulating pulses, comprising a pulse generator, a modulator
      connected to the generator, an amplifier and an output stage (SU,
      A, 1069832).<br>
      <br>
      The pulse voltage of rectangular waveform from the pulse generator
      is applied to an input of the modulator, the other input whereof
      receives pulses from a modulation frequency generator. At the
      modulator output, a pulse-modulated voltage with a carrier
      frequency of rectangular waveform is thus generated and passed to
      the amplifier, and thereafter to the biological object.<br>
      <br>
      In this apparatus pulses of highly regulated, preset parameters
      are generated. It lacks the ability to assess the state of the
      biological object and dynamics of changes in this state, thus
      leading to unwarranted prolongation of the stimulation procedure
      and possible overdosage.<br>
      <br>
      Also known in the art is an electrostimulator, comprising
      connected in series pulse generator, duration shaper, amplitude
      shaper in the form of a power amplifier, and an active electrode
      to be applied to a section of tissue (SU, A, 1011130).<br>
      <br>
      Here the pulse generator produces pulses of the desired
      stimulation period, each pulse triggering the stimulus duration
      shaper, in turn controlling the amplitude shaper to generate
      current pulses passed via the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      This design configuration suffers the same deficiencies as the
      herein above discussed known in the art apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention is to provide a method for generating electric
      pulses for biological object stimulation and an apparatus thereof
      to generate electric pulses adaptable to the state of the
      biological object.<br>
      <br>
      This is achieved by a method for generating electric pulses for
      biological object stimulation, comprising generation of pulses of
      a specified repetition rate, duration modulation of each pulse,
      generation of pulse packets of specified duration of packets and
      pauses between them and with ramp variation of the duration of
      pulses of the specified repetition rate, amplification of
      stimulation pulses constituting the pulse packet and applying
      these pulses to the biological object via the electrodes, and at
      the same time setting the maximal duration of pulses of the
      specified repetition rate in the pulse packets in accordance with
      the individual sensitivity of the biological object to stimulation
      treatment. According to the invention, the duration of the packet
      of stimulating pulses applied to the biological object is varied
      in accordance to evaluated electrophysiological parameters of the
      state of the interelectrode section of the biological object, this
      evaluation being carried out simultaneously with biological object
      stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      It is expedient to use the impedance of the interelectrode section
      of the biological object as the electrophysiologic parameter, by
      which the state of the biological object is evaluated, using the
      time characteristics of the electric signal appearing after the
      trailing edge of each stimulating pulse to evaluate this
      impedance.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to use the modified duration of the packet of
      stimulating pulses with a specified repetition rate, and, if the
      modified packet duration is less than a preset value, allowing the
      next packet of stimulating pulses to be passed to this given
      section of the biological object, or inhibiting further
      stimulation if the modified duration exceeds or is equal to a
      preset limiting value.<br>
      <br>
      It is also expedient to generate complementary inverted electric
      pulses to affect the section of the biological object.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objectives are achieved by an apparatus for
      generating electric pulses (electric pulse generator) for
      biological object stimulation, according to this invention, having
      a pulse generator, a pulse duration modulator with one input
      thereof connected to the pulse generator output, and a stimulating
      pulse power amplifier with the input thereof connected to the
      pulse duration modulator output and with the outputs thereof
      connected to the electrodes applied to a section of the biological
      object during stimulation. A first signal shaper has an input
      thereof connected to the output of the stimulating pulse power
      amplifier and has signals evaluating the biological object's
      response to stimulating pulse generated at the output thereof to
      control the duration of the stimulated pulses packet. A
      variable-duration pulse packet generator has an input thereof
      connected to the first signal shaper output. A second signal
      shaper generates a signal proportional to the stimulating pulse
      package duration and with leading and trailing edges varying at a
      constant rate and with the input thereof connected to the output
      of the variable-duration pulse generator. A modulation control
      signal clipper has one input thereof connected to a signal level
      presetter and has another input thereof connected to the second
      signal shaper output, with the modulation control signal clipper
      output connected to the second input of the pulse duration
      modulator.<br>
      <br>
      The electric pulse generator may further comprise a time
      discriminator to generate a stimulation completion signal at its
      output, with one input of the time discriminator connected to the
      output of a time discriminator controller, the input whereof is
      connected to the output of the stimulating pulse power amplifier,
      and with the other input of the time discriminator connected to
      the variable-duration pulse generator output.<br>
      <br>
      The second input of the time discriminator controller or the third
      input of the time discriminator may be connected to the pulse
      generator output.<br>
      <br>
      It is advantageous that the electric pulse generator comprise a
      timer with the input thereof connected to the output of the time
      discriminator controller, and a controllable power supply with the
      input thereof connected to the timer output to disable the power
      supply, wherein the second input of the timer is connected to the
      pulse generator output.<br>
      <br>
      It is also advantageous to connect the output of the time
      discriminator to the third input of modulation control signal
      clipper or the second input of the controllable power supply.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it proved to be advantageous that the electric pulse
      generator be complemented with a switch located between the
      electrodes and the stimulating pulse power amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      The first signal shaper and the variable-duration pulse generator
      may be embodied as a multivibrator, designed with IGFETs, with
      resistors in the sources of transistors of the first stage and
      with a capacitor connected to the source of the p-channel
      transistor, so that the other capacitor lead constitutes the input
      to the first signal shaper. The first stage of the multivibrator
      is provided with a feedback loop of series connected diode and
      capacitor, wherein the output of the second stage of the
      multivibrator constitutes the output of the variable-duration
      pulse generator. The second signal shaper may be embodied as an
      IGFET integrator, with resistors between the voltage supply
      circuits and the transistor sources.<br>
      <br>
      It is also advantageous that the pulse duration modulator comprise
      an IGFET amplifier with a differentiating network at the amplifier
      input, the time constant of this network variable by a separate
      IGFET, the gate whereof is connected to an input of the modulator
      and with the differentiating network input constituting the other
      input of the modulator.<br>
      <br>
      The signal level presetter may comprise an IGFET integrator with
      resistors installed between the supply buses and the transistor
      sources and with the integrator input connected via switches to
      the voltage supply buses.<br>
      <br>
      It proved suitable to embody the pulse generator with an IGFET
      multivibrator, with the first stage thereof comprising an IGFET
      amplifier, with an inertial resistor-capacitor network in the
      feedback loop, and with complementary IGFETs between the voltage
      supply buses and the transistor sources, the interconnected gates
      of these complementary IGFETs constituting the input of the first
      stage and the amplifier output constituting the output of the
      first stage of the multivibrator.<br>
      <br>
      It is also advantageous that the time discriminator controller
      comprise series connected resistor and inverter, a first pulse
      counter with the data input thereof connected to the inverter
      output, the counter control input connected to its output and with
      the counter reset input constituting the controller input, a
      second pulse counter with the data input and thereof connected to
      the reset input of the first counter, with the control input of
      the second counter connected to its output and with the reset
      input of the second counter connected to the output of the first
      counter.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable that the time discriminator comprise an OR gate
      and a pulse counter with the reset input thereof connected to the
      OR gate output, the data input constituting the time discriminator
      input and the control input of the counter connected to its
      output.<br>
      <br>
      It is also desirable that the controllable power supply comprise a
      voltage supply and a flip-flop with the set input thereof
      connected via a switch to the output of the voltage supply, with
      the reset inputs thereof constituting the inputs of the
      controllable power supply, and with the output thereof connected
      to the control input of an electronic key, the input whereof is
      connected to the voltage supply.<br>

      The present invention pertains to medicine and may be used in
      different scientific and technical fields where a biological
      subject is studied in order to obtain information about the
      complex resistance components (electrical conduction) of its
      tissues. The present invention is used for improving the
      measurement precision of the electrical conduction in organic
      tissues and relates to a method that comprises placing electrodes
      on predetermined sections of the subject's skin. A high-quality
      inductance coil is connected at a predetermined moment to a DC
      voltage supply and saturated with electromagnetic energy, after
      which the coil is instantaneously connected to the electrodes.
      Free oscillations occur in an oscillation circuit, wherein the
      elements of said circuit are the coil induction and the complex
      resistance of the tissues in the electrode gap. After measuring
      the parameters of said oscillations, it is possible to calculate
      the complex resistance components (electrical conduction) of the
      biological subject's tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to medicine, and particularly, to
      electroneuroadapting stimulators, and can be used for
      electrostimulation procedures for medical, prophylactic and
      diagnostic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Nowadays there are widely applied electrostimulators -
      devices that act upon the body with electric signals of various
      form, duration and power.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Most of such devices are of little effect because they are
      not supplied with the control system of the body reaction upon the
      electrostimulation (for example, electrostimulators, protected by
      the USA patents, such as No3511641, MK pi . A61N1/36, in 1966;
      No3589370, MK pi . A61N1/36, in 1967; No4177819, MK pi . 4
      A61N1/36, in 1979; author's certificate of USSR No865300, MK pi .
      4 A61N1/36, in 1981; No1034750, MK pi . 4 A61N1/36, in 1983;
      No1351612, MK pi . 5 A61N1/37, in 1987).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] More consummate are electrostimulators that allow to
      determine the time of the action by the reaction of the body upon
      the electrostimulation. Such devices were called
      electroneuroadapting stimulators or bioelectric regulators of
      psychosomatic homeostasis, as they regulate functional condition
      of the body with signals, similar to nerve impulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Known in the art is an electrostimulator described in the
      author's certificate of USSR No1817335, M PI K 6 A61N1/36,
      published in 1995, From.No24, that allows to set the action dose
      according to the body reaction upon this action. The
      electrostimulator consists of a pulsed oscillator, a modulator, a
      power amplifier, active and passive electrodes, a differentiator,
      an indicator, an envelope curve former, a multiplier, and an
      energy stimulus controller. The disadvantage of this
      electrostimulator is low accuracy of determining the body
      adaptation to the stimulating action that leads to reduction of
      the therapeutic effect of the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Electrostimulating device, protected by the patent of
      Russian Federation No2091089 MTTK 6 A61N1/36, published in 1997,
      From No27, that is unlike electrostimulator, protected by the
      author's certificate No1817335, additionally contains a signal
      conditioner, its inputs being connected to the outputs of the
      pulsed oscillator and the power amplifier, a time gate and a
      summator connected between the envelope curve former and the
      multiplier. It results in increasing of the speed of tracking of
      the body reaction upon the stimulating action, increasing of the
      dosage accuracy, and, consequently, the effect of treatment. The
      disadvantage of this electrostimulating device is low diagnostic
      capabilities, as diagnostics is carried out by frequency and
      intensity of flashes of the light-emitting diode indicator
      switched into the supply circuit of the power amplifier and, to a
      greater extent, depends upon the subjective perception of the
      person conducting the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A bioelectrical regulator of psychosomatic homeostasis,
      protected by the patent of Russian Federation No2068277, M PI K 6
      A61N1/36, A61H39/00, published in 1996, From.No35, is supplied
      with higher accuracy of diagnostics (disclosing the character of
      pathology) and allows to prognosticate the effect of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] This bioelectric regulator of psychosomatic homeostasis
      (electroneuroadapting stimulator) consists of a square-wave
      generator, connected in series; a stimulating signal forming unit;
      a switching-type amplifier supplied with a transformer output,
      connected to the active and passive electrodes; connected to the
      active electrode a concatenated half-wave rectifier, a measuring
      unit of duration and speed of the duration change of the first
      halt-wave of forced oscillations, a unit of indication and
      control; and the a set up unit of parameters of stimulating
      signals, connected to the second input of the stimulating signal
      forming unit. The accuracy of diagnostics is increased due to the
      duration of the first half-wave of damped oscillations testifying
      to the character and deepness of the pathology, and the speed of
      the duration change testifying to the results of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The disadvantage of this bicelectric regulator of
      psychosomatic homeostasis, used as prior art, consists in that due
      to the narrow-band output of the switching-type amplifier the
      change of the area of action leads to the change of the level of
      the stimulating signal that decreases the effect of treatment and
      accuracy of diagnostics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] Technical achievement of application of this invention
      consists in creation of electroneuroadapting stimulator providing
      higher effect of treatment and wider diagnostic capabilities due
      to coordination of the level of the stimulating signal with
      electrophysiological parameters of the body area being acted upon.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The above mentioned technical achievement is reached by the
      fact that electroneuroadapting stimulator comprising the power
      supply; the set up unit of parameters of stimulating signal; the
      active and passive electrodes; and the reactive load
      switching-type amplifier, the active electrode being connected to
      one of its taps, and the passive electrode being connected to the
      other tap; includes a microprocessor with the set up unit of
      parameters of the stimulating signal being connected to its first
      input port; an analog-to-digital converter with its input being
      connected to the active electrode, and the output being connected
      to the second input port of the microprocessor; and the reactive
      load adjusting unit with its input being connected to the first
      output of the microprocessor, that has its second output being
      connected to the input of the switching-type amplifier, the
      reactive load of the switching-type amplifier has a component of
      adjustment connected to the reactive load adjusting unit; the
      display unit is connected to the third output of the
      microprocessor; and the power supply is connected to one of the
      taps of the reactive load of the switching-type amplifier. In
      accordance with the preferred embodiment of the
      electroneuroadapting stimulator, the reactive load of the
      switching-type amplifier is performed as an inductance coil having
      a ferromagnetic core as a component of adjustment; and the
      reactive load adjusting unit contains a comparator, its first
      input being simultaneously the input of the adjusting unit, the
      second input being the input of the reference voltage and the
      output being connected to the control winding of the micromotor
      that has its shaft being connected through reducer to the
      ferromagnetic core that is installed into the inductance coil, so
      that it can be displaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The inductance coil is performed as two-sectional, with the
      correlation of windings in the sections from 2:1 to 10:1, the
      sections being connected in series. In the reactive load of the
      switching-type amplifier, performed as a two-sectional inductance
      coil, if the point of junction of the sections is the tap for
      connection of the power supply, the end of the section containing
      less windings is the tap for connection of the switching-type
      amplifier, and the end of the section containing more windings is
      the tap for connection of the active electrode. If the point of
      junction of the sections is the tap for connection of the active
      electrode, the end of the section containing less windings is the
      tap for connection of the switching-type amplifier; and the end of
      the section containing more windings is the tap for connection of
      the power supply and the passive electrode. If the point of
      junction of the sections is the tap for connection of the
      switching-type amplifier and the passive electrode, the end of the
      section containing less windings is the tap for connection of the
      power supply; and the end of the section containing more windings
      is the tap for connection of the active electrode. If the point of
      junction of the sections is the tap for connection of the
      switching-type amplifier, the end of the section containing less
      windings is the tap for connection of the power supply and the
      passive electrode; and the end of the section containing more
      windings is the tap for connection of the active electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The inductance coil should have high quality of 500, the
      inductance within 1.0+/-0.9 henry, and the component of adjustment
      should provide the change of the inductance of the coil within
      0.5...1.0 of the largest extremum.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] The claimed electroneuroadapting stimulator (Fig.1)
      consists of connected in series set up unit 1 of parameters of the
      stimulating signal, a microprocessor 2 and a switching-type
      amplifier 3 with a reactive load 4, active 5 and passive 6
      electrodes being connected to it. The input of the
      analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 7 that converts electric
      potential difference between the active 5 and passive 6 electrodes
      into a string of codes is connected to the active electrode 5. The
      output of ADC 7 is connected to the second port of the input of
      the microprocessor 2. The reactive load 4 contains a component of
      adjustment that changes its reactive component within 0.5...1.0 of
      the largest extremum. The component of adjustment of the reactive
      load 4 is connected to the reactive load adjusting unit 8, having
      its input connected to the second output of the microprocessor 2.
      To the third output of the microprocessor 2 there is connected a
      display unit 9, meant for displaying the parameters of firing
      pulses and the stimulating action. The power supply 10 provides
      precise supply for the switching-type amplifier 3 through the
      reactive load 4 and reference voltage for the adjusting unit 8. In
      the conventional stimulator, the switching-type amplifier 3 (Fig.
      2) is represented as a transistor V1, its base (input 13) being
      delivered firing (enabling) pulses of normed amplitude and
      predetermined duration from the microprocessor 2, and its
      collector being connected through the protecting diode V2 to one
      of the taps of the reactive load 4 (output 14).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
      electroneuroadapting stimulator, the reactive load 4 is performed
      as a two-sectional inductance coil (Fig. 3) with the correlation
      of windings in the sections from 2:1 to 10:1. As a component of
      adjustment, the inductance coil has a ferromagnetic core 11. In
      this case, the reactive load adjusting unit 8 (Fig. 4) contains a
      comparator 15, its first input being connected to the output 12 of
      the microprocessor 2, the second input being connected to the
      bus-bar E of the power supply 10, and the output being connected
      to the control winding of the micromotor 16, having its shaft
      mechanically connected through reducer 17 to the ferromagnetic
      core 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Variants of connection of the taps of the reactive load 4
      are shown in Fig. 3a,..Fig. 3r.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Fig. 3a shows the point of junction of the sections 1 and
      11 being connected to the passive electrode 6 and the bus-bar E of
      the power supply 10, the section I containing less windings being
      connected to the output 14 of the switching-type amplifier 3, and
      the section 11 containing more windings being connected to the
      active electrode 5. Fig. 36 shows the point of junction of the
      sections I and II being connected to the active electrode 5, the
      section 1 being connected to the output 14 of the switching-type
      amplifier 3, and the section II being connected to the passive
      electrode 6 and the bus-bar E of the power supply 10. Fig. 3a
      shows the point of junction of the sections I and II being
      connected to the output 14 of the switching-type amplifier 3 and
      the passive electrode 6, the section I being connected to the
      bus-bar E of the power supply 10, the section II being connected
      to the active electrode 5. Fig. 3r shows the point of junction of
      the sections I and II being connected to the output 14 of the
      switching-type amplifier 3, the section I being connected to the
      bus-bar E of the power supply 10 and the passive electrode 6, the
      section II being connected to the active electrode 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The principle of operation of the electroneuroadapting
      stimulator is based upon the fact that stimulating signals, that
      act upon the tissue structure under the electrode are electric
      oscillations in an oscillatory circuit formed by connected in
      series reactive load and capacitive and reactive components of
      impedance of the tissue structure under the electrode, appearing
      together with stopping of action of firing pulse on the input of
      the switching type amplifier 3 after it has been disconnected.
      Parameters of these oscillations (amplitude, frequency, damping
      time) to 90...95% depend only upon electrophysiological condition
      of the tissue structure under the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] It depends on the constancy of level of oscillations
      energy, stability of the parameters of the reactive load and
      elimination of influence of impedance of contact "electrode -
      tissue under the electrode". Stability of the parameters of the
      reactive load is achieved by a high-quality inductance coil (with
      high quality over 500). Constancy of the oscillations energy is
      achieved due to being equal to the energy accumulated in the
      reactive load with the switching-type amplifier 3 being switched
      on and depends only upon the duration of firing pulse. To exclude
      any influence upon the parameters of the electric oscillations of
      impedance of contact "electrode - tissue under the electrode", it
      is enough to use the electrodes having the contact area over 5
      mm&lt;2&gt; and choose resonance frequency of the oscillatory
      circuit over 100 kHz at the expense of the parameters of the
      reactive load. Under such conditions, the value of the capacitive
      component of impedance of contact "electrode - tissue under the
      electrode" is two orders less than the value of the capacitive
      component of impedance of the tissue structures under the
      electrode. Thus, with high stability of firing pulses,
      characteristics of the switching-type amplifier 3, the parameters
      of the reactive load 4, that can be easily realized under modern
      technical conditions, and, provided that the contact area is over
      5 mm&lt;2&gt; and the resonance frequency of the oscillatory
      circuit is over 100 kHz, the parameters of free oscillations in
      the oscillatory circuit will reflect biochemical processes and
      physical condition of the tissue structures under the electrode
      with high accuracy, as the active component of impedance of these
      structures characterized blood filling and admittance of the
      intertissular medium and capacitive component characterizes
      cellular and intercellular polarization. Disbalance of the
      biochemical processes under the influence of the stimulating
      signal will cause the changing of both active and reactive
      component of the impedance of the tissue structures under the
      electrode. In its turn, this changing causes changing of the
      parameters of free oscillations in the oscillatory circuit formed
      by series connection ot the inductance of the reactive load 3 and
      the capacitive component of impedance of the tissue structures
      under the electrode. Measuring the parameters of these
      oscillations allows to judge about the body reaction upon the
      stimulating action. When the balance of the biochemical processes
      is achieved, the stimulating action stops its influence upon the
      value of impedance of the tissue structures under the electrode
      and it should be stopped, as overdose of the stimulating action
      may lead to negative result. Therapeutic effect of applying the
      electroneuroadapting stimulator of psychosomatic homeostasis in
      many respects depends upon the accuracy of determining the moment
      when the balance of the biochemical processes is achieved, i.e.
      when the impedance of the tissue structures under the electrode
      stops changing under the influence of the stimulating signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Operation of the claimed electroneuroadapting stimulator of
      psychosomatic homeostasis is described taking into account the
      algorithm of operation of the microprocessor 2 shown in Fig. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Switching on the electroneuroadapting stimulator is carried
      out with the set up unit 1 of parameters of the stimulating signal
      that is performed as a push-button control panel and the
      parameters of firing pulses - duration of firing pulses tH, firing
      pulse repetition period TH, number of firing pulses in series NH,
      duration of the series of firing pulses tau ccp, duration of the
      stimulating action tC.R., and repetition frequency of the
      stimulating action FC.R. are recorded into on-line storage of the
      microprocessor 2. After the parameters of firing pulses have been
      recorded into the on-line storage of the microprocessor 2, the
      timer is activated, control time and current number of pulse are
      set to zero and there starts counting of the current time and
      comparing it with the control time. If the current time is equal
      to the control one (t-tk=0), firing pulse-shaping circuit is
      started and it is reset when the difference between the current
      and control time is equal to tH. Pulses with normed amplitude are
      delivered from the output of the firing pulse-shaping circuit to
      the input 13 of the switching-type amplifier 3 and switch it on.
      During action of firing pulse, there is conducted electric current
      through the inductance coil of the reactive load 4 and inside the
      inductance coil there is accumulated electromagnetic energy that
      can be determined by the following expression:<br>
      <br>
      EMI8.1<br>
      <br>
      L - is value of the inductance of the reactive load 4,<br>
      E - is voltage of the power supply 10,<br>
      r0 - is internal resistance of the power supply 10,<br>
      rL - is ohmic resistance of the reactive load 4,<br>
      rK pi - is resistance of the open switching-type amplifier 3,<br>
      tH - is duration of the pulse,<br>
      <br>
      [0029] After the action of firing pulse has been stopped, the
      switching-type amplifier 3 is switched off and in the oscillatory
      circuit, formed by series connection of the inductance of the
      reactive load 4, equivalent capacitance C3 and equivalent ohmic
      resistance R3 of the tissue structures under the electrode, there
      appear electric oscillations that can be described by the
      following expression:<br>
      <br>
      EMI8.2<br>
      <br>
      Um - is amplitude of the first half-wave of oscillations;<br>
      alpha - is speed of oscillation damping;<br>
      f - is frequency of oscillations;<br>
      L is inductance of the reactive load 4;<br>
      C3 - is equivalent capacitance of the tissue structures under the
      electrode;<br>
      E - is voltage of the power supply 10;<br>
      r0 - is internal resistance of the power supply 10;<br>
      rL - is ohmic resistance of the reactive load 4;<br>
      rK pi - is resistance of the switching-type amplifier 3 being
      switched on;<br>
      tH - is duration of the firing pulse;<br>
      R3 - is equivalent ohmic resistance of the tissue structures under
      the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] From the output 7 of ADC, voltage codes between the active
      5 and passive 6 electrodes are read with the frequency that is 10
      - 20 times higher than the oscillations frequency and are
      delivered to the microprocessor 2. In the microprocessor 2,
      supplied with special subprogram, there are determined Um -
      amplitude of the first half-wave of oscillations, f - frequency of
      oscillations and T0.5 - time of damping of amplitude of
      oscillations to level 0.5. Then the control time is set equal to
      the time of start of the next firing pulse (tx DELTA t-tM+TM) and
      1 is added to the current number of the pulse (N DELTA N+1); after
      that the new number of the pulse is compared with the set value of
      pulses in N series and, if they are not equal, another firing
      pulse is formed and new values Um,f, and T0.5 are determined; if
      they are equal, the control time is set equal to the time of start
      of new series of firing pulses (tK DELTA t-TM(N-1)-tk+ tau cep),
      the current number of the pulse is set equal to zero (N DELTA 0)
      and subprogram of trimming of the inductance coil of the reactive
      load 4 is started. According to this program, change Um during the
      duration of series of firing pulses is determined and, in
      accordance with the value of this change, PWM voltage delivered to
      the input 8 of the reactive load adjusting unit is corrected, and
      with the help of the component of adjustment - the ferromagnetic
      core 11 the inductance of the inductance coil is being changed
      until the value Um is not equal to the initial value, This allows
      to increase the accuracy of determining the body reaction upon the
      stimulating action, as when the equivalent capacitance of the
      impedance of the tissue structures under the electrode is being
      changed, wave resistance of the oscillatory circuit is maintained
      constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The sign of no reaction of the body upon the stimulating
      action and termination of the stimulation is determined by
      constancy of at least one of parameters of electric oscillations
      (Um, f, and T0.5) during the next series of firing pulses, i.e.
      when the following condition is executed:<br>
      DELTA Um=Um1 - UmNH = 0, or DELTA f = DELTA f1 - DELTA fNH = 0, or
      DELTA T0.5 = T&lt;1&gt;0.5 - T&lt;N&gt;0.5 = 0;<br>
      <br>
      DELTA Um - is change of the amplitude of the first half-wave of
      electric oscillations during the duration of series of firing
      pulses;<br>
      Um1 - is the amplitude of the first half-wave of electric
      oscillations from the first pulse in the series;<br>
      UmNH - is the amplitude of the first half-wave of electric
      oscillations from the last pulse in the series;<br>
      DELTA f- is the change of the frequency during the series of
      firing pulses;<br>
      f1 - is the frequency of electric oscillations after the first
      pulse in the series;<br>
      fNH - is the frequency of electric oscillations after the last
      pulse in the series;<br>
      DELTA T0.5 - is the change of time of damping of amplitude of free
      oscillations to level 0,5 during the duration of the series of
      firing pulses;<br>
      T&lt;1&gt;0.5 - is the time of damping of amplitude of
      oscillations to level 0,5 after the first pulse in the series;<br>
      T&lt;N&gt;0.5 - is the time of damping of amplitude of
      oscillations to level 0,5 after the last pulse in the series.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Constancy of one of the parameters of electric oscillations
      during the action of the stimulating signals (NH signals with
      pulse repetition period TH) testifies to the electrophysiological
      condition of the tissue structures under the electrode being
      unchanged or changed within the sensitivity of the device; the
      further action may convert it from tonic into stress one and
      eliminate therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Execution of one of those conditions will lead to switching
      off of the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In accordance with the subprogram of indication and
      diagnostics, there are generated signals for reflecting the
      characteristics allowing to judge objectively about the
      electrophysiological condition of the tissue structures under the
      electrode before the stimulating action and after that. Such
      characteristics are power level of the stimulating action (tH and
      NH are reflected), values of the active and reactive components of
      impedance of the tissue under the electrode at the beginning and
      at the end of the action (there reflected R3, C3, DELTA R3 and
      DELTA C3 - the final values of the active and reactive components
      of impedance and their change during the time of the action).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The effect of therapeutic action is increased due to the
      increase of accuracy of dosage of the stimulating action.
      Diagnostic capabilities are enlarged due to objectivizing of the
      results of the action.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The claimed electroneuroadapting stimulator can be easily
      made of the components available in industry. The microprocessor 2
      ADC 7 can be made of programmable logic devices FLEX 10k, the
      switching-type amplifier can be made of KT815 transistor. An
      inductance coil with the cup core E-18, E-22 can be used as the
      inductance coil.<br>

      The present invention pertains to medicine and may be used in
      different scientific and technical fields where a biological
      subject is studied in order to obtain information about the
      complex resistance components (electrical conduction) of its
      tissues. The present invention is used for improving the
      measurement precision of the electrical conduction in organic
      tissues and relates to a method that comprises placing electrodes
      on predetermined sections of the subject's skin. A high-quality
      inductance coil is connected at a predetermined moment to a DC
      voltage supply and saturated with electromagnetic energy, after
      which the coil is instantaneously connected to the electrodes.
      Free oscillations occur in an oscillation circuit, wherein the
      elements of said circuit are the coil induction and the complex
      resistance of the tissues in the electrode gap. After measuring
      the parameters of said oscillations, it is possible to calculate
      the complex resistance components (electrical conduction) of the
      biological subject's tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to the medicine and can be used in
      various fields of science and engineering that require information
      about the components of the complex impedance of the biological
      object's tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Lately, the trends of scientific and diagnostic studies of
      biological objects that make provision for analysis of parameters
      of measured complex impedance of various body areas of a
      biological object, so-called impedance methods, are being more and
      more widely practised. The main point of these methods is to
      measure the electrical parameters of the skin of a biological
      object in various body areas and compare them with the already
      studied parameters of the standard skin sample. Having determined
      to what extend these parameters deviate from the standard, a
      conclusion can be drawn about skin condition, diseases and other
      phenomena in a living organism...<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The disadvantage of the prior art lies in its low accuracy
      because of instability of frequency of self-excited oscillator and
      the amplitude of these oscillations being affected by the
      resistance of skin under the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The aim of the invention is to increase the accuracy of
      measuring the conductivity of the biological object's tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] The above mentioned aim is achieved by the fact that in the
      method for measuring the conductivity of the biological object's
      tissue that consists in superimposing the electrodes upon the skin
      area under examination and determining the components of the
      complex impedance of the conductivity of the biological object's
      tissue by parameters of electrical oscillations in the oscillatory
      circuit, including as its component the complex impedance of the
      tissue between the electrodes, the conductance coil preliminarily
      saturated with electromagnetic energy is connected to the
      electrodes and the components of the biological object's tissue
      are determined by the parameters of free oscillations that set on
      in the oscillatory circuit, including as its components the
      inductance of the inductance coil, the ohmic resistance and the
      capacitance of the biological object's tissue...<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The feature of the invention, i.e. the connection of
      saturated with electromagnetic energy inductance coil to the
      electrodes placed upon the biological object's skin area under
      examination, in order to determine the components of the complex
      impedance of the biological object's tissue, is unknown from the
      available prior art. Determining of the components of the complex
      impedance by parameters of free oscillations in the oscillatory
      circuit, having the inductance of the inductance coil saturated
      with electromagnetic energy and the impedance of the biological
      object's tissue between the electrodes is unknown as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] The essence of the applied method is revealed by the
      description of operation of the device (for the functional diagram
      of the device see Fig.1) that provides the applied method for
      measuring the conductivity of the biological object's tissue being

      The device consists of high-quality conductance coil 1, standard
      source of constant voltage 2, switch 3, active electrode 4 and
      passive electrode 5, that are put upon the biological object's
      skin area 6 under examination, in order to measure the

      electrode 5 is connected to a common bus 8, that, in its turn, has
      one of the terminals of the source 2 and the lead of the
      conductance coil 1 being connected to it. The unit of control and
      measurement connected to the tap of the conductance coil 1
      provides the measurement of the parameters of free oscillations in
      the oscillatory circuit...<br>

      1. The ways of influences, the most optimal for SCENAR therapy
      were defined: local, symmetrical, horizontal, general zone, where
      the reactions of the body are defined: IR, DR, D, 0. An operator
      consecutively determines body reactions with next influence
      depending of increasing of the patient response.<br>
      <br>
      2. The algorithm of influence of SCENAR therapy depends of two
      comparing reactions and next influence is made to the high
      reaction. Few different ways are determined of this algorithm.<br>
      <br>
      FIELD: medicine. ^ SUBSTANCE: method involves applying primary
      treatment using pulsating SCENAR current sequentially arranging
      the device in zone of complaint and additionally in zone arranged
      symmetrically to the zone of complaint and horizontally
      equidistant from vertebral column line. Sequential positioning is
      carried out with initial SCENAR response values being determined
      until a value differing from the previous ones is detected.
      Individually dosed SCENAR treatment factor value is determined in
      position distinguished by maximum value of initial SCENAR response
      value from passed positions. The initial SCENAR response values
      measurement is continued in determining individually dosed SCENAR
      treatment factor values in positions distinguished by growing
      initial response values.; Current SCENAR response values are
      determined in the positions characterized by growing individually
      dosed SCENAR treatment factor values where organism response to
      pulsating SCENAR current vanishes when electric skin tissue
      impedance stops changing. Zone of maximum current SCENAR response
      value characterized in organism response to pulsating SCENAR
      current action vanishing is selected as optimum for applying
      SCENAR therapy. The same is done in one of two positions having
      individually dosed SCENAR treatment factor values characterized in
      organism response to pulsating SCENAR current action vanishing.
      The position is distinguished by greater value of individually
      dosed SCENAR treatment factor.; Zone of maximum current SCENAR
      response value characterized in organism response to pulsating
      SCENAR current action vanishing is selected as optimum for
      applying electric pulse SCENAR therapy. ^ EFFECT: enhanced

      state; reflex therapy. ^ SUBSTANCE: methods can be used for
      diagnostics and correction of state of organism by means of
      electro-stimulation. Method of acupuncture diagnostics is based
      upon measurement of electric conductivity of skin in 24
      biologically active representative points of 12 pair meridians of
      acupuncture skin areas, upon building reference spreadsheet of
      electric conductivities and individual corridor. Electric
      conductivity is estimated on the base of direction values which go
      out of limits of individual corridor borders.; Borders of
      individual corridor are found from relations of T=Ca.Kt+Delta1 and
      L= Ca.Kl-Delta2, where T is top border of individual corridor, Ca
      is average normalized electric conductivity of all meridians, Kt
      =1,05-1,2, namely normalizing coefficient of top border of
      individual corridor, Delta1=2-5 is value of tolerance which
      compensates errors in measurement for determination of top border
      of individual corridor, L is lower border of individual corridor,
      Kl =0,8-0,95 is normalizing coefficient of lower border of
      individual corridor, Delta2=2-5 is value of tolerance which
      compensates errors in measurement for determination of lower
      border of individual corridor.; Pair meridians are found where one
      biologically active representative point has electric conductivity
      coinciding with individual corridor, and the other has electric
      conductivity being higher than top and being lower than lower
      border of individual corridor. Method diagnostics has higher
      precision due to determination of borders of individual corridor
      of any person. Method of correction of functional state of
      organism is based upon measurement of electric conductivity of
      skin in 24 biologically active points of 12 pair meridians of
      acupuncture skin areas, upon building of normalization spreadsheet
      of electric conductivities and upon building of individual
      corridor, and upon evaluation of electric conductivity from
      direction of values which go out of borders of individual
      corridor.; Correction of functional state of organism is preformed
      due to electric influence onto biologically active points. For the
      purpose after the individual corridor built, the number of
      meridians where electric conductivity of biologically active
      representative points exceeds top border of individual corridor
      and number of meridians where electric conductivity is lower than
      low border of individual corridor as well as the value of meanings
      which is smaller and which pair meridians belong to the smaller
      quantity. To make stimulating influence, biologically active
      points are chosen of those pair meridians which meet the three
      conditions.; First condition relates to meridians where one
      biologically active representative point has electric conductivity
      which coincides with values of individual corridor of standard and
      the other biologically active representative point has electric
      conductivity being higher or lower than lower border of individual
      corridor. Second condition relates to meridians which belong to
      smaller quantity of those ones where electric conductivities of
      biologically active representative pints go out of borders of
      individual corridor. The third condition relates to meridians
      where difference in electric conductivities of biologically active
      representative points has maximal value.; If individual corridor
      is higher than averaged corridor of norm for healthy person, then
      electric influence onto biologically active representative points
      of selected meridian is carried out at excitation mode, and if
      individual corridor is lower than - in mode of brake. ^ EFFECT:
      improved efficiency of influence due to correct selection of
      points to make influence on.<br>

      is increased because of BFB of local physiological reactions on
      the grounds of analysis of free vibration’s waves.<br>
      <br>
      Medical equipment, in particular, electronic devices for
      electrostimulation of human organism, applicable for action of
      electric pulses on areas of human dermatic integument with the aim
      of exerting a generally regulatory influence on human physiologic
      systems and attaining an analgetic effect. SUBSTANCE: the
      electrostimulator has a square-wave unit, control unit, energy
      action control unit, output unit, passive and active electrodes,
      pulse burst shaping unit, feedback unit, individual norm storage
      unit and a sounding signal parameter recording unit. EFFECT:
      expanded functional abilities attained due to introduction of
      local, physiologic feedback on the basis of analysis of half-waves
      of free oscillations of stimulating pulses, improved therapeutic
      effect<br>
