      The new invention will offer uninterrupted power supply at no
      cost, says the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      This was the view expressed by most of those who attended an
      investor's dinner in Abuja where the invention was presented and
      demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      The invention called Self-Sustaining Emagnetodynamics Machine,
      according to the inventor, Izuogu, was made possible after over 30
      years of research and work.<br>
      <br>
      Already, the machine has received patents from 104 countries and
      is recognized by the World Intellectual Property Organization
      (WIPO).<br>
      <br>
      Presenting it to the investors at the dinner which included former
      Vice-President Alex Ekwueme, Senator Osita Izunaso, Gen. Chris
      Garuba (Rtd), Alhaji Alani Bankole, Prof Peter Onwualu who is
      Director-General of Raw Material Research and Development Council
      (RMRDC), Izuogu said the machine is capable of generating as much
      megawatt of electricity as could power Nigeria.<br>
      <br>
      "We are here today to announce to you that this machine can give
      uninterruptible electricity power supply to our nation and because
      it uses no input energy to operate, government can indeed make
      Nigerians pay nothing for electricity."<br>
      <br>
      He said that the new invention, when fully installed, would also
      eliminate running cost as it is self-sustaining and needs no
      diesel or petrol to power it.<br>
      <br>
      The machine, he said, became possible after turning the two laws
      of emagnetodynamics into interpretable work.<br>
      <br>
      "We are here today because some 33 years ago, while I worked as a
      missionary itinerant evangelist of the gospel in Benin City, the
      Almighty God gave me a vision of a machine that could help solve
      the energy problems of the world. Right there in 1980, I received
      the two laws of emagnetodynamics.<br>
      <br>
      "By June 5, 1982 I had succeeded in turning these two laws into a
      working machine. It was very exciting but because of the
      frightening and intimidating effects of the well known science
      laws, I was scared to publish my findings. I wished to work more
      and prove these things very well. So, I worked for another 27
      years before I approached the World Intellectual Property
      Organisation for a patent.<br>
      <br>
      "Under the direction of the WIPO, patents for this invention have
      now been filed in 104 nations of the world," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Describing the machine, WIPO said "the self-sustaining
      emagnetodynamics machine utilizes a theory that is different from
      the age old theory on which electric motors have been built for
      over five hundred [sic] years since the days of the great inventor
      and scientist, Michael Faraday."<br>
      <br>
      WIPO said: "The present invention is a magnet motor that utilizes
      the inventor's first and second laws of emagnetodynamics as well
      as the inventor's horse orientation theory of magnetism."<br>
      <br>
      It said, "the critical feature of this machine is that it is
      distinguishable from earlier invention of the non self sustaining
      emagnetodynamics machine in that the self-sustaining machine
      generates a feedback current which provides release from the
      backlash stators and therefore the machine is able to run without
      any external source of energy."<br>

      Inventor DR EZEKIEL 0 IZUOGU<br>
      Citizenship NIGERIA <br>
      Residence HOUSE 8 ROAD 6922, GWARIMPA, ABUJA<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is in the technical field of PHYSICS<br>
      <br>
      More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field
      of ENERGY.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art in such technical field includes: <br>
      <br>
      THE ELECTRIC OR BATTERY OPERATED EMAGNETODYNAMICS MOTOR, THEORY OF
      MAGNETISM AND THE THEORY OF FORCE EXERTED ON A CURRENT-CARRYING
      CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD.<br>
      <br>
      FORCE IS EXERTED ON A CURRENT CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC
      FIELD THIS THEORY HAS BEEN EXPLOITED IN BUILDING THE ELECTRIC
      MOTOR WHICH IS A MACHINE THAT CONVERTS ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO
      MECHANICAL ENERGY THE EMAGNETODYNAMICS MOTOR WORKS ON A DIFFERENT
      THEORY, NAMELY THE LAWS OF EMAGNETODYNAMICS.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is a MAGNET MOTOR, CALLED THE
      SELF-SUSTAINING EMAGNETODYNAMICS MACHINE THAT UTILISES THE
      INVENTOR'S FIRST AND SECOND LAWS OF EMAGNETODYNAMICS AS WELL AS
      THE INVENTOR'S HORSE ORIENTATION THEORY OF MAGNETISM<br>
      <br>
      The first law states as follows:<br>
      <br>
      A SUSPENDED COMPOSITE MAGNETIC POLE WILL ROTATE IN A CERTAIN
      DIRECTION IF PLACED IN THE VICINITY OF AN ARRAY OF LIKE POLES OF
      MAGNETS.<br>
      <br>
      The second law states that:<br>
      <br>
      THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION IS THAT OF THE COMPOSITE POLE SIMILAR TO
      THE ARRAY*<br>
      <br>
      *(The inventor acknowledges the similarity between these laws and
      that of Faraday's discovery of the force exerted on a
      current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. His knowledge of
      Faraday's work certainly inspired and guided him to establish
      similar laws for the movement of magnets without current-carrying
      conductors.)<br>
      <br>
      THE CRITICAL FEATURE OF THIS MACHINE IS THAT IT IS DISTINGUISHABLE
      FROM THE EARLIER INVENTION OF THE NON SELF-SUSTAINING
      EMAGNETODYNAMICS MACHINE IN THAT THE SELF-SUSTAINING MACHINE
      GENERATES A FEEDBACK CURRENT WHICH PROVIDES RELEASE FROM THE
      BACKLASH STATORS AND THEREFORE THE MACHINE IS ABLE TO RUN WITHOUT
      ANY EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ENERGY WHILE AN ELECTRIC MOTOR CONVERTS
      ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO MAGNETIC ENERGY AND THEN CONVERTS MAGNETIC
      ENERGY TO MECHANICAL ENERGY, THE SELF-SUSTAINING EMAGNETODYNAMICS
      MOTOR, LIKE ITS NON-SELF-SUSTAINING COUNTERPART, CONVERTS AN
      INTERACTION OF MAGNETIC POLES DIRECTLY TO MECHANICAL ENERGY,
      WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF CURRENT-CARRYING
      CONDUCTORS<br>
      <br>

      of four copper bolts.<br>

      The circular Perspex plates 49, 51, 53, 55, is each carrying three
      permanent magnets as 18,19,20 mounted on each plane, as well as
      the electromagnets 22,32. The five stators of a plane are placed
      round a circular hole of diameter 480 mm cut at the centre of
      Perspex. The stators cover an angle of 180 degrees. This means an
      angle of 45 degrees between one stator and its adjacent one. The
      circular distance, measured along the circumference of the circle
      between the centre of one stator and the adjacent stator,
      determines the circuler length of the distance between the north
      and south poles of the composite polarity of the rotor. The
      circular Perspex plates 49,51,53,55, are now held firmly by
      sliding down the aluminium sleeves to tighten The aluminium vanes
      76 carrying the two permanent magnets, in each plane, that form
      the composite poles, are now tightened into place and the top end
      of the rotor is slid into the upper ball bearing 11 in the copper
      support 28. Nuts are now tightened at the threaded ends of the
      brass supports 35,37 to make the system strong and rigid. A dc
      battery 21 is now connected to the release electromagnets via the
      ignition key 12, the motor 25 and the nine brushes The dc motor 25
      is connected in parallel with the release electromagnets and is
      protected from the heavy current surge by a heavy duty resistor
      23.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 2</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The system is ready to run As the ignition key 12 is turned,
      current from the battery 21 turns on the dc motor 25, which turns
      the rotor in a clockwise direction (which must coincide with the
      direction in which the second law of Emagnetodynamics says the
      rotor will move ). The motor 25 is able to turn the rotor 26 by
      means of wheel and pinion arrangement (The rotor 26 carries a
      cogged wheel 144 mm in diameter, while the motor carries a cogged
      wheel, 10mm in diameter, much like a kickstarter in an internal
      combustion engine ) The battery 21 simultaneously energises the
      Distributor 27, and motor 25. The distributor 27 makes electrical
      contact with the brushes 33, 35, 37,39,41,43,45, thereby
      energizing the Release electromagnets much like a distributor in a
      conventional internal combustion engine would fire the four PLUGS.
      The first release electromagnet 22 in plane 1, is timed to develop
      a North Pole strength which must equal, or nearly so, the pole
      strength of the stator permanent Magnets. This must happen at the
      INSTANT that the magnetic axis of the leading composite pole of
      the rotor has just crossd the magnetic axis of the Electromagnet
      22. The rotor 26 moves on and at the point where the magnetic axis
      of the leading rotor composite pole is about to cross the magnetic
      axis of the last rotor permanent magnet 19, the distributor 27
      makes contact with the second brush 35, thereby energizing the
      last stator electromagnet 32, and thereby freeing the trailing
      composite pole of the rotor, a South Pole which would have been
      otherwise attracted, and held back by the North pole of the last
      stator permanent magnet 19. This would have impaired the rotation
      of the rotor and stalled the machine. Being a four plane machine,
      torque exerted on the rotor by other stators in other planes,
      enables the rotor cover the idle distance and this brings it once
      more under the influence of the first stator electromagnet 22,
      whose iron core draws the leading north pole of the composite
      rotor pole under its influence and the process is repeated. The
      rotor is thus able to continue its rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Notice that the four vanes all attached to the rotor but
      traversing different stators in different planes, are not disposed
      at an angle of 90 degrees each.<br>
      <br>
      What we find, in fig 6B is that the first vane Vl is leading the
      second vane V2 by an angle of 90 degrees. V2 leads V3 by an angle
      of 135 degrees,while V3 leads V4 by an angle of 67.5 degrees. The
      simple angler disposition of rotor vanes in a four plane machine
      would have been to divide 360 degrees by four so each vane will
      lead the following vane by 90 degrees. We have not adopted this
      simplistic approach in the design because it would have meant the
      distributor will energize more than one electromagnet at the same
      time. Since the electromagnets draw enormous current from the
      feedback generator, the latter may not cope with this great drain
      on its scarce energy, and the system may stall. To avoid this
      fatal situation, the vanes are disposed as shown in fig 6. For a
      six plane machine the disposition of vanes will again be different
      and so on. The whole idea in the design is to avoid a situation
      where more than one release electromagnet is energized at the same
      instant.<br>
      <br>
      Were we building a five or six or twenty plane machine, the
      angular disposition must be determined separately for each case
      just as a designer of an internal combustion engine designing a
      four, five or six CYLINDER engines, must for each engine decide
      the angular disposition of the projections on the CAM SHAFT which
      in turn determine the FIRING SEQUENCE OF PLUGS IN THE compression
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing, we can see that though we call this machine a
      magnet motor, IN REALITY, AND FROM A DESIGN STANDPOINT, IT HAS FAR
      MORE IN COMMON WITH THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE THAN IT HAS
      WITH A CONVENTIONAL ELECTRIC MOTOR.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 3</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to the Fig 7, for the rotor 26 to rotate, it is
      necessary to ensure that the circular length of the vane
      approximately equals the circular distance between one stator
      magnetic axis and the next one.<br>
      This is a critical condition for the system to work. It is equally
      essential that the pole strength of all stator permanent magnets
      are equal or else the first and second laws of Emagnetodynamics
      would not have been complied with and the machine will not
      function.<br>
      <br>
      The Emagnetodynamics machine is essentially a magnet motor. It is
      therefore necessary to ensure that only non magnetic metals are
      used to build all the parts of the machine or else critical
      magnetic field strength required at certain points will be
      weakened or impaired. All bolts, nuts, etc are made of copper or
      brass or aluminium to avoid magnetic INTERFERENCES AND DISTORTIONS
      which would critically undermine the set up.<br>
      <br>
      Just like the plug of an internal combustion engine must be
      ignited at a particular TIMING, the release electromagnets must be
      "ignited"/energized at the proper TIMING in order to secure
      releases of the rotor 26 at the backlash points and keep the motor
      running. To ensure this PRECISION TIMING, the positions of the
      carbon brushes, are made adjustable, much like the TIMING CHAIN of
      an internal combustion engine. The brushes are mounted on bases
      that themselves move on circular grooves made on the rectangular
      Perspex 15. When the appropriate timing position has been
      determined, the brush base is screwed unto the Perspex base by
      means of a brass bolt and brass nut.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 4</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Refer to fig 7 of the invention,the rotor 26 is made of copper and
      is 870 mm high with holes made along its stem at various heights
      to take vane stems; these coincide with the heights of the four
      planes.<br>
      <br>
      While the rotor 26 has big stem with a diameter of 60 mm, and
      length 70mm,the rest of the body has a diameter of 30mm The slip
      rings 90,94 (width 10 mm and thickness 0.5 mm) are made of
      copper,which is both a good electrical conductor and non-rusting
      material. These are desirable properties to ensure there is always
      good electrical contact between the slip ring commutators and the
      brushes. The BRUSH CONTACT RESISTANCE must not be more than 0.2
      Ohms. Of course the slip ring commutators are effectively
      insulated from any electrical contact with the rotor, using paper
      insulation as is done for a conventional electric motor
      commutator.<br>
      <br>
      The permanent magnet stators, being the main source of torque
      exerted on the rotor 26 must be very powerful or else the
      resulting machine will be weak. In fact,the permanent magnet
      stators used by the inventor to build the working model of the
      non-self-sustaining emagnetodynamics machine each had magnetic
      pole strength that gave an angler deflection of 25 degrees on a
      magnetometer placed one meter away. The magnets were Alcomax
      magnets, but of course, since buying these magnets some twenty
      five years ago,more powerful magnets have been invented in the
      form of NEODYMIUM magnets.<br>
      <br>
      An Emagnetodynamics machine having only one plane is like an
      internal combustion engine having only one cylinder, as against
      the traditional four cylinders, four stroke engine or a
      conventional electric motor running on only one coil. The
      practical Emagnetodynamics motor must have many planes, at the
      very least, four planes in order to produce enough torque on the
      rotor 26 resulting in a powerful machine. The more the number of
      planes, the more powerful the resulting machine and it is
      desirable to build machines with as many as 10 to 20 planes even
      though MAGNETIC SHIELDING becomes of critical importance in order
      to shield the magnetic fields created by one plane from
      influencing the fluxes in an adjacent Plane.<br>
      <br>
      Reference fig. 21 of the invention. 51, 52, 53, 54 are
      electromagnet stators of a one plane machine. While 51, 52, 53 are
      all connected in parallel and energized together, 54 which is the
      release electromagnet is energized separately in a different
      circuit. It is found that for the system to rotate, some 120V must
      be fed to the three stators while 72V must be fed to the release
      stator 54. The current flowing in the first circuit as measured by
      ammeter Al is 45A, while A2 read 6A.<br>
      <br>
      If the power developed by this machine, rotating at 300 rpm is
      calculated it will be as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. 240V source is the main power input to the motor<br>
      <br>
      The control or auxiliary input to the motor supplies relatively
      negligible power when K2 is closed from the motor position at mmf
      axis of S2 to mmf axis of S4.<br>
      <br>
      Power output of the motor is Rotor Torque times Rotor Speed in
      radians per second<br>
      <br>
      Pout = T x [omega] = T x ( 300 x 2 [pi] ) / 60 = 10 pi T watts.<br>
      <br>
      3. Assuming lossless machine, Input Power = Output Power,<br>
      <br>
      Power from S1, S2, S3 = 45 x 240W = 10800W.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that K2 is on for [theta] radians per revolution (from S2
      axis to S4 axis), or 120 deg.,<br>
      <br>
      power from S4 = 72 x [theta] / 2 [pi] x 6 W = 68.75[Theta] W. =
      144.4W<br>
      <br>
      (a) Percentage of power attributed to S1, S2 and S3 = 10800 x 100
      / ( 10800 + 68.75 [theta] ) =98.7%<br>
      <br>
      (b) Percentage of control power attributed to S4 = 68.75 [Theta] x
      100 / (10800 + 68.75 [theta] ) = 1.3 %.<br>
      <br>
      FROM THIS RESULT IT IS CLEAR THAT IF A SMALL FEEDBACK GENERATOR IS
      LINKED TO THE ROTOR SPINDLE, IT WILL SUPPLY THE 1.3% POWER
      REQUIRED TO WORK THE RELEASE ELECTROMAGNET AND IF WE REPLACE THE
      ELECTROMAGNETS S1, S2, S3,WITH PERMANENT MAGNETS, WE HAVE A
      MACHINE WHOSE EFFICIENCY IS WELL OVER UNITY.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 5</span><br>
      <br>
      A different version of the self sustaining Emagnetodynamics
      machine can be built by adding a current booster in the circuit of
      the feedback generator The output of the feedback generator is
      then fed into a PULSE CIRCUIT,such as shown in fig 21 A pulse
      circuit is simply a circuit in which electrical energy is stored
      in a capacitor and discharged very fast A large current flows for
      a very brief period Since the release of rotor required at
      backlash points boils down to ACTION AT A POINT, lasting only a
      few milliseconds, the current pulse so produced is enough to free
      rotor at backlash points.<br>
      <br>
      DECEIT OF ENERGY<br>
      <br>
      It can also be argued that the selfsustaining emagnetodynamics
      machine<br>
      Os exploits the principle of deceit of energy This is explained
      this way<br>
      <br>
      In the conventional electric motor, full current must flow through
      the coils at any and every instant for the motor to function. This
      means HEAVY ENERGY must be constantly supplied to the electric
      motor. For the emagnetodynamics machine, it is not so. We do not
      need heavy energy at every instant. We need heavy energy only at
      the point where we need to secure the release of rotor vanes from
      the decelerating effects of backlash. For a machine rotating at a
      speed of 600 rpm or example,we need heavy current for how long ?<br>
      <br>
      A machine running at 6OOrpm is doing 10 rps. The diameter of slip
      ring commutator is 60 mm and the width of distributor is 20 mm. So
      this distributor makes contact with a carbon brush for 0.01
      seconds. This is one hundredth of a second, which is very short
      indeed. This is the PULSE DURATION. Besides or the rest of the
      time that one revolution lasts, the permanent magnet stators
      supply the torque needed for motion. The energy stored in the
      permanent magnets is converted to mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      The Television also uses the concept of DECEIT OF THE EYE. Small
      spots from an object hitting the retina, stay on for a few
      seconds. If this happens fast enough, different spots appear
      continuous and the eye "sees" the whole picture as one.<br>
      <br>
      One can say that the emagnetodynamics machine sees the pulse of
      energy appearing at the backlash points as one continuous chain by
      virtue of energy gaps covered by the permanent magnet stators<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 6</span><br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the sel sustaining Emagnetodynamics motor,over
      and above the conventional electric motor is obvious. It means
      this motor can replace electric motors wherever electric motors
      are being used presently. This includes but are not limited to
      electric cars, trains, trolleys, electric fans, etc. Miniaturised
      emagnetodynamics machines, if they can be built, will also replace
      electric motors in clocks, grinding machines, toys, etc. It could
      also be possible to install small emagnetodynamics machines to
      supply current to television sets and radios, so we can have these
      important gadgets that do not require electricity or battery to
      operate. Indeed the emagnetodynamics machine possesses the
      capacity to radically change the way we live. The energy saving
      for mankind will also be enormous. In a world where energy is
      scarce and costs so much, apart from its capability to disturb
      world peace, a machine that needs no external energy input to
      function will be of great interest and industrial value.<br>
      <br>
      The theory of Emagnetodynamics and the successful design of the
      Emagnetodynamics motor,which took thirty-one years to accomplish,
      opens a new field of learning in science and engineering. This is
      a field that needs to be more deeply explored by scientists and
      engineers around the world. The inventor has found the field very
      interesting and exciting indeed.<br>
      <br>
      More research work in this area will include, but not limited to,
      finding out the detailed characteristics of the Emagnetodynamics
      machine and just how they compare with those of the conventional
      electric motor and internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      To build compact and sturdy Emagnetodynamics machines, new and
      more efficient process of magnetic screening will have to be
      invented, along with more powerful and sturdy permanent magnets.
      That does include the invention of current-rich dc generators to
      work the Emagnetodynamic machine.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 7</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In broad embodiment, the invention is a motor that works on the
      principle of interaction of permanent magnets, or even
      electromagnets, utilizing the laws of Emagnetodynamics as against
      the force exerted on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      The theory of Emagnetodynamics is also a product of the inventor's
      research with magnets which lasted thirty-one years.<br>
      <br>
      Another version of the machine uses no vanes. The soft iron slabs
      are pasted on the rotor as angular dispersions. The rotor itself
      is made larger in diameter to accommodate this change in design.
      This version also has only two split ring commutators, much like
      the conventional electric motor. The planes could be up to 30 or
      more and this leads to a more sturdy and simple powerful machine
      that does over 2000 rpm.<br>

      « on: 2010-12-10, 14:21:48 »<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Some of you might be aware of the story about the Nigerian
      schoolgirls that allegedly made a free energy machine.&nbsp; Our
      comrades at EF have been following up on this and the trail has
      led to a person named Ezekiel Izuogu.&nbsp; This person has a new
      free energy machine that can allegedly power a house.&nbsp; I
      think that we have all heard that one before.<br>

      and a working model can be produced in 2 weeks.This is because the
      machine has no more than 10 parts.<br>
      <br>
      But the snag is that it is a patented product and if you wish to
      produce for commercial purposes the law demands that you sign a
      licensing with us.IF HOWEVER YOU WISH TO PRODUCE JUST ONE FOR YOUR
      OWN USE,YOU MAY NOT NEED A LICENSING AGREEMENT BUT YOU WILL HAVE
      TO PAY US FOR LIMITED RIGHT TO PRODUCE OUR DESIGN,WITH AN
      UNDERTAKING NOT TO<br>
      COMMERCIALISE.<br>
      <br>
      We can give you right to produce for personal use for just
      $100,000.00 with signed full money back guarantee.<br>
      <br>
      Machine will serve you for a minimum of 30 years with no external
      energy input.<br>
      <br>
      With a good mechanical engineering/production workshop,machine can
      be produced and working in a minimum of 2 weeks and maximum of 4.<br>
      <br>
      If you have any more questions,do not hesitate to get in touch.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>

      <br>
      The above represents the lowest of the low in the free energy
      cottage industry.&nbsp; This guy Ezekiel is hoping to strike it
      rich by finding a wealthy and gullible person that would be stupid
      enough to send him a bank transfer for $100,000.&nbsp; Then he
      will simply disappear.&nbsp; It's noteworthy to mention again that
      the trail started with the two Nigerian girls.&nbsp; The two girls
      don't have a small free energy machine, the whole thing is a
      scam.&nbsp; Reporters that have no technical knowledge can easily
      be manipulated into publishing articles about stuff that isn't
      real, it happens all the time.<br>

      According to the Nigerian inventor, Ezekiel Izuogu, he has a new
      machine almost ready for release to everyone. It is much larger
      than the earlier model perpetual motion generator that had a 60mm
      rotor. The rotor on the new machine will be 1000mm in diameter
      instead of 60mm. It will power a Japanese generator with the
      energy guzzling parts removed. So, maybe we should wait on the
      details of the new machine instead of jumping on the old one.
      Supposedly the new machine will power a small office or regular
      size house. So, that's an interesting update indeed.<br>
