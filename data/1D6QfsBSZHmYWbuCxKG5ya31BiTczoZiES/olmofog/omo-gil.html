      ... Developed over the past 5 years on the Canary Islands by
      Hernando Theo Olmo and Ricardo Gil, the “Water Gardens” are
      groupings of water-extracting towers for high volume and high
      quality water. Some of the planned uses are for forests, camping,
      fire suppression, agriculture, livestock, and human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      According to the website; After years of experimentation and
      improvement, our NRP 3.0 fog collectors are currently the most
      technically advanced and productive in the world in the last 50
      years in this sector, with a maximum collection of 1,074 liters /
      day and a life of more than 10 years.<br>
      <br>
      The NRP 3.0 fog collector, have a huge collecting surface of 56 m2
      into minimum space, only 1.6 m2, thus reducing the area occupied
      by 90% and minimizing the visual impact. Its three-dimensional
      structure gives great stability and prevents the loss of water out
      of the structure and also minimizes the influence of the wind
      direction in production of water. It also has a base designed to
      decant and filter the water before it passes to the tube system.<br>
      <br>
      The materials used give the NRP 3.0 high strength, low weight and
      high durability.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the rate cost-production, this system allows us to consider
      definitely the mists as another water resource, complementary to
      the existing resources, and this,&nbsp; in a practical,
      cost-effective, sustainable and innovative. Water from the mist
      can be used for qualitative and quantitative improvement of the
      waters from another origin, which can also help&nbsp; to reduce
      transportation costs, pumping or treatment of these, saving energy
      and minimizing pollution.<br>

      <b>Design Bases</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
        Development of fog collectors NRP 3.0</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As we have been working&nbsp; for some years in a scientific and
      in a&nbsp; professional way with the flat collectors or Chilean
      type, we realiced its complications and shortcomings. For this
      reason, in 2008 we began to design some collectors based on the
      following design bases:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A fog collector very stable against wind and with no need of
      tensioners, which occupies little space, easy to transport and to
      install, it does not need constant maintenance, it avoids constant
      loosing of water, (collected by the meshes) outside the structure,
      and therefore, the loss of production, which will increase the
      rate of precipitation of drops already captured, not been
      influenced by changes in the direction of the mist , so therefore,
      is is able to get more than 100 liters per day.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      With all these data, we design our NRP 3.0 fog collectors in
      different models depending on their size, whose name refers to
      plants of the Canarian forest: Erica, Pinea and Garoé.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is fog water collection?</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The fog, produced normaly by low clouds impacting against a
      rugged terrain, can be captured by special mesh placed pn a
      support structure. These meshes retain the tiny water drops
      floating in the air, imitating the process&nbsp; made ??by the
      treetops and giving the name to the phenomenon known as
      "horizontal precipitation".<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This technique is studied for over 50 years in many parts of the
      world and allows the use of this water resource.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It was in Chile, particularly in the Atacama Desert, where it
      began to research and develop collection instruments primarily
      between the years 1960-1980, with the help of distinguished
      researchers from the Catholic University of the North.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This is how the Chilean type "catchers" appeard, which have been
      used up to now. Although cheap and easy, these fog collectors have
      certain drawbacks such as low production, occupied area, water
      leaks out of the structure, stability problems and breakage.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In order to solve these problems, we have designed the NRP 3.0 fog
      collectors, which represent the most advanced technology and
      higher production worldwide today.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dimensional sensor water fog, dew and rain with overlapping inner
      layers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Collection, settling and filtering water mists, dew and rain,
      forest, agricultural and livestock and human use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since ancient times man has taken advantage of alternative water
      resource that nature offered, such as using the mists captured by
      vegetation and rocks waters.<br>
      <br>
      The best known case in the Canary Islands this type of
      exploitation is to Garoé Tree, a sacred tree in the Iron and that
      mentions the sixteenth century in which he recounted how their
      branches there flowed the precious liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Another example is the use of water mist captured by branches of
      heather or woolen blankets (in the Chilean desert Atiquipa) plus
      vine crops Lanzarote, in holes dug into gravel (lapilli) (which
      holds the condensation overnight due to its porosity).<br>
      <br>
      In the 60s a group of Chilean researchers (UCN) began
      investigating in capturing the Camanchacas water (sea fog), with
      such illustrious names as A. Acosta Baladon and C. Espinosa.<br>
      <br>
      The latter obtained a patent (not 18,424) for a device for
      capturing water in mist or camanchacas.<br>
      <br>
      The collected water ranged between 1.5 liters per day to a maximum
      of over 15 liters / day.<br>
      <br>
      The annual average was 3.9 captured liters a day between 1961 and
      1963).<br>
      <br>
      In the late 80s and early 90s, the research group led by Canadian
      Schemenauer R. and P. Cereceda, continued to work in the same
      region of Chile (Proyecto El Tofo), jumping to fame by supplying
      meshes flat trunks supported by 5 meters high (equipment Stándar
      Fog Collector or SFC) to Chungungo populated fisherman, who had
      440 permanent residents.<br>
      <br>
      After that they continued implementing this technique, CFS 0.5 x
      0.5 meters pickup surface worldwide (Namibia, Oman, Peru, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      In the Canaries, researchers and L. Pérez Santana, began to
      perform experiments in the archipelago in the early 80s
      (1983-1985).<br>
      <br>
      In the 90s, the professor of the Faculty of Geography, University
      of La Laguna, MV Marzol Jaen, began to implement the techniques of
      the Canadian group, with the use of SFC 0.5 x 0.5 meters, in
      Tenerife (Teno, Anaga, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      In the late 90's and early 2000, a private investigator, C.
      Sánchez Recio recorded in Canarias (in 2000) planes sensors (such
      as Chile) but slant auxiliary trays (and other models tapered
      trunk which have not materialized).<br>
      These teams represent the only record as a utility model in Spain
      of equipment to capture fog water (reference U9901838).<br>
      <br>
      Begins to realize, through his private company (Natural Aqua
      Canarias SL), projects the government majority for the
      implementation and use of these equipment (Aquair optimizer).<br>
      <br>
      They consist of a vertical frame of 5 x 2 meters, supported by guy
      and concrete footings, with 7 trays placed inclined 50 deg in
      order to reduce the effects of wind on the grid central catch.<br>
      <br>
      Water is collected in a gutter of PVC placed 1 m from the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Total pickup area is 8 m2 vertically.<br>
      <br>
      The sensor along with its tension, occupies 16 m2 of land and 5 m
      in height.<br>
      <br>
      Due to its size usually they have breakage due to wind effects on
      the structure, along with a laborious task of transport, assembly,
      installation and maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      He is having worked with both research groups Marzol Jaen
      (Geography ULL), the Hydrology Group ICIA (Canarian Institute of
      Agrarian Research) ETSIA the University of La Laguna, having had
      knowledge of Santana Perez (from 1998), momentum and deal with
      Baladon Acosta and others, like Alain Gioda (IRD French Institute
      of Research for Development) and the work done in Natural Aqua
      Canarias SL, with Sánchez Recio, for 3 years, Theo Hernando Olmo,
      inventor of the water trap of fog, dew and rainfall, wants to step
      forward both in the world of technology capture water from fog and
      dew, as in their application, implementation and dissemination to
      society.<br>
      <br>
      Already submitted the application for the utility model 200800661,
      sensor with self-generated turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The gauge of water mists, dew and precipitation is a three
      dimensional structure, prism-shaped, with a square base of 0.7 m.
      side and 2 m in height, preferably. newpage<br>
      <br>
      It consists of a metal base for anchoring the computer, the
      vertical support structures, decanting and filtering the collected
      water, upstanding structures formed by tubes 2 m. length, an upper
      part and a crown or inner layers of mesh supported by steel
      cables.<br>
      <br>
      For the collation of the team on earth metal shoe that, being
      buried at 30 cm it is used. Depth can take advantage of the weight
      of the earth to support the team extracted without the need to
      pour concrete and the possibility of their removal and reuse
      without leaving residues on the ground.<br>
      <br>
      The shoe has four floored rods at each end that fit the anchor
      pieces on the ends of the computer base.<br>
      <br>
      For installation on concrete, just place about 4 wall plugs and
      screws 8 mm in the same anchoring parts.<br>
      <br>
      This layering an exhibition of nearly 11 m2 of surface scavenging
      without taking up space on the ground (only 0.5 m2) is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Being cubic need not direct it toward a particular wind direction,
      but preferably its orientation towards the dominant wind direction
      at each location is recommended.<br>
      <br>
      This prismatic structure peripherally coated with plastic insect
      screen (5.6 m2 in total) and internally by a second layer of metal
      mesh screened 1 m. high (covering three faces of the gauge, 2.1 m2
      in total).<br>
      <br>
      In the center of this structure (interior) are installed between
      3-5 successive layers vertical mesh (as curtains) by creating an
      opposition in the path drops laden air passes through the sensor.<br>
      <br>
      They are supported by frames made with steel cables that are
      attached to the base and the top or crown piece by small
      carabiners and rings.<br>
      <br>
      The cables provide flexibility, stability and light weight.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, increase harvest levels (greater exposed surface pickup)
      without taking up space and resisting conditions of moderate to
      strong wind.<br>
      <br>
      The drops retained in the mesh aggregate to form larger diameter
      droplets that slide towards the base where the solids are retained
      possible present before departure by decantation.<br>
      <br>
      Water leakage occurs by overflow, through a small strainer,
      preventing the floating materials such as plant debris or insects,
      pass the conduction system.<br>
      <br>
      Because the inner layer is coated with metal insect screen and the
      structure of the sensor is also metal, night condensation of the
      circulating air, dew (clear skies at night hours), as well as the
      utility model unsolicited 200 800 661 is promoted .<br>

      plastic mesh and the second metallic mesh layer and on the other
      hand, the frames carried by braided steel cable (10) anchored to
      the base and the top piece or crown by small carabiners.<br>
      About this internal structure layers were fixed insect screen like
      a curtain.<br>
      <br>
      - The upper part or crown (11), according to Figure 4, is a square
      frame with a hollow core and multiple perforations.<br>
      <br>
      It serves to give consistency, allowing entry to the rain and keep
      the prism of the team.<br>
      <br>
      Vertical tubes (9) are joined to this piece with nuts, because
      they have a small screw welded at its upper end.<br>
      <br>
      The central space is covered with plastic mesh to keep out leaves
      and other items carried by the wind.<br>
      <br>
      - All scavenging meshes bind to their corresponding structures
      (pipes or cables) through plastic cable ties.<br>
      <br>
      Applications and uses<br>
      <br>
      - Water supply in remote areas or expensive supplies.<br>
      <br>
      - Supply of agricultural farms of mediocrities.<br>
      <br>
      - Supply tanks or cisterns of forestry and fire trucks normally
      filled by Cuba.<br>
      <br>
      - Use of preventing and fighting forest fires, reforestation and
      environmental monitoring.<br>
      <br>
      - Improving by mixing low quality water from another source
      Industrial (underground, etc.<br>
      )<br>
      <br>
      - Supply of forest recreation areas and sources of walkers (on
      purification).<br>
      <br>
      - Human supply, housing or quarters of tools (on purification).

      Advantage<br>
      <br>
      - Especially suitable in conditions of moderate to high winds.<br>
      <br>
      - Obtaining high quality water height (height between 800-1500
      meters, in the Canary Islands).<br>
      <br>
      - Drives gravity (energy saving).<br>
      <br>
      - No energy consumption and waste generation.<br>
      <br>
      - Easy assembly and installation (savings in storage,
      transportation and installation).<br>
      <br>
      - Very low maintenance (cleaning and replacement occasionally
      mesh).<br>
      <br>
      - Supply in situ (saving water transport and pipelines).<br>
      <br>
      - Fully renewable materials.<br>
      <br>
      - Mobile facilities, leaving no residue or shoes on location.<br>
      <br>
      - Exploitation of dew and precipitation without taking up space on
      the ground.<br>
      <br>
      - Decanting and filtering water obtained integrated.<br>
      <br>
      - Major pickup surface in less space.<br>
      <br>
      - It occupies only 0.5 m2 of land with respect to other sensors
      that take between 3 and 18 m2, with a volume of water collected
      similar to these.<br>
      <br>
      - Overlapping inner layers of mesh capture increasing levels of
      catch (to possess greater exposed surface pickup) without taking
      up space on the ground and creating a turbulent wind to the path
      of charged droplets to traverse the maze sensor.<br>
      <br>
      Individualized inner layers and can easily swap or replaced
      without dismantling the entire structure (layers as curtains).<br>
      <br>
      Supported by cables, providing flexibility, stability and light
      weight.<br>
      <br>
      - The anchor base or seat is designed PRG for nothing so much his
      installation over existing slabs, through wall plugs and for
      placement on land, in this case using a shoe designs PRG nothing
      in order to secure the anchor down the sensor without the need for
      works or pouring concrete, installation easier and cheaper by
      reducing work times.<br>
      <br>
      The weight of the land is exploited, allowing turn the sensor
      location can be changed if so desired, still remains at the first
      settlement.<br>
