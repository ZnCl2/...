      </p>
      <p>The Bourke Engine was designed by Russell Bourke in the 1920s,
        as an improved two stroke engine. Despite finishing his design
        and building several working engines, the onset of World War II,
        lack of test results,[1] and the poor health of his wife
        compounded to prevent his engine from ever coming successfully
        to market. The main claimed virtues of the design are that it
        has only two moving parts, is light weight, powerful, has two
        power pulses per revolution, and does not need oil mixed into
        the fuel. </p>
      <p><b>Overview</b> </p>
      <p>The Bourke engine is basically a two stroke design, with two
        horizontally opposed pistons that move in the same direction at
        the same time, so that their operations are 180 degrees out of
        phase. The pistons are connected to a Scotch Yoke mechanism in
        place of the more usual crankshaft mechanism, which reduces the
        acceleration of the pistons, slightly. The incoming charge is
        compressed in a chamber under the pistons, as in conventional
        crankcase charged two strokes. Unlike them the chamber is sealed
        from the crankcase. </p>
      <p><b>Operation</b> </p>
      <p>The operating cycle is very similar to that of a current
        production spark ignition two-stroke with crankcase compression,
        with three modifications. </p>
      <p>Firstly, the fuel is injected directly into the air as it moves
        through the transfer port. </p>
      <p>Secondly the engine is designed to run without using spark
        ignition once it is warmed up. This known as auto-ignition or
        dieseling, and the air/fuel mixture starts to burn due to the
        high temperature of the compressed gas, and/or the presence of
        hot metal in the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>Thirdly, it is claimed that the piston stops at Top Dead Centre
        for hydrogen detonation and/or complete combustion of the fuel.
      </p>
      <p><b>Design Features</b> </p>
      <p>The following design features have been identified </p>
      <p><b>Mechanical Features</b> </p>
      <p>Scotch yoke instead of connecting rods to translate linear
        motion to rotary motion </p>
      <p>Fewer moving parts (only 2 moving assemblies per opposed
        cylinder pair) and the opposed cylinders are combinable to make
        2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or any even number of cylinders </p>
      <p>Smoother operation due to elimination of crank and slider
        mechanism </p>
      <p>The piston is connected to the Scotch yoke through a slipper
        bearing (a type of hydrodynamic tilting-pad fluid bearing) </p>
      <p>Mechanical fuel injection. </p>
      <p>Ports rather than valves. </p>
      <p>Easy maintenance (top-overhauling) with simple tools. </p>
      <p>The Scotch yoke does not create lateral forces on the piston,
        reducing friction, vibration and piston wear. </p>
      <p>O-rings are used to seal joints rather than gaskets. </p>
      <p>The use of the Scotch Yoke reduces vibration from the motions
        of the connecting rod — for example, the peak acceleration in a
        Scotch yoke is 25% less than the acceleration in a conventional
        crank and slider arrangement. </p>
      <p>The Scotch Yoke makes the pistons dwell very slightly longer at
        top dead center, so the fuel burns more completely in a smaller
        volume. </p>
      <p><b>Gas Flow and Thermodynamic Features</b> </p>
      <p>Low exhaust temperature (below that of boiling water) so metal
        exhaust components are not required, plastic ones can be used if
        strength is not required from exhaust system </p>
      <p>Extremely fast hydrogen detonation burn time of the lean
        mixture so the engine can be considered to be a hydrogen
        detonation or hydrogen "explosion" engine. </p>
      <p>15:1 to 24:1 compression ratio for high efficiency and it can
        be easily changed as required by different fuels and operation
        requirements. </p>
      <p>Fuel is vaporised when it is injected into the transfer ports,
        and the turbulence in the intake manifolds and the piston shape
        above the rings stratifies the fuel air mixture into the
        combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>Lean burn for increased efficiency and reduced emissions. </p>
      <p>Fuel can be injected very late into the transfer port. This
        will reduce the amount of fuel that is blown straight out of the
        exhaust port, for a given scavenge ratio[citation needed]. This
        will increase efficiency and reduce HC emissions. </p>
      <p><b>Lubrication</b> </p>
      <p>This design uses oil seals to prevent the combustion chamber
        created pollution's piston ring blow-by from polluting the
        crankcase oil extending the life of the oil indefinitely as
        proven by Russell Bourke's endless testing[citation needed] as
        it is used slowly for keeping the rings full of oil to hold and
        use to lubricate. Oil was shown to be used slowly by the
        dropfull as needed, but checking the quantity and cleanness of
        it was still recommended </p>
      <p>The lubricating oil in the base is protected from combustion
        chamber pollution by an oil seal over the connecting rod. </p>
      <p>The piston rings are supplied with oil from a small supply hole
        in the cylinder wall at bottom dead center. </p>
      <p><b>Claimed and Measured Performance</b> </p>
      <p>Efficiency 0.25 lb/h /hp is claimed - about the same as the
        best diesel engine,[2] or roughly twice as efficient as the best
        two strokes. This is equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of
        55.4%, which is an exceedingly high figure for a small internal
        combustion engine. In the test witnessed by a third party the
        actual fuel consumption was 1.1 hp/lb/h,[3] or 0.9 lb/h/hp,
        equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of about 12.5%, which
        is typical of a 1920s steam engine.[4] </p>
      <p>Power to weight 0.9[5] to 2.5 hp/lb is claimed although no
        independently witnessed test to support this has been
        documented. The upper range of this is roughly twice as good as
        the best four stroke production engine shown here,[6] or 0.1
        hp/lb better than a Graupner G58 two stroke.[7] The lower claim
        is unremarkable, easily exceeded by production four stroke
        engines, never mind two strokes.[8]. </p>
      <p>Emissions Achieved virtually no hydrocarbons (80 ppm) or carbon
        monoxide (less than 10 ppm) in published test results, however
        no power output was given for these results, and NOx was not
        measured. A diesel engine at idle may give the same
        results[citation needed]. </p>
      <p>Low Emissions The engine is claimed to be able to operate on
        hydrogen or any hydro-carbon fuel without any modifications,
        producing only water vapor and carbon dioxide as emissions. </p>
      <p><b>Engineering Critique of the Bourke Engine</b> </p>
      <p>The Bourke Engine has some interesting features, but the
        extravagant claims[9] for its performance are unlikely to be
        borne out by real tests[citation needed]. Many of the claims are
        contradictory.[10] </p>
      <p>1) Seal friction from the seal between the air compressor
        chamber and the crankcase, against the conrod, will reduce the
        efficiency.[11] </p>
      <p>2) Efficiency will be reduced due to pumping losses, as the air
        charge is compressed and expanded twice but energy is only
        extracted for power in one of the expansions per piston
        stroke.[12][13] </p>
      <p>3) Engine weight is likely to be as high because it will have
        to be very strongly built to cope with the high peak pressures
        seen as a result of the rapid high temperature combustion.[14] </p>
      <p>4) Each piston pair is highly imbalanced as the two pistons
        move in the same direction at the same time, unlike in a boxer
        engine.[15]. This will limit the speed range and hence the power
        of the engine, and increase its weight due to the strong
        construction necessary to react the high forces in the
        components.[16] </p>
      <p>5) High speed two-stroke engines tend to be inefficient
        compared with four-strokes because some of the intake charge
        escapes unburnt with the exhaust.[17] </p>
      <p>6) When the charge is transferred from the compressor chamber
        to the combustion chamber it will cool down, reducing the
        efficiency[citation needed] of the engine.[18] </p>
      <p>7) Use of excess air will reduce the torque available for a
        given engine size.[19] </p>
      <p>8) Forcing the exhaust out rapidly through small ports will
        incur a further efficiency loss.[20] </p>
      <p>9) Operating an internal combustion engine in detonation
        reduces efficiency due to heat lost from the combustion gases
        being scrubbed against the combustion chamber walls by the shock
        waves.[21] </p>
      <p>10) Emissions - although some tests have shown low emissions in
        some circumstances, these were not necessarily at full power. As
        the scavenge ratio (ie engine torque) is increased more HC and
        CO will be emitted.[22] </p>
      <p>11) Increased dwell time at TDC will allow more heat to be
        transferred to the cylinder walls, reducing the efficiency.[23].
      </p>
      <p>12) When running in auto-ignition mode the timing of the start
        of the burn is controlled by the operating state of the engine,
        rather than directly as in a spark ignition or diesel engine. As
        such it may be possible to optimize it for one operating
        condition, but not for the wide range of torques and speeds that
        an engine typically sees. The result will be reduced efficiency
        and higher emissions.[24] </p>
      <p>13) If the efficiency is high, then combustion temperatures
        must be high, as required by the Carnot cycle, and the air fuel
        mixture must be lean. High combustion temperatures and lean
        mixtures cause nitrogen dioxide to be formed. </p>

      <p>Built in 1954. This is Russell's first 30 cubic inch, 30+ HP
        production engine built for public use. The claims made, except
        for the unusually high rpm's or the workability of extremely
        high compression ratios, are true based on real world tests. The
        key to it's much higher efficiency is simply increased time
        at&nbsp; Top Dead Center 'TDC'. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Back in the 1940's Russell Bourke set out to solve
        various problems with the conventional engines of that era.
        During his career as an instructor on internal combustion
        engines he soon ended up discarding many pre-conceived notions,
        fixed ideas and incorrectly duplicated theories of how to create
        the same end result as a steam engine using pressure as the
        prime mover by converting hydrocarbon based fuels to create
        pressure against a piston driving it downward in a cylinder and
        converting it into rotary motion. </p>
      <p>The first basic and workable theory was in order to create the
        needed pressure against a piston,&nbsp; combustion of
        hydrocarbons and air in an enclosed chamber was mandated! In
        order to accomplish real work it was theorized that 4 separate
        cycles. 'INTAKE' of air and fuel, 'COMPRESSION' thereof, spark
        or pressure ignited expansion of those gasses ' POWER' and
        finally removal of the spent gasses, 'EXHAUST' was necessary. </p>
      <p>Long ago, Dr. Otto came up with the first practical working
        engine based on this theory which was a 4 stroke type. It
        completed 4 cycles in a very literal way in that it had an
        INTAKE stroke, a COMPRESSION stroke, a POWER stroke and finally
        and EXHAUST stroke. Do you see the literal translation? The 4
        Stroke Cycle was born. </p>
      <p>The combustion chamber had to be valved in order to enable the
        cylinder to admit air and fuel and to emit spent gasses and it
        needed a crankshaft to drive things. There was quite a bit
        of&nbsp; parasitic power robbing equipment added to accomplish
        the above complete cycle. Anyway, the first internal combustion
        piston engine was born and basically it hasn't changed one bit
        since! </p>
      <p>Ever since then we have been basically stuck with the Otto
        cycle to drive anything that requires a 4 stroke/cycle diesel or
        gasoline engine. The problem isn't so much in Dr. Otto's
        interpretation of original theory or Dr. Diesel's decision to
        stick with what works. </p>
      <p>This includes 2 stroke and turbine engines as well. They are
        although much simpler and able to yield more power per pound of
        weight, still prone to similar limitations. </p>
      <p>Thermodynamically speaking they are flawed relative to their
        stoichiometric limitations and their complete inability to
        achieve even a hint of adiabatic efficiency. </p>
      <p>Although they do work, none of these engine types are capable
        of adiabatic operation in that their efficiency is gauged based
        upon fuel rich stoichiometric ratios. </p>
      <p>Regardless of an engine, be it 2 stroke, 4 stroke or turbine
        type, they are all inefficient stoichiometric engines in that
        they emit harmful waste products into the atmosphere! They
        needlessly pollute our world due to an incomplete combustion
        process with a great deal of lost heat energy that could and
        should otherwise be put to work! </p>
      <p>Regardless of that and to be fair, It remains a fact that
        conventional engines have worked well for decades and kept the
        world chugging along faithfully for a long time. But at what
        cost? </p>
      <p>We are all seeing the cost now as Russell Bourke predicted
        decades ago and tried to help prevent! I don't have to tell you
        what that is as you wouldn't be reading this now if you didn't
        know or at least suspect that something can be done about it!
        Yes, the effect is overall environmental degradation due to
        improperly and incompletely converted hydrocarbons and other
        toxic substances and gasses! </p>
      <p>The work engineers and chemists have done, their innovations as
        well as improvements of conventional engines and hydrocarbon
        fuels of all types are greatly acknowledged and appreciated.
        From my perspective, engineers are generally extremely bright
        intelligent people who solve problems and create! The greater
        majority of them have a passion for helping their fellow
        inhabitants live better, take care of and preserve our natural
        resources. </p>
      <p>The drive of this website is what Russell Bourke the inventor,
        Melvin Vaux, John Allen, Roger Richard and a host of others
        including myself have been talking about and trying to prove for
        a long time. Something CAN be done about it! </p>
      <p>As Russell Bourke advocates in his Documentary, there is and
        has been a better way to squeeze power out of a pound of fuel
        without wasting it and harming the environment for over 60 years
        now. Russell Bourke is responsible for this discovery and will
        always be greatly appreciated and honored for his ingenious and
        insightful contributions! </p>
      <p>We at Bourke Engine Com are carrying on his work in his honor
        and in the name of a better world where people can breath fresh
        air! </p>

        <p>***</p>
      </center>
      <p>Per reports received from Melvin Vaux who knew and worked with
        Russell, the Bourke 400 was actually designed and built under
        contract with American Motors Corporation by Russell Bourke and
        Melvin Vaux. Melvin was Russell's protégé during that time. </p>
      <p>The 400 was a heavy duty engine designed to be a standard
        replacement engine built for trucks and tug boats of that era.
        Per Melvin Vaux, after it had been test run for about 15 minutes
        or so as per contract, AMC took it away from Russell and never
        put it to use as they just couldn't get their heads wrapped
        around it's operation and tried to make it run like a rich 15:1
        a/f stoichiometric engine when it was designed and ran fine with
        ultra lean air fuel ratio's. Per the Documentary the 400 cu. in.
        engine produced around 200 plus horse power at only 2000 RPM! </p>
      <p>Since Russell Bourke and Mr. Vaux claimed they were the only
        ones who really knew how to make it run in super lean mode,
        AMC's engineers were lost and they gave up on it all together. </p>
      <p>It has been rumored by Melvin Vaux that the 400 4 cylinder was
        born out of the 200 cubic inch 2 cylinder Bourke cycle engine
        that Melvin sized up from the original Bourke 30 before Russell
        took him on as his understudy. Evidently when Russell saw
        Melvin's calling card, a light went on and the 400 was born!
        Melvin incorporated a half shaft crankshaft using a square
        cupped yoke instead of the 4 piece scotch yoke connecting rod
        setup as in an original Bourke 30 engine. Not so much an
        original idea as it was novel on Melvin's part. Melvin's design
        did accomplish one thing and that was a true 1 piece connecting
        rod/scotch yoke assembly. </p>
      <p>Trouble was that in order to keep Melvin's design from bending
        and breaking at the cup, he had to incorporate a slider plate as
        a means to keep the setup from breaking. In my opinion this
        arrangement offers no fundamental improvement over Russell's
        original design. Same movement, same stroke, same dwell time at
        TDC and BDC and actually there's no where to mount timing
        equipment or pumps etc. because there's only one half of a
        crankshaft sticking out the PTO end. Was Melvin's engine design
        any better. Evidence of his workmanship and the results thereof
        say absolutely NOT based on my own personal observations of
        Melvin's workmanship which is shoddy at best compared to Russell
        and his obvious jealousy of Russell based on his history working
        with Russell. </p>
      <p>Even Melvin's latest creation, the DeVaux 4 cylinder boxer is
        no more efficient than the original Bourke design. In fact it's
        less efficient, less powerful and more complex than the original
        Bourke 30 ever was! </p>
      <p>The 400 4 cylinder engine was only static estimated @ 200 HP
        and 500 Ft. Lb. torque at 2000 RPM! It never ran a real test and
        no one knows the actual power it made based on interviews with
        Melvin Vaux in 2001. But Melvin Vaux had been running his 2
        cylinder 200 cubic inch Bourke twin on natural gas as an
        irrigation pump for a long time and up until recently in the
        last 10 years before he retired and turned all his engines over
        to another company with the hopes that they would finally get
        something useful done with his version of the original Bourke
        engines which are in fact a far cry from the original Bourke
        engine design. </p>
      <p>Per Melvin Vaux, the Bourke 400 was made due to Russell's
        abandonment of the 30, the radial 4 cylinder engines and the H 4
        cylinder, in an attempt to make enough money to support his wife
        Lois after he was gone. </p>
      <p>Russell was very ill and knew he was dying. A sad and
        pre-mature ending for an incredibly ingenious man who cared
        deeply about his fellow man and the environmental damage he knew
        was going to result from the improper design and use of
        conventional engines and carbon based fuels well ahead of time.
        Now we see exactly what Russell was talking about all around us!
        Don't we. At least those who can see that is. Russell lived a
        very full life as you will find in the Bourke Engine
        Documentary. Lois was a genuine angel and backed Russell up
        100%, up to and after Russell's passing. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Russell Bourke was indeed a visionary man. There have
        been and are still many who carry on his dream and his work. We
        are part of that group. We are proud of it! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The key thing is that the Bourke engine will still run as
        clean and green as Russell said they will! They do run unusually
        lean air fuel and high compression&nbsp; ratio's. It's all in
        the dwell time and the simplicity of the Scotch Yoke mechanism
        that accomplishes a shorter&nbsp; moment arm and longer torque
        period with less bore and stroke and moving parts than any
        conventional engine including Wankles. of equal power that are
        keys to improved efficiency in any internal combustion engine! </p>

      <p>Russell Bourke, the inventor, made several claims about his
        engine in his "Bourke Engine Documentary" and other published
        articles. A summary of those unique claims are as follows: </p>
      <p><i>Emissions</i>:&nbsp; Russell Bourke, the inventor, stated
        the exhaust components were carbon dioxide and water vapor. <br>
        <i>Exhaust Temperature</i>: Russell Bourke, the inventor, stated
        that matches could be held in the exhaust without igniting. <br>
        <i>Multi-Fuel Capable</i>: Russell Bourke, the inventor, stated
        the engine would run on any low grade fuel (diesel, jet
        fuel/kerosene, home heating oil, brown distillate, ect.). <br>
        <i>Fuel Consumption</i>: Russell Bourke, the inventor, claimed a
        brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of .25 pounds of fuel per
        horsepower hour. <br>
        <i>Simplicity</i>: With only two (2) moving parts, the
        simplicity of this engine is self evident. <br>
        <i>Reliability</i>: Russell Bourke, the inventor, stated he
        tested the engine for 2,000 hours of marine use on an outboard
        motor lower unit with no detectable wear. <br>
        <i>Power-to-Weight Ratio</i>: Based on the testing that Russell
        Bourke performed on this engine, the power-to-weight ratio will
        be 2.5 or greater. <br>
        <i>Operational Costs</i>: Based on reliability, fuel
        consumption, and mutli-fuel tests, this engine will be very
        economical to operate. </p>

      <p>The Bourke engine was designed by Russell Bourke in the late
        1930s, who endeavored to improve upon the Otto cycle engine.
        Despite finishing his redesign and building several working
        engines; bad luck (WWII breaking out), bad health and a
        know-best attitude compounded to prevent his engine from ever
        coming to market despite its claimed advantages. Well into the
        2000's there are several small groups extolling the virtues of
        the design. The Bourke engine has two opposed cylinders with the
        pistons in a Scotch yoke mechanism. Because the motion of the
        pistons is a perfect sine wave with regards to time vs
        displacement the fuel burns in a smaller volume, and so burns
        hotter. The Bourke engine also has a looser coupling with the
        output shaft, preventing excess vibration. The intake valves are
        replaced by ports, saving on parts. This article or section is
        missing references or citation of sources. ... The four-stroke
        cycle of an internal combustion engine is the cycle most
        commonly used for automotive and industrial purposes today (
        cars and trucks, generators, etc). ... German soldiers at the
        Battle of Stalingrad World War II was the most extensive and
        costly armed conflict in the history of the world, involving the
        great majority of the worlds nations, being fought
        simultaneously in several major theatres, and costing tens of
        millions of lives. ... The Scotch Yoke is a mechanism for
        converting the horizontal motion of a slider into rotational
        motion or vice-versa. ... </p>
      <p>Unfortunately the design features that increase its efficiency
        create emission problems. The higher combustion temperatures
        combined with the increased cycle time around top-dead-center
        lead to increased nitrogen oxide emissions. This more than
        anything else has stopped the Bourke engine from gaining
        widespread acceptance today. </p>
      <p>Scotch yoke instead of connecting rods to translate motion to
        rotary motion... <br>
        Fewer moving parts... <br>
        Smoother operation... <br>
        Longer percentage of cycle spent at top-dead-center and
        bottom-dead-center for more complete combustion and exhaust
        scavanging... <br>
        Two power strokes for every rotation from the opposed pistons
        instead of one every other rotation (4-stroke) resulting in
        nearly twice the power at a given engine speed... <br>
        High compression and temperatures to cause an instantaneous and
        adiabatic reaction as opposed to a drawn out combustion... <br>
        Lean fuel/air misture combined with the adiabatic reaction
        resulting in zero unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust... <br>
        Sealed underside of the piston to isolate the fuel/air mixture
        from the crankcase... <br>
        Eliminate the need to mix oil with the fuel as with standard
        2-cycle engines... <br>
        Prevents the piston ring blow by from polluting the crankcase
        oil extending the life of the oil... </p>

        During his career as an instructor on internal combustion

        ...After the tour of Wheeler One, we were given an impromptu
        Bourke Engine Replication class back at Roger's other
        workshop.&nbsp; Roger showed us the various Bourke original
        engines, parts, and even the VAUX engine he's managed to acquire
        over the years.&nbsp; The lesson included a brief history of his
        work thus far, and a show-and-tell session about the various
        crank shafts, piston heads, bearings and whatnot that had been
        incorrectly specified, or incorrectly machined such that they
        failed in one way or another.&nbsp; It was a concentrated lesson
        in humility; if you get the flexibility of a piston head
        incorrect, you will most likely wreck your engine.&nbsp; I had
        no idea from the drawings that piston heads were even supposed
        to be flexible.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        As my opener, I am displaying my most prized possession, the
        first 30 cubic inch internal combustion engine sold by Russell
        Bourke.<br>
        <br>
        Why is this engine unique?<br>
        <br>
        Ultra low exhaust gas temperature-more energy converted to
        useful work.<br>
        Ultra lean mixture-more economical without power loss.<br>
        Uses lower octane fuels-avoids toxic fuel additives.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Attributes more closely satisfy elements of ideal I/C engine:<br>
        <br>
        Maximum pressure attainable in a cylinder<br>
        Quickest expansion<br>
        Minimum heat loss<br>
        Best mechanical advantage<br>
        Fewer moving parts<br>
        <br>
        Bourke 30" homebuilt engine powering a 24 kW generator, 3.25/1
        belt reduction. Recent runs include use of jet-A, white gas mix.
        Improvements to&nbsp; the cooling system have made a big
        difference in reliability and predictable running.<br>
        <br>
        View of standard automotive radiator, Go Power water brake
        mounting plate and stub shaft pillow block. Someday, I'll have
        to make a list of all the readily available parts used to get
        the 24 kW stand together. I believe this work typifies the
        "homebuilt" spirit...<br>
        <br>
        Because I used steel for the camcase, it was necessary to run
        the case oil through the transmission section of the donated car
        radiator to prevent heat build-up in the bottom-end oil. The new
        cooling components are "off the shelf" and commonly available...<br>
        <br>
        Looks like a crankshaft, functions as a camshaft. a high speed
        reverse roller camshaft.<br>
        <br>
        All Bourke engine components are ruggedly constructed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is the "triple slipper" bearing. It is the only bearing
        design suitable for the&nbsp; load and speed demands of the
        crosshead assembly...<br>
        <br>
        Russ Bourke devised an engine that would harness the destructive
        forces of detonation, to produce a smooth flow of power, with
        minimal loss.<br>
        <br>
        Bourke Engines embody attributes of the ideal internal
        combustion engine.<br>
        <br>
        I taught myself CAD, so that I would&nbsp; be better able to
        really get intimate with Old Russ, and gain better insight into
        why his engines gained "legendary" status.&nbsp; The evolution
        and refinement of his design presented itself on my computer
        screen.<br>
        <br>
        Bourke was very much misunderstood and ignored.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Diesel would stand in awe of a Bourke 400"<br>
        <br>
        Virtually zero particulate emission<br>
        more rapid expansion of charge<br>
        better mechanical advantage<br>
        100% dynamic balance<br>
        leaner mixtures<br>
        no oxides of nitrogen<br>
        no mechanical sounds while in operation<br>
        low exhaust gas temperature<br>
        clear-clean exhaust<br>
        low grade fuels only<br>
        <br>
        I applied several of the later 400 features to the Proto-30 to
        reduce flexure of the yoke assembly, and simplify the
        manufacturing process. Attention to detail-required.<br>
        <br>
        The 200" reverse roller cam crosshead assembly.<br>
        <br>
        The 400 is actually two coupled 200" units. Multiple twin
        cylinder units can be coupled directly, or geared to a common
        shaft. Modular engine layouts can provide many benefits.<br>
        <br>
        Beefy roller cam assembly. Cranks and roller cams have
        differences in geometry-Russ used them to advantage.<br>
        <br>
        Precision roller yoke and rod assembly-heat treated and ground.
        The rod most be absolutely straight and true.<br>
        <br>
        Bottom view of 200" cylinder. I believe my CAD model is the most
        detailed work you will find on this Bourke masterpiece.<br>
