      Dr. Daryoush Allaei didn’t set out to revolutionize the wind
      industry, but he may have stumbled on an idea that could become a
      major game changer, not only in the wind market, but the entire
      field of energy production.<br>
      <br>
      In a non-descript office in an unremarkable building on the north
      side of Chaska’s Jonathan Industrial Park, sits a pair of
      rudi-mentary prototypes ready to show the world a different way of
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      The models illustrate the idea behind Invelox – a wind generation
      system designed to capture, accelerate and concentrate wind power.
      Life-size counterparts will be rolled out in the next few months
      for testing. And if Allaei can convince the world that his idea
      works, he can envision a day when his wind generation systems are
      atop every building and every home all around the world.<br>
      <br>
      “Once people taste something that can coexist with nature and
      harvest wind, there’s no stopping us,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      SheerWind was recently awarded the Cleantech Open’s North Central
      Region Sustainability Award for the Invelox.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">HARVESTING WRON</span>G<br>
      <br>
      Born in Iran, Allaei came to the United States at the age of 20 to
      study mechanics and earn his doctorate in structural and system
      dynamics at Purdue University. Since graduating, he has founded a
      number of companies, including the Chaska-based QRDC – a research
      and development company specializing in energy flow control and
      energy efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      It was mid-2008 when Allaei was working on a proposal for the U.S.
      Department of Energy regarding wind turbine vibration that he
      realized people were going about wind harvesting all wrong.<br>
      <br>
      “Hold the breaks, let’s relook at this,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Allaei noted a number of problems with traditional wind turbines
      and wind farms. “Birds don’t like it, humans don’t like it, we’re
      going to a dead end,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      He developed a tower shaped like a giant old phonograph horn lying
      on its back that could collect wind closer to the ground than
      traditional turbines, thereby reducing the cost of construction
      materials as well as operation and maintenance costs. “Harvest
      en-ergy closest to the source,” he reasoned.<br>
      <br>
      The company, SheerWind, was created two years later.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to reducing costs, Allaei believes his creation to be
      more efficient and more versatile than the kinds of windmills
      people have used for thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      “It is based on a concept of elegant simplicity,” states his
      promotional brochures. “Instead of a pinwheel, you begin with a
      scoop.”<br>
      <br>
      The Invelox (a combination of “increased” and “velocity”) captures
      wind moving as slow as 2 mph, funnels it down a tapered passageway
      designed to increase its speed, and into a ground-level generator.
      Allaei believes the Invelox can outperform a tradi-tional 300-foot
      turbine 3-to-1 at half the size and with one-tenth the land
      needed. In addition, multiple towers could be connected to form a
      wind farm.<br>
      <br>
      The result is wind power ranging between 2.8 and 4.1 cents per
      kilowatt hour. “The cost will be below natural gas,” said Allaei.
      “Our target is below hydro[electric].”<br>
      <br>
      “This will really make a difference in people’s lives,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">GAME-CHANGING</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Allaei spent six months working on his initial idea for the
      Invelox. “All my engineers said it wouldn’t work,” he recalled.<br>
      <br>
      But as they spent two years refining the models, no one could
      prove to him that the Invelox wouldn’t work.<br>
      <br>
      “A lot of solutions are simpler than you think,” said Allaei.<br>
      <br>
      Now he’s ready to put his invention to the test.<br>
      <br>
      “The designs are complete and authorization to cut steel has been
      given,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      The first Invelox units will be installed in February or March and
      will be tested for three months. He already has a number of
      prospective customers eager to try out the system. He’s not
      surprised.<br>
      <br>
      Allaei asserts that his design, while being more environmentally
      friendly, can better blend into natural and residential settings
      making it a more attractive option than traditional wind turbines.
      He notes that the Invelox design has the flexibility to be scaled
      up or down for use in several markets from utilities to
      residential and commercial to military. He also envisions a mobile
      unit that could be dispatched during natural disasters to provide
      ready power.<br>
      <br>
      The Invelox, while initially envisioned for steel, could be made
      out of a variety of materials at varying price points.
      “Eventually, I want it to be biodegradable material,” he added.<br>
      <br>
      For now, Allaei remains in the business of convincing people that
      his invention can and will work. “There’s going to be huge
      re-sistance,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      “We are not going to be issue-free,” he added. “But there are
      solutions.”<br>
      <br>
      Allaei’s already received two patents (with several more pending)
      and successfully lured former Army Corps of Engineers and Xcel
      Energy bigwigs to join both his management team and the company’s
      board of directors.<br>
      <br>
      If he’s right about the Invelox, Allaei is poised to jump to the
      forefront of energy production.<br>
      <br>
      “It will be game changing,” he said. “Absolutely.”<br>
      <br>
      “This could make Minnesota the Silicon Valley of wind.”<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">by <br>
            Lauren Craig</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"> SheerWind is a Chaska, Minnesota-based
          start-up with a wind power generator concept that looks
          nothing like any wind turbine you have ever seen. The
          venture’s “Invelox” technology recently won the 2011 CleanTech
          Open’s Sustainability Award for the North Central Region.
          SheerWind’s Founder and CEO, Dr. Daryoush Allaei, has 25 years
          of research and development experience, including leading
          projects funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and
          Department of Energy (DOE).<br>
          <br>
          Interestingly, his technical expertise is not in wind power,
          or even renewable energy, but in systems
          dynamics–specifically, noise and vibration. He first developed
          the idea for Invelox in late 2008, while working on a proposal
          for a project to monitor wind turbine vibration, in response
          to a DOE solicitation.<br>
          <br>
          “DOE wanted a technology that could monitor the vibration of
          the [wind turbine] blades, to help them manage wind energy
          more cost-effectively,” Allaei said to us in a recent
          interview. “When I was reviewing what they were asking for, I
          just thought, ‘Wow! They are trying to solve the wrong
          problem.’ They were asking me to go 60 to 100 feet up in the
          air, when what I really needed to do was bring [the cost of
          wind energy] down for them. I thought something had to change.
          So I closed my door and I sat down and thought about what else
          we could do that makes more sense. That’s how I came up with
          this idea of harvesting wind on the ground.”<br>
          <br>
          The result is what to looks to be a pretty novel approach to
          generating wind power. Allaei’s “Invelox” technology (named
          for increasing velocity) looks more like a giant phonograph
          player than a wind turbine. Essentially, it works by capturing
          wind, funneling it into a tunnel to increase velocity, and
          channeling it into a ground-based turbine.<br>
          <br>
          Allaei typically describes the system by comparing it to a
          hydroelectric dam:<br>
          <br>
          “If you look at a hydro dam, the basic principle is to collect
          water and then, down below there are small openings where the
          water is allowed to escape. By simple physics, when you do
          that, the water speeds up. It is in that small opening in dams
          where the generator is placed. The generator is small, but it
          makes a very large amount of power because the water is moving
          very fast through that small opening. Invelox is basically an
          air dam that collects wind instead of water.”<br>
          <br>
          Sheerwind’s simulations and computer models indicate that the
          Invelox technology can produce three times more power than a
          conventional wind turbine, while mounted on a tower at least
          25 percent shorter, and using a ground-based turbine with
          blades 25 percent as long.&nbsp; Because the system is
          shorter, smaller, and has fewer moving parts than a
          conventional system, SheerWind expects to achieve savings of
          16 to 38 percent per megawatt-hour (MWh) produced.<br>
          <br>
          At 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, the technology is believed
          capable of producing wind power at prices comparable to new
          gas-fired generation.<br>
          sheerwind<br>
          <br>
          Unlike the conventional tower-based turbine design, (“you put
          the blade up in the sky and you are at the mercy of nature”),
          Allaei says that Invelox has the potential to overcome many of
          the challenges facing large-scale wind farm development. For
          one, the technology can generate power at wind speeds as low
          as 2 mph. This can make wind power feasible in areas where it
          is currently not.<br>
          <br>
          The Invelox generators can also be sited close to urban
          centers of demand, and used in tandem with natural gas power
          plants. This configuration would enable utilities to manage
          wind power like a baseload resource.<br>
          <br>
          Invelox also does not produce the vibrations that contribute
          to what is known in the scientific community as “Wind Turbine
          Syndrome.” Citing a 2009 study of communities located near
          wind farms in Wales, Allaei explains that wind turbines
          generate vibrations at frequencies too low for human ears to
          detect, but at which some organs in the human body resonate,
          such as the heart.<br>
          <br>
          “The lower the frequency, the longer the vibrations travel,
          like whales that communicate with each other from miles away
          in the ocean…. There is evidence that this can cause people
          that live near wind farms to get tired, get sick or throw up,”
          Allaei explains.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, Allaei knew that there would be skeptics. Since
          1992, he has founded six companies, including QRDC, a
          consulting firm specializing in noise and vibration control.
          With over 100 publications, 25 U.S. patents and 14
          international patents, but little experience in the power
          industry, Allaei found himself having to convince high-level
          utility executives that his idea will work. “When I first
          started, I did not even have a business plan.” he said. “My
          first test was to see if people in the power industry could
          punch a whole in the argument that I was making. These are not
          shy people. If they don’t like your idea, they will tell you
          to your face.”<br>
          <br>
          But, Allaei is inspired and convincing; and his ideas are
          making sense to people who know the energy business. Craig
          Mataczynski, former CEO and president of both RES Americas and
          NRG, met with Allaei specifically “to prove that the
          technology would not work.” Now, Mataczynski sits on
          SheerWind’s board.<br>
          <br>
          SheerWind has developed several laboratory prototypes and
          full-scale computer models, and expects to begin field testing
          in the first quarter of 2012. “We have received strong
          traction from customers during development; and if our claims
          are validated in the field, they will buy,” Allaei said.<br>
          <br>
          He also envisions that the technology could be scaled down for
          quick deployment after a disaster. “It would have far more
          impact in our community and society than just as a
          money-making business,” he said. ”Really, this [technology]
          can change the equation. It can change wind energy from an
          alternative to a main source of generation.”<br>

          to turbine-intake towers for wind energy conversion systems.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0002] Due to the recent energy problems that have arisen,
          considerable interest has been given to wind power to be
          converted efficiently into electrical energy. Most of the
          developments and advancements have been focused on the
          improvement of the aerodynamics of propeller-type turbines,
          e.g., known as wind turbines and initially referred to as
          windmills. Typically, each turbine-generator system is mounted
          on the top of tall tower, where the taller the tower, the
          higher the prevailing wind speed. The electrical power
          generated from a wind turbine is proportional to cubic order
          of the wind speed. Furthermore, the longer each turbine blade,
          the higher the power generation. However, long blades are
          costly, can be subjected to defects and failure, take up a
          large amount of space, and generate excessive noise and
          vibration. The electrical power generated from a wind turbine
          is directly proportional to the square of the propeller
          length. However, taller towers and longer propellers increase
          not only the cost of material and installation, but also the
          cost of maintenance.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] The current wind power generation systems typically
          suffer from low efficiency, high capital cost, unpredictable
          failures, excessively high noise and vibration, and/or high
          maintenance. Due to higher wind speed, large wind farms have
          recently been installed at sea. These sea-based systems suffer
          from even much higher capital and maintenance costs.
          Therefore, the growth of wind farms has been slow at best.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] One of the national goals is that wind energy must
          provide 20% of the nation's electricity by the year 2030. This
          level of wind power will support 500,000 jobs while saving the
          consumers $128 billion by lowering the price of natural gas.
          In addition, it will cut greenhouse gas emission that is
          equivalent to taking 140,000,000 cars off the road. While no
          breakthrough in wind power technology is needed to achieve
          this goal, power transmission lines, reliability, reduction of
          operation and maintenance costs, and reduction of downtime and
          failure of wind turbines is crucial.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines
          should be reduced to make conversion of wind energy to
          electrical power economically more viable. The wind turbines
          must also become more reliable with reduced downtime and
          failures. For example, for offshore wind turbines, the costs
          for operation and maintenance are estimated in the order of 30
          to 35% of the costs of electricity. Roughly 25% to 35% is
          related to preventive maintenance while 65% to 75% is due to
          corrective maintenance.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Wind turbines are complex machines with several
          sub-machines that convert the kinetic energy of moving air to
          electrical power. Extraction of a significant amount of energy
          requires high wind speeds and large turbine diameters. In
          general, turbine speeds are slow (about 20 rpm) and the speed
          must be increased to a useful generator speed. A typical wind
          machine has a 3-blade turbine of more than 60 meters in
          diameter. This turbine drives a generator through a
          speed-increasing gearbox that generally has a planetary first
          stage and one or two additional parallel shaft stages. The
          generator runs at about 1500 rpm and produces about 1.5 MW.
          Many wind turbines are variable speed machines; the speed
          depends on the wind conditions and can vary over a wide range.
          For these machines, high power output requires high levels of
          torque and accompanying high gear-mesh forces. Because of the
          low speed of the turbine, the various gearbox components are
          usually supported by rolling element bearings. These bearings
          are subject to significant radial loads and need to be
          carefully monitored to detect any degradation.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] At present, with the increasing installed power of the
          wind turbines, the application of offshore wind turbines, and
          major problems with turbine blades and gearboxes, the
          necessity of condition monitoring can no longer be neglected.
          Some components, although designed for the turbine lifetime,
          may require repair or fail earlier than expected. This is
          emphasized by the approach of warranty and insurance companies
          that simply require application of monitoring provisions.
          Otherwise, expensive preventive replacements or inspections
          should be carried out periodically.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons
          stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in
          the art upon reading and understanding the present
          specification, there is a need in the art for alternatives to
          existing wind power generation systems.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0016] In the following detailed description of the present
          embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings
          that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of
          illustration specific embodiments that may be practiced. These
          embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those
          skilled in the art to practice disclosed subject matter, and
          it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized
          and that process, electrical or mechanical changes may be made
          without departing from the scope of the claimed subject
          matter. The following detailed description is, therefore, not
          to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the claimed
          subject matter is defined only by the appended claims and
          equivalents thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] FIG. 1 is a cut-away perspective view of a wind energy
          conversion system 100. Wind energy conversion system 100
          includes a turbine-intake tower 110, a turbine 120 fluidly
          coupled to turbine-intake tower 110, and an electrical
          generator 130, such as a 60 Hz AC generator, coupled (e.g.,
          mechanically coupled) to turbine 120.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Turbine-intake tower 110 has an inlet 140 and an outlet
          142. Air enters turbine-intake tower 110 through inlet 140
          flows through turbine-intake tower 110 and exits
          turbine-intake tower 110 through outlet 142. The air exiting
          though outlet 142 passes over the blades of turbine 120, as
          shown in FIG. 2, an enlarged view of outlet 142, turbine 120,
          and generator 130, causing turbine 120 to rotate. Rotation of
          turbine 120 rotates the generator 130 via a suitable
          transmission (not shown) that couples turbine 120 to generator
          130.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Inlet 140 may have a screen or other devices to prevent
          the entry of birds or other airborne objects. Any conventional
          bird catcher device may be used in this system.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Turbine-intake tower 110 includes an intake nozzle
          assembly 143 that includes a converging intake nozzle 144 and
          that may include an integral collector 146 that is contiguous
          with converging intake nozzle 144. Intake nozzle assembly 143
          is rotatably coupled to a support column 150 of turbine-intake
          tower 110 by means of a bearing 152. Support column 150 is
          substantially vertical and acts to support intake nozzle
          assembly 143 at a vertical height H above ground level 154,
          where the height H is measured from a central longitudinal
          axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly 143. The height H may be
          about the same height as the hub of a turbine of a
          conventional wind turbine system, where the turbine is mounted
          atop a tower. For example the height H may be about 100 to
          about 200 feet.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Support column 150 has a base 151 that may directly
          contact the ground at ground level 154. Alternatively, intake
          tower 110 may be positioned on and may be in direct contact
          with a platform floating on water, for example, for offshore
          application, an in which case ground level 154 would
          correspond to the surface of the platform. Turbine 120 and
          generator 130 are located at or near ground level, e.g., at
          about the same vertical level as base 151 and about the same
          vertical level as outlet 142, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Intake nozzle assembly 143 may be substantially
          horizontal. That is, central longitudinal axis 156 of intake
          nozzle assembly 143 may be substantially horizontal. Central
          longitudinal axis 156 may be substantially parallel to the
          direction of the wind and thus the direction of the air
          entering intake nozzle assembly 143. The inner surfaces of
          nozzle assembly 143 are made of a smooth material in order to
          reduce losses due to surface friction.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Collector 146 extends in the direction of central
          longitudinal axis 156 from an inlet plane 160 of
          turbine-intake tower 110 to the dashed line 162, which marks
          the exit of collector 146. The flow passage within collector
          146 is substantially uniform in size between inlet plane 160
          and the exit 162 of collector 146, i.e., the cross-sectional
          area (perpendicular to the flow direction) of the flow passage
          within collector 146 is substantially uniform between inlet
          plane 160 and the exit 162. When inlet 140 is facing the wind
          and central longitudinal axis 156 is substantially parallel to
          the wind direction, collector 146 collects the wind.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Intake nozzle 144 is fluidly coupled to collector 146.
          The flow passage within intake nozzle 144 converges (e.g.,
          tapers) in the direction of central longitudinal axis 156,
          starting at the exit 162 of collector 146 and ending at an
          entrance to an elbow 164. That is, the cross-sectional area
          (perpendicular to the flow direction) of the flow passage
          within intake nozzle 144 decreases between exit 162 of
          collector 146 and elbow 164, as shown in FIG. 1. Intake nozzle
          144 acts to increase the flow velocity between exit 162 of
          collector 146 and elbow 162. That is, passing the flow through
          intake nozzle 144 causes the flow to converge and thus
          accelerate. Note that intake nozzle 144 receives the wind from
          collector 146 and accelerates the wind.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Elbow 164 is interposed between intake nozzle assembly
          143 and bearing 152. As such, bearing 152 rotatably connects
          an upper end of support column 150 to elbow 164.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Support column 150 is hollow. A converging tower nozzle
          170 (e.g., a column nozzle) is located within an interior of
          support column 150 and may extend from bearing 152 to an elbow
          172 that is coupled to an outlet duct 174 (e.g., sometimes
          referred to as the turbine inlet duct) that leads to outlet
          142. As such, tower nozzle 170 is fluidly coupled to intake
          nozzle 144 and outlet duct 174.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] Tower nozzle 170 may be substantially vertical. For
          example, a central longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle 170
          is substantially vertical and is substantially perpendicular
          to central longitudinal axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly
          143, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The flow passage within tower nozzle 170 converges
          (e.g., tapers) in the direction of central longitudinal axis
          176, e.g., in the downward vertical direction, starting at the
          exit of elbow 164 and ending at an entrance to elbow 172. That
          is, the cross-sectional area (perpendicular to the flow
          direction) of the flow passage within tower nozzle 170
          decreases between elbow 164 and elbow 172, as shown in FIG. 1.
          Tower nozzle 170 acts to increase the flow velocity between
          elbow 164 and elbow 172. That is, passing the flow through
          tower nozzle 170 causes the flow to converge and thus
          accelerate.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Outlet duct 174 is substantially horizontal. For
          example, a central longitudinal axis 178 of outlet duct 174 is
          substantially horizontal and is substantially perpendicular to
          central longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle 170 and
          substantially parallel to central longitudinal axis 156 of
          intake nozzle assembly 143, as shown in FIG. 1. Elbow 172 and
          outlet duct 174 direct the flow from tower nozzle 170 onto the
          blades of turbine 120. The flow velocity at outlet 142, i.e.,
          the outlet of turbine-intake tower 110 and of duct 174, is the
          turbine inlet velocity.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Turbine 120 has a shaft 180 that is substantially
          horizontal, i.e., shaft 180 has a central longitudinal axis
          182 that is substantially horizontal and that is substantially
          parallel to central longitudinal axis 178 of outlet duct 174.
          For example, turbine 120 may be referred to as a
          horizontal-axis turbine. Central longitudinal axis 178 of
          outlet duct 174 central longitudinal axis 182 of shaft 180 may
          be substantially collinear. Note that for this embodiment,
          turbine-intake tower 110 has a substantially horizontal
          outlet.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Alternatively, for another embodiment, elbow 172 and
          outlet duct 174 may be removed, and a turbine 120 may be
          located at the exit of tower nozzle 170 so that its shaft 180
          is substantially vertical. For example, central longitudinal
          axis 182 of shaft 180 is substantially vertical and is
          substantially parallel and substantially collinear to central
          longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle 170. In this embodiment,
          turbine 120 may be referred to as a vertical-axis turbine.
          Note that the flow velocity at the exit of tower nozzle 170 is
          the turbine inlet velocity for this embodiment and that
          turbine 120 receives the fluid flow directly from tower nozzle
          170. As such, the exit of tower nozzle 170 is the outlet of
          turbine-intake tower 110, meaning that turbine-intake tower
          110 has a substantially vertical outlet.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Elbow 164 has a radius of curvature that acts to keep
          flow losses relatively low. This means that the flow velocity
          at the exit of intake nozzle 144 and the entrance to tower
          nozzle 170 is substantially the same. Elbow 172 also has a
          radius of curvature that acts to keep flow losses relatively
          low. In addition, the losses in outlet duct 174 are relatively
          small. Therefore, the flow velocity at the exit of tower
          nozzle 170 and the exit of outlet duct 174 are substantially
          the same. As such, intake nozzle 144 and tower nozzle 170 work
          together to increase the flow velocity from the velocity at
          inlet 140 (the wind velocity) to the velocity at outlet 142
          (the turbine inlet velocity). Note that the inner surfaces of
          the elbows, tower nozzle 170, and outlet duct 174 are made of
          a smooth material in order to reduce losses due to surface
          friction. Turbulence suppressors may be implemented to reduce
          turbulence in elbows 164 and 172, intake nozzle assembly 143,
          tower nozzle 170, and outlet duct 174 that may result from
          imperfections and anomalies in elbows 164 and 172, intake
          nozzle assembly 143, tower nozzle 170, and outlet duct 174.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] Note that the flow (wind) velocity at inlet 140 is
          substantially the same as the flow (wind) velocity at the
          inlet of a wind turbine of a conventional wind turbine system.
          This means that the flow velocity at the inlet to turbine 120
          is higher than the flow velocity (the wind velocity) at the
          inlet of the wind turbine of the conventional system, owing to
          increasing the flow velocity using intake nozzle 144 and tower
          nozzle 170. The increased velocity at the inlet to turbine 120
          allows for shorter turbine blades compared to conventional
          wind turbines.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] For example, the power output of a turbine is
          proportional to the cubic order of the turbine inlet velocity
          and is proportional to the square of the blade length. Since
          the turbine inlet velocity, as result of turbine-intake tower
          110, of the system of the present invention is higher than the
          wind velocity at the inlet of a turbine of a conventional wind
          turbine system, the turbine system of the present invention
          has a higher power output than the conventional wind turbine
          system for the same blade length. This means that since the
          power output of a turbine is proportional to the cubic order
          of the turbine inlet velocity and is proportional to the
          square of the blade length, the turbine of present invention
          can have shorter blades than the blades of the turbines of
          conventional wind turbine systems and still have a higher
          power output. Shorter blades also result in less drag than
          longer blades and thus result in less energy loss than longer
          blades.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] Shorter blades result in lower material costs,
          installation costs, and maintenance costs compared to the
          longer blades of the turbines of conventional wind turbine
          systems. The shorter blades are less susceptible to defects
          and failure, take up less space, and generate less noise and
          vibration than the longer blades of the turbines of
          conventional wind turbine systems.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] Actuators 186, e.g., piezoelectric actuators, may be
          physically coupled to the outer surface of intake nozzle
          assembly 143, e.g., the outer surface of intake nozzle 144
          and/or the outer surface of collector 146, as shown in FIGS. 1
          and 5. For example, actuators 186 may be coupled in direct
          physical contact with the outer surface of intake nozzle 144
          and/or the outer surface of collector 146. Actuators 186 are
          electrically coupled to a controller 190 for receiving
          electrical signals from controller 190.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] A wind speed sensor, such as an anemometer 192, may be
          mounted on an outer surface of turbine-intake tower 110 at or
          near the top of turbine-intake tower 110 for sensing the wind
          speed. For example, anemometer 192 may be mounted on elbow
          164, as shown in FIG. 1, or on intake nozzle assembly 143.
          Anemometer 192 may be electrically coupled to controller 190
          for sending electrical signals to controller 190 indicative of
          the sensed wind speed. Note that although anemometer 192 is
          positioned behind inlet 140, anemometer 192 is positioned at a
          vertical level that is sufficiently above the upper surface of
          intake nozzle assembly 143 so as to sense the prevailing wind
          speed external to turbine-intake tower 110. As a result,
          anemometer 192 effectively measures the prevailing wind speed
          upstream of inlet 140.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] A wind direction sensor, such as a wind vane 194, may
          be mounted on an outer surface of turbine-intake tower 110 at
          or near the top of turbine-intake tower 110 for sensing the
          wind direction. Wind vane 194 catches the wind and rotates
          intake nozzle assembly 143 relative to support column 150 such
          that inlet 140 is directed into the wind, e.g., so that
          central longitudinal axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly 143 is
          parallel to the wind direction. Wind vane 194 may be
          electrically coupled to controller 190 for sending electrical
          signals to controller 190 indicative of the sensed wind
          direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] For another embodiment, upon receiving electrical
          signals from wind vane 194, controller 190 may send electrical
          signals to a yaw motor (not shown) located adjacent bearing
          152. A yaw drive (not shown) may mechanically couple the yaw
          motor to intake nozzle assembly 143. The signals instruct the
          yaw motor to activate the yaw drive that in turn rotates
          intake nozzle assembly 143 such that inlet 140 is directed
          into the wind.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] In response to receiving signals indicative of the wind
          speed from anemometer 192, controller may send electrical
          signals to actuators 186. Actuators 186 may then adjust the
          shape (e.g., contour) of intake nozzle assembly 143 by
          exerting forces on the outer surface of intake nozzle assembly
          143 based on the wind speed. That is, the shape of collector
          146 and/or the shape of intake nozzle 144 may be adjusted
          based on the wind speed. For example, actuators may adjust the
          diameter of collector 146 and/or a diameter of intake nozzle
          144.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] Controller 190 may store voltage values corresponding
          to the voltages that need to be applied to an actuator 186 to
          set a diameter at a certain numerical value. The certain
          numerical value may correspond to a diameter that provides a
          certain increase in velocity and/or reduced losses for a
          certain wind velocity for a certain power output.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] For example, anemometer 192 might detect a wind speed
          and send a signal indicative of the wind speed to controller
          190. Controller 190 may then determine the required velocity
          at outlet 142 to produce a certain power. Controller 190 may
          further determine how much voltage needs to be applied to
          actuator 186 to adjust the diameter of intake nozzle 144
          and/or collector 146 in order to produce the required velocity
          at outlet 142 for the detected wind speed. Similarly,
          controller 190 may adjust the diameter of collector 146 and/or
          a diameter of intake nozzle 144 to reduce flow losses based on
          a detected wind speed.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] In the event that anemometer 192 detects a wind speed
          that is excessive, e.g., above a certain value, and that could
          cause damage to turbine 120 and/or generator 130, controller
          190 might send a signal to solenoid activated bleed-off valves
          193 located at the elbows 164 and 172 that causes the
          bleed-off valves 193 to open. Opening the bleed-off valves 193
          causes a portion of the flow to be bled off, reducing the
          turbine inlet velocity to an acceptable value. For example, a
          portion of the flow may be bled off between intake nozzle
          assembly 143 and tower nozzle 170, and a portion of the flow
          may be bled off between tower nozzle 170 and turbine 120. For
          one embodiment, the bled-off flows may be directed to another
          turbine.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] After intake nozzle assembly 143 is rotated such that
          inlet 140 is directed into the wind and central longitudinal
          axis 156 is substantially parallel to the wind direction,
          collector 146 collects the wind and directs the wind to intake
          nozzle 144. Intake nozzle 144 accelerates the wind. Elbow 164
          receives the accelerated wind from intake nozzle 143 and
          directs the wind to tower nozzle 170 by turning the wind by
          substantially 90 degrees. Tower nozzle 170 further accelerates
          the wind. For one embodiment, elbow 172 receives the further
          accelerated wind from tower nozzle 170 and directs the wind to
          outlet duct 174 turbine 120 by turning the wind by
          substantially 90 degrees. Outlet duct 174 directs the wind to
          turbine 120, e.g., when turbine 120 is a horizontal-axis
          turbine. For another embodiment, e.g., when turbine 120 is a
          vertical-axis turbine, turbine 120 may receive the wind
          directly from tower nozzle 170 while the wind is flowing
          substantially vertically downward.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] FIG. 3 is a cut-away perspective view of a wind energy
          conversion system 300. Common numbering is used in FIGS. 1 and
          3 to identify components common to FIGS. 1 and 3. The common
          components are as discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Wind energy conversion system 300 includes
          turbine-intake tower 110, turbine 120, and electrical
          generator 130. An outlet 342 of turbine-intake tower 110 is
          located at the exit of tower nozzle 170 and is coupled to
          subterranean plumbing, such as a subterranean flow delivery
          system 355. Subterranean flow delivery system 355 is fluidly
          coupled to tower nozzle 170. Subterranean flow delivery system
          355 receives the accelerated flow exiting tower nozzle 170,
          e.g., while the wind is flowing substantially vertically
          downward, and delivers that flow to turbine 120, which is
          fluidly coupled to subterranean flow delivery system 355.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] FIG. 4 is an enlarged view showing the outlet 357 of
          subterranean flow delivery system 355, turbine 120, and
          generator 130. Common numbering is used in FIGS. 2 and 4 to
          identify components common to FIGS. 2 and 4. The common
          components are as discussed above in conjunction with FIGS. 1
          and 2.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] The flow velocity at outlet 357 is the turbine inlet
          velocity. Turbine 120 is oriented so that its shaft 180 that
          is substantially vertical, i.e., central longitudinal axis 182
          of shaft 180 is substantially vertical. For example, turbine
          120 may be referred to as a vertical-axis turbine.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] Subterranean flow delivery system 355 includes a
          substantially vertical duct 359 and a substantially vertical
          duct 361. Ducts 359 and 361 are fluidly coupled by elbows 363
          and a substantially horizontal duct 365. Turbulence
          suppressors may be implemented to reduce turbulence in ducts
          359 and 361, elbows 363, and duct 365.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] Subterranean flow delivery system 355 acts to increase
          the velocity of (e.g., accelerate) the flow exiting tower
          nozzle 170 by taking advantage of the cooler temperatures
          typically present under ground. The cooler temperatures cause
          the walls of the subterranean flow delivery system 355 to be
          at a lower temperature than the temperature of the air (wind)
          entering turbine-intake tower 110.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] For example, the temperature of the wall of duct 359 is
          lower than the temperature of the air entering turbine-intake
          tower 110. As a result, the air cools and becomes more dense
          (e.g., heavier) as it flows downward through duct 359. The
          difference between the lower density air entering
          turbine-intake tower 110 and the higher density air in duct
          359 produces a pumping effect that accelerates the downward
          flow through duct 359 (note that cooler air has a natural
          tendency to flow downward). The pumping effect acts to
          increase the flow velocity in duct 359 and thus in
          subterranean flow delivery system 355, meaning that the
          turbine inlet velocity is increased.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] In an alternative embodiment, turbine-intake tower 110,
          turbine 120, and generator 130 may be located on a platform
          floating on water, and subterranean flow delivery system 355
          may be located under the surface of the water. In this
          embodiment, subterranean flow delivery system 355 will act to
          increase the flow velocity in the same way as when
          subterranean flow delivery system 355 was located under
          ground, owing to the lower temperatures that typically occur
          below the surface of water.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] For another embodiment, the outputs of two or more
          turbine-intake towers 110 may be sent to a single turbine 120
          coupled to a single generator 130, as shown for a wind energy
          conversion system 500 in FIG. 5. In particular, the outlet
          ducts 174 are coupled to a single outlet 542 directed at
          turbine 120. Note that the flow velocity at outlet 542 is the
          turbine inlet velocity. Common numbering is used in FIGS. 1
          and 5 to identify components common to FIGS. 1 and 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] For another embodiment, two or more turbine-intake
          towers 110 may be coupled to a subterranean flow delivery
          system, such as subterranean flow delivery system 355 (FIG.
          3). Alternatively, each of the two or more turbine-intake
          towers 110 may be respectively coupled to respective ones of
          two or more subterranean flow delivery systems 355, and each
          of the subterranean flow delivery systems 355 may be coupled
          to single outlet 542 of FIG. 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0055] FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a wind farm 600. For
          one embodiment, wind farm 600 may include a plurality of wind
          energy conversion systems 100, as described above in
          conjunction with FIGS. 1 and 2. Alternatively, a wind farm may
          include a plurality of wind energy conversion systems 300
          having turbine-intake towers 110 coupled to subterranean
          plumbing, as described above in conjunction with FIGS. 3 and
          4. In another embodiment, a wind farm may include a plurality
          of turbine-intake towers 110 coupled to a single outlet
          directed at a single turbine, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0056] In the disclosed embodiments, the turbine and generator
          are located at or near ground level and are easier to access
          than the turbine and generator installed on the top of a tower
          in conventional wind power systems. This acts to reduce
          maintenance costs and noise and vibration. The noise and
          vibration often results in damage to conventional wind power
          systems and their supporting structures, thereby inducing
          failure. In addition, reducing the length of the turbine
          blades, as described above, reduces the initial capital cost,
          installation cost, and the lifetime maintenance cost of the
          turbine.<br>
          <br>
          [0057] The disclosed embodiments allow for centralizing the
          wind power generation farms and thus increase efficiency and
          reduce cost. Centralization of the wind power generation will
          also make the implementation in the national grid much easier.<br>
          <br>
          [0058] The disclosed embodiments can be implemented as single
          units for single households. A single unit may also be
          installed on rooftop, large ships, and other moving (e.g.
          automobiles) or still systems. The disclosed embodiments can
          also be implemented in groups in any number that suits the
          power requirements. The disclosed embodiments can be
          implemented in commercial wind power generation farms
          installed on land or offshore.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Conversion of the kinetic energy of a flowing fluid, such as
          air (wind) or water, into electrical power is an attractive
          method for producing electrical power. This typically involves
          directing the flowing fluid through a turbine. The flowing
          fluid causes the turbine to rotate an electrical generator,
          causing the electrical generator to produce electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          Examples of systems that convert the kinetic energy of flowing
          fluids into electrical power include wind energy conversion
          systems and kinetic hydropower generation systems. Kinetic
          hydropower generation systems typically involve submerging a
          turbine under water and directing flowing water current, e.g.,
          due to waves, tides, etc., through the turbine.<br>
          <br>
          Wind energy conversion systems typically include a wind
          turbine and an electrical generator mounted atop a tower and
          are typically large and noisy. Such systems are not well
          suited for producing power, such as supplemental power, for
          individual residences, especially in residential areas. Some
          wind energy conversion systems involve placing a wind turbine
          on a roof of residential or commercial buildings. However,
          these turbines are susceptible to storm damage and may require
          additional support structure to be added to the building to
          support the weight of the turbine. The kinetic energy of fluid
          flow relative to bodies moving through a fluid environment can
          also be converted into electrical power. For example, the
          kinetic energy of air relative to moving ground and aerial
          (manned or unmanned) motor vehicles and of water relative to
          moving marine and submarine (manned or unmanned) motor
          vehicles can be used to generate electrical power for use by
          the respective vehicle. However, mounting a turbine on the
          exterior of a motor vehicle is impractical in that a turbine
          produces noise, vibration, and added drag, and is not
          esoterically appealing. Moreover, using ducting that has
          relatively large openings at the front of a motor vehicle to
          direct the fluid flow to one or more turbines within an
          interior of a motor vehicle can result in additional drag on
          the vehicle. For the reasons stated above, and for other
          reasons stated below which will become apparent to those
          skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present
          specification, there is a need in the art for alternatives to
          existing systems for converting kinetic energy of flowing
          fluids into electricity.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In the following detailed description of the present
          embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings
          that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of
          illustration specific embodiments that may be practiced. These
          embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those
          skilled in the art to practice disclosed subject matter, and
          it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized
          and that process, electrical or mechanical changes may be made
          without departing from the scope of the claimed subject
          matter. The following detailed description is, therefore, not
          to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the claimed
          subject matter is defined only by the appended claims and
          equivalents thereof.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1 is a perspective view of an exterior of a skin
          structure 100, according to an embodiment. Figure 2 is a
          perspective view of an interior of skin structure 100. Skin
          structure 100 may include a skin 102. For one embodiment, skin
          102, and thus skin structure 100, may form a portion of an
          outer covering of a stationary structure, such as a roof
          and/or sides of a building. As such, an interior surface 107
          (Figure 2) of skin 102, and thus skin structure 100, may form
          a portion of an interior surface of the stationary structure,
          and an exterior surface 108 (Figure 1) of skin 102, and thus
          skin structure 100, may form a portion of an exterior surface
          of the stationary structure.<br>
          <br>
          For another embodiment, skin 102, and thus skin structure 100,
          may form a portion of an outer covering of a vehicle, such as
          a ground or aerial (manned or unmanned) motor vehicle, e.g.,
          an automobile, airplane, etc., or a marine or submarine
          (manned or unmanned) motor vehicle, e.g. a boat, submarine,
          etc. As such, interior surface 107 of skin 102, and thus skin
          structure 100, may form a portion of an interior surface of
          the vehicle, and exterior surface 108 of skin 102, and thus
          skin structure 100, may form a portion of an exterior surface
          of the vehicle. Skin structure 100 includes a power generation
          system 104 attached to the skin and located on an interior
          side of skin 102. Power generation system 104 converts kinetic
          energy of a fluid-flow 110, e.g., a water-flow or airflow,
          moving relative to and over exterior surface 108 of skin 102,
          and thus of skin structure 100, as shown in Figure 1. For
          example, the fluid flow may be substantially parallel to
          exterior surface 108. Note that the portion of power
          generation system 104 that is located on the interior side of
          skin structure 100 is hidden from view in Figure 1 and is thus
          shown using dashed lines in Figure 1.<br>
          <br>
          Fluid-flow 110 may be wind moving past skin structure 100 when
          skin structure 100 is stationary, such as when skin structure
          100 forms an outer covering of a stationary structure.
          Alternatively, fluid-flow 110 may be an airflow or water-flow
          relative to a vehicle moving through air or water. As such,
          fluid- flow 1 10 may be termed a forced fluid- flow.<br>
          <br>
          Power generation system 104 has one or more tubes 120 on the
          interior side of skin 102 that are communicatively (e.g.,
          fluidly) coupled to a turbine of a turbine/generator 125
          formed on the interior side of skin 102. For example, power
          generation system 104 may include a manifold 130 that is
          interposed between turbine/generator 125 and a plurality of
          tubes 120 and that communicatively couples the plurality of
          tubes 120 to the turbine of turbine/generator 125, as shown in
          Figures 1 and 2. For one embodiment, pairs of tubes 120 may be
          coupled to a manifold 140 interposed between manifold 130 and
          tubes 120. Each manifold 140 communicatively couples its pair
          of tubes 120 to manifold 130.<br>
          <br>
          Each of tubes 120 has an inlet 135 that opens on the exterior
          side of skin structure 100. For one embodiment, inlet 135 may
          have circular cross-section having a diameter on the order of
          one micron or one nanometer. As such, tubes 120 may be
          referred to as micro- tubes or nano-tubes, and power
          generation system 104 may be referred to as a micro-power-
          generation-system or a nano-power-generation-system. Note that
          the size of the micro-tubes or nano-tubes is exaggerated in
          Figures 1 and 2 and may be several orders of magnitude less
          that the thickness of skin 102 for some embodiments.<br>
          During operation, fluid- flow 110 enters tubes 120 though
          inlets 135. The respective tubes 120 direct their respective
          flows to the turbine turbine/generator 125. For example, pairs
          of tubes 120 direct their respective flows to a respective
          manifold 140. Each manifold 140 combines the flows from the
          respective pair of tubes 120 and directs the combined flow to
          manifold 130. Manifold 130 combines the flows from the
          respective manifolds 140 and directs the combined flow to the
          turbine of turbine/generator 125. As such, the turbine
          receives the flow flowing through each of tubes 120.<br>
          <br>
          The flow subsequently flows through the turbine, causing the
          turbine to rotate. The generator of turbine/generator 125
          generates electrical power in response to the rotation of the
          turbine. That is, the generator converts the rotation of the
          turbine into electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          The flow exits the turbme, and thus power system 104, through
          an outlet 150. That is, an outlet of the turbine is fluidly
          coupled to outlet 150. Outlet 150 may be located on and may
          open on the exterior side of skin structure 100, and the flow
          152 exiting power system 104 through outlet 150 may be
          returned to the flow 110, as shown in Figure 1.<br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, outlet 150 may be located on and open on the
          interior side of skin structure 100 so that the flow 152
          exiting power system 104 through outlet 150 is directed away
          from skin structure 100. For another embodiment, outlet 150
          may be located in a portion of the stationary structure or
          vehicle that is not exposed to fluid- flow 110.<br>
          <br>
          For one embodiment, a stationary structure or vehicle may have
          a plurality of power systems 104. For this embodiment, the
          power from each power system 104 may be directed to a battery,
          for example, for storage, such as for auxiliary power, to
          reduce the power demand of an engine of a motor vehicle, or to
          reduce the power that needs to be purchased to power a
          stationary structure, such as a building.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of a portion of power
          system 104, according to another embodiment. As shown, the
          flow passage within each tube 120 may be tapered and may
          converge along the length of the tube from the inlet 135 to
          turbine/generator 125. That is, the cross-sectional area
          (perpendicular to the flow direction) of the flow passage
          within each tube 120 decreases from the inlet 135 to the
          turbine/generator 125.<br>
          <br>
          Passing the flow through a tube 120 causes the flow to
          converge and thus accelerate. That is, each tube 120 receives
          fluid- flow 110 and accelerates fluid-flow 1 10. For
          embodiments, where manifolds 130 and 140 are used, manifolds
          130 and 140 may also have converging flow passages that act to
          accelerate the flows received thereat. The accelerated flow is
          delivered to the turbine. Note that the flow velocity within
          tubes 120, manifold 130, and manifolds 140, may be further
          increased, e.g., thermally assisted, by a temperature
          difference that may occur between the exterior and interior
          sides of skin structure 100, e.g., between the inlets 135 and
          the inlet to the turbine. The increased flow velocity at the
          inlet to the turbine allows for shorter turbine blades. For
          example, the power output of some turbines is proportional to
          the cubic order of the turbine inlet velocity and is typically
          proportional to the square of the blade length. This means
          that since the power output of a turbine is proportional to
          the cubic order of the turbine inlet velocity and is
          proportional to the square of the blade length, the turbine
          can have shorter blades and still have a higher power output.<br>
          <br>
          Shorter blades result in less drag than longer blades and thus
          result in less energy loss than longer blades. Shorter blades
          result in lower material costs, installation costs, and
          maintenance costs compared to longer blades. The shorter
          blades are less susceptible to defects and failure, take up
          less space, and generate less noise and vibration than longer
          blades.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in Figures 1 and 3, the inlet 135 of each tube 120
          may extend above exterior surface 108 of skin 102, e.g., at an
          angle to exterior surface 108. The distance d by which the
          inlet 135 of each tube 120 extends above exterior surface 108
          may be on the order of one micron or one nanometer, so as to
          not to significantly increase drag. Angling the inlet 135 of
          each tube 120, as shown in Figures 1 and 3, enables the inlet
          135 to capture a portion of fluid-flow 110 and to direct that
          portion of fluid-flow 110 into the respective tube 120. The
          outlet 150 of each tube may also extend above exterior surface
          108 of skin 102, e.g., at an angle to exterior surface 108, by
          a distance on the order of one micron or one nanometer, so as
          to not to significantly increase drag.<br>
          Alternatively, inlet 135 and outlet 150 may be flush (e.g.,
          substantially flush) with exterior surface 108, as shown in
          the cross-sectional view of Figure 4. The fluid-flow 110 in
          the configuration of Figure 4 may be parallel (e.g.,
          substantially parallel) to exterior surface 108 or may be
          perpendicular (e.g., substantially perpendicular) to exterior
          surface 108, as shown in Figure 4. Note that the outlet 150 in
          the configuration of Figure 4 may be located in a portion of
          the stationary structure or vehicle that is not exposed to
          fluid-flow 110, as indicated by the break in Figure 4.<br>
          <br>
          Micro-actuators or nano-actuators 160 may be coupled in
          physical contact with the outer surface of each tube 120, as
          shown in Figure 3, and in physical contact with the outer
          surface manifold 130 and of manifolds 140. Actuators 160 are
          electrically coupled to a controller (not shown) for receiving
          electrical signals therefrom. For example, a flow- velocity
          sensor (not shown), e.g., of skin structure 100, the vehicle,
          or the stationary structure, might detect a flow velocity of
          fluid-flow 110 and send a signal indicative of the flow
          velocity to the controller. For some embodiments, the flow-
          velocity sensor may sense the velocity of fluid-flow 1 10
          relative to exterior surface 108 of skin structure 100. For
          example, the velocity of fluid-flow 110 may be the wind speed
          or the velocity of the vehicle that includes skin structure
          100. The flow- velocity sensor may be a micro- or nano-sensor.<br>
          <br>
          The controller may apply a voltage to actuators 160, causing
          the actuators to adjust a shape of the tubes 120, e.g., the
          diameters of the tubes 120, and/or the shape of manifold 130,
          e.g., the diameter of manifold 130, and/or the shapes of
          manifolds 140, e.g., the diameters of manifolds 140, to
          produce a certain flow velocity at the inlet to the turbine.
          The controller may also cause the actuators to adjust the
          diameters of the tubes 120 and/or manifold 130 and/or
          manifolds 140 to reduce flow losses based on a detected flow
          velocity of fluid-flow 110. This is similar to control and
          operation of the actuators in U.S. Patent Application Serial
          No. 12/466,840 and U.S. Patent Application Serial No.

          sensors, and controllers.<br>

          Figure 5 illustrates a turbine/generator 525 that may be used
          for turbine/generator 125 of power system 104 for one
          embodiment. For example, turbine/generator 525 may include an
          axial-flow turbine 510 having blades that rotate about a
          rotational axis 515 that is parallel (e.g., substantially
          parallel) to the fluid-flow 517, e.g., exiting manifold 130,
          at the inlet to turbine 510. After the flow flows past turbine
          510, it is directed out of power system 104 through outlet 150
          (Figures 1 and 3).<br>
          <br>
          An electrical generator 520, such as a 60 Hz AC generator, is
          coupled (e.g., mechanically coupled) to turbine 120 via a
          shaft and suitable transmission. For water applications,
          electrical generator 520 is suitably waterproofed to protect
          against electrical shorting and corrosion. Alternatively,
          electrical generator 520 may be located out of the fluid-flow,
          and the shaft and transmission may convey the rotation to the
          location of electrical generator 520.<br>
          <br>
          For one embodiment, the size of turbine/generator 525 may be
          on the order of one micron or one nanometer, and may be
          referred to as a micro- or nano- turbine/generator. For
          example, turbine 510 may be a micro- or nano-turbine and have
          a rotor diameter (e.g., blade tip-to-tip distance) on the
          order of one micron or one nanometer, and generator 520 may be
          a micro- or nano-generator and have a size on the order of one
          micron or one nanometer.<br>
          <br>
          During operation, fluid-flow 517 causes turbine 510 to rotate.
          The rotation is transferred to generator 520, via the shaft
          and transmission, thereby causing generator to rotate and
          generate electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 6 and 7 illustrate a turbine/generator 625 that may be
          used for turbine/generator 125 of power system 104 for another
          embodiment. For example, turbine/generator 625 may include a
          radial-flow turbine 610 that rotates about a rotational axis
          615 (Figure 7) that is parallel (e.g., substantially parallel)
          to the fluid-flow 617 (Figures 6 and 7), e.g., exiting
          manifold 130, at the inlet to turbine 610. After entering
          turbine 610, fluid-flow 617 turns by about 90 degrees and
          flows with radial-outward component over turbine blades 619
          away from rotational axis 615 and toward a periphery 622 of
          turbine 610, as shown in Figure 7. At the periphery 622, the
          flow turns by about 90 degrees and flows parallel (e.g.,
          substantially parallel) to axis 615.<br>
          <br>
          The flow exits turbine 610, in a direction parallel (e.g.,
          substantially parallel) to axis 615, through outlets 624 that
          are formed in a stationary housing 626 that houses turbine 610
          and that are located around the periphery 622, as shown in
          Figures 6 and 7. The flow is then directed out of power system
          104 through outlet 150 (Figures 1 and 3). Note that turbine
          610 is located within housing 626 and is hidden from view in
          Figure 7 and is thus shown using dashed lines in Figure 7.<br>
          <br>
          For one embodiment, stationary housing 626 may include a
          stationary electrical generator (not shown) that generates
          electrical power from the motion of the tips of blades 619 of
          turbine 610 or the motion of the periphery 622 of turbine 610
          in a manner similar to the WT6000 Wind Turbine Gearless Blade
          Tip Power System developed by HONEYWELL International, Inc.
          (Morristown, NJ). For water applications, the electrical
          generator is suitably waterproofed to protect against
          electrical shorting and corrosion. Alternatively, turbine 610
          may be coupled to an electrical generator by a shaft and
          suitable transmission in a manner similar to that described
          above in conjunction with electrical generator 520.<br>
          <br>
          For one embodiment, the size of turbine/generator 625 may be
          on the order of one micron or one nanometer, and may be
          referred to as a micro- or nano- turbine/generator. For
          example, turbine 610 may have a diameter on the order of one
          micron or one nanometer and may be referred to as a micro- or
          nano-turbine.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 8 is a perspective view of an interior of a skin
          structure 800, according to another embodiment. Common
          reference numbers are used in Figure 8 and Figures 1-3 to
          identify the same or substantially similar components. Skin
          structure 800 may include the skin 102 described above in
          conjunction with Figures 1-3. The power generation system 104,
          described above in conjunction with Figures 1-3, is located on
          the interior side of skin structure 800, with the inlets 135
          of tubes 120 located on the interior side of skin structure
          800.<br>
          <br>
          The temperature of a fluid, such as water or air, on the
          interior side of skin structure 800 is greater than the
          temperature of the fluid on the exterior side of skin
          structure 800. For example, skin structure 800 may form a
          portion of an outer covering of a stationary structure, such
          as a roof of a building, where the interior of the building is
          at a higher temperature than the exterior. As such, interior
          surface 107 (Figures 8 and 9) of skin 102, and thus skin
          structure 800, may form a portion of an interior surface of
          the stationary structure, and exterior surface 108 (Figure 9)
          of skin 102, and thus skin structure 800, may form a portion
          of an exterior surface of the stationary structure.<br>
          <br>
          Skin structure 800 may form a portion a covering (e.g., a
          hood) of an engine compartment of a motor vehicle, where the
          interior of the engine compartment is at a higher temperature
          than the exterior of the motor vehicle. For example, interior
          surface 107 of skin 102, and thus skin structure 800, may form
          a portion of an interior surface of the engine compartment,
          and exterior surface 108 of skin 102, and thus skin structure
          800, may form a portion of an exterior surface of the engine
          compartment.<br>
          <br>
          The temperature difference between the interior and exterior
          produces a fluid-flow 810 on the interior side of skin
          structure 800 that enters tubes 120 through their respective
          inlets 135, as shown in Figure 9, a cross-sectional view of a
          portion of power system 104. That is, the flow 810 is a
          thermally driven flow. Note that inlets 135 open on the
          interior side of skin structure 800 and thus open to an
          interior of the stationary structure or the vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          The fluid flows through each tube 120, into the respective
          manifolds 140 (Figure 8), and into manifold 130, as described
          above in conjunction with Figures 1 and 2. The flow
          subsequently flows through the turbine of turbine generator
          125, causing the turbine to rotate. The generator of
          turbine/generator 125 generates electrical power in response
          to the rotation of the turbine. The flow exits the turbine,
          and thus power system 104, through outlet 150 on the exterior
          side of skin 102, and thus of skin structure 800. That is, an
          outlet of the turbine may be fluidly coupled to the exterior
          side of skin 102.<br>
          <br>
          Note that turbine/generator 125 may be the same (e.g.,
          substantially the same) as turbine/generator 525, discussed
          above in conjunction with Figure 5. Alternatively,
          turbine/generator 125 may be the same (e.g., substantially the
          same) as turbine/generator 625, discussed above in conjunction
          with Figures 6-7.<br>
          Note that power system 104, and thus skin structure 800,
          directs the relatively warm fluid from the interior side to
          the exterior side while generating electrical power. This acts
          to ventilate the interior of the stationary structure, such as
          a warm attic under a roof during the summer, or the interior
          of a motor vehicle, such as the engine compartment of the
          motor vehicle. That is, skin structure 800 provides cooling
          while producing electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          For one embodiment, skin structure 100 and skin structure 800
          may be used together on a stationary structure or a motor
          vehicle.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The present disclosure relates generally to kinetic hydropower
          generation and, in particular, the present disclosure relates
          to kinetic hydropower generation systems and intakes
          therefore.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Due to the recent energy problems that have arisen,
          considerable interest has been given to converting the kinetic
          energy of fluid flows occurring in nature, e.g., wind flows in
          wind energy conversion systems and water current flows in
          kinetic hydropower generation systems, into electrical power.
          For example, wind energy conversion systems involve directing
          wind through a turbine. The wind causes the turbine to rotate
          an electrical generator, causing the electrical generator to
          produce electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          Kinetic hydropower may be defined as, for example, dam-less
          hydropower that is converted from energy found in the flowing
          water currents of oceans, tides, rivers, lakes, and manmade
          channels or conduits. For example, kinetic hydropower
          generation systems typically involve submerging a turbine
          under water and directing flowing water current through the
          turbine, causing the turbine to rotate an electrical generator
          for producing electrical power. However, water currents in
          some bodies of water are too weak for kinetic hydropower
          generation systems to be cost effective. For example, some
          hydropower generation systems require current flow velocities
          of at least about six feet per second in order to generate
          enough energy for them to be cost-effective.<br>
          <br>
          The electrical power generated from the turbines typically
          used in wind energy conversion systems and kinetic hydropower
          generation systems is proportional to cubic order of the flow
          velocity, e.g., of the water or air, at the turbine inlet.
          Furthermore, the longer each turbine blade, the higher the
          power generation. However, long blades are costly, can be
          subjected to defects and failure, take up a large amount of
          space, and generate excessive noise and vibration. The
          electrical power generated from these turbines is directly
          proportional to the square of the propeller length. However,
          longer propellers increase not only the cost of material and
          installation, but also the cost of maintenance. As such,
          current wind energy conversion systems and kinetic hydropower
          generation systems typically suffer from low efficiency, high
          capital cost, unpredictable failures, excessively high noise
          and vibration, and/or high maintenance.<br>
          <br>
          For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated
          below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art
          upon reading and understanding the present specification,
          there is a need in the art for alternatives to existing wind
          power generation systems and kinetic hydropower generation
          systems.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          An embodiment of the present invention provides a kinetic
          hydropower generation system. The kinetic hydropower
          generation system has a turbine and a generator coupled to the
          turbine. An underwater intake nozzle assembly is fluidly
          coupled to the turbine. For one embodiment, an underwater
          tower nozzle may be fluidly coupled between the turbine and
          the underwater intake nozzle assembly. The underwater intake
          nozzle assembly may include a collector and a converging

            DESCRIPTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In the following detailed description of the present
          embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings
          that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of
          illustration specific embodiments that may be practiced. These
          embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those
          skilled in the art to practice disclosed subject matter, and
          it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized
          and that process, electrical or mechanical changes may be made
          without departing from the scope of the claimed subject
          matter. The following detailed description is, therefore, not
          to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the claimed
          subject matter is defined only by the appended claims and
          equivalents thereof. Figure 1 is a cut-away perspective view
          of an energy conversion system 100, such as a wind energy
          conversion system or a kinetic hydropower generation system.
          When operating as kinetic hydropower generation system, energy
          conversion system 100 is submerged within a body of water,
          such as a river, ocean, lake, or a manmade channel, etc., as
          is shown in Figure 3 for a kinetic hydropower generation
          system 300. Energy conversion system 100 includes a
          turbine-intake tower 110, a turbine 120 fluidly coupled to
          turbine- intake tower 110, and an electrical generator 130,
          such as a 60 Hz AC generator, coupled (e.g., mechanically
          coupled) to turbine 120.<br>
          <br>
          For underwater applications, electrical generator 130 is
          suitably waterproofed to protect against electrical shorting
          and corrosion. To help guard against water corrosion
          turbine-intake tower 110 and the blades of turbine 120 may be
          fabricated from a suitable polymer or may be polymer-coated
          metal. For other embodiments, turbine 120 and electrical
          generator 130 may be located above water, such as on land or
          on a platform floating on a body of water, and the water
          exiting turbine-intake tower 110 may conveyed to turbine 120,
          e.g., by conduits, such as pipes. Turbine-intake tower 110 has
          an inlet 140 and an outlet 142. Air or water enters
          turbine-intake tower 110 through inlet 140 flows through
          turbine-intake tower 110 and exits turbine-intake tower 110
          through outlet 142. The air or water exiting though outlet 142
          passes over the blades of turbine 120, as shown in Figure 2,
          an enlarged view of outlet 142, turbine 120, and generator
          130, causing turbine 120 to rotate. Rotation of turbine 120
          rotates the generator 130 via a suitable transmission (not
          shown) that mechanically couples turbine 120 to generator 130.<br>
          <br>
          Inlet 140 may have a screen or other devices to prevent the
          entry of birds or other airborne objects for wind applications
          or the entry offish or other water-born objects for underwater
          applications. Any conventional bird-catcher or fish-catcher
          device may be used in this system. Turbine-intake tower 110
          includes an intake nozzle assembly 143 that includes a
          converging intake nozzle 144 and that may include an integral
          collector 146 that is contiguous with converging intake nozzle
          144. For another embodiment, intake nozzle assembly 143 may be
          rotatably coupled to a support column 150 of turbine- intake
          tower 110 by means of a bearing 152. Support column 150 is
          substantially vertical and acts to support intake nozzle
          assembly 143 at a vertical height H above ground level 154,
          where the height H is measured from a central longitudinal
          axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly 143. Note that ground level
          154 may correspond to the floor or the bottom 354 (Figure 3)
          of the body of water in which turbine-intake tower 110 is
          submerged.<br>
          <br>
          For wind applications, the height H may be about the same
          height as the hub of a turbine of a conventional wind turbine
          system, where the turbine is mounted atop a tower. For
          example, the height H may be about 100 to about 200 feet.<br>
          <br>
          For some underwater applications, the height H may be
          sufficient to position intake nozzle assembly 143 at a
          distance above the bottom 354 of the body of water where the
          flow velocity is at or near its highest. For example, for
          rivers or shallow-water regions near shorelines, the current
          flow velocity increases toward the surface of the water. For
          example, in breakwater zones near shorelines, the flow
          velocity near the surface is higher due to wave action and
          tidal flow. As such, intake nozzle assembly 143 is positioned
          to capture tidal flow and wave-induced current.<br>
          <br>
          Support column 150 has a base 151 that may directly contact
          the ground at ground level 154. Alternatively, for wind
          applications, intake tower 110 may be positioned on and may be
          in direct contact with a platform floating on water, for
          example, for offshore application, in which case ground level
          154 would correspond to the surface of the platform. Turbine
          120 and generator 130 are located at or near ground level,
          e.g., at about the same vertical level as base 151 and about
          the same vertical level as outlet 142, as shown in Figures 1
          and 2. For example, turbine 120 and generator 130 may be
          located on the bottom 354 of the body of water, as shown in
          Figure 3.<br>
          <br>
          Intake nozzle assembly 143 may be substantially horizontal.
          That is, central longitudinal axis 156 of intake nozzle
          assembly 143 may be substantially horizontal. Central
          longitudinal axis 156 may be substantially parallel to the
          direction of the wind or water current and thus the direction
          of the air or water entering intake nozzle assembly 143. The
          inner surfaces of nozzle assembly 143 are made of a smooth
          material in order to reduce losses due to surface friction.<br>
          <br>
          Collector 146 extends in the direction of central longitudinal
          axis 156 from an inlet plane 160 of turbine-intake tower 110
          to the dashed line 162, which marks the exit of collector 146.
          The flow passage within collector 146 is substantially uniform
          in size between inlet plane 160 and the exit 162 of collector
          146, i.e., the cross-sectional area (perpendicular to the flow
          direction) of the flow passage within collector 146 is
          substantially uniform between inlet plane 160 and the exit
          162. When inlet 140 is facing the wind or the direction of the
          water current and central longitudinal axis 156 is
          substantially parallel to the wind or water flow direction,
          collector 146 collects the wind or water flow. Intake nozzle
          144 is fluidly coupled to collector 146. The flow passage
          within intake nozzle 144 converges (e.g., tapers) in the
          direction of central longitudinal axis 156, starting at the
          exit 162 of collector 146 and ending at an entrance to an
          elbow 164. That is, the cross-sectional area (perpendicular to
          the flow direction) of the flow passage within intake nozzle
          144 decreases between exit 162 of collector 146 and elbow 164,
          as shown in Figure 1. Intake nozzle 144 acts to increase the
          flow velocity between exit 162 of collector 146 and elbow 164.
          That is, passing the flow through intake nozzle 144 causes the
          flow to converge and thus accelerate. Note that intake nozzle
          144 receives the wind or water current from collector 146 and
          accelerates the wind or water current.<br>
          <br>
          Elbow 164 is interposed between intake nozzle assembly 143 and
          bearing 152. As such, bearing 152 rotatably connects an upper
          end of support column 150 to elbow 164. Support column 150 is
          hollow. A converging tower nozzle 170 (e.g., a column nozzle)
          is located within an interior of support column 150 and may
          extend from bearing 152 to an elbow 172 that is coupled to an
          outlet duct 174 (e.g., sometimes referred to as the turbine
          inlet duct) that leads to outlet 142. As such, tower nozzle
          170 is fluidly coupled to intake nozzle 144 and outlet duct
          174.<br>
          <br>
          Tower nozzle 170 may be substantially vertical. For example, a
          central longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle 170 is
          substantially vertical and is substantially perpendicular to
          central longitudinal axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly 143,
          as shown in Figure 1. The flow passage within tower nozzle 170
          converges (e.g., tapers) in the direction of central
          longitudinal axis 176, e.g., in the downward vertical
          direction, starting at the exit of elbow 164 and ending at an
          entrance to elbow 172. That is, the cross-sectional area
          (perpendicular to the flow direction) of the flow passage
          within tower nozzle 170 decreases between elbow 164 and elbow
          172, as shown in Figure 1. Tower nozzle 170 acts to increase
          the flow velocity between elbow 164 and elbow 172. That is,
          passing the flow through tower nozzle 170 causes the flow to
          converge and thus accelerate.<br>
          <br>
          Outlet duct 174 may be substantially horizontal. For example,
          a central longitudinal axis 178 of outlet duct 174 may be
          substantially horizontal and may be substantially
          perpendicular to central longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle
          170 and substantially parallel to central longitudinal axis
          156 of intake nozzle assembly 143, as shown in Figure 1. Elbow
          172 and outlet duct 174 direct the flow from tower nozzle 170
          onto the blades of turbine 120. The flow velocity at outlet
          142, i.e., the outlet of turbine-intake tower 110 and of duct
          174, is the turbine inlet velocity.<br>
          <br>
          Turbine 120 has a rotatable shaft 180 that is substantially
          horizontal, i.e., shaft 180 has a central longitudinal axis
          182 that is substantially horizontal and that is substantially
          parallel to central longitudinal axis 178 of outlet duct 174.
          Turbine blades 181 (Figure 2), e.g., three or more, are
          mechanically coupled to shaft 180. Note that central
          longitudinal axis 182 is the rotational axis of turbine 120
          about which shaft 180 and the blades rotate.<br>
          <br>
          Turbine 120 may be referred to as a horizontal-axis turbine.
          Central longitudinal axis 178 of outlet duct 174 central
          longitudinal axis 182 of shaft 180 maybe substantially
          collinear. Note that for this embodiment, turbine-intake tower
          110 has a substantially horizontal outlet. Also note that the
          direction of the flow exiting outlet duct 174 is substantially
          parallel to the central longitudinal axis 182 of shaft 180 and
          thus the rotational axis of turbine 120.<br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, for another embodiment, elbow 172 and outlet
          duct 174 may be removed, and a turbine 120 may be located at
          the exit of tower nozzle 170 so that its shaft 180 is
          substantially vertical. For example, central longitudinal axis
          182 of shaft 180 is substantially vertical and is
          substantially parallel and substantially collinear to central
          longitudinal axis 176 of tower nozzle 170. In this embodiment,
          turbine 120 may be referred to as a vertical-axis turbine.
          Note that the flow velocity at the exit of tower nozzle 170 is
          the turbine inlet velocity for this embodiment and that
          turbine 120 receives the fluid flow directly from tower nozzle
          170. As such, the exit of tower nozzle 170 is the outlet of
          turbine-intake tower 110, meaning that turbine-intake tower
          110 has a substantially vertical outlet. Again, the direction
          of the flow exiting tower nozzle 170 is substantially parallel
          to the vertically oriented central longitudinal axis 182 of
          shaft 180 and thus the rotational axis of turbine 120. Elbow
          164 has a radius of curvature that acts to keep flow losses
          relatively low.<br>
          <br>
          This means that the flow velocity at the exit of intake nozzle
          144 and the entrance to tower nozzle 170 is substantially the
          same. Elbow 172 also has a radius of curvature that acts to
          keep flow losses relatively low. In addition, the losses in
          outlet duct 174 are relatively small. Therefore, the flow
          velocity at the exit of tower nozzle 170 and the exit of
          outlet duct 174 are substantially the same. As such, intake
          nozzle 144 and tower nozzle 170 work together to increase the
          flow velocity from the velocity at inlet 140 (the wind or
          water current velocity) to the velocity at outlet 142 (the
          turbine inlet velocity).<br>
          <br>
          The inner surfaces of the elbows, tower nozzle 170, and outlet
          duct 174 are made of a smooth material in order to reduce
          losses due to surface friction. Turbulence suppressors may be
          implemented to reduce turbulence in elbows 164 and 172, intake
          nozzle assembly 143, tower nozzle 170, and outlet duct 174
          that may result from imperfections and anomalies in elbows 164
          and 172, intake nozzle assembly 143, tower nozzle 170, and
          outlet duct 174.<br>
          Note that the flow (wind or water current) velocity at inlet
          140 is substantially the same as the flow (wind or water
          current) velocity at the inlet of a turbine of a conventional
          wind energy conversion or a conventional kinetic hydropower
          generation system. This means that the flow velocity at the
          inlet to turbine 120 is higher than the flow velocity (wind or
          water current) at the inlet of the turbines of conventional
          wind energy conversion systems and conventional kinetic
          hydropower generation systems, owing to increasing the flow
          velocity using intake nozzle 144 and tower nozzle 170. The
          increased velocity at the inlet to turbine 120 allows for
          shorter turbine blades compared to the turbine blades for the
          turbines of conventional wind energy conversion systems and
          conventional kinetic hydropower generation systems.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the power output of a turbine is typically
          proportional to the cubic order of the turbine inlet velocity
          and is typically proportional to the square of the blade
          length. Since the turbine inlet velocity, as result of
          turbine-intake tower 110, of the wind energy conversion
          systems and the kinetic hydropower generation systems of the
          present disclosure is higher than the wind or water current
          velocity at the inlet of a turbine of a conventional wind
          energy conversion system or a conventional kinetic hydropower
          generation system, the wind energy conversion systems and the
          kinetic hydropower generation systems of the present
          disclosure have a higher power output than conventional wind
          energy conversion systems and conventional kinetic hydropower
          generation systems for the same blade length. This means that
          since the power output of a turbine is proportional to the
          cubic order of the turbine inlet velocity and is proportional
          to the square of the blade length, the turbines of the wind
          energy conversion systems and the kinetic hydropower
          generation systems of the present disclosure can have shorter
          blades than the blades of the turbines of conventional wind
          energy conversion systems and conventional kinetic hydropower
          generation systems and still have a higher power output.<br>
          <br>
          Shorter blades result in less drag than longer blades and thus
          result in less energy loss than longer blades. Shorter blades
          result in lower material costs, installation costs, and
          maintenance costs compared to the longer blades of the
          turbines of conventional wind energy conversion systems and
          conventional kinetic hydropower generation systems. The
          shorter blades are less susceptible to defects and failure,
          take up less space, and generate less noise and vibration than
          the longer blades of the turbines of conventional wind energy
          conversion systems and conventional kinetic hydropower
          generation systems.<br>
          Actuators 186, e.g., piezoelectric actuators, may be
          physically coupled to the outer surface of intake nozzle
          assembly 143, e.g., the outer surface of intake nozzle 144
          and/or the outer surface of collector 146, as shown in Figures
          1, 3, and 4. For example, actuators 186 may be coupled in
          direct physical contact with the outer surface of intake
          nozzle 144 and/or the outer surface of collector 146.
          Actuators 186 are electrically coupled to a controller 190 for
          receiving electrical signals from controller 190.<br>
          <br>
          A flow- velocity sensor 192, may be mounted on an outer
          surface of turbine-intake tower 110 at or near the top of
          turbine-intake tower 110 for sensing the velocity of the wind
          or water current. For example, flow- velocity sensor 192 may
          be mounted on elbow 164, as shown in Figure 1, or on intake
          nozzle assembly 143. Flow-velocity sensor 192 may be
          electrically coupled to controller 190 for sending electrical
          signals to controller 190 indicative of the sensed wind or
          water current flow velocity. Note that although flow- velocity
          sensor 192 is positioned behind inlet 140, flow- velocity
          sensor 192 is positioned at a vertical level that is
          sufficiently above the upper surface of intake nozzle assembly
          143 so as to sense the prevailing wind or water current flow
          velocity external to turbine-intake tower 110. As a result,
          flow- velocity sensor 192 effectively measures the prevailing
          wind or water current flow velocity upstream of inlet 140.<br>
          <br>
          A flow-direction sensor 194, may be mounted on an outer
          surface of turbine- intake tower 110 at or near the top of
          turbine-intake tower 110 for sensing the direction of the wind
          or water current flow. Flow-direction sensor 194 catches the
          wind or water flow such that the water current flow rotates
          intake nozzle assembly 143 relative to support column 150 such
          that inlet 140 is directed into the wind or water current
          flow, e.g., so that central longitudinal axis 156 of intake
          nozzle assembly 143 is substantially parallel to the wind or
          water flow direction. Flow-direction sensor 194 may be
          electrically coupled to controller 190 for sending electrical
          signals to controller 190 indicative of the sensed wind or
          water flow direction.<br>
          <br>
          Kinetic hydropower generation systems that are configured to
          convert the kinetic energy of tidal flows into electrical
          power are exposed to bidirectional currents. That is, the
          current flow is in one direction when the tide comes in and in
          an opposite direction when the tide goes out. Flow-direction
          sensor 194 catches the incoming or outgoing tide and rotates
          intake nozzle assembly 143 so that inlet 140 is directed into
          the incoming or outgoing tide. Note that rivers that flow into
          the oceans act as tidal channels where the current direction
          changes with the tide. For another embodiment, upon receiving
          electrical signals from flow-direction sensor 194, controller
          190 may send electrical signals to a yaw motor (not shown)
          located adjacent bearing 152. A yaw drive (not shown) may
          mechanically couple the yaw motor to intake nozzle assembly
          143. The signals instruct the yaw motor to activate the yaw
          drive that in turn rotates intake nozzle assembly 143 relative
          to support column 150 and tower nozzle 170 such that inlet 140
          is directed into the wind or the water current flow.<br>
          <br>
          In response to receiving signals indicative of the wind or
          water flow velocity from flow- velocity sensor 192, controller
          190 may send electrical signals to actuators 186.<br>
          <br>
          Actuators 186 may then adjust the shape (e.g., contour) of
          intake nozzle assembly 143 by exerting forces on the outer
          surface of intake nozzle assembly 143 based on the wind or
          water flow velocity. That is, the shape of collector 146
          and/or the shape of intake nozzle 144 may be adjusted based on
          the wind or water flow velocity. For example, actuators 186
          may adjust the diameter of collector 146 and/or a diameter of
          intake nozzle 144.<br>
          <br>
          Controller 190 may store voltage values corresponding to the
          voltages that need to be applied to an actuator 186 to set a
          diameter at a certain numerical value. The certain numerical
          value may correspond to a diameter that provides a certain
          increase in velocity and/or reduced losses for a certain wind
          or water flow velocity for a certain power output. For
          example, flow-velocity sensor 192 might detect a wind or water
          flow velocity and send a signal indicative of the wind or
          water flow velocity to controller 190. Controller 190 may then
          determine the required velocity at outlet 142 to produce a
          certain power. Controller 190 may further determine how much
          voltage needs to be applied to an actuator 186 to adjust the
          diameter of intake nozzle 144 and/or collector 146 in order to
          produce the required velocity at outlet 142 for the detected
          wind or water flow velocity. Similarly, controller 190 may
          adjust the diameter of collector 146 and/or a diameter of
          intake nozzle 144 to reduce flow losses based on a detected
          wind or water flow velocity.<br>
          <br>
          In the event that flow- velocity sensor 192 detects a wind or
          water flow velocity that is excessive, e.g., above a certain
          value, and that could cause damage to turbine 120 and/or
          generator 130, controller 190 might send a signal to solenoid
          activated bleed-off valves 193 located at the elbows 164 and
          172 that causes the bleed-off valves 193 to open. Opening the
          bleed-off valves 193 causes a portion of the flow to be bled
          off, reducing the turbine inlet velocity to an acceptable
          value. For example, a portion of the flow may be bled off
          between intake nozzle assembly 143 and tower nozzle 170, and a
          portion of the flow may be bled off between tower nozzle 170
          and turbine 120. For one embodiment, the bled-off flows may be
          directed to another turbine. After intake nozzle assembly 143
          is rotated such that inlet 140 is directed into the wind or
          water current flow and central longitudinal axis 156 is
          substantially parallel to the wind or water current flow
          direction, collector 146 collects the wind or water current
          flow and directs the wind or water flow to intake nozzle 144.
          Intake nozzle 144 accelerates the wind or water flow. Elbow
          164 receives the accelerated wind or water flow from intake
          nozzle 143 and directs the wind or water current flow to tower
          nozzle 170 by turning the wind by substantially 90 degrees.
          Tower nozzle 170 further accelerates the wind or water flow.
          For one embodiment, elbow 172 receives the further accelerated
          wind or water flow from tower nozzle 170 and directs the wind
          or water flow to outlet duct 174 by turning the wind or water
          flow by substantially 90 degrees. Outlet duct 174 directs the
          wind or water flow to turbine 120, e.g., when turbine 120 is a
          horizontal-axis turbine. For another embodiment, e.g., when
          turbine 120 is a vertical-axis turbine, turbine 120 may
          receive the wind or water flow directly from tower nozzle 170
          while the wind or water is flowing substantially vertically
          downward. For another embodiment, the outputs of two or more
          turbine-intake towers 110 may be sent to a single turbine 120
          coupled to a single generator 130, as shown for an energy
          conversion system 400, such as a wind energy conversion system
          or a kinetic hydropower generation system, in Figure 4. In
          particular, the outlet ducts 174 are coupled to a single
          outlet 442 directed at turbine 120. Note that the flow
          velocity at outlet 442 is the turbine inlet velocity. Common
          numbering is used in Figures 1 and 4 to identify components
          common to Figures 1 and 4.<br>
          <br>
          When energy conversion system 400 acts as a kinetic hydropower
          generation system, energy conversion system 400 is submerged
          under water. For another embodiment, only turbine-intake
          towers 110 are submerged under water; and the single turbine
          120 and generator 130 are located on land or on a floating
          platform; and the water exiting the single outlet 442 is
          conveyed to the turbine 120, e.g., by conduits, such as pipes.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 5 illustrates a kinetic hydropower generation system
          500 submerged in a body of water, such as a river, ocean,
          lake, or a manmade channel, etc. Common numbering is used in
          Figures 1-3 and 5 to identify components common to Figures 1-3
          and 5. Kinetic hydropower generation system 500 includes the
          nozzle assembly 143, as described above in conjunction with
          Figure 1, positioned on bottom 354 of the body of water. Inlet
          140 of nozzle assembly 143 is directed into the water current
          flow. Intake nozzle assembly 143 may be substantially parallel
          to bottom 354 of the body of water. That is, central
          longitudinal axis 156 of intake nozzle assembly 143 maybe
          substantially parallel to bottom 354 of the body of water.
          Central longitudinal axis 156 may be substantially parallel to
          the direction of the water current and thus the direction of
          water entering intake nozzle assembly 143.<br>
          <br>
          The central longitudinal axis 182 of turbine shaft 180 (Figure
          2) is substantially parallel to and is substantially collinear
          with longitudinal axis 156, as shown in Figure 6, an enlarged
          view of outlet 542 of intake nozzle assembly 143, turbine 120,
          and generator 130. As indicated above in conjunction with
          Figures 1 and 2, central longitudinal axis 182 is the
          rotational axis of turbine 120. Note that the direction of the
          flow exiting intake nozzle assembly 143 is substantially
          parallel to the central longitudinal axis 182 of shaft 180.<br>
          <br>
          Nozzle assembly 143 operates as described above in conjunction
          with Figure 1. That is, collector 146 collects the water
          current flow and directs the water flow to intake nozzle 144.
          Intake nozzle 144 accelerates the water flow and directs the
          accelerated water flow onto blades of turbine 120, causing
          turbine 120 to rotate generator 130 so that generator 130
          generates electrical power.<br>
          <br>
          Nozzle assembly 143 may include the flow- velocity sensor 192
          (Figure 1) that is electrically coupled to controller 190 for
          sending electrical signals to controller 190 indicative of the
          sensed water current flow velocity. Controller 190 may cause
          actuators 186 to adjust the diameter of collector 146 and/or a
          diameter of intake nozzle 144 based on the detected water flow
          velocity, as described above.<br>
          <br>
          For example, controller 190 may determine how much voltage
          needs to be applied to an actuator 186 to adjust the diameter
          of intake nozzle 144 and/or collector 146 in order to produce
          the required velocity at outlet 542 for the detected water
          flow velocity. Controller 190 may further adjust the diameter
          of collector 146 and/or a diameter of intake nozzle 144 to
          reduce flow losses based on a detected water flow velocity.<br>
          <br>
          For another embodiment, the outputs of two or more nozzle
          assemblies 143 of a kinetic hydropower generation system may
          be sent to a single turbine 120 coupled to a single generator
          130 in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 4. For
          example, the outlets 542 of the two or more nozzle assemblies
          143 may be coupled to a single outlet, e.g., similar to outlet
          442 in Figure 4, directed at turbine 120. Figure 7 is a
          perspective view of an array 700 of energy conversion systems
          100, as described above in conjunction with Figures 1 and 2.
          Array 700 may be located above ground as a portion of a wind
          farm or may be submerged in a body of water as a portion of an
          underwater kinetic-hydropower- generation farm. The turbines
          and generators of the respective energy conversion systems 100
          of the underwater kinetic-hydropower- generation farm may be
          located underwater or above water, e.g., on land or on a
          floating platform.<br>
          <br>
          A wind farm may include a plurality of above-ground
          turbine-intake towers 110 coupled to a single outlet directed
          at a single turbine, as shown in Figure 4. An underwater
          kinetic-hydropower-generation farm may include a plurality of
          underwater turbine-intake towers 110 coupled to a single
          outlet directed at a single turbine. The single turbine of the
          underwater kinetic-hydropower-generation farm may be located
          on land or on a floating platform, and the water exiting the
          single outlet may be conveyed to the on-land turbine, e.g., by
          conduits, such as pipes.<br>
          <br>
          For another embodiment, an underwater
          kinetic-hydropower-generation farm may include an array of
          underwater kinetic hydropower generation systems 500 (Figure
          5). The turbines and generators of the respective energy
          conversion systems 500 maybe located underwater or above
          water, e.g., on land or on a floating platform. Alternatively,
          an underwater kinetic-hydropower-generation farm may include
          an array of nozzle assemblies 143, where nozzle assemblies of
          the array are coupled to a single outlet directed at a single
          turbine, where the single turbine and the generator coupled
          thereto are underwater or are above water, e.g., on land or on
          a floating platform.<br>
          <br>
          Accelerating water current flow using the nozzle assembly 143
          of Figure 5 or accelerating either wind or water current flow
          using the turbine-intake towers 110 of Figures 1, 3, 4, and 7
          acts to reduce the length of the turbine blades. Reducing the
          length of the turbine blades acts to reduce the initial
          capital cost, installation cost, and the lifetime maintenance
          cost of the turbine. Accelerating the water current flow using
          either nozzle assembly 143 or turbine-intake tower 110 acts to
          increase water current flow velocities that might otherwise be
          too low to be cost effective to levels that can be cost
          effective.<br>
          <br>
          Locating the turbine and generator above water as described in
          some of the embodiments of the disclosed kinetic hydropower
          generation systems enables easier to access the turbine and
          generator than the underwater turbines and generators in
          conventional kinetic hydropower generation systems. This acts
          to reduce maintenance costs. Above-water turbines and
          generators are not subjected to the type of water-induced
          corrosion as is common in under-water turbines and generators.
          Above-water generators are not subject to the type of
          water-induced shorting that can occur with underwater
          generators.<br>
