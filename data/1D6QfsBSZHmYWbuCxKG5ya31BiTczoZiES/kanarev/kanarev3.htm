              LOW CURRENT ELECTROLYSIS&nbsp; OF WATER</b> </p>
          <p><b>Ph. M. Kanarev</b></p>
        </center>
        <p align="left">( Published 19.12.2003 / Updated 04.11.2005 ) </p>
        <p align="left">An interest in hydrogen energetic is being
          increased of late years. It is explained by the fact that
          hydrogen is an inexhaustible and environmental-friendly energy
          carrier. But the implementation of these properties is slowed
          down by large energy consumption for its production from
          water.&nbsp; The most modern Electrolyzers consume 4.0 kWh per
          cubic meter of this gas. Electrolysis process takes place by
          voltage of 1.6-2.0 V and current strength of dozens and
          hundreds of amperes. When one cubic meter of hydrogen is
          burnt, 3.55 kWh of energy is released [1]. </p>
        <p align="left">Many laboratories in the world are busy solving
          a problem of a reduction of energy consumption for hydrogen
          production from water, but there are no significant results.
          In the meantime, a money-saving process of decomposition of
          water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen exists in the nature.
          This process takes place during photosynthesis. Hydrogen atoms
          are separated from water molecules and are used as connecting
          links while forming organic molecules, and oxygen is released
          into the air. </p>
        <p align="left">A question emerges: is it possible to model an
          electrolytical process of water decomposition into hydrogen
          and oxygen, which takes place during photosynthesis? A search
          of a reply to this question has resulted in a simple structure
          of a cell (Fig. 1), in which the process takes place by
          voltage of 1.5-2.0 V between the anode and the cathode and
          amperage of 0.02 amperes [1], [2]. </p>

        <p align="left">The electrodes of the cell are made of steel. It
          helps to avoid the phenomena, which are appropriate to a
          galvanic cell. Nevertheless, at the cell electrodes a
          potential difference of nearly 0.1 V takes place in complete
          default of electrolytic solution in it. When the solution is
          charged, the potential difference is increased. The positive
          sign of the charge appears on the upper electrode always, and
          the negative sign appears on the lower one. If a direct
          current source generates pulses, gas output is increased. </p>

        <p align="left">As a laboratory model of the low current
          electrolyzer cell generates small quantity of gases, a
          solution mass change definition method during the experiment
          and further calculation of released hydrogen and oxygen is the
          most reliable method of definition of their quantity. </p>
        <p align="left">It is known that a gram atom is equal to atomic
          mass of substance; a gram molecule is equal to molecular mass
          of substance. For example, the gram molecule of hydrogen in
          the water molecule is equal to two grams; the gram-atom of the
          oxygen atom is 16 grams. The gram molecule of water is equal
          to 18 grams. Hydrogen mass in a water molecule is 2 x 100 / 18
          = 11.11%; oxygen mass is 16 x 100 / 18 = 88.89 %; this ratio
          of hydrogen and oxygen is in one liter of water. It means that
          111.11 grams of hydrogen and 888.89 grams of oxygen are in
          1000 grams of water. </p>
        <p align="left">One liter of hydrogen weighs 0.09 g; one liter
          of oxygen weighs 1.47 g. It means that it is possible to
          produce 111.11 / 0.09 = 1234.44 liters of hydrogen and 888.89
          / 1.47 = 604.69 liters of oxygen from one liter of water. It
          appears from this that one gram of water contains 1.23 liters
          of hydrogen. Energy consumption for production of 1000 liters
          of hydrogen is 4 kWh and for one liter 4 Wh. As it is possible
          to produce 1.234 liters of hydrogen from one gram of water,
          1.234 x 4 = 4.94 Wh is spent for hydrogen production from one
          gram of water now. </p>

          0.655 x 0.0302 = 0.01978 A = 0.02 mA. The ammeter readings are
          0.02 A. </p>
        <p align="left">A question emerges at once: why is current value
          according to the readings of the ammeter and oscillograph the
          same and voltage value according to&nbsp; the oscillograph
          readings is 177.4fold less than according to the voltmeter
          readings? A series of additional experiments accompanying this
          question is shown that a low current electrolyzer cell is a
          capacitor being discharged gradually under the influence of
          electrolytical processes, which take place in it. A value of
          this discharge is compensated by the pulses of voltage, which
          mean value is considerably less than a constant value of
          charge voltage of this capacitor. </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, the voltmeter shows a capacitor charge
          voltage value, and the&nbsp; oscillograph shows a value of its
          recharge, which characterizes the energy consumed by the cell
          from the line. It appears from this that in order to calculate
          energy consumed by the low current electrolyzer cell from the
          line it is necessary to use voltage, which is registered not
          by the voltmeter, but by the oscillograph. As a result, energy
          consumption for hydrogen production from water in case of low
          current electrolysis are reduced not 12fold, but almost
          2000fold. </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, a small value of current 0.02 A and
          voltage 0.062 V allows us to suppose that in the low current
          electrolyzer the water electrolysis process is similar to the
          process, which takes place during photosynthesis. At
          photosynthesis, hydrogen separated from the water molecule is
          used as a connecting link while organic molecule formation,
          and oxygen is released in the air. At low current
          electrolysis, both hydrogen and oxygen are released in the
          air. </p>
        <p align="left">Fruitfulness of this attractive hypothesis
          should be checked not once, but now it is the only one, which
          gives a satisfactory explanation of an unusual experimental
          result. </p>
        <p align="left">Note: gas release is clearly seen during several
          hours after the cell is disconnected from the line. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Energy efficiency index of the low current
          electrolysis should be refined, but in any case it will be
          greater than 10, that’s why there is every reason to think
          that a way to production of inexpensive hydrogen from water
          and transition to hydrogen energetic is opened. </p>
