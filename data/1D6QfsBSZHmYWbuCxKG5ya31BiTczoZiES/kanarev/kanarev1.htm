        <b>WATER IS THE MAIN POWER CARRIER OF FUTURE POWER ENGINEERING</b>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ph. M. Kanarev</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>ABSTRACT ---</b> </p>
      <p>The problems of power engineering are well known. The power
        carriers, which are used nowadays, are not only exhaustible, but
        they cause a considerable damage to environment. Nearly 40 years
        ago it was announced that controlled thermonuclear fusion could
        be the future inexhaustible energy source. More than 25 billion
        dollars have been spent for the investigation of this source,
        but there is no positive result. This state can be explained by
        a considerable lag of theoretical investigations from the
        possibilities of industry to implement any installation in order
        to check an intuitive idea being formulated. As a result, the
        main attention has been paid to an experiment, not to a theory.
      </p>
      <p>As there was no acceptable theoretical description of the
        planned process of thermonuclear fusion control, a positive
        result could be obtained only by chance. Theoretical
        prognostication of this result was impossible due to the absence
        of any notion concerning the models: the electron, the proton,
        the atom of hydrogen and the ions of chemical elements, which
        form plasma. Orthodox physics did not even set itself such task.
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime theoretical physics and theoretical chemistry
        were at a standstill. They were developed by those who managed
        to overcome a stereotype of the existing theoretical notions. As
        a result, the models of the photon, the electron, the atom of
        hydrogen, the atoms of the ions and the molecules of other
        chemical elements took place. The analysis of them of the
        behavior demonstrated the impossibility to control plasma in a
        current carrying space, which is the main technological element
        of the well known installations "Takomak". If it was known
        earlier, the expenses for the above-mentioned investigations
        could be reduced at least by an order of magnitude. </p>
      <p>Twelve years ago Fleischmann and Pons, the American
        electrochemists, obtained additional energy during electrolysis
        of heavy water. They announced at once that cold nuclear fusion
        is the source of this energy. Hundreds of experiments were
        carried out in various countries in order to check this fact.
        The positive result was registered, but its reproducibility
        proved to be low. The reason of appearance of additional energy
        remained unclear. </p>
      <p>In 1995, we began our investigations of the water electrolysis
        process in order to obtain additional energy. It has been
        determined that there are such modes of plasma electrolysis of
        water when up to 100% of additional thermal energy takes place,
        but a thousandfold increase of energy, which was announced by
        the Americans, was not confirmed. The calculations have shown
        that an increase of thermal energy by 100% with the unstable
        reproducibility of such a result has no prospects for industrial
        implementation. At least 300% increase of thermal energy is
        necessary, but such result cannot be obtained still. </p>
      <p>But if we take into consideration energy of hydrogen and
        oxygen, which are released from water together with additional
        thermal energy, it will be possible to get more than 300% of
        additional energy. </p>
      <p>Modern industrial installations require 4 kWh for production of
        1 cubic meter of hydrogen from water. When this hydrogen is
        burnt, 3.6 kWh of energy is released. If the energy expenses for
        production of hydrogen from water are reduced by twofold or
        threefold, it becomes a competitive energy carrier. If it is
        possible to reduce these expenses of hydrogen tenfold, it will
        become the cheapest energy carrier. In this case, coal, oil and
        natural gas fail to compete with it. </p>
      <p>Our investigations have shown that there are some plasma
        electrolytic devices and modes of their operation, which reduce
        energy expenses for obtaining one cubic meter of hydrogen up to
        0.40 kWh. In this case, more than 1000% of additional energy is
        obtained. A laboratory device with such indices was made one
        year ago. </p>
      <p>Modern fuel elements use potential possibilities of hydrogen by
        0.6%. There is every reason to believe that the fuel element
        will improve this index at least by an order of magnitude if it
        operates together with the plasma electrolytic reactor. There
        are great reserves in the discovered direction of the energy
        problem solution. </p>
      <p>The transition from a laboratory installation to the industrial
        one requires additional investigations with the use of rather
        expensive spectrometers, gas analyzers, electronic sets for
        simultaneous registration of more than 10 induces of the plasma
        electrolytic process. As hydrogen is an explosive gas, it is
        impossible to ignore the investigation stage for making the
        laboratory installation the industrial one. During the scale
        operation, dangerous radiations can take place, which accompany
        the transmutation process of the chemical element nuclei. </p>
      <p>Five patents have been received for the investigation results;
        three positive decisions concerning the issue of the patents and
        three claims are in the process of consideration. Three editions
        of the book "Water as a New Source of Energy" are available with
        the detailed theoretical description of plasma electrolysis of
        water and the quantitative calculations of the experimental
        results. </p>
      <p>The author of these elaborations was invited to deliver a
        lecture concerning this problem at the European congress on "New
        Hydrogen Technologies and Space Drives", which took place on
        June 23-24 in Weinfelden near Zürich. </p>
      <p>As the author has kept walking along the corridors of the
        Russian power without success for five years in order to get
        financing, the last hope remains – to find a foreign investor.
        The author is busy with this problem as it is clear that a delay
        in financing is equal to a loss of priority in this topical
        field of investigations, which solves two global problems of the
        mankind: the energy problem and the environmental problem. </p>

        <b>EXPERT&nbsp; RESOLUTION ON&nbsp; SCIENTIFIC&nbsp;
          INVESTIGATION&nbsp; RESULTS</b> <br>
        <b>of&nbsp; Professor Philipp M. Kanarev, head of the Chair of
          Theoretical Mechanics of the Kuban State Agrarian University</b></center>
      <p><b>1. ESSENCE OF RESULTS OF THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>The results of theoretical investigations of Professor Ph.M.
        Kanarev are based on a new axiomatics of exact sciences
        formulated and presented by him. Due to this fact, some of his
        scientific results do not match a number of acknowledged modern
        physical and chemical theories, with the special theory of
        relativity by A. Einstein and the theory of orbital movement of
        the electrons in the atoms, in particular. It is natural,
        because the above-mentioned theories have been worked out
        without taking into consideration the actual existing fact of
        space - matter - time unity, which is axiomatic, and due to this
        fact it should be taken into consideration when any mathematical
        theory is worked out. But it has not taken place, because prior
        to Ph.M. Kanarev nobody has given an axiomatic significance to
        the actually existing basic fact of space - matter - time unity.
      </p>
      <p>Minkovsky was the first to pay attention to space - time unity.
        But he neglected the fact that not only space and time&nbsp; are
        inseparable, but matter is inseparable with space and time.
        Ph.M. Kanarev paid attention to this fact and formulated an
        axiom of space - matter - time unity. When he did it, his axiom
        began to play the role of a criterion when checking a bond of
        mathematical models of various theories with reality at once. </p>
      <p>The analysis of Lorentz’s transformations within the framework
        of the axiom of space - matter - time unity carried out by the
        author has demonstrated groundlessness of the universally
        recognized interpretation of these transformations and lack of
        the consequences of these transformations, which are a
        foundation of the special theory of relativity of A. Einstein. </p>
      <p>Having formulated the axiom of space - matter - time unity,
        Ph.M. Kanarev has given interesting patterns of its
        implementation in the solution of serious problems of modern
        physics. In particular, it concerns the analysis of correctness
        of substantiation of Lorentz’s transformations as an initial
        base of the principle of relativity of A. Einstein. He has shown
        discrepancy of such mathematical transformations to the actual
        events of the physical nature. </p>
      <p>In his scientific works, Ph.M. Kanarev has demonstrated not
        once that the axiom of space - matter - time unity introduced by
        him does not allow false notions concerning the essence of the
        phenomena. </p>
      <p>The axiom of space - matter - time unity has allowed the author
        to find electromagnetic models of the photon and the electron
        from the existing mathematical models of classical physics.
        These results are undoubtedly new as far as the depth of
        validity and connection with the experimental factors are
        concerned. </p>
      <p>A discovery of the law, which governs&nbsp; the permanency
        of&nbsp; Planck’s constant, plays an important role on the
        scientific investigations of Ph.M. Kanarev. Planck constant has
        been known for one hundred years, and the reason of the
        permanency of this constant has been unknown for one hundred
        years. It is Professor Ph.M. Kanarev who has proved that the law
        of conservation of angular momentum governs the permanency of
        Planck constant. </p>
      <p>Dimensional method, which is well known in science, has led
        Ph.M. Kanarev to a conclusion that Max Planck constant, which
        has dimensionality of angular momentum, is vector quantity. It
        follows from this that the photon and the electron have a form
        of rotating rings. Deep analysis of the existing mathematical
        models, which describe behaviour of the photon and the electron,
        has allowed Ph.M. Kanarev to discover their electromagnetic
        structures and to explain successfully their numerous discrepant
        features, which have remained incomprehensible from the point of
        view of modern physical theories. </p>
      <p>Thus, the axiom of space - matter - time unity is in the
        foundation of exact sciences in spite of the author. The
        scientific community has not paid attention to this fundamental
        fact, which puts Ph.M. Kanarev among the scientists, who have
        opened the fundamental law of the nature. </p>
      <p>Since the date of the discovery of the fact that the molecules
        consist of atoms till present time, neither physics, nor
        chemists have not been in the know of the mechanism of the
        formation of the atoms and the molecules. The electron is
        considered to form the orbital movement in the atom, but the
        way, in which it connects the atoms in the molecules, remains
        unknown. The thing has become clear after Ph.M. Kanarev has
        discovered the law of formation of the spectra of the atoms and
        the ions. It has turned out that there is no orbital component
        of the energy of the electron in the mathematical model of this
        law. A conclusion has been made at once that there is no orbital
        movement of the electron in the atom. And it has turned out here
        that the law of preservation of angular momentum governs the
        process of the formation of the atoms and the molecules. One can
        make a conclusion that the electrons precessing on the nuclei of
        the atoms connect them into molecules by means of their unlike
        magnetic poles. </p>
      <p>To my mind, on the basis of the concept of Ph.M. Kanarev it is
        easy to explain the origin, structure and features of Rydberg’s
        atoms and Rydberg’s substance, which has been discovered
        recently by the scientists of the Goetheborg University
        (Sweden). </p>
      <p>The new principle of the connection of the atoms in the
        molecules together with the law of the formation of the spectra
        of the atoms and ions have allowed the author to build the
        models of the atoms and the molecules of the first chemical
        elements, including the molecules of water, and to analyze in
        detail the processes of its fusion and dissociation. The
        contradictions of the modern theory of water electrolysis have
        been discovered at once, which have been not only eliminated
        with the help of his new theoretical results, but the author has
        determined that the fusion of the atoms and the molecules of
        hydrogen, not the cold nuclear fusion, is the source of
        additional energy during some modes of water electrolysis. </p>
      <p>The new theory of water electrolysis has allowed the author to
        calculate quantity of heat energy. The results of these
        theoretical investigations have been confirmed experimentally
        not only by the author and an independent commission, but by the
        scientists of USA and Japan. </p>
      <p>Ph.M. Kanarev has corrected a mistake made by Schwartzschild in
        deriving the formula for the calculation of the gravitation
        radius of the black hole and has worked out the new theory for
        the calculation of this radius as well as the theory of the
        contortion of the track of the movement of the photon by a
        gravitation field of the planets and the stars. This new theory
        is a significant contribution into astrophysics, and it will
        cause a revision of the existing astronomical notions. </p>
      <p>It is clear that the new theory has formulated many new
        questions. Here are some of them, which demand great attention
        and investigation. </p>
      <p>Why does the photon loose no energy when moving in the space? </p>
      <p>How does a complicated electromagnetic structure of the photon
        generate constant velocity of its movement? </p>
      <p>How is it possible to explain the multi-photon effect and a
        number of other last discoveries of physics on the basis of the
        new models of the electron and the photon? </p>
      <p>Why is the toroidal structure of the electron stable? </p>
      <p>Why do the changes of the energy state of the electron in the
        atom take place in the form of a jump? Why are they connected
        with integral numbers? </p>
      <p>What fact stipulates discreteness of energy spectrum of the
        atoms and the ions? </p>
      <p>Why do electron ionozation energies of the second electrons and
        the next electrons beginning from the nuclei of the atoms fail
        to be equal to their binding energies, which correspond to the
        first energy levels? </p>
      <p>How is it possible to sum up the proof of the increase of mass
        of the electron during the increase of its velocity for other
        variants of its interaction with electric field? </p>
      <p>How is it possible to substantiate the angular anisotropies of
        the electrons in the atoms and the atoms in the molecules? </p>
      <p><b>2. NOVELTY OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>The following significant results of the investigations carried
        out by Ph.M. Kanarev are the new ones: the axiom of space -
        matter - time unity; the proof of the vector’s properties of
        Planck constant and the cause of its constant; the law of the
        formation of the spectra of the atoms and the ions; the
        electromagnetic models of the photon and the electron; the model
        of the hydrogen atom, the principles of the formation of the
        atom and the molecules; the theory of water electrolysis; the
        deduction of the mathematical model of the law of irradiation of
        an absolutely black body from the laws of classical physics; the
        results of the experiments connected with obtaining additional
        energy during&nbsp; usual and plasma electrolysis of water;
        technical devices for obtaining heat energy, hydrogen and oxygen
        during plasma electrolysis of water; mathematical models for the
        calculation of the gravitational radius of the black hole and
        the contortion of the track of the movement of the photons by
        the gravitation fields of the stars and the planets. </p>
      <p><b>3. VALUE FOR SCIENCE AND PRACTICE</b> </p>
      <p>A new axiom is new foundation for exact sciences. That’s why
        the axiom of space - matter - time unity will play the same role
        in science as the Euclidean axioms play now. </p>
      <p>The law of the formation of the spectra of the atoms and ions
        will allow the physicists and chemists to regard the principle
        of the formation of the atom and the molecules from another
        point of view. In spite of the author’s will, this law together
        with vector properties of Planck constant will serve as a
        foundation for further development of theoretical chemistry. </p>
      <p>The method of the construction of the structures of the nuclei,
        the atoms and the molecules is an original one. It promises the
        new principles of the investigations of the features of the
        nature, which are developed on the basis of vector features of
        Planck constant, not only for the physicists, but the chemists
        as well. </p>
      <p>The new theory of water electrolysis opens its potential
        possibilities for the generation of additional heat energy,
        significantly reduces energy expenses for production of hydrogen
        from water and makes the main source of energy in future power
        industry. </p>
      <p>The new technical devices for heat energy as well as energy
        containing gases (hydrogen and oxygen) from water will be the
        prototypes of the future industrial power installations. Five
        patents have&nbsp; already been obtained for these devices. The
        use of water as a source of energy will solve many environmental
        problems in the scale of the planet. </p>
      <p><b>4. PUBLICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>Ph.M. Kanarev has published&nbsp; more than 180 scientific
        papers, including 15 brochures, three educational guides and 14
        books. Some of his scientific papers and books have been
        published abroad. The American Internet journal <i>Journal of
          Theoretics</i> (http://www.journaloftheoretics.com) has
        already accepted his five papers on physics to be published in
        the year of 2002. Now Ph.M. Kanarev writes the book “Classical
        quantum physics”, in which he is going to generalize the results
        of his theoretical and experimental investigations. </p>
      <p>This year Ph.M. Kanarev has got the invitations to the
        scientific seminars, conferences, symposia and congresses to
        USA, England, Germany, Switzerland and Russia. In June, 2001, he
        read lecture “Water as a Source of Energy” in Switzerland at the
        European congress “New Hydrogen Technologies and Space Drives” (
        http://Weinfelden.innoplaza.net&nbsp; ). </p>
      <p>It is from the above-mentioned facts that a number of the new
        scientific results and ideas of the author will be included into
        the future guides on physics, mechanics, chemistry, astronomy,
        philosophy and other sciences and will be developed in the
        scientific works of other scientists. </p>

        "Simplicity and 100% reproducibility of the experiments being

        water electric generator of heat... The main task of the
        experiment was to check the hypothesis: "Electrodynamic
        influence on the water molecules gives the possibility to reduce
        energy expenses on destruction of their chemical bonds
        significantly; further fusion of these molecules increases
        considerably the output of additional energy in the form of
        heat... In order to solve this task, special experiments were
        carried out connected with electrodynamic destruction of
        chemical bonds of water molecules with electric pulses of
        various frequencies. </p>

        107; Tables: 48; physical and chemical equations: 315) </p>
      <p>The new axiomatics of natural sciences is given in the book; on
        its basis, quantum physics and quantum chemistry have been
        returned to the classical way of development. The first steps
        are made on this way, which have led to discovery of the
        structure of the photon, the electron, and the principle of the
        formation of the atomic nuclei, the atoms and the molecules. </p>
      <p>The Planck's Law of radiation of perfect blackbody is given on
        the basis of classical concepts, and the connection of quantum
        phenomena with the laws of classical physics is proved. </p>
      <p>The application of the new theoretical results to the solution
        of practical energy tasks on the basis of plasma electrolysis of
        water is shown. Due to this electrolysis, additional heat energy
        generated as well as hydrogen and oxygen are the energy
        containing gases. Cold Nuclear transmutation of the atomic
        nuclei of alkaline metals and the atomic nuclei of the cathode
        material takes place during plasma electrolysis of water. </p>
      <p>The book is intended for physicists, chemists and other
        specialists who are seeking the new directions for understanding
        the foundations of the microworld and the new energy sources. </p>

      <p>"The following was received by email from Prof. Kanarev" [ to
        Sterling Allen ( May 6, 2006 ) ]: --- </p>
      <p>"If you wish to reproduce quickly my experiment on lowcurrent
        electrolysis of water I am ready to consult you. Cost of
        videofilm and the information necessary for manufacturing of
        labo-ratory model electrolyser, its start in work and reception
        of necessary results - $2000. </p>
      <p>"If you agree, transfer on my account in the beginning $1000
        and I send to you videofilm by duration one minute. If after
        viewing film you decide will make and to test laboratory model
        electrolyser after transfer still $1000 I send to you parameters
        of cells and other information. After manufacturing model and
        the beginning of tests I shall give you recommendations on
        structure of a solution and modes of start electrolyser. The
        duration of the video is one minute. </p>
      <p>"Videofilm: Low Current Electrolysis of Water </p>
      <p>"The text on a course of film in Russian. A reference point
        after time shown by a video-camera. The duration of Video is one
        minits. </p>
      <p>"The beginning: "Water --- a new energy source" </p>
      <p>"9-57 --- Pay attention, on the right two light wires go from
        the power supply to a cell. Now they will be switched - off, and
        process of an output of gases will proceed. </p>
      <p>"10-18 --- Has passed twenty minutes from the moment of
        switching-off of the power supply, but the output of gases
        proceeds. </p>
      <p>"10-31 --- The power supply is included </p>
      <p>"The additional information: At a continuous feed electrolysis
        the power consumption on reception of hydrogen from water makes
        1,5-2,0 Wh/liter. If a feed periodically to disconnect, it is
        possible to reduce a power consumption by reception of hydrogen
        up to 0,5-1,0 Wh/liter and is more significant. After
        switching-off of the power supply process of an output of gases
        proceeds some hours. </p>

      <p>"Dr. Philipp Kanarev, chairman of Kuban State Agrarian
        University’s Department of Theoretical Mechanics, Krasnodar,
        Russia, developed a method of water plasma electrolysis that he
        sees as the best way to get cheap hydrogen from water. He tells
        why his 1987 report on it didn’t reach news media nor the open
        literature about patents. Since his device was developed “at the
        enterprise of the military industrial complex”, his certificate
        of invention was stamped “for service use only” and its content
        was not published openly. </p>
      <p>"At that time, the focus was on purifying and disinfecting
        water with the help of the plasma in his reactor. Two years
        later Drs. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann announced they
        had excess energy output during a type of electrolysis. This
        renewed research efforts behind the former Iron Curtain as well
        as in the West. In 1996 one of Kanarev’s co-authors on the 1987
        certificate published results on the excess energy output from
        the plasma process. The next year they applied for a patent.
        Then a full group of Russian scientists tested the device and
        documented its output. Technical people can read more about
        Kanarev’s theory in his books, such as <i>Crisis of Theoretical
          Physics</i>. Results of the plasma-electrolytic experiments
        were predicted by the theory."<br>
