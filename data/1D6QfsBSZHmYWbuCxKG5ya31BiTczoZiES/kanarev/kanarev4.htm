          <p><b>LOW CURRENT PROCESS OF WATER ELECTROLYSIS</b> </p>

        <p align="left">Low voltage process of water electrolysis is
          known from Faraday’s times. It is widely used in modern
          industry. Voltage of 1.6-2.3 volts is operation voltage
          between the anode and the cathode of the electrolyzer; current
          strength is tens and hundreds of amperes. In accordance with
          Faraday’s law, energy consumption for production of one cubic
          meter of hydrogen is nearly 4 kWh&nbsp; in this case. </p>
        <p align="left">The analysis of the water molecule structure
          (Fig. 1) worked out by us shows the possibility of water
          electrolysis at minimal current and even without it. The
          protons of the hydrogen atoms in water molecules can be
          combined with each other and can form clusters. As a result,
          an orthohydrogen molecule is formed (Fig. 2). A question
          arises: is it possible to separate this molecule from such
          cluster? A search of the answer to this question has lasted
          nearly three years. Its results are given in Tables 1, 2 and
          3. </p>

        <p align="left">It is known that a gram-atom is equal to atomic
          mass of substance; a grammolecule is equal to molecular mass
          of substance. For example, the grammolecule of hydrogen in the
          water molecule is equal to two grams; the gram-atom of the
          oxygen atom is 16 grams. The grammolecule of water is equal to
          18 grams. Hydrogen mass in a water molecule is 2 x 100 / 18 =
          11.11%; oxygen mass is 16 x 100 / 18 = 88.89 %; this ratio of
          hydrogen and oxygen is in one liter of water. It means that
          111.11 grams of hydrogen and 888.89 grams of oxygen are in
          1000 grams of water. </p>
        <p align="left">One liter of hydrogen weighs 0.09 g; one liter
          of oxygen weighs 1.47 g. It means that it is possible to
          produce 111.11 / 0.09 = 1234.44 liters of hydrogen and 888.89
          / 1.47 = 604.69 liters of oxygen from one liter of water. It
          appears from this that one gram of water contains 1.23 liters
          of hydrogen. Energy consumption for production of 1000 liters
          of hydrogen is 4 kWh and for one liter 4 Wh. As it is possible
          to produce 1.234 liters of hydrogen from one gram of water,
          1.234 x 4 = 4.94 Wh is spent for hydrogen production from one
          gram of water now. </p>

          are given when frequency of nearly 500 Hz has been generated
          in the power supply </p>
        <p align="left">First of all, we should note that the anode and
          the cathode are made of one and the same material: steel. It
          excludes the possibility of formation of a galvanic cell. If
          we analyze Tables 1, 2 and 3, we’ll see the electrolysis
          process takes place at very low current of 0.02 A; that’s why
          it has been called low current one. Further, this process
          consisted of two cycles in some experiments; in one cycle, the
          electrolyzer is connected to the power line; in another cycle,
          it is disconnected. </p>
        <p align="left">Gas generation process is manifested by release
          of the bubbles being formed. The bubbles go on being released
          after the electrolyzer is disconnected from the supply line
          (Tables 2 and 3). When the electrolyzer is de-energized, gas
          release intensity is reduced, but it is not stopped during
          many hours. It is proved by the fact that electrolysis takes
          place at the expense of potential difference on the
          electrodes. It should be noted that small potential difference
          takes place on the electrodes of the empty electrolyzer and
          immediately after it has been charged with electrolyte prior
          to its connection to the supply line. </p>
        <p align="left">If water electrolysis took place only at the
          expense of the electrons emitted by the cathode, i.e.
          according to Faraday’s law, current value would be greater and
          the stock of these electrons would give out after the
          electrolyzer was de-energized and the gas release process
          would be stopped. </p>
        <p align="left">After electrolyzer de-energizing, gas release
          during a long period of time proves the fact that the
          molecules of oxygen and hydrogen are formed without the
          electrons emitted by the cathode, i.e. at the expense of the
          electrons of the water molecule itself. Let us analyze this
          process&nbsp; in detail. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Fig. 4. Diagram of low current electrolysis
            process</b> </p>

        <p align="left">In Fig. 4, the anode is shown leftward and the
          cathode is shown rightward. The proton of the hydrogen atom in
          water molecule is oriented to the cathode; another proton of
          this molecule is connected with the proton of the ion
          OH`&nbsp; (leftward). As a result,&nbsp; a cluster chain is
          formed; rightward, the water molecule H2O is situated;
          leftward, the ion OH`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is situated (Fig. 4,
          a); the orthohydrogen molecule H2 is in the center (Fig. 4, a,
          b). Both protons of the hydrogen molecule are connected by
          energy 0.485 eV corresponding to water molecule cluster
          formation energy at the temperature of 20°C. Binding energies
          of the left electron of the hydrogen molecule with the
          electron of the oxygen atom and the right electron with the
          electron of the ion OH`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are equal to 0.74 eV
          (Fig. 1). </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, the complex cluster chains with strict
          orientation between the anode and the cathode are formed in
          the electrolytic solution under the influence of the
          electrostatic field. </p>
        <p align="left">Let us pay attention to the fact that the axis
          electron of the oxygen atom&nbsp; and its six ring electrons
          of the ion OH`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are attracted to the anode
          simultaneously (Fig. 4, a). Electrostatic forces attracting
          six ring electrons to the anode deform the electrostatic field
          in such a way that the axis electron comes to the nucleus of
          the oxygen atom, and six ring electrons withdraw from the
          atomic nucleus. As the electron withdrawal process from the
          atomic nucleus is an endothermic one, six ring electrons
          absorb 1.18 eV x 6 = 7.08 eV (s. Fig. 5). It will
          automatically transform both axis electrons of the oxygen atom
          to the energy levels corresponding the excited state of the
          oxygen atom. Energy absorbed by the ring electrons of two
          atoms of oxygen is 7.08 x 2 = 14.16 eV. </p>

        <p align="left">When two oxygen atoms have been separated from
          two cluster chains, their two axis electrons form a covalent
          bond releasing 5.13 eV of energy (s. Fig. 5). Other two
          electrons of the oxygen atoms arranged at the ends of the axis
          of the molecule O2 will go to the energy levels with binding
          energies of 2.56 eV having emitted (2.56-0.74) x 2 = 6.92 eV.
        </p>
        <p align="left">Hydrogen molecule fusion energy is
          (4.53-0.485-1.48x2)=1.085 eV taking into consideration a
          binding energy change between its protons and electrons (Fig.
          4) and conversion of orthohydrogen into parahydrogen. Fusion
          energy of two molecules of parahydrogen is 1.085 x 2 = 2.170
          eV. As a result, total energy of fusion of one oxygen molecule
          and two hydrogen molecule is (5.13+6.92+2.170)=14.22 eV. </p>
        <p align="left">Difference between absorbed energy and emitted
          energy will be (14.22-14.16)=0.06 eV. This is exothermic
          energy. If we take into account that nearly 0.5 liter of
          hydrogen has been released during the experiment, thermal
          energy should be generated. </p>

        <p align="left">The experiment has shown that when the
          electrolyzer is energized, solution temperature is increased
          by 1.5-2°C. When the electrolyzer is de-energized and the
          electrolysis process goes on, solution temperature is reduced.
          When the electrolyzer is de-energized, potential on the
          electrodes is reduced gradually. It means that the initial
          stock of the electrons on the cathode is reduced as well. It
          takes place due to restoration of the ions of an alkaline
          metal. When the ions are restored, they take electrons from
          the cathode and reduce potential between the electrodes. It is
          manifested by cathode surface color. It acquires color of the
          alkaline metal being used. </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, low ampere electrolyzer can operate in two
          modes: connected to the supply line and disconnected from it.
          When the electrolyzer is connected to the supply line, a part
          of gases is released using the electrons of the cathode, and a
          part is released without the use of these electrons. When the
          electrolyzer is disconnected from the supply line, the cathode
          electrons are spent for restoration of alkaline metals. </p>
        <p align="left">In Fig. 4, a, the boundaries of the hydrogen
          peroxide molecule H2O2 are shown in the cluster chain (Fig.
          6). It is clear (Fig, 4) that the hydrogen peroxide molecule
          is released only when a hydrogen atom being in contact with
          the cathode is released from the cluster chain. It takes place
          when voltage is increased. Hydrogen peroxide is released and
          interacts with the anode material; if it is iron, foam with
          red flakes is formed at once. Foam is an apparent feature of
          spontaneous gas release process disturbance. </p>

        <p align="left">Involuntarily, the results being obtained form
          an aspiration to find an analogy of the described low ampere
          process of water electrolysis in Nature. </p>
        <p align="left">It is known that carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>
          is absorbed during photosynthesis. It is considered that
          carbon C of the molecule CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; is used for
          plant cell construction, and oxygen O<sub>2</sub> is released.
          Now we have every reason to doubt at it and to suppose that
          the molecule CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; is used totally for plant
          cell construction. Water molecules release oxygen; the
          hydrogen atoms of water molecules are used as connecting links
          of the molecules, from which the plant cells are constructed.
          This process is similar to the process shown in Fig. 4. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Simplicity and 100% reproducibility of the
          experiments being described afford ground for the fact that
          mankind has got a chance to avoid energy famine and
          environmental crisis. </p>
