        <i>Abstract ~P</i>hysicochemical technology of generation of
        heat, hydrogen and oxygen. SUBSTANCE: gear has frame with axial
        hole and cylindrical-conical boss and lower cover which form
        jointly with frame interelectrode chamber including
        intercommunicating anode and cathode spaces. Circular anode with
        hole is positioned in anode space and rod cathode in put into
        dielectric rod which is brought into interelectrode chamber
        through threaded hole in lower cover. It enables working part of
        cathode to be centered relative to hole in refractory metal
        bushing put through axial hole of frame. Diameter of hole in
        bushing is less than diameter of cathode. Branch pipe to feed
        working solution is located in anode chamber, branch pipes to
        release oxygen are brought to upper part of anode space, branch
        pipes to release hydrogen are brought to upper part of cathode
        space and branch pipe to remove steam and gas mixture is
        installed in axial hole of frame. Given gear makes it feasible
        to generate thermal energy by heating of solution with the use
        of plasma and to produce simultaneously hydrogen and oxygen by
        way of electrolytic and thermal decomposition of water. EFFECT:
        raised efficiency of gear. </p>
