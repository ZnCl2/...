      <p>EVERY day, tonnes of uncooked meat in our supermarkets,
        restaurants and hotels are destroyed before reaching their
        recommended shelf life. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Sebestian Chua (left) and his brother, DrRichard Chua, hope
        the EsmoSphere will add another level of protection over food
        storage. -- Picture: KELVIN CHNG </p>
      <p>Even with refrigeration, meat still spoils easily because the
        temperature is not always consistent and has to be thrown away.
      </p>
      <p>Last year alone, almost half-a-million tonnes of food waste
        were incinerated. </p>
      <p>Now, thanks to a local company, Esmo Technologies, the amount
        of spoiled raw meat can be cut by about a third, simply by
        placing a specially modified magnet next to it in the
        refrigerator. </p>
      <p>It also helps preserve other foodstuff. </p>
      <p>The palm-sized magnet, called an EsmoSphere, is a world-first
        invention by Dr Richard Chua, 42, who has filed for patents both
        locally and internationally. </p>
      <p>In response to his application, the International Searching
        Authority's official written opinion said that his use of
        magnetism to control dehydration rates in food are considered
        'novel' and 'inventive' as no other invention has the same
        claims. </p>
      <p>Dr Chua worked for 12 years as an industrial research engineer
        before going back to Nanyang Technological University for his
        doctorate research. </p>
      <p>He delved into the little-known field of bio-magnetics, which
        looks at how magnetic fields influence biological processes. </p>
      <p>After discovering new techniques of energising magnets and
        understanding how cells respond to magnetic energy, he set up
        Esmo Technologies in 2004 with three of his siblings. </p>
      <p>Dr Chua said: 'Throwing away food is a waste of resources and
        energy. To maintain food freshness, refrigeration is presently
        the most used method, but there's always dehydration. </p>
      <p>'Also, because it's not possible to ensure that food is kept at
        constant low temperatures throughout the supply chain, freshness
        will be affected during packaging and transportation.' </p>
      <p><b>EXTRA PROTECTION </b></p>
      <p>Although fridges have features to reduce odours or bacteria
        through improved air circulation, these are not effective to
        preserve freshness of meat because meat is often wrapped in
        plastic. </p>
      <p>When plenty of food is stored together, the food will
        deteriorate even faster, Dr Chua said. </p>
      <p>With the EsmoSphere, refrigerated food can remain fresh because
        the magnet emits a dome-shaped magnetic field (see graphics at
        right) that strengthens the bonds between water molecules in the
        food. </p>
      <p>With stronger bonds, water loss is reduced, so raw meat which
        is placed within the EsmoSphere's protection zone does not
        become dehydrated. </p>
      <p>The EsmoSphere's magnetism also delays bacterial growth and
        slows down oxidation, which causes discoloration. </p>
      <p>The EsmoSphere, which comes in different sizes and costs
        between $40 and $80, does not require an electrical source and
        its magnetic field remains effective for three years. </p>
      <p>Dr Chua, who uses it in his fridge, said: 'Some of our clients
        were concerned at first about the strength of the magnets, but
        we assured them that it conforms to World Health Organisation's
        safety guidelines. </p>
      <p>'The EsmoSphere's magnetic strength is like that of a fridge
        magnet or handbag with a magnetic catch.' </p>
      <p>One of Dr Chua's most enthusiastic clients is Indoguna, which
        supplies food to Singapore's major supermarkets such as NTUC
        FairPrice, Cold Storage and Carrefour, as well as many five-star
        hotels here, like Grand Hyatt, Marina Mandarin and Shangri-La. </p>
      <p>In a supermarket trial conducted over three months from the end
        of last year to early this year, the EsmoSphere helped save an
        average of a few thousand dollars per outlet. </p>
      <p>Meat remained fresh for three days, which is the recommended
        shelf life. Before the EsmoSphere was used, meat had to be
        thrown after just two days. </p>
      <p>In addition, 40 per cent less seafood was thrown away. </p>
      <p>Mr Bryan Chia, sales executive for Indoguna, told The New
        Paper: 'We feel that Dr Chua's invention is a very good idea. </p>
      <p>'We emphasise quality and freshness so the EsmoSphere adds
        another level of protection over our food supplies.' </p>
      <p>Indoguna worked with Esmo Technologies to modify the EsmoSphere
        design. The earlier model was a large tray but the newer model
        is lighter and more portable. </p>
      <p>Dr Chua's brother, Sebestian, 39, who is head of production,
        said: 'We're continually researching on how to improve the
        products. </p>
      <p>'It's exciting because very few people know how to work with
        such technologies and materials.' </p>
      <p>He added that the EsmoSphere is especially useful during new
        year celebrations, when there tends to be a lot of extra food. </p>
      <p>Mr Chua said: 'Even if the fridge breaks down, the food can
        remain fresh.' </p>

      During our last meeting, Mr Ngiam mentioned to us about this
      company called the Esmo Technologies. Basically, this company
      specialises in food preservation and energy conservation, through
      reducing wastages and increase profitability.<br>
      <br>
      To our interest, the company has developed a bio-foodsphere that
      is able to preserve food and increase the shelf-life of food:<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      I believe that this technology can help us greatly in our ninja
      van business as it will help to keep our food fresh for longer
      hours (quality of food is guaranteed), cut wastage costs in the
      long run and can help to improve our reputation (which I believe
      is important for any F&amp;B business, but this can be subjective
      I guess)<br>
      <br>
      Further analysis of the food sphere:<br>
      <br>
      The food sphere is available with the largest shape of 24inches
      (about 0.6m) and has an effective range of probably three times
      its range from the diagrams (about 70 inches which is
      approximately 1.8m wide!) Placing one or two of these biospheres
      in the van will definitely increase the shelf-life of our food.<br>
      <br>
      The price of the food sphere also need to be considered! But I
      think there's some problems over its website, can't access the
      rest of its sectors. What a bad timing, seems like the website is
      temporarily not available for the moment so I guess I'll try again
      tomorrow morning. <br>

      A device for treating perishable objects or liquids and a method
      of fabricating the device. The method comprising breaking a single
      piece of magnetic material into a plurality of pieces; inhibiting
      movement of the pieces with respect to each other during the
      breaking of the magnetic material; and forming a magnetic
      structure comprising the plurality of pieces of the magnetic
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates broadly to a device for
      treating perishable objects or liquids and a method of fabricating
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Generally, perishable objects such as raw seafood, poultry,
      meats and dairy products deteriorate with time. One important
      factor affecting the rate of deterioration is water activity.
      Water activity affects the shelf life, safety, texture, flavour
      and smell of foods, as well as the stability of pharmaceuticals
      and cosmetics. In addition, water activity affects the activity of
      enzymes and vitamins in foods and the denaturing of fats and
      proteins, which in turn affects the colour, taste, and aroma of
      foods.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The water activity is a measure of the energy state of the
      water in a system. Some factors that affect water activity are
      water binding strength, dissociation of water, and solubility of
      solutes in water. Water activity also determines the lower limit
      of availability for microbial growth. The lower the water activity
      is or the higher the water binding strength is, the slower the
      deterioration of the food quality and bacteria growth is.
      Therefore, it is important to treat the perishable objects and the
      liquids to prolong the shelf life.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] There are various known methods and devices to treat the
      perishable objects (e.g. cooked food, beverages, raw meat, etc.),
      to keep the perishable objects fresh. Some conventional devices
      utilise static magnetic fields to treat a perishable object, such
      as raw food and alcoholic beverage. These known devices typically
      use an array of permanent magnets that are arranged on a flat
      plane surface to perpendicularly project a magnetic field towards
      the object to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Some conventional devices utilise magnetic fields created
      by magnetic interference to treat perishable objects. Similarly,
      these known devices typically comprise a plurality of magnets
      arranged in a panel such that a magnetic field created by magnetic
      interference projects from the panel.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] To treat a large object, such known devices may comprise
      several planes/panels of magnets and/or a large number of magnets
      in order to project a magnetic field that extends sufficiently to
      cover the object to be treated. However, having several
      planes/panels of magnets and/or a large number of magnets not only
      increases the weight and bulk of the device, the cost of
      manufacturing the device also increases. These disadvantages make
      the known devices not practical for commercial applications.
      Further, for a given size and weight, the magnetic field generated
      by the known devices may not be strong enough to effectively treat
      the perishable objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Therefore, there exists a need to provide a device for
      treating perishable objects or liquids and method of fabricating
      the device to address or overcome at least one of the above
      problems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention,
      there is provided a method of fabricating a device for treating
      perishable objects or liquids, the method comprising: breaking a
      single piece of magnetic material into a plurality of pieces;
      inhibiting movement of the pieces with respect to each other
      during the breaking of the magnetic material; and forming a
      magnetic structure comprising the pieces of the magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Inhibiting movement of the pieces may comprise providing a
      fixture element on the magnetic material prior to breaking the
      magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The fixture element may comprise at least one adhesive
      sheet attached along at least one surface of the magnetic
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The fixture element may comprise two adhesive sheets
      attached along opposing surfaces of the magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The adhesive sheet may be an elastic plastic sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The elastic plastic sheet may be wound around the opposing
      surfaces of the magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The method may further comprise: forming the magnetic
      structure into a desired shape while substantially maintaining a
      relative position of the pieces of the magnetic material with
      respect to each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The pieces of the magnetic material may be initially
      unpolarized and may be magnetically polarized after the desired
      shape of the magnetic structure is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Forming the magnetic structure into the desired shape may
      comprise: providing a support having a profile with the desired
      shape; attaching the magnetic structure to the support such that a
      shape of the magnetic structure conforms to the shape of the
      profile.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Attaching the magnetic structure to the support may
      comprise wrapping the magnetic structure against the support with
      an adhesive sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The desired shape of the magnetic structure may be
      dome-shaped or arc-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The magnetic structure may be substantially globe-shaped
      and may comprise two dome-shaped or arc-shaped magnetic structures
      having opposite polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The magnetic structure may be substantially planar.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The magnetic structure may comprise at least two
      dome-shaped or arc-shaped magnetic structures having a same
      polarity stacked on one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The method may further comprise providing a shield element
      for shielding a north pole side or a south pole side of the
      magnetic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The shield element may comprise at least one auxiliary
      magnet formed of a single piece of magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The auxiliary magnet may be a permanent magnet or may
      comprise magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The method may further comprise: disposing a plurality of
      the magnetic structures on a non-planar support structure of a
      desired shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The support structure may be dome-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The method may further comprise providing an additional
      shield element on a concave side of the support structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The additional shield element may be made from metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The additional shield element may comprise a single piece
      of magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The method may further comprise encapsulating the device in
      plastic resins or in a plastic casing.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In accordance with a second aspect of the present
      invention, there is provided a device for treating perishable
      objects or liquids, the device comprising: a plurality of pieces
      formed from a single piece of magnetic material wherein movement
      of the pieces of the magnetic material with respect to each other
      is inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The device may further comprise a fixture element in
      contact with the pieces of the magnetic materials for inhibiting
      movement of the pieces with respect to each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The fixture element may comprise at least one adhesive
      sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The fixture element may comprise two adhesive sheets
      attached along opposing surfaces of the magnet elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The adhesive sheet may be an elastic plastic sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The elastic sheet may be wound around the opposing surfaces
      of the magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The magnet elements may form a substantially planar
      magnetic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The pieces of the magnetic material may form a dome-shaped
      or arc-shaped magnetic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] At least two dome-shaped or arc-shaped magnetic structures
      having a same polarity may be stacked on one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Two dome-shaped or arc-shaped magnetic structures may form
      a substantially globe-shaped magnetic structure, the two
      dome-shaped or arc-shaped magnetic structures having opposite
      polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The device may further comprise a support having a profile
      with a desired shape, wherein the magnetic structure is attached
      to the support to conform a shape of the magnetic structure to the
      shape of the profile.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The magnetic structure may be attached to the support with
      an adhesive sheet that wraps the magnetic structure against the
      profile of the support.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The desired shape may be an arc-shape or a dome-shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The support may be made of plastic.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The device may further comprise a shield element for

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0092] A schematic drawing of a portion of a device 100 for
      treating perishable objects, is shown in FIG. 1(a). The relative,
      dimensions of the various features of the device 100 have been
      exaggerated for illustration purposes. The device 100 generally
      comprises a magnetic structure 102 comprising a plurality of
      magnet elements 104 formed from a single piece of magnetic
      material (not shown) and movement of the magnet elements 104 with
      respect to each other is inhibited. The plurality of magnet
      elements 104 are spaced adjacent each other with a gap 106
      defining a boundary 108 between adjoining magnet elements 104 to
      produce a magnetic field created by magnetic interference of the
      magnet elements 104. The size of the gap 106 between the magnet
      elements 104 can range from about 0.05 mm to about 3.00 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The magnetic field created by magnetic interference can be
      directed onto a perishable object (not shown) to treat the
      perishable object. Magnetic interference of the magnet elements
      104 enhances the strength of the magnetic field projected from the
      plurality of magnet elements 104. Therefore, the greater the
      intensity of the magnetic interference, the greater the
      enhancement of the magnetic field strength. To treat the
      perishable object, the magnetic field created by magnetic
      interference of the magnet elements 104 is directed upon the
      object to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] A schematic drawing of a cross-section of the device 100 in
      FIG. 1(a) along a line A-A is shown in FIG. 1(b). An auxiliary
      magnet 110 is disposed on one side of the magnet elements 104 of
      the magnetic structure 102. The auxiliary magnet 110 helps to
      further increase an overall magnetic flux density of the magnetic
      field projected from the device 100 and also helps to further
      increase the intensity of magnetic interference created at the
      gaps 106 between the magnet elements 104. As the auxiliary magnet
      110 is a single piece of magnetic structure, there is no magnetic
      interference emitted from the auxiliary magnet 110. As a result,
      the auxiliary magnet 110 acts as a shield element to substantially
      shield a magnetic interference field projected from the side of
      the magnet elements 104 facing the auxiliary magnet 110 from being
      emitted. The auxiliary magnet 110 can be in the form of a single
      piece of permanent magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The magnetic material for forming the magnetic structure
      102 and the auxiliary magnet 110 can be made of materials
      comprising, for example, ferrite, ceramics, samarium cobalt, or
      neodymium. The magnetic materials can either be polarized to the
      desired polarity before the magnetic structure 102 is formed or
      after the magnetic structure 102 is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The intensity of magnetic interference created between the
      magnet elements 106 depends on several factors and can be
      generally represented by the following equation (i.e. Equation 1):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Intensity of magnetic
      interference=f(B1&lt;2&gt;,B2&lt;2&gt;,L,g&lt;-2&gt;,D&lt;-2&gt;)
      (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where<br>
      <br>
      [0097] B1 is the average magnetic flux density of the magnet
      elements (gauss);<br>
      <br>
      [0098] B2 is the magnetic flux density of the auxiliary magnet
      (gauss);<br>
      <br>
      [0099] L is the total length of the boundary between the magnet
      elements (m);<br>
      <br>
      [0100] g is the average gap distance between the magnet elements
      (m), where g&lt;&gt;0; and<br>
      <br>
      [0101] D is the perpendicular distance from a surface plane of the
      magnet elements (m).<br>
      <br>
      [0102] From the above equation, it is observed that at a given
      perpendicular distance (D) from a surface plane of the magnet
      elements, the intensity of magnetic interference is proportional
      to the length of the boundary between the magnet elements (L) and
      the square of the average magnetic flux density (B1) of the magnet
      elements and the square of the magnetic flux density (B2) of the
      auxiliary magnet. However, the intensity of magnetic interference
      is inversely proportional to the square of the average gap (g)
      distance between the magnet elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Further, since the influence of the magnetic interference
      on the object to be treated (i.e. treatment effect) depends on the
      intensity of the magnetic interference whereby the more intense
      the magnetic interference (and therefore, the greater the strength
      of the magnetic field created by the magnetic interference), the
      greater the influence of the magnetic interference has on the
      object to be treated. Therefore, the above parameters, B1, B2, L,
      g, and D, are also factors affecting the treatment effect on the
      perishable objects (i.e. treatment effect=f (B1&lt;2&gt;,
      B2&lt;2&gt;, L, g&lt;-2&gt;, D&lt;-2&gt;)).<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Schematic drawings of a method of fabricating a device 212
      are shown in FIGS. 2(a) to 2(b). A fixture element in the form of
      two adhesive sheets 202 is attached onto a single piece of
      magnetic material 200. The piece of magnetic material 200 is
      disposed between the two adhesive sheets 202, as shown in FIG.
      2(a). The adhesive sheets 202 are attached along opposing surfaces
      201, 203 of the magnetic material 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The adhesive sheets 202 can comprise clear elastic adhesive
      sheets which are stretched and wound around the opposing surfaces
      201, 203 of the magnetic material 200, thereby binding the
      magnetic material 200. As a result a compressive force is exerted
      on the magnetic material 200. However, it will be appreciated that
      other types of fixture elements can be used, as long as movement
      of the magnet elements 206 with respect to each other is
      inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] A punch 204 is used to physically break the piece of
      magnetic material 200 into a plurality of smaller pieces of
      adjoining magnet elements 206, as shown in FIG. 2(b). The punch
      204 comprises a plurality of protrusions 203 on a leading surface
      205. The punch 204 is advanced towards the magnetic material 200
      and applies a force onto the magnetic material 200 to break the
      magnetic material 200 into the plurality of adjoining magnet
      elements 206. The punch 204 is retracted after the piece of
      magnetic material 200 is broken. Therefore, a magnetic structure
      208 comprising the plurality of adjoining magnet elements 206 is
      obtained. Movement of the magnet elements 206 with respect to each
      other during the breaking of the magnetic material 200 is
      inhibited by the adhesive sheets 202 wound around the piece of
      magnetic material 200. The magnetic structure 208 of FIG. 2(b) is
      generally similar to the magnetic structure 100 of FIG. 1. The
      magnetic structure 208 is rectangular in shape and is generally
      planar. It will be appreciated that the magnetic structure 208 can
      be of other shapes, e.g. square, circular, etc., depending on
      design requirements. Further, it will be appreciated that instead
      of having protrusions 203 on the leading surface, the punch 204
      can have other geometries and configurations, as long as the punch
      can break the magnetic material 200 into a plurality of magnet
      elements 206.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The adhesive sheets 202 serve to inhibit movement of the
      magnet elements 206 with respect to each other by exerting a
      compressive force on the magnetic structure 208 to hold the magnet
      elements 206 in place with respect to each other, against any
      repulsive forces between the magnet elements 206. The magnet
      elements 206 are spaced adjacent to each other with a separation
      gap defining a boundary 207 between adjoining magnet elements 206
      to produce a magnetic field created by magnetic interference of
      the magnets. Further, the adhesive sheets 202 should be
      sufficiently deformable such that the adhesive sheets 202 are not
      broken when force is applied by the punch 204 to break the piece
      of magnetic material 200. The adhesive sheets 202 can be, for
      example, cellophane tape or polyethylene tape. In the above
      description, two adhesive sheets 202 are used, however, it will be
      appreciated that a single adhesive sheet attached along at least
      one surface of the piece of magnetic material 200 as long as the
      plurality of magnet elements 206 can be held securely such that
      relative movement of the magnet elements 206 is inhibited, thereby
      maintaining small gaps between the adjoining magnet elements 206.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] By keeping the plurality of magnet elements 206 adjacent to
      each other with small gaps between adjoining magnet elements 206,
      the magnetic interference created by the adjoining magnet elements
      206 is intensified. Referring to Equation 1 (and assuming that all
      other factors, B1, B2, L and D are kept constant) it is observed
      that when the gap distance between adjoining magnet elements 206
      is decreased, the intensity of the magnetic interference is
      increased as the magnetic interference intensity is inversely
      proportional to the square of the gap distance (g). Therefore, the
      gap distance between adjoining magnet elements 206 should be
      maintained as small as possible to achieve magnetic interference
      of a greater intensity.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Conventionally, due to repulsive forces between magnets, it
      is difficult to assemble or keep two magnets very close to one
      another, especially where high strength magnets are used. However,
      as described above, by utilising the fixture element on the piece
      of magnetic material 200 to inhibit movement of the plurality of
      magnet structures 206 with respect to each other to form the
      magnetic structure 208, results in the magnetic structure 208
      having a plurality of magnet elements 206 which are held adjacent
      to one another such that the separation gaps between the magnet
      elements 206 can be kept small, for example, in the range of about
      0.01 mm to about 2.00 mm. This creates a substantially intensified
      magnetic interference. The magnetic materials for forming the
      magnetic structure 208 can either be polarized to the desired
      polarity before the magnetic structure 208 is formed or after the
      magnetic structure 208 is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Since increasing the intensity of magnetic interference
      increases the strength of the magnetic field, the size and/or the
      number of magnets required to achieve a desired magnetic field
      strength is reduced. This in turn can reduce the total weight and
      cost of the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] After breaking the piece of magnetic material 200, the
      generally planar magnetic structure 208 in FIG. 2(b) is formed
      into an arc-shaped magnetic structure 210, as shown in FIG. 2(c)
      while substantially maintaining a relative position of the magnet
      elements 206 with respect to each other. The generally planar
      magnetic structure 208 is placed against a support 220 having an
      arc-shaped profile 222 such that the generally planar magnetic
      structure 208 conforms to the arc-shaped profile 222 of the
      support 220 to form the arc-shaped magnetic structure 210. An
      adhesive sheet (not shown) is used to wrap the magnetic structure
      210 against the support 220 to maintain the shape of the
      arc-shaped magnetic structure 210. It will be appreciated that the
      generally planar magnetic structure 208 can be formed into other
      desired shapes such as a dome shape instead of an arc shape by
      using a support with a corresponding profile shape. The support
      220 can be made of any non-metallic material, such as plastic.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The device 212 comprises the arc-shaped magnetic structure
      210 and a magnetic shielding device in the form of, for example,
      an auxiliary magnet 214 disposed on one side of the magnetic
      structure 210. As described earlier, the auxiliary magnet 214
      comprises a single piece of magnetic material, therefore no
      magnetic interference is created by the auxiliary magnet 214,
      therefore, the auxiliary magnet is a shielding device for
      shielding the magnetic interference field projecting from at least
      one side of the magnetic structure 210. Further, the auxiliary
      magnet 214 also helps to increase the overall magnetic flux
      density and also helps to increase the magnetic interference
      created at the gaps between the magnet structures 206. The
      arc-shaped magnetic structure 210 comprises a convex side 216 and
      a concave side 218. In this embodiment, a south-pole side of the
      magnetic structure 210 is made the convex side 216 of the magnetic
      structure 210 and the north-pole side of the magnetic structure
      210 is made the concave side 218 of the magnetic structure 210.
      The magnetic field (not shown) projecting from the convex side 216
      of the magnetic structure 210 is projected onto the perishable
      object (not shown) to treat the object. Therefore, the object to
      be treated is exposed to a magnetically interfered south magnetic
      field. The auxiliary magnet 214 is disposed at the concave side
      218 (i.e. north-pole side) of the magnetic structure 210 to shield
      the magnetic interference projecting from the north-pole side of
      the magnetic structure 210. The auxiliary magnet 214 is disposed
      with the same magnetic polarity orientation of the magnetic
      structure 210. Therefore, in this case, a south-pole side of the
      auxiliary magnet 214 faces towards the north-pole side of the
      magnetic structure 210. The auxiliary magnet 214 may be any kind
      of permanent magnet or may be made of magnetic materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The device 212 comprising the arc-shaped magnetic structure
      210, the support 220 and the auxiliary magnet 214 are encapsulated
      in plastic resins, e.g. epoxy or polyester plastics to form, for
      example, a disc structure (not shown) for placing beneath
      perishable objects that are to be treated. Alternatively, the
      device 212 is incorporated, e.g. by encapsulating in plastic
      resins, into a vessel or container (not shown) that contains the
      perishable objects to be treated. FIGS. 6 to 10 show various
      examples of the device 212 being incorporated into, for example, a
      tray structure, a container, a coaster, etc. Alternatively, the
      device 212 can be encapsulated in a plastic casing, e.g. a
      polyethylene or polypropylene plastic casing. It will be
      appreciated that instead of forming the generally planar magnetic
      structure 208 into the arc-shaped magnetic structure 210, the
      auxiliary magnet 214 can be disposed on one side of the generally
      planar magnetic structure 208 (e.g. the north-pole side of the
      generally planar magnetic structure 208). The generally planar
      magnetic structure 208 and the auxiliary magnet 214 are then
      encapsulated in plastic resins or a plastic casing, or
      incorporated into a vessel or a container as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] It will be appreciated that if a north magnetic field is to
      be used to treat an object, the north-pole side of the magnetic
      structure is made the convex side and the south-pole side of the
      magnetic structure is made the concave side.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] There are two polarities and directions in a magnetic
      field. One direction is from the North magnetic pole and the other
      direction is from the South magnetic pole. Based on scientific
      convention, the compass "north" needle points in the direction of
      the magnetic flux, that is, in an outward direction from a
      magnet's North pole end and inward at the magnet's South pole end.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Schematic drawings of another example method of fabricating
      a device 312 for treating perishable objects are shown in FIGS.
      3(a) to 3(c). A single piece of magnetic material 300 that is
      generally flat and circular in shape, is used to form a magnetic
      structure 306 (FIG. 3(b)). An adhesive sheet (not shown) is
      attached along opposing surfaces of the piece of magnetic material
      300 prior to breaking the piece of magnetic material 300 into a
      plurality of magnet elements 304. The adhesive sheet comprises
      clear plastic sheet that is wound or wrapped around the opposing
      surfaces of the magnetic material 300, thereby binding the
      magnetic material 300 and exerts a compressive force on the
      magnetic material 300. A punch 302 is used to break the piece of
      magnetic material 300 into the plurality of adjoining magnet
      elements 304, resulting in a generally planar magnetic structure
      306, as shown in FIG. 3(b). Movement of the plurality of magnet
      elements 304 with respect to each other during breaking of the
      magnetic material 300 is inhibited by the adhesive sheet. The
      compressive force exerted on the magnetic material 300 acts
      against the repulsive forces between the magnet elements 304 so as
      to inhibit the movement of the magnet elements 304 with respect to
      each other. The generally planar magnetic structure 306 is formed
      into a dome-shaped magnetic structure 308 using a support 316
      having a dome-shaped profile 318, as shown in FIG. 3(c). The
      magnetic materials can either be polarized to the desired polarity
      before the magnetic structure 308 is formed or after the magnetic
      structure 308 is formed. A circular shielding device in the form
      of an auxiliary magnet 310 disposed at a concave side 314 of the
      dome-shaped magnetic structure 308 to shield the magnetic
      interference field projecting from the concave side 314.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The device 312 comprising the dome-shaped magnetic
      structure 308, the support 316 and the auxiliary magnet 310 are
      encapsulated in plastic resins, e.g. epoxy or polyester plastics
      to form, for example, a disc structure (not shown) for placing
      beneath perishable objects that are to be treated. Alternatively,
      the device 312 is incorporated, e.g. by encapsulating in plastic
      resins, into a vessel or container (not shown) that contains the
      perishable objects to be treated. FIGS. 6 to 10 show various
      examples of the device 312 being incorporated into, for example, a
      tray structure, a container, a coaster, etc. Alternatively, the
      device 312 can be encapsulated in a plastic casing, e.g. a
      polyethylene or polypropylene plastic casing and sealed with a
      plastic resin. It will be appreciated that instead of forming the
      generally planar magnetic structure 306 into the dome-shaped
      magnetic structure 308, the auxiliary magnet 310 can be disposed
      on one side of the generally planar magnetic structure 306 (e.g.
      the north-pole side of the generally planar magnetic structure
      208). The generally planar magnetic structure 308 and the
      auxiliary magnet 310 are then encapsulated with plastic resins or
      a plastic casing or incorporated into a vessel or a container as
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] A schematic drawing of a device 400 for treating perishable
      objects is shown in FIG. 4a. The device 400 comprises a
      dome-shaped support panel 402, a plurality of substantially planar
      magnetic structures 404 arranged on a convex side 401 of the
      dome-shaped support panel 402 and a base 414 disposed at the
      concave side 413 of the dome-shaped support panel 402. The
      magnetic structures 404 in this embodiment are similar to, for
      example, the magnetic structure 208 of FIG. 2(b). Each magnetic
      structure 404 comprises a set of magnet elements 210 formed from a
      single piece of magnetic material. An auxiliary magnet 406 is
      disposed on one side of each magnetic structure 404 to shield the
      magnetic interference field projecting from the side of the
      magnetic structure 404. The magnetic structures 404 and the
      auxiliary magnets 406 disposed on the support panel 402 are not
      individually encapsulated by plastic resins or a plastic casing in
      this embodiment. The auxiliary magnet 406 also helps to increase
      the overall magnetic flux density of the magnetic structure 404
      and helps to increase the magnetic interference created at the
      gaps (not shown) between the magnet elements 410 of each magnetic
      structure 404. The magnetic structures 404 are arranged
      substantially in a staggered arrangement on the convex side 401 of
      the dome-shaped support panel 402 to produce further magnetic
      interference between the magnetic structures 404. This is in
      addition to the magnetic interference produced by the magnetic
      structures 404. In addition to the auxiliary magnets 406, the base
      414 of the device 400 can also act as a shielding device. The base
      414 can be made of metal, for example, aluminium or tin, to shield
      the magnetic interference field projecting form the concave side
      413 of the support panel 402. Alternatively, the base 414 can
      comprise an auxiliary magnet to shield the magnetic interference
      field projecting from the concave side 413 of the support panel
      and also to help increase the overall magnetic flux density of the
      magnetic structure 404 and to increase the magnetic interference
      created at the gaps (not shown) between the magnet elements 410 of
      each magnetic structure 404, and also between each magnetic
      structure 404.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The device 400 comprising the magnetic structures 404, the
      auxiliary magnets 406, the support panel 402 and the base 414 are
      encapsulated in plastic resins, e.g. epoxy or polyester plastics,
      or plastics, e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene, to form, for
      example, a disc structure (not shown) for placing beneath
      perishable objects that are to be treated. Alternatively, the
      device 400 is incorporated, e.g. by encapsulating in plastic
      resins, in a vessel or container (not shown) that contains the
      perishable objects to be treated. FIGS. 6 to 10 show various
      examples of the device 400 being incorporated into, for example, a
      tray structure, a container, a coaster, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] A schematic drawing of another example of the device 416 is
      shown in FIG. 4b. The device 416 comprises two dome-shaped magnet
      structures 418 arranged such that the respective auxiliary magnets
      420 are contacting one another. One magnet structure 418 comprises
      the north magnetic field and the other magnet structure 418
      comprises the south magnetic field. Therefore, the respective
      auxiliary magnets 420 have opposite magnetic polarity and attract
      each other, forming a globe shaped structure 422.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] A schematic drawing of another example of the device 424 is
      shown in FIG. 4c. The device 424 comprises two dome-shaped magnet
      structures 426 similar to the device 400 of FIG. 4a. The two
      structures 426 are arranged such that the respective auxiliary
      magnets 428 are contacting one another. One magnet structure 426
      comprises the north magnetic field and the other magnet structure
      426 comprises the south magnetic field. Therefore, the respective
      auxiliary magnets 428 have opposite magnetic polarity and attract
      each other, forming a globe shaped structure 430.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] A schematic drawing of another example of the device 432 is
      shown in FIG. 4d. The device 432 comprises two dome-shaped magnet
      structures 434 stacked on one another. More than two dome-shaped
      magnet structures 434 can be stacked on another in different
      embodiments. The dome-shaped magnet structures 434 have the same
      polarity. The respective auxiliary magnets 436 of the magnet
      structures 434 are also stacked on one another to form the shield
      element. In other embodiments, a single piece of auxiliary magnet
      436 can be used as the shield element. It will be appreciated that
      the magnet structures 434 can be also be of other configurations,
      e.g. in the form of the magnet structures 426 of FIG. 4(c). It
      will be appreciated that in different embodiments, the
      configuration could be a combination of the configurations
      described with reference to FIGS. 4(b) and (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0123] FIG. 5a shows a schematic perspective view of a device 500,
      for example, in the form of the device 312 of FIG. 3(c) or the
      device 400 of FIG. 4a. The device 504 comprises a dome-shaped
      portion 502 and a generally circular base 504. The shaded region
      in FIG. 5a shows an aerial projection of a magnetic field 506
      created by magnetic interference, extending from the device 500.
      The aerial projection of the magnetic field 506 is dome-shaped
      with a circular base 508. The magnetic field 506 does not project
      from the base 504 of the device 500 due to the presence of a
      shielding device (e.g. the auxiliary magnet 310 of FIG. 3(c) or
      the auxiliary magnets 406 disposed beneath the magnetic structures
      404 or the base 414 of the device 400 of FIG. 4a, which act as the
      shielding device).<br>
      <br>
      [0124] FIG. 5b shows a schematic perspective view of a
      globe-shaped device 510, for example, in the form of the device
      416 of FIG. 4(b) or the device 424 of FIG. 4(c). The device 510
      comprises two dome-shaped magnetic structures 512 and 514 and a
      generally circular base 516. The shaded region in FIG. 5b shows an
      aerial projection of a magnetic field 518 created by magnetic
      interference from one magnetic polarity, extending from the
      magnetic structure 512. The unshaded region in FIG. 5b shows
      another aerial projection of a magnetic field 520 created by
      magnetic interference from the opposite magnetic polarity,
      extending from the magnetic structure 514.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The aerial projections of the magnetic fields 518 and 520
      are dome-shaped with a circular base 522. The magnetic fields 518
      and 520 do not project from the base 516 of the structures 512 and
      514 due to the presence of a shielding device (e.g. the auxiliary
      magnet 310 of FIG. 3(c) or the auxiliary magnets 406 disposed
      beneath the magnetic structures 404 or the base 414 of the device
      400 of FIG. 4a, which act as the shielding device).<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Objects to be treated should be exposed to the magnetically
      interfered magnetic field and therefore, should be positioned to
      be within the area of the magnetic field such that the magnetic
      field is directed onto the objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] FIGS. 5a and 5b illustrates that by using the device 500 or
      510, the magnetic field can be projected and diverged from the
      device 500 or 510, which can advantageously provide a larger
      treatment area compared to that achievable with a flat or planar
      magnetic structure of the same size.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] FIG. 6(a) shows a schematic drawing of a device 600, for
      example, in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device
      312 in FIG. 3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. The device 600 is
      embedded into a tray component 608 by encapsulating the device 600
      in plastic resins or in a plastic casing to form the tray
      component 608. The tray component 608 is placed below perishable
      objects to be treated, such as raw fish 602, or meat (not shown),
      in a package 604 for point-of-sale or storage purposes. The
      package 604 comprises a plastic sheet 606 wrapped over the tray
      608, the device 600 and the raw fish 602. Alternatively, device
      600 can be individually encapsulated in e.g. plastic resins, and
      placed on the tray component 608 rather than being embedded into
      the tray component 608.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] FIG. 6(b) shows a schematic drawing of the device 600
      embedded into a beverage packaging 610 by encapsulating the device
      600 in plastic resins or in a plastic casing to form the beverage
      package 610. The beverage package 610 may store dairy products,
      such as milk or yogurt or fruit juices 612 for point-of-sale or
      storage purposes. The beverage package 610 may comprise a plastic
      container or paper box, the device 600 and the beverage 612.
      Alternatively, the device 600 can be individually encapsulated in
      e.g. plastic resins, and physically secured to the beverage
      packaging 610 rather than being embedded.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] FIG. 7 shows a schematic drawing of a device 700, for
      example, in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device
      312 in FIG. 3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. Two devices 700 are
      placed in separate compartments 704 of a refrigerator 702. Each
      device 700 is embedded into one compartment 704 of the
      refrigerator by encapsulating the device 700 in plastic resins or
      in a plastic casing and to form the compartment 704. Perishable
      objects such as raw fish 708 are placed in the compartments 704
      such that a magnetically interfered south magnetic field from the
      device 700 extends into the space of the compartment 704
      containing the perishable objects to maintain freshness of the
      perishable objects. Alternatively, device 700 can be individually
      encapsulated in e.g. plastic resins, and placed in the
      compartments 704 rather than being embedded into the compartments
      704.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] FIG. 8 is a schematic drawing of a device 800, for example,
      in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device 312 in FIG.
      3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. The device 800 is embedded into
      a storage container 802 by encapsulating the device 800 in plastic
      resins or in a plastic casing to form the storage container 802.
      Perishable objects, such as raw fish 804 are placed in the storage
      container 802 to maintain the freshness of the perishable objects.
      Alternatively, device 800 can be individually encapsulated in e.g.
      plastic resins, and placed in the storage container 802 rather
      than being embedded into the storage container 802.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] FIG. 9(a) is a schematic drawing of a device 900, for
      example, in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device
      312 in FIG. 3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. The device 900 is
      embedded into a tray component 906 by encapsulating the device 900
      in plastic resins or in a plastic casing to form the tray
      component 906. The tray 906 is placed below a block of ice 902.
      Perishable objects such as raw fish 904, are displayed on the
      block of ice 902. The device 900 is positioned such that the
      perishable objects are exposed to the magnetically interfered
      south magnetic field projecting from the device 900 to maintain
      the freshness of the perishable objects, and to slow the melting
      rate of the block of ice 902. Alternatively, device 900 can be
      individually encapsulated in e.g. plastic resins, and placed on
      the tray 906 rather than being embedded into the tray 906.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] FIG. 9(b) is a schematic drawing of the device 900 embedded
      into a large container 912 by encapsulating the device 900 in
      plastic resins or in a plastic casing to form the container 912.
      The device 900 is placed on the base of the container 912 which
      may be used in cold trucks and fishing trawlers. Perishable
      objects such as raw fish 914 are stored with or without ice in the
      container 912. The device 900 is positioned such that the
      perishable objects are exposed to the magnetically interfered
      south magnetic field projecting from the device 900 to maintain
      the freshness of the perishable objects. Alternatively, device 900
      can be individually encapsulated in e.g. plastic resins, and
      placed on the container 912 rather than being embedded.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] FIG. 10 is a schematic drawing of a device 1000, for
      example, in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device
      312 in FIG. 3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. The device 1000 is
      embedded into a container 1002 by encapsulating the device 1000 in
      plastic resins or in a plastic casing to form the container 1002.
      The container 1002 is used in freezing perishable objects such as
      raw fish 1004. Water 1006 in the container 1002 containing the
      perishable objects and the device 1000 are frozen to maintain
      freshness of the perishable objects. In addition to keeping the
      perishable objects fresh. The magnetically interfered south
      magnetic field projecting from the device 1000 was found to
      increase the water binding strength in perishables and reduce
      water crystallisation and growth of water crystals that cause food
      cell damage in frozen food. Alternatively, device 1000 can be
      individually encapsulated in e.g. plastic resins, and placed into
      the container 1002 rather than being embedded into the container
      1002.<br>

      [0135] FIG. 11 is a schematic drawing of a device 1100, for
      example, in the form of the magnetic structure 208 of FIG. 2(b),
      the device 212 of FIG. 2(c), or the device 312 of FIG. 3(c) is
      embedded into a circular disc-shaped component 1102 by
      encapsulating the device 1100 in plastic resins or in a plastic
      casing to form a coaster 1102, for example, for wine 1104
      contained in a glass 1106 or a bottle (not shown). The wine 1104
      in the glass 1106 is exposed to the magnetically interfered north
      magnetic field projecting from the device 1100 and is therefore
      treated by the device 1100.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] FIG. 12 is a schematic drawing of a device 1200, for
      example, be in the form of the magnetic structure 208 of FIG. 2(b)
      or the device 212 of FIG. 2(c) embedded into a rectangular-shaped
      enclosure 1202 by encapsulating the device in plastic resins or in
      a plastic casing to form a pendant 1202 for tagging to a beverage
      container such as a wine glass 1204. The pendant 1202 comprises a
      fastening means in the form of e.g. a string 1206 to allow the
      pendant to be movably attached to the wine glass 1204. The pendant
      1200 can be moved from a rest position at the base 1208 of the
      wine glass 1204 to a lifted position to treat the wine in the wine
      glass 1204.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] FIGS. 13(a) to (f) are schematic drawings of a device 1300
      according to another embodiment. In this embodiment, the device
      1300 is provided separately for use in treating perishable objects
      and liquids such as water. The device 1300 comprises a plurality
      of magnetic structures 1304 arranged in two rows along the length
      of a flexible support 1302. The magnetic structures 1304 can, for
      example, be in the form of the magnetic structure 208 in FIG.
      2(b). Each magnetic structure 1304 comprises a set of magnet
      elements 1301 formed from a single piece of magnetic material. The
      magnetic structures 1304 in one row are disposed on the flexible
      support 1302 in an offset arrangement with respect to the magnetic
      structures 1304 in the other row. The flexible support 1302
      carries the plurality of magnetic structures 1304 such that the
      device 1300 can be attached to objects with curved surfaces. FIG.
      13(a) shows the device being wrapped around a conduit structure
      1306 to treat the contents, for example, water, in the conduit
      1306. A schematic drawing of a cross-section FIG. 13(a) along the
      line B-B is shown in FIG. 13(b). A magnetically interfered north
      magnetic field projected from the device 1300 treats the water by
      reducing the water molecule binding energy to improve water
      heating and cooling efficiency. Alternatively, the device 1300 can
      be wrapped around a cylindrical portion of a container 1308 as
      shown in FIG. 13(c). A schematic drawing of a cross-section of
      FIG. 13(c) along the line C-C is shown in FIG. 13(d). Each
      magnetic structure 1304 has an auxiliary magnet 1305 disposed on
      top of the magnetic structure 1304 (i.e. on the south pole side of
      the magnetic structure 1304). For illustration purposes, the
      magnetic structures 1304 disposed below the auxiliary magnet 1305
      are shown in dashed lines in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(c). Additionally,
      a flexible shielding plate (e.g. aluminium foil, not shown) is
      disposed on top of the auxiliary magnet 1305 (i.e. on a side of
      the auxiliary magnet 1305 opposite the magnetic structure 1304).
      Each magnetic structure 1304 is first encapsulated in plastic
      resins, which is then assembled onto the flexible support 1302.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] It will be appreciated that more than two rows or one row
      of magnetic structures 1304 can be attached to the flexible
      support 1302. Further, the magnetic structures 1308 can also be of
      other configurations, e.g. in the form of the device 212 of FIG.
      2(c).<br>
      <br>
      [0139] FIGS. 13(e) and 13(f) are schematic drawings of a device
      1310, for example, in the form of the device 212 of FIG. 2(c), or
      the device 312 of FIG. 3(c), or the device 400 of FIG. 4(a), or
      the device 416 of FIG. 4(b), or the device 424 of FIG. 4(c), or
      device 432 of FIG. 4(d). The device 1310 is mounted in a storage
      tank container 1312 by encapsulating the device 1310 in plastic
      resins or in a plastic casing to form a waterproof and heat
      resistant device. An electric water heating element 1314 can be
      disposed in the storage tank container 1312.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] FIG. 14 is a graph, based on experimental results, of gap
      distance between two magnets against measured magnetic flux
      density between the two magnets. The magnetic flux density of the
      pairs of magnets is measured at a perpendicular distance of about
      25 mm away from the magnets' surface. Two pairs of permanent
      magnets were used for the experiments. Each pair of permanent
      magnets comprises two magnets that are of similar size and
      strength. Each of the magnets of the first pair has a magnetic
      flux (B) of about 350 G and each of the magnets of the second pair
      has a magnetic flux (B) of about 500 G. It is observed that for
      both pairs of magnets, when the gap distance between the two
      magnets of a pair decreases, the measured flux density of the
      magnetic field created by magnetic interference of the two magnets
      increases exponentially. Therefore, the smaller the gap distance
      between the magnets, the greater the intensity of the magnetic
      interference, which in turn increases the strength of the magnetic
      field. By using the method as described in the above embodiments,
      for example, with reference to FIGS. 2(a) to 2(c) or FIGS. 3(a) to
      3(c), the gap distance between the adjoining magnet elements in
      the respective magnetic structures can be maintained small in
      order to create an intensified magnetic interference for treating
      perishable objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] FIG. 15(a) is a table based on experimental results showing
      the average total bacteria count in three samples of raw sliced
      salmon after an exposure period of about 4.5 hours in room
      conditions at about 20[deg.] C. In the first sample, raw sliced
      salmon 1502 is placed on a device 1500, as shown in FIG. 15(b),
      and is exposed to a magnetically interfered south magnetic field
      projecting from the device 1500. The device 1500 is in the form of
      a plate 1504 comprising a plurality of magnetic structures 1508
      disposed in a staggered arrangement in a base panel 1510 of the
      plate 1504. The magnetic structures 1508 can, for example, be in
      the form of the magnetic structures 208 in FIG. 2(b) or the
      magnetic structures 404 in FIG. 4a, each of the magnetic
      structures 404 having one auxiliary magnet 406 disposed on one
      side of the magnetic structure 406. In the second sample, raw
      sliced salmon 1502 is placed on the plate 1504 comprising a single
      magnet 1512 disposed in the base panel 1510 of the plate 1504, as
      shown in FIG. 15(c). The raw sliced salmon 1502 in the second
      sample is exposed to a south magnetic field projecting from the
      magnet 1512. The south magnetic field in the second sample is not
      created by magnetic interference. The strength of the magnets used
      in the first and sample are about 150+-10 G. In the third sample,
      raw sliced salmon 1502 is placed on the plate 1504, as shown in
      FIG. 15(d) and is not subjected to any magnetic field. The total
      bacteria count (i.e. total plate count, TPC) of the first sample
      is about 16,400 cfu/g. However, the total bacterial count of the
      second sample and the third sample is about 87,000 cfu/g and about
      49,000 cfu/g, respectively. The results in the table in FIG. 15(a)
      demonstrate that the magnetically interfered south magnetic field
      (having the lowest bacteria count out of the three samples) slows
      food spoilage compared to the second and third samples. On the
      other hand, the south magnetic field (without magnetic
      interference) appears to be the least effective of the three
      samples in slowing food spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] FIG. 16 is a graph based on experimental results of ice bed
      thickness against duration of melting ice: (i) exposed to a device
      with a south magnetic interference field having an average
      magnetic flux density of about 250 G, (ii) exposed to another
      device with a south magnetic interference field having an average
      magnetic flux density of about 500 G, and (iii) not exposed to the
      device (i.e. not exposed to any magnetic field; magnetic
      interference field=0 G). Each bed of ice has a surface area of
      about 300*400 mm and is of about 60 mm thick at the beginning of
      the experiment. The ice beds are exposed for about 9 hours in room
      conditions at about 26[deg.] C. After 9 hours, the thickness of
      the ice bed not exposed to any magnetic field was about 2 mm
      thick. However, for the ice bed (ii), it is observed that the
      thickness of the ice bed after 9 hours is about 8 mm, thereby
      demonstrating that the rate of ice melting is reduced compared to
      the ice bed that was not subjected to any magnetic field. It is
      observed that for the ice bed (iii), the thickness of the ice bed
      after 9 hours is about 20 mm, thereby demonstrating that the rate
      of ice melting is reduced further. In other words, the results in
      the graph of FIG. 16 demonstrate that the rate of ice melting is
      reduced when the ice is exposed to the south magnetic interference
      field and a stronger south magnetic interference field slows the
      rate of ice melting further<br>
      <br>
      [0143] FIG. 17 is a graph based on experimental results showing
      thermal images of raw whole fish exposed to the device and raw
      whole fish not exposed to the device. Thermal infrared images of
      raw whole fish samples with time at various distances from the
      device were obtained and analysed. The fish samples were kept in
      room conditions at about 26[deg.] C. In this experiment, the
      device used is similar to the device of FIG. 3(c). A ferrite
      permanent magnet with a diameter of about 30 mm and a thickness of
      about 3 mm was used. The magnetic field strength of the permanent
      magnet is about 200 G. The permanent magnet is similar to for
      example, the magnetic structure 306 in FIG. 3(b). The fish exposed
      to the device were subjected to a magnetically interfered south
      magnetic field. Three sets of raw fish exposed to the device were
      placed at a distance of 0 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, respectively, from
      the device, and thermal images of the fish from each set were
      obtained at time intervals of about 60 min, 120 min and 210 min
      from the beginning of the experiment. The raw fish not exposed to
      the device were not subjected to any magnetic field and are used
      as a reference or control experiment. Regions of darker shades in
      the thermal images represent areas of lower temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The thermal images show that the surface temperature of the
      raw fish nearest to the device (i.e. at 0 cm from the device)
      remained relatively cooler compared to the raw fish farther away
      from the device (i.e. at 15 cm and 30 cm from the device,
      respectively) and the raw fish that was not exposed to any
      magnetic field. After 210 mins, the thermal images of the fish
      samples at 30 cm away from the device was observed to be almost
      similar to the raw fish that was not exposed to the device. On the
      other hand, after 210 mins the fish samples that were placed at 0
      cm and 15 cm away from the device, respectively still had
      relatively larger cooler regions compared to the fish samples at
      30 cm away from the device. The fish samples at 0 cm away from the
      device have the largest cooler region compared to all of the other
      samples after 210 mins.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] From the experimental results in FIG. 17 the maximum
      distance at which a perishable object can be placed in order to be
      treated by the device (i.e. effective distance) can be established
      and verified by thermal imaging, where other factors such as B, L
      and g of Equation 1 are kept constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Further, the fish samples closer to the device have an
      improved hydration state compared to the fish samples further away
      from the device and the fish samples that are not exposed to any
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] From the above experiment, the effective distance is about
      30 cm away from the device. However it will be appreciated that
      the effective distance varies for devices of different shapes and
      interference magnetic field strengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] FIGS. 18(a) and 18(b) are photographs of a block of ice
      1802 exposed to the device 1800 and another block of ice 1804 not
      exposed to the device 1800, respectively. The block of ice 1802
      that is exposed to the device 1800 is subjected to a magnetically
      interfered south magnetic field projected from the device 1800
      (FIG. 18(b)) and the block of ice 1804 that is not exposed to the
      device 1800 is not subjected to any magnetic field (FIG. 18(a)). A
      schematic drawing of the device 1800 is superimposed onto the ice
      block 1802 for illustration purpose. The device 1800 can, for
      example, be in the form of the device 212 in FIG. 2(c), the device
      312 in FIG. 3(c) or the device 400 in FIG. 4a. When water freezes,
      water crystals 1806 will grow, as shown in FIG. 18(a) and this
      phenomenon is detrimental to perishable objects such as food when
      water is frozen in the food because food cells will be damaged
      during ice crystallization growth period. The natural growth of
      water crystals 1806 without any magnetic interference field is
      shown in FIG. 18(a). When the block of ice 1802 is frozen in the
      presence of a south magnetic interference field from the device
      1800, the rate at which water crystals 1808 are formed is reduced
      significantly, as shown by the smaller water crystals 1808 in FIG.
      18(b). These results show that when exposed to the device 1800,
      perishables containing large amount of water have less ice
      re-crystallization growth problem when water freezes than those
      which are not exposed to the device 1800.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] FIG. 19(a) is a graph based on experimental results
      demonstrating the effects of magnetic interference on water
      surface energy when a plurality of sessile water droplets are
      exposed to a magnetically interfered south magnetic field, a
      magnetically interfered north magnetic field and without any
      magnetic field, respectively. Contact angles of the sessile water
      droplets were plotted against various sample points. A schematic
      drawing showing a contact angle 1900 of a sessile water droplet
      1902 on a surface 1904 is shown in FIG. 19(b). The contact angles
      of sessile water droplets on a solid plate exposed to the various
      conditions described above were measured. The horizontal bar in
      the graph represents the mean value of the contact angles
      measured. The data in the left region of the graph (sample number
      1 to 11) shows the contact angles of the water droplets that were
      not exposed to any magnetic field. The mean contact angle for
      sample numbers 1 to 11 is about 86[deg.]. The data in the middle
      region of the graph shows the contact angles of water droplets
      after the water droplets (sample number 12 to 21) were exposed to
      the device (not shown) with an approximately 350
      gauss-magnetically interfered north magnetic field disposed at
      about 150 mm away from the water droplets. The mean contact angle
      for sample numbers 12 to 21 is about 81.5[deg.]. The data in the
      right region of the graph shows the contact angles of water
      droplets after the water droplets (sample number 22 to 39) were
      exposed to the device (not shown) with an approximately 350
      gauss-magnetically interfered south magnetic field disposed at
      about 150 mm away from the water droplets. The mean contact angle
      for sample numbers 22 to 39 is about 89[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The above experimental results demonstrate that a
      magnetically interfered south magnetic field increases molecule
      bonding energy of liquids (e.g. water) such that the water
      droplets were able to retain their droplet shape better than the
      water droplets not exposed to any magnetic field, as shown by the
      larger contact angles of the water droplets exposed to the
      magnetically interfered south magnetic field. An increase in the
      molecule bonding energy indicates that the chance of water
      escaping from perishable objects will be lower (i.e. lower water
      activity) and hence water can be retained better as compared to,
      for example, perishable objects not exposed to any magnetic
      interference field, hence making the perishable objects firmer and
      fresher. In addition, an increase in molecule bonding energy
      reduces water activity and slows down the activity of enzymes and
      vitamins in foods. As a result, the denaturing of fats and
      proteins advantageously becomes slower. Hence the food colour,
      taste, and aroma can advantageously be retained better. Further,
      the increase in water bonding energy may slow down the melting
      rate of ice in an ice bed and bio-chemical activities such as
      oxidation in food.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] On the other hand, the droplets exposed to the magnetically
      interfered north magnetic field have smaller contact angles
      compared to the water droplets that were not exposed to any
      magnetic field, which indicates that the molecule bonding energy
      in the water molecules have been weakened. A weakening of the
      molecule bonding energy has the opposite effect to increasing the
      molecules bonding energy, and can result in faster dehydration and
      oxidation of the perishable objects, and increasing the melting
      rate of ice (i.e. an increase in water activity). In addition, the
      weakened molecule bonds in liquids such as water, as demonstrated
      in the reduction of surface tension of water, can reduce the
      viscosity of water which may improve the heat transfer in a
      heating/boiling process such as the heat convection flow and the
      boiling process.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] FIG. 20 is a graph based on experimental results showing
      thermal images of heat transfer in an open water storage tank
      exposed to the device and in an open water storage tank without
      the device respectively. The device can be installed either
      outside or inside a non-metallic storage tank. If the storage tank
      is made of metallic materials, the device is preferably installed
      inside the storage tank because metallic materials attenuate
      magnetic fields. In this experiment, the device used is similar to
      the device of FIG. 3(c). Other designs of the device, such as
      devices of FIGS. 4(a) to 4(d) can be used in other embodiments.
      The water is exposed to a magnetically interfered north magnetic
      field projecting from the device. The experimental results show
      that the water heating behaviour differed significantly between
      the tank with the device and the other tank without the device.
      With the device, it can be seen that the movement of heat from the
      heater source at the right side of the tank to the colder regions
      at the left side is more aggressive and faster than the other tank
      without the device. In addition, it can be observed that the heat
      movement spirals more prominently with the presence of the device
      than the one without the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] To quantify the effect of the device on the overall heating
      improvement, the change in temperature was recorded after 60
      minutes of heating by a 3 kilowatts heating element in an open
      storage water tank containing 153 litres of water. FIG. 21 shows a
      graph based on experimental results showed the effects of magnetic
      interference on water temperature rise when the water is exposed
      to a north-polarity device and when the water is not exposed to
      the device respectively. The experimental results show that the
      overall water temperature rise for the samples exposed to the
      device was statistically higher than the samples which are not
      exposed to the device by an average of about 7.6%.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] From the experimental results shown in FIGS. 20 and 21, it
      can be observed that by exposing water to a magnetically
      interfered north magnetic field, the water is able to heat up
      faster and the transfer of the heat to the colder regions is also
      faster.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] FIG. 22 shows a flowchart 2200 illustrating a method of
      fabricating the device for treating perishable objects or liquids.
      At step 2202, a single piece of magnetic material is broken into a
      plurality of pieces. At step 2204, movement of the pieces with
      respect to each other is inhibited during the breaking of the
      magnetic material. At step 2206, a magnetic structure comprising
      the pieces of the magnetic material is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that
      numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the
      present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without
      departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly
      described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be

      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Conventional methods and devices to keep food and beverages
      fresh and natural, particularly in the raw, semi-processed and
      processed states, typically involve thermal treatments, mainly by
      refrigeration. However, such devices are usually operated by
      electricity, which may not be available in some circumstances.
      Further, keeping food in a low temperature environment, such as a
      refrigerator, may also result in dehydration of the food.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the decomposition of all living cells, such as in fish
      and meat products, there are several chemical and biochemical
      processes taking place. These processes include: (1) enzymatic
      spoilage that is caused by the tissue enzymes of the fish or meat
      itself; (2) oxidative deterioration that results in foul, rancid
      odors and color changes; (3) spoilage due to bacterial growth from
      its secondary products, primarily from the enzymes that cause the
      decomposition of proteins. These chemical-related deterioration
      processes are conventionally controlled by the reduction of
      ambient temperature by means of refrigeration processes. However,
      such refrigeration devices require electrical supply, which may
      not be available in some circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Further, even if refrigeration devices are available, it
      may be desirable to help prolong and/or enhance the freshness of
      food and beverages stored in a refrigerator for a longer period of
      time and to retain moisture of the food.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] An object of the present invention is to provide a method
      of treating a perishable object, the method exposing the
      perishable object to a south magnetic field created by magnetic
      interference of a plurality of magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The plurality of magnets may be arranged in a substantially
      staggered arrangement, and can be permanent or electromagnets. The
      method could provide for shielding the north-pole side of the
      magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The perishable object may comprise a food item, a beverage
      item, or both, and the exposure maintains the freshness of the
      food item, the beverage item, or both. The perishable object may
      also comprise ice used to cool another perishable object.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The exposure may control a surface temperature of the
      perishable object, the rate of bacterial growth, the rate of
      dehydration or the rate of melting of the perishable object.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The duration of said exposing step may be chosen such that
      the rate of bacterial growth is reduced or increased compared to a
      rate without said exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Another object of the present invention is to provide a
      device for treating a perishable object, the device comprising a
      panel defining a portion of a space for containing the perishable
      object, a plurality of magnets housed within the panel and
      arranged such that a south magnetic field created by magnetic
      interference of the plurality of magnets extends into the space
      for containing the perishable object.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The device could be composed of a six sided container, a
      tray, a plate, or a five sided container.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The device comprising a shielding unit consisting of a
      magnetic plate disposed at a north-pole side of the magnets housed
      in each panel.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The device further comprising protective padding disposed
      around the magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The magnets sealed within the panels may be permanent or
      electromagnets.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] The described embodiments relate to a method and device to
      reduce the rate of chemical and biochemical activities that cause
      the denaturing and decomposition of perishable objects, such as
      food and beverages. The device and method also function to retain
      the moisture content in food by maintaining cell hydration, which
      can be particularly useful for food such as cooked rice, bread,
      cheese, cold-cut ham, and ice.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 1 illustrates a magnetic device in accordance with a
      first embodiment of the present invention. The device comprises a
      substantially rectangular shaped container 10 having a cavity 12
      defined by six panels, namely, four side panels 14, a base panel
      16 and a top panel 18. The top panel 18 acts as a cover or lid of
      the container 10. Each of the panels 14, 16, 18 houses a plurality
      of magnets 20 within the panel. The four side panels 14, the base
      panel 16, and the top panel 18 are configured to envelop an object
      (not shown), for example, perishable food. The object is placed in
      the cavity 12 of the container 10 such that the object is
      surrounded by the panels 14, 16, 18 in all three linear axes,
      namely the x, y, and z-axes.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Each of the plurality of magnets 20 are housed within the
      panels 14, 16, 18 with their respective south-pole side (refer to
      FIG. 4) facing towards the object placed in the cavity 12 of the
      container 10, such that a magnetic south field is directed upon
      the object. Further, since the object is surrounded by the panels
      14, 16, 18, this ensures that the targeted object is only exposed
      to the magnetic south field in all three axes.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] There are two polarities and directions in a magnetic
      field. One direction is from the north magnetic pole and the other
      direction is from the south magnetic pole. Based on scientific
      convention, the compass "north" needle points in the direction of
      the magnetic flux, that is, in an outward direction from a
      magnet's north pole end, and inward at the magnet's south pole
      end.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The magnets 20 are permanent magnets in the referenced
      embodiment. It should be appreciated that the material, size and
      shape of the permanent magnets 20 may vary, depending on design
      and application. Further, the number of magnets 20 used may vary
      depending on e.g. the shape and size of the container 10, for
      example. The magnets 20 may also be in the form of electromagnets
      instead of permanent magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic view showing the arrangement
      of the plurality of magnets 20 housed in one of the four side
      panels 14 of the container 10 shown in FIG. 1. The magnets 20 are
      arranged such that nearest neighboring circles 17 of magnets 20
      are substantially in a staggered arrangement with substantially
      uniform spacing between the magnets 20 within the side panel 14 to
      produce magnetic interference 15, which in turn enhances magnetic
      field strength. Magnetic interference significantly increases the
      total propagated magnetic field (in this case the south magnetic
      field). Since magnetic interference increases the strength of the
      magnetic field, the size of the magnets and/or the number of
      magnets required to achieve a desired magnetic field strength is
      reduced. This in turn reduces the total weight and the cost of the
      device. The magnets 20 in the base panel 16 and top panel 18
      (shown in FIG. 1) are arranged in a similar staggered arrangement
      as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic view of the arrangement of a
      plurality of magnets 23 housed in the panel 25 of the device
      according to a second embodiment. In this embodiment, the magnets
      23 are arranged in a substantially staggered arrangement having a
      circular configuration 27 with a magnet 23 in the center of each
      of the circles 27 of magnets 23 to produce magnetic interference
      29, thereby enhancing the magnetic field strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 4 illustrates a table showing the comparison of
      magnetic flux from an in-line arrangement 34 of four magnets 30
      and a substantially staggered arrangement 36 of the four magnets
      30. Schematic plan views of the positions of the magnets 30 in the
      in-line arrangement 34 and the substantially staggered arrangement
      36 are shown in the first and second rows of the table,
      respectively. The positions of the magnets 30 are represented by
      dots "-" and the center of the arrangement of the magnets 30 are
      represented by a cross "X". The magnetic flux is measured from the
      center of each arrangement 34, 36, about 60 mm away from a
      magnetic plane 38. The magnetic flux at the center of the
      staggered arrangement 36 (magnetic flux of 1700+-8 G) is greater
      compared to the magnetic flux at the center of the in-line
      arrangement 34 (magnetic flux of 1300+-10 G). This shows an
      enhancement of the magnetic field strength and propagation of the
      magnetic field of the staggered arrangement 36 over the in-line
      arrangement 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the side panel 14 of
      FIG. 2 along line A-A. The side panel 14 comprises a casing 24.
      The magnets 20 are housed within the casing 24. Protective padding
      26 is disposed on a south-pole side 20a and a north-pole side 20b
      of the magnets 20. The protective padding 26 acts as a spacer,
      heat insulator and shock absorber for the magnets 20. The
      north-pole side 20b of the magnets 20 is shielded by a magnetic
      shielding device 28 in the form of, for example, a shield plate.
      The shield plate 28 is disposed between the protective padding 26
      on the north-pole side 20b of the magnets 20 and the casing 24.
      The protective padding 26 may be made of materials such as
      neoprene based foam tape, which is structurally stable and offers
      good moisture and fungus resistance properties. The thickness of
      the protective padding 26 depends on the magnetic field strength
      of the magnets 20 used. The protective padding 26 also serves to
      provide the necessary spacing between the magnets 20 and an outer
      surface of the casing 24, such that the magnetic field strength on
      the outer surface of the casing 24 is not too large to attract any
      ferromagnetic objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The shield plate 28, the protective padding 26 and the
      magnets 20 are sealed within the casing 24. This is to ensure that
      the magnets 20, the protective padding 26 and the shield plate 28
      are insulated. The top and base panels, 16, 18 of the container 10
      (see FIG. 1) are configured in a similar manner as described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The shield plate 28 may be made of any ferromagnetic
      material, such as low cost tin sheets, which comprise iron (Fe)
      mixed with tin (Sn). The composition and thickness of the shield
      plate 28 may vary, but the magnetic saturation value of the
      material used for the shield plate 28 should be higher than the
      external magnetizing field strength, which depends on the type and
      size of the permanent magnets 20 used.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The material used for the casing 24 may be any non-magnetic
      material, especially for the portion of the casing, for example,
      polyethylene and polypropylene, which are chemically and
      structurally stable and also food safe. The materials are durable
      against wear, high temperatures and washing by detergents. The
      thickness of the material used for the casing 24 may be sufficient
      to prevent deformation from rough handling and protect the magnets
      20 from damage.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the device 10 is in the form
      of a closed rectangular container, with six panels 14, 16, 18.
      However, the device may be designed in various other forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] For example, a third embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6,
      shows the device 50 is in the form of a plate. A plurality of
      magnets 52 is disposed in a staggered arrangement in a base panel
      54 of the plate 50. The plate 50 may be used in buffets and
      catering applications to display ready-to-eat food and at the same
      time maintain the freshness of the food.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 7 illustrates a fourth embodiment showing another
      staggered arrangement of the plurality of magnets 53 in the base
      panel 55 of the device 51 in the form of a plate. In this
      embodiment, the magnets 53 are arranged in a circular
      configuration having a magnet 53 in the center of the circular
      configuration to produce magnetic interference.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 8 illustrates a fifth embodiment whereby the device 60
      may be in the form of an open container comprising five panels 62.
      Similarly, each of the panels 62 houses a plurality of magnets 64
      disposed in a staggered arrangement. A cooler box 66 may be placed
      in the container 60 for use outdoors, such as for picnics and
      fishing, to keep food chilled.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 9 illustrates a sixth embodiment of another staggered
      arrangement of a plurality of magnets 63 within each panel 65 of
      the open container 61. In this embodiment, the magnets 63 are
      arranged in a circular configuration having a magnet 63 in the
      center of the circular configuration to produce magnetic
      interference.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In a seventh embodiment, as shown in FIG. 10, the device 70
      may be in the form of a tray. Each of the panels 72 forming the
      sides and the base of the tray 70 houses a plurality of magnets
      74, as described earlier. The tray 70 may be used to contain
      ready-to-eat food, such as bread and cooked food.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 11 illustrates an eighth embodiment of a staggered
      arrangement of a plurality of magnets 73 within a panel 75 forming
      the base of the tray 71. In this embodiment, the magnets 73 are
      housed within the panel 75 forming the base of the tray 71, and
      are arranged in a circular configuration having a magnet 73 in the
      center of the circular configuration to produce magnetic
      interference.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In a ninth embodiment as shown in FIG. 12, the device 80
      may be in the form of a block comprising six panels 82. A
      plurality of magnets 84 disposed in a staggered arrangement are
      housed within the panels 82. The plurality of magnets 84 are
      arranged at various respective tilt angles to project a
      substantially three-dimensional magnetic field into space(s)
      adjacent one or more of the panels 82. The device 80 may be placed
      in, for example, a refrigerator or in an open environment such
      that the projected magnetic field extends into the space(s)
      adjacent one or more of the panels 82 containing the perishable
      objects to maintain the freshness of the perishable objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 13 illustrates a graph, based on experimental results,
      showing bacterial growth against exposure period of food samples
      exposed to the north magnetic field, the south magnetic field, and
      without any magnetic field. Comparing the curves of the south
      magnetic field growth curve and the north magnetic field growth
      curve, during early stages of exposure, for example, within 1-3
      days for seafood in seafood in (about 0[deg.] C.4[deg.] C.)
      chiller environment, the rate of bacterial growth is higher for
      food samples exposed to the north magnetic field compared to
      samples exposed to the south magnetic field. Also, this difference
      in the rate of bacterial growth is found to be greater when
      magnetic interference is applied. By using magnetic interference
      from the south magnetic field, it was found that there is a
      significant reduction in biochemical and chemical reactions during
      the early stages of exposure, which causes a delay in the food
      denaturing process. As a result of the reduced biochemical and
      chemical reactions, the overall quality of foods exposed to the
      interfered south magnetic field can be maintained longer than
      foods that are not exposed to any magnetic field or foods exposed
      to the north magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The duration of early stages of exposure depends on the
      condition and type of food and beverages, and storage conditions
      such as ambient temperature. For example, the early stages for a
      processed fish stored in chiller conditions (about 0[deg.]
      C.4[deg.] C.) may be 1 to 3 days, whereas at room temperature
      conditions (about 20[deg.] C.25[deg.] C.) may be 2 to 4 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In addition, it was found that in example embodiments the
      mechanism of maintaining the freshness in food and beverages is
      due to the reduction of energy state in electrons in atoms and
      molecules. By using the magnetic south field, the energy state of
      the electrons is reduced. This, in turn, reduces the vibration
      energy of the electrons, and hence, creates an energy barrier that
      prevents electron transfer which is required for any biochemical
      or chemical reactions to occur. Thus, the rate of chemical and
      biochemical deterioration activities that cause the decomposition
      of food and beverages can be slowed down or reduced, thereby
      maintaining the freshness of the food and beverages.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Experiments were conducted to monitor the temperature
      differences of various objects, such as melting ice cubes and
      deteriorating beverages and foods. Differences in the temperature
      of an object that is exposed to the South magnetic field and the
      temperature of the object without exposure to a magnetic field
      were observed. The difference in temperature indicates the
      relative energy state of the object, for example, and influences
      the rate of ice melting (from solid to liquid state) and changes
      in chemical and biochemical reactions for deteriorating food.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The table illustrated in FIG. 13, shows experimental
      results of average internal ambient temperature differences with
      and without a device. The cooler boxes that are placed in the
      device are exposed to a south magnetic field, while the cooler
      boxes without the device are not subjected to any magnetic field.
      In this experiment, the device used is a five-panel container
      substantially similar to the device 60 shown in FIG. 8. In
      Experiment 1, 1 kg of ice cubes is placed in the cooler boxes. In
      Experiment 2, 1 kg of ice cubes and 1 kg of fishes (comprising 10
      whole fishes of approximately 100 g each) are placed in the cooler
      boxes. The experimental results shown in FIG. 14 illustrate one of
      the observable temperature effects when objects are continuously
      undergoing physical and chemical changes. For example, the ice
      cubes kept in the 25 liter cooler box that gradually melts over a
      time period of 24 hours, and similar ice cubes with an additional
      load of whole fishes that are gradually melting and deteriorating
      with time, respectively. In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2,
      the difference in the average internal ambient temperatures
      between the cooler boxes placed in the device and the cooler boxes
      without the device are negative (i.e. the internal ambient
      temperature of the cooler boxes placed in the device is lower).
      The standard deviation for both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 is
      about 0.15.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The results observed in the table of FIG. 14 demonstrate
      that the south magnetic field is able to reduce the total energy
      state in the melting ice, such that gaining of heat from the
      environment by the ice to cause the melting process is slowed.
      With the additional load into the cooler box (for this case, the
      whole fishes), the effect on the melting ice and deteriorating
      fish gave rise to higher internal ambient temperature differences
      (i.e. -1.24[deg.] C. compared to -0.66[deg.] C.). The lower
      temperatures observed in the cooler boxes that were exposed to the
      south magnetic field demonstrate the effect on the reduction of
      the rate of heat transfer and absorption in melting ice, and also
      the ability to lower the chemical and biochemical reactions that
      generate additional heat during the fish decomposition process.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIGS. 15(a) and 15(b) are thermal images of a cooler box
      100 containing ice cubes that are placed in a device according to
      the embodiments of the present invention (i.e. exposed to magnetic
      south field), and a cooler box 102 containing ice cubes without
      the device (i.e. not exposed to any magnetic field), respectively.
      The device used is a five-panel open container substantially
      similar to that described earlier in FIG. 8. A thermal image
      analysis provides further evidence to the above explanation on the
      reduction of energy state. Regions of darker shades in the thermal
      images represent areas of lower temperatures. The cooler box 100
      that is exposed to a south magnetic field has more distinct darker
      regions compared to the cooler box 102 that was not exposed to any
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] FIGS. 15(c) and 15(d) are thermal images of the contents of
      the cooler boxes 100, 102 described above, respectively. The
      thermal images were obtained after 10 hours of storage in a room
      environment (28[deg.] C.31[deg.] C.). The remaining ice cubes
      (represented by the darker shaded regions) in the cooler boxes
      100, 102 show that more ice cubes remained in solid form when the
      ice cubes are exposed to the South magnetic field (FIG. 15(c))
      compared to the ice cubes that were not exposed to any magnetic
      field (FIG. 15(d)).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 16(a) illustrates a graph, based on experimental
      results, showing ice thickness against duration of an ice sample
      exposed to a device according to an embodiment of the present
      invention (i.e. exposed to a south magnetic field) and another ice
      sample not exposed to the device (i.e. not exposed to any magnetic
      field). In this experiment, the rate of ice melting is determined
      by the decrease in thickness of the ice samples over time. Crushed
      ice samples are compacted to 65 mm thick ice beds and placed on
      perforated plastic trays. The device is placed at the bottom of
      one of the trays. The ice sample on the tray with the device is
      exposed to the south magnetic field, while the ice sample on the
      tray without the device is not exposed to<br>
