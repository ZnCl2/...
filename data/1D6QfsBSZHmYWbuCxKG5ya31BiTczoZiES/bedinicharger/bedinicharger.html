      It happened on a Saturday night on the Bill Jenkins Show. I was
      invited to speak between the Dodger Baseball game and the news.
      The show had about one hour remaining to the end at 12:00
      midnight.<br>
      <br>
      Bill Jenkins knew nothing about what I was going to talk about
      that night. The time came for us to go on the air and the program
      started. I then proceeded to talk to the audience and I said, "Did
      anyone ever try this experiment: Did you ever try charging two
      capacitors, say about 22,000 microfarads, with 12 volts and then
      putting the two capacitors in series and dumping the charge across
      that same battery?" In the next few minutes the phone lines
      started to light up so I took the first phone call and answered
      the person's question. By the time the next call came up, it was
      time for news. By the time the news was over, I was on my way home
      with Bill.<br>
      <br>
      Well two weeks went by and it came time for the next radio show.
      This is where Ray and Bill showed up. Bill Jenkins called for the
      radio station Chief Engineer, and said to Ray and Bill: "Well Show
      Us what You Got." Bill said, "WE HAVE A SCALAR WAVE BATTERY
      CHARGER." The Engineer said, "Sure you do." Bill said, "We do. We
      built this to John Bedini's plan." The Engineer said "OK, LET'S
      TEST IT." About this time Bill threw the switch on the side of the
      box , the lights and the motor started to run and Bill said to the
      station Engineer, "GO AHEAD MEASURE THE BATTERY." The station
      Engineer put the best meter the station owned across the battery.
      The Engineer looked over to Bill Jenkins and Me and said, "I do
      not believe this. This battery for all practical purposes is dead
      but yet it's running the lights and the motor and the battery is
      not running down."<br>
      <br>
      For weeks after that the station was flooded with calls from
      people trying to find out where they could find this Bill and Ray.
      About one month after that I got a phone call from Bill. He said
      "Would you like to come over to my house. I said, "Sure." I got to
      his house and we talked for about two hours. At the end of our
      talk I asked Bill if I could have a copy of the circuit diagram.
      He said, "Sure. After all,you invented the thing."<br>
      <br>
      This is where the bad part comes in. What the hell happened to
      Bill and Ray with this box? They never did anything with it. Here
      is the good part, the circuit diagram as he drew it I have only
      copied it in my paint program. IT'S YOURS, HAVE FUN. I NEVER BUILT
      IT. I ONLY HAD AN IDEA ABOUT A PORTABLE BATTERY CHARGER YOU NEVER
      HAD TO PLUG INTO THE WALL FOR POWER.<br>
      <br>
      Some things in the circuit look wrong to me. But this is the
      circuit just the way I received it. So that's what I'm putting on
      the page. I have not studied this circuit and I haven't built it.
      I'm just giving you the information.<br>
      <br>
      WARNING: BATTERY COULD EXPLODE IF YOU HAVE FAULTY CONNECTIONS.
      BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br>
      <br>
      Good Luck<br>

          CHARGER/REJUVENATOR COMING SOON!</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      John Bedini's 2.5A12-EX (Extreme) battery charger and rejuvenator
      is the #1 most requested item from the Tesla Chargers product
      line. Although these have been out of production for almost 5
      months, we still get emails almost on a daily basis asking us when
      these are going to be available again. Good news! We expect to be
      shipping these sometime in May! Visit Tesla Chargers and join the
      Tesla Chargers mailing list to be notified when we are accepting
      pre-orders. http://teslachargers.com<br>
      <br>
      If you are unfamiliar with what is so special about these
      chargers, they can bring back about 80% of the batteries that are
      doomed for the scrap yard that nothing else can bring back and we
      can rejuvenate them so that they have 80-110% of the brand new
      manufacturer's rated capacity! And if you periodically charge your
      12v flooded cell lead acid batteries that are in good shape with
      this, you will extend their life beyond what you can imagine. Just
      saving a few batteries pays for the unit, so it's a no-brainer
      that this charger is a must have for any family or business.<br>

      Additional comment :<br>
      <br>
      The most strange event is that after 19 hours of running time, the
      battery voltage drop to 0 volts, and the motor continued to run (
      !!! ?? !!! ). It seemed that the condensators could maintained
      power to supply motor after this first deadline. You could see on
      my report that the charge of battery restart after, for new 4
      hours ( strange and curious event ?? ). I couldn't explain today
      what happened, but it's reality. I don't know if it is the good
      way for overunity, I have the feeling that it isn't......<br>
      <br>
      The clock frequency is 25 Hz ( T=40ms) with cyclic ratio of 50%.<br>
      <br>
      You have the specs of some MosFet bellow :<br>
      <br>
      IRF820 ( MOS-N-FET-e V-MOS, 500V, 2.5A, 50W, &lt;3ohm(1.5A) )<br>
      IRF234 ( MOS-N-FET-e V-MOS, 250V, 8.1A, 75W, &lt;0.45ohm(4.1A)<br>
      BUZ11&nbsp; ( MOS-N-FET-e V-MOS,&nbsp; 50V, 30A,&nbsp; 75W,
      &lt;0.04ohm(19A)<br>
      <br>
      but you can see in these characteristics that the IRF234 have a
      RDS of 0.45ohm Vs 3 ohm for the IRF820. Better RDS is low better
      the result because joules effect losses must be minimized.<br>
      <br>
      The main problem is the stability of the battery charge, I think
      that this device must be used as a demonstrator purpose only but
      not in real operational use (power supply). Because the battery
      don't support the high peak of voltage and if the device is not
      properly tuned it may destroy the battery ( lost of its memory
      effect ). If the charger is correctly tuned it run as a scalar
      charger but it is difficult to tune correctly for long working
      time.<br>
