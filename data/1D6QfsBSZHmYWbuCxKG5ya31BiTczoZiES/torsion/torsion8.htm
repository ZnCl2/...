        <p><b><font color="#000000">Abstract:</font></b> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">It has been found through empirical
            experimentations that the spin field causes various
            properties of a vast array of materials to be transferred,
            with varying degrees of intensity and various degrees of
            impermanency, into other various materials. This is most
            dramatically demonstrated when application of the spin field
            transfers the inebriating properties of alcoholic beverages
            into pure de-ionized water. When this treated water is
            assayed, it is found to be chemically pure water, yet, when
            consumed, it has all the properties of an alcoholic
            beverage, with none of the damaging side effects, such as
            cellular damages, hangover, or a tendency to generate
            obesity. We find that this result is related to the memory
            property of water, and indeed to the memory of space itself,
            which memory is transferred by application of the spin
            field. It is suggested that further experimentation and
            clinical trials should be performed to investigate the
            possibility of applications of spin-altered water in alcohol
            abuse programs.</font> </p>
        <p><b><font color="#000000">Theory:</font></b> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The spin field is described rigorously
            by R. M. Kiehn: [1] [2] [3] From a topological viewpoint,
            Maxwell's electrodynamics indicates that the concept of
            chirality is to be associated with a third rank tensor
            density of Topological Spin induced by the interaction of
            the 4 vector potentials {A, phi } and the field excitations
            (D, H). The distinct concept of helicity is to be associated
            with the third rank tensor field of Topological Torsion
            induced by the interaction of the 4 vector potentials and
            field intensities (E, B). The 4-divergence of the
            topological Spin is equal to the first Poincare Invariant of
            classical electromagnetism. The 4-divergence of the
            topological Torsion is equal to the second Poincare
            Invariant. On space-time domains where either Poincare
            Invariant is zero, the closed integrals of the Spin
            (respectively, Torsion) have values whose ratios are
            rational. That is, both the objects of topological torsion
            and topological spin can be quantized by the deRham
            theorems.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">However, when the 4-divergence of
            Topological Torsion is not zero, the second Poincare
            invariant, E · B, is not zero, and parity is not conserved.
            New time dependent wave solutions to the classical
            homogeneous Maxwell equations in the vacuum have been found.
            These waves are not transverse; they exhibit both torsion
            and spin; they have finite magnetic helicity, a non-zero
            Poynting vector, E x H and a non zero second Poincare
            invariant, E dot B.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Two, four component, rank 3 tensors,
            constructed on topological grounds, in terms of the Fields
            and Potentials, are used to define the concepts of Torsion
            and Spin, even in domains with plasma currents. The
            divergence of the spin pseudo vector generates the Poincare
            invariant equivalent to the Lagrangian of the field,</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">B dot H -D dot E -(A dot J - rho phi).</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The divergence of the Torsion pseudo
            vector generates the second Poincare invariant, E dot B. The
            Poincare invariants have closed integrals, which are
            deformation invariants, and therefore can be used to define
            deformable coherent structures in a plasma. When the second
            Poincare invariant is non-zero, there can exist solutions
            that are not time-reversal invariant.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Put in simpler terms, the spin field
            can be described as a series of propagating helical vortices
            observed as carrying a dense interstitial flux of an array
            of particles, possibly ranging down to the sub-quantum, in
            size. [4] This flux of particles and the spin field helices
            act together, in some not well understood manner, to
            temporarily copy the physical properties of substances into
            other substances. It is this flux of sub-quantum particles,
            which seems to be responsible for the copying ability of the
            spin field.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">In relation to positively charged
            particles, such as the proton, the motion of the spin field
            energy is directed from the periphery to the center. For
            negatively charged particles, the field is directed from the
            center to the periphery. A spin field disturbance moves
            along a helical path in space, with a propagation velocity
            which is typically, significantly less than the speed of
            light. Propagation velocity is determined by the
            longitudinal moment of the impulse, and those parameters of
            the environment which the change the density of the winding
            of the helix of the spin field. For the spin field created
            by the spin field generator, as designed by A. A. Shpilman
            in 1995, [5] the longitudinal momentum of the spin field
            impulse is equal to the impulse of a proton, with an energy
            of 300 electron-volts in air, and 3 electron-volts in
            ferrite. The spin field helices are very sensitive to the
            magnitude and direction of the magnetic vector potential.
            The helices are guided in the direction of the vector
            potential, but not in the direction of the magnetic field!
            Spin fields of protons are guided in the direction of the
            Poynting vector. The space between the spin field helices is
            saturated with particles, which are similar to the neutrino,
            having energy at rest of an electron-volt or less. These
            particles are apparent as threads, composing closed toroidal
            knot-like structures, having various rest masses,
            topologies, characteristic sizes, and a broad spectrum of
            resonant frequencies. Apparently, the rules of gas dynamics
            apply to the interstitial particles associated with the spin
            field helix.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The spin field and the torsion field
            have only recently begun to be investigated in this country.
            However, spin and torsion fields have been studied globally
            for many years. These studies have been particularly
            intensive in Russia, where the spin and torsion fields have
            been investigated for some 50 years. There is now a fairly
            substantial literature on the spin and torsion fields by
            some prominent physics researchers, such as H. Kleinert,[6]</font>

            exclusively with studies of the mathematical theory of the
            spin and torsions field, or getting involved with the more
            esoteric energetic properties of spin and torsion fields, we
            have initiated a series of empirical experiments designed to
            verify the properties of the spin field, and its effects on
            organic living matter, and on inorganic materials. We have
            been particularly interested in observations, which have
            shown that the spin field has the remarkable property of
            copying certain attributes of materials into other materials
            [23], and laboratory results which have shown that

            into water, could be accomplished, as claimed by some of the
            Russian investigators. Very simply, we placed a food-grade
            plastic-coated paper container filled with alcohol, on the
            vertical axis above a container filled with pure de-ionized
            water. We arranged the spin field generator on the vertical

            container. We then drank the water. We were astounded to
            discover that the spin field treated water had an
            intoxicating effect! As the writer is inordinately sensitive
            to alcohol, he was surprised to discover that there were no
            observable side effects. This result was later duplicated
            with several volunteer test subjects, to ensure the
            objectivity of the results. These volunteers reported no
            hangover symptoms after having consumed enough of the water
            to be the equivalent of a respectable "shot" of an 80 proof
            liquor. Based on these limited trials, in this simple
            experimental sequence, we have determined that the
            inebriating properties of the alcohol were indeed
            transferred into the water, where the energetic signature of
            the alcohol was stored, as though a memory, with none of the

            inebriating quality of alcohol into pure water might seem
            astounding, water memory is well known in the practices of
            homeopathy, but it is poorly understood how the homeopathic
            memory of water functions. Brian Josephson, the Nobel
            Laureate, in a letter to the New Scientist,
            http://www.newscientist.com/ns/971101/letters.html (expired
            link) says: "... advocates of homeopathic remedies attribute
            their effects, not to molecules present in the water, but to
            modifications of the water's structure. Simple-minded
            analysis may suggest that water, being a fluid, cannot have
            a structure of the kind that such a picture would demand.
            But cases such as that of liquid crystals, which while
            flowing like an ordinary fluid can maintain an ordered
            structure over macroscopic distances, show the limitations
            of such ways of thinking. There have not, to the best of my
            knowledge, been any refutations of homeopathy that remain
            valid after this particular point is taken into account.

        <p><font color="#000000">According to the Encyclopaedia
            Britannica, "... The water molecule is not linear but bent
            in a special way. As a result, part of the molecule is
            negatively charged and part positively charged. It is thus a
            highly polar molecule. Hydrogen atoms in water molecules are
            attracted to regions of high electron density and can form
            weak linkages, called hydrogen bonds, with those regions.
            This means that the hydrogen atoms in one water molecule are
            attracted to the non-bonding electron pairs of the oxygen
            atom on an adjacent water molecule. As a result, water
            molecules associate strongly. In an ice crystal, the
            association is a highly ordered but loose structure.

            more closely together. This makes the liquid denser than the
            solid, which is why ice forms on top of liquid water. The
            associative force, however, is still strong enough to
            prevent water molecules from separating completely even at
            room temperature. This continued association in the liquid
            state accounts for the high boiling point of water. The
            structure of liquid water is believed to consist of
            aggregates of water molecules that form and re-form
            continually. This short-range order, as it is called,
            accounts for other unusual properties of water, such as its
            high viscosity and surface tension. The polarity of the
            water molecule plays a major part in the formation of
            aqueous solutions...."</font> </p>

            clusters of water molecules exist optimally in certain Magic
            Numbers and in configurations such as Buckyball pentagonal
            dodecahedral structures with a closed, ideally icosahedral
            symmetry formed by 20 hydrogen-bonded water molecules, with
            their oxygen atoms at the vertices of 12 concatenated
            pentagons and with 10 free exterior hydrogen atoms. Coupling
            of these delocalized oxygen orbitals with the low-frequency
            cluster vibronic modes via the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect
            may make water buckyballs catalytic electron reservoirs and
            oxygenates in fuel combustion and active agents in
            biological systems. The broad electronic and unique
            low-frequency vibronic spectra of water buckyballs may

            http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/Tucson/4.htm - Water's memory
            notes that the tetrahedral Hydrogen bonds of water are not
            'fixed' in time and space. Even in frozen water Ice, the
            tetrahedral bonds from Oxygen to Oxygen are each half
            covalent and half Hydrogen, unlike the purely covalent
            Carbon-Carbon tetrahedral bonds of Diamond. The tetrahedral
            Hydrogen water bonds are able to re-shuffle at the rate of
            about a trillion times per second. The manner in which this
            re-shuffling occurs is described by a probability function
            and may be represented by a random binary network, similar
            to that of a computer. From the perspective of cybernetics,
            the Hydrogen bond network in water may be considered a
            self-organizing system that behaves chaotically. Water
            molecules that are in contact with other surfaces (e.g. air)
            or with solutes (e.g. salts, organic molecules) arrange
            themselves into a variety of geometries that impart changes
            to the network. In this manner, water is capable of
            discerning 'self'' from 'non-self' and interacting with its
            environment. Recent findings suggest that the breaking and
            forming of Hydrogen bonds between macromolecules and
            surrounding water molecules substantially influences the 3-D
            structure of proteins and nucleic acids.</font> </p>

            in plumbing by "hard water". It was demonstrated that this

            ability of the spin field generator to transfer properties
            between materials, we shall invoke the experimental results
            of V. Poponin, which show that even the vacuum, space
            itself, has this property of having a memory.
            http://twm.co.nz/~sai/DNAPhantom.htm</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">V. Poponin’s experiments at Lebedev
            University in Moscow, and at the Heart-Math Institute in
            Arizona, have shown that the electromagnetic signature of a
            hermetically sealed sample of DNA will persist in a vacuum
            chamber for periods as long as 30 days, after the sample is
            removed. According to Poponin, the memory of the vacuum can
            be described as a localized excitation in a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
            lattice. The FPU lattice is the Hamiltonian of an
            n-dimensional system of loosely coupled (anharmonic)
            oscillators.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">These experimental data suggest that
            localized excitations of DNA phantom fields are long living
            and can exist in non-moving and slowly propagating states.
            This type of behavior is distinctly different from the
            behavior demonstrated by other well known nonlinear
            localized excitations such as solitons, which are currently
            considered to be the best explanation of how vibrational
            energy propagates through the DNA.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">It is a remarkable and striking
            coincidence that a new class of localized solutions to
            anharmonic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice (FPU), Nonlinear
            Localized Excitations (NLE), which have been recently
            obtained, demonstrate very similar dynamical features to
            those of the DNA phantom. Nonlinear localized excitations
            predicted by the FPU model also have unusually long
            life-times. Furthermore, they can exist in both stationary
            and slowly propagating forms. In Figure 3, one example of a
            NLE is shown which illustrates three stationary localized
            excitations generated by numerical simulation using the FPU
            model.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">It is worthy to note that this NLE has
            a surprisingly long life-time. Here, we present only one of
            the many possible examples of the patterns for stationary
            excitations which are theoretically predicted. Slowly
            propagating and long lived NLE are also predicted by this
            theory. Note that the FPU model can successfully explain the
            diversity and main features of the DNA phantom dynamical
            patterns. This model is suggested as the basis for a more
            general nonlinear quantum theory which may explain many of
            the observed subtle energy phenomena and eventually could
            provide a physical theory of consciousness.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">According to our current hypothesis,
            the DNA phantom effect may be interpreted as a manifestation
            of a new physical vacuum substructure which has been
            previously overlooked. It appears that this substructure can
            be excited from the physical vacuum in a range of energies
            close to zero energy provided certain specific conditions
            are fulfilled which are specified above.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Furthermore, one can suggest that the
            DNA phantom effect is a specific example of a more general
            category of electromagnetic phantom effects. This suggests
            that the electromagnetic phantom effect is a more
            fundamental phenomenon which can be used to explain other
            observed phantom effects including the phantom leaf effect
            and the phantom limb.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">From this, we think that the spin field
            is acting as a carrier of the non-linear excitations of the
            vacuum, by way of the previously described species of
            sub-quantum particles in the interstitial spaces internal to
            the spin field helices. What we are saying then, is that due
            to a memory mechanism similar to the description by V.
            Poponin of the memory of the vacuum, that the spin field is
            transporting the actual particles that comprise the FPU
            lattice, into the volume of effect the spin field, thereby
            transporting the memory of the vacuum which resided in that
            first location, into the volume and any materials which are
            present at the second location.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Thus, we feel that the spin field is
            duplicating the electromagnetic 4-vector patterning, which
            was contained in the volume containing the alcohol, into the
            volume containing the water, where it should remain for some
            time. We intend to determine at a later date, the latency of
            the memory medium, which is imparted by the spin field into
            water. At this time, our preliminary results have shown that
            the memory thus imparted to the water will last for
            approximately 14 days.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The most important application, we
            feel, for this remarkable property of spin field memory
            transfer, is in the treatment of alcohol abusers. Because,
            although the alcohol memory imparted into the water
            structure has the capacity to cause inebriation, at the same
            time, preliminary sample testing has shown that the water so
            treated does not engender any hangover. This is obvious,
            since we know that the hangover is a by-product of the
            breakdown of the alcohol by the systems of the physical
            body, while pure water has no such effect. Additionally,
            because this is just pure water, prolonged and dense
            consumption of spin field treated water will apparently not
            result in any physical damage to the body systems, such as
            jaundice, which can result from alcohol toxicity. There is
            no physical toxicity in the physical body related to
            ingestion of standard levels of pure water.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">We are concerned however, whether the
            toxic properties of the alcohol can be transferred in any
            degree, however minute, into the water, by application of
            the spin field. Because no hangover results from the treated
            water, and because the volunteers have stated that the
            alcohol-like exhilarations ceased in about an hour, relative
            to the normal eight hours which would be expected in the
            case of the consumption of actual alcohol, we think that
            there will probably be no toxicity found due to the treated
            water. Also, because it is just water, prolonged consumption
            of spin field treated water should not be expected to result
            in any increase in obesity. We also expect that the common
            symptom of desiccation in alcohol abusers will be greatly
            alleviated, if not eliminated, when spin field treated water
            is substituted for actual alcohol. We expect incidences of
            hospitalization due to the toxic effects of alcohol on the
            human physiology will be greatly reduced when this spin
            field derived ersatz alcohol is used to replace actual
            alcohol. We expect that the overall health of alcohol
            abusers will be substantially improved when spin field
            treated water replaces alcohol consumption. This regimen
            would then reduce the concomitant economic and emotional
            burdens on the State, and the families of alcohol abusers,
            while prolonging the life expectancy of abusers who use the
            water substitute.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">We think that it is possible that the
            treated water will alleviate some of the more dramatic
            effects of alcohol detoxification. We think that it is also
            possible that the treated water may eliminate or reduce
            alcohol dependencies, particularly physical dependencies.
            These two possibilities should be examined experimentally.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">We suggest that a series of standard
            clinical trials should be performed to verify these various
            preliminary results of consumption of spin field treated
            water in alcoholics and to substantiate the positive
            potentials for health improvements which may result by this
            application of the spin field in the treatment of
            alcoholics. We further suggest that the spin field and its
            potential for additional medical applications should undergo
            intensive experimental study.</font> </p>
