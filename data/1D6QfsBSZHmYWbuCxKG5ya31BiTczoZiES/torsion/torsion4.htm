      <p><b>9.1 -- EVERY ATOM IS A TORSION GENERATOR</b> </p>
      <p>Kozyrev’s work and others have shown us that all matter
        harnesses torsion waves to sustain its existence. In the last
        two chapters we saw that an atom is actually a vortex of
        aetheric energy, where the negatively-charged electron clouds
        are pressing in towards the positively-charged nucleus via the
        Biefield-Brown effect. We also have seen that geometry is a
        major factor in the quantum realm, since it represents the
        natural form that vibration creates in a fluidlike medium. These
        naturally occurring aetheric vibrations will cause atoms that
        are released from a tiny nozzle to gather into perfectly
        geometric microclusters, which act as one large atom in their
        own right. These vibrations are also responsible for the
        formation of quasi-crystals, where a rapidly-cooled metallic
        alloy forms into a geometri structure that cannot be created by
        individual “particle” atoms, but only by those atoms blending
        together into a larger whole. </p>
      <p>Again, the key is that these geometric forms are being created
        by vibration. In order for this vibration to occur, an atom must
        be constantly absorbing and radiating aetheric energy at the
        same time. As this vibration continues, the atom will throw off
        torsion waves into the surrounding aether. This means that every
        atom is a torsion generator, and depending on its overall “spin
        polarization,” i.e. whether there is a greater amount of
        right-handed or left-handed spin in its electron clouds, the
        object will either generate left-handed or right-handed torsion
        waves. Larger “bulk” groupings of atoms into common physical
        objects would obviously follow the same rules. </p>
      <p>So, let’s say that you have an object whose atoms are more
        heavily polarized for right-handed spin as opposed to
        left-handed spin. Now, let’s move back to our analogy of a
        sponge that is submerged in water. The vibrations at work will
        cause the sponge to be continually expanding and contracting in
        size at a very fast speed. If the sponge is a perfect sphere,
        then the sponge will be throwing off an equal amount of water in
        all directions at a steady flow rate. However, if the sponge
        were shaped into a cone, then each time that the sponge
        contracts, a greater amount of water will shoot out of the top
        of the cone as opposed to the other areas. This is easily
        visualized with the analogy of seeing water passing through a
        funnel. In the case of this analogy, the top of the cone would
        be releasing right-handed torsion waves. </p>
      <p>Thus, since every atom is throwing off torsion waves as it
        vibrates, certain shapes can help harness and direct this
        torsional energy flow more than others. Obviously, any of the
        Platonic Solids would be in this category, but other shapes can
        harness torsion waves without necessarily being Platonic Solids.
        Dr. Victor Grebennikov discovered such phenomena in the “cavity
        structural effect” or CSE, through his study of insects. In this
        chapter, we shall also discuss Dr. Golod, Dr. Krasnoholovets,
        Joe Parr and others’ surprising research on the power of the
        pyramid shape to harness torsional energy. </p>
      <p><b>9.2 --&nbsp; MAJOR CATEGORIES OF TORSION GENERATING DEVICES</b>
      </p>
      <p>As described in Nasonov’s groundbreaking torsion studies, there
        are four major categories of devices that will produce a
        measurable torsion-field effect: </p>
      <p>1. Objects with specially organized spin polarization. A magnet
        is the most common material that fits into this first category.
        Every atom has a combination of “right” spin and “left” spin in
        the electron clouds, and this is known as the “spin
        polarization” of the atom. Any bulk object will have an overall
        spin polarization, which is the sum of all the different spins
        in the atoms comprising it. In a magnet, all molecules are
        aligned in north-south magnetic polarization, and this creates
        strong torsion waves as well as a magnetic field. Czech
        researcher Pavilta was able to produce similar effects in
        non-magnetic materials, as documented in Psychic Discoveries. </p>
      <p>2. Electromagnetic or electrostatic torsion generators. By
        simply generating an electrostatic or electromagnetic field,
        such as by passing electric current through a coil of wire, you
        will also produce measurable torsion waves. Generators using
        this principle have been created and tested by S.V. Avramenko,
        G.F. Ignatjev, G.A. Sergejev, S.N. Tarakhtiy and many others. </p>
      <p>3. Objects with specially organized rotation. By rotating
        either magnetic or non-magnetic materials in certain specific
        patterns and speeds, torsion fields can be generated. In Russia,
        this method has been used by A.I. Veinik, K.N. Perebeinos, V.M.
        Yuritovsky, V.V. Bobyr and many others. Such generators have
        been well described in our previous volume, as many researchers
        have created “overunity” or free-energy devices using these
        principles to extract energy directly from the aether itself.
        Gravity-defying craft, such as the SEG device by Professor
        Searl, have also been created using this method. </p>
      <p>4. Objects that distort the geometry of the physical vacuum. As
        Nasonov indicates,&nbsp; “Every object having a certain surface
        geometry will simultaneously generate left and right torsion
        fields of a certain configuration depending on the geometry of
        the object. This fact can be detected by various types of
        physical, chemical and biological indicators. Unusual effects
        demonstrated by pyramids, cones, cylinders, flat triangles, etc.
        were repeatedly observed by many researchers in different
        countries.” This fourth category shall be the main topic of
        discussion in this chapter, and we shall refer to such
        specially-shaped objects as “passive torsion generators.”&nbsp;
        These effects have been studied by A.I. Veinik, V.S.
        Grebennikov, Yu.V. Tszyan Kanchzhen, I.M. Shakhparonov, A.A.
        Beridze-Stakhovsky, A. Golod, V. Krasnoholovetz, Joe Parr and
        others. </p>
      <p>5. Generators that combine characteristics of the previous four
        categories. Certain devices have been built that combine the
        geometric shape of an object or enclosure (#4) with other
        torsion-wave generating properties such as seen in numbers 1-3,
        producing remarkable results. These studies will also be
        discussed in this and later chapters, and have been performed by
        Yu.V. Tszyan Kanchzhen, V.P. Kaznacheev, Joe Parr and the
        authors of the 1979 French patent #2421531, among others. </p>
      <p><b>9.3 -- CHANGES IN THE SPIN POLARIZATION OF AN ATOM ARE
          POSSIBLE</b> </p>
      <p>Before we go on, we should note here that the spin polarization
        of an atom is not necessarily fixed in either a right-handed or
        left-handed direction. The Institute of Material Research in
        Kiev, Ukraine performed a series of experiments where an object
        was exposed to torsion radiation created by the third process in
        the above list. They found that if the torsion radiation was
        strong enough, then the spin state of the atoms themselves could
        be changed. Later in this chapter we will see that these changes
        can eventually be substantial enough to alter the structure and
        appearance of a material, such as the color of granite and the
        sharpness of a razor blade. </p>
      <p>Even more interestingly, the Institute of Material Research
        also determined that people with strong psychic abilities were
        also capable of creating identical changes in the spin
        polarization of various substances by the sheer focus of their
        consciousness. No other known technologies could create such
        changes in a physical object. This again suggests that
        consciousness and torsion-waves are actually one and the same
        --- and in the Russian and Ukranian pyramid research of this
        chapter we will see more of the mounting evidence that points
        towards this conclusion. </p>
      <p><b>9.4 -- AETHERIC ENERGY INTAKE POSSIBLY MOST IMPORTANT FOR
          HEALTH</b> </p>
      <p>In this chapter, we will also begin feeling the weight of
        evidence that suggests that aetheric energy intake is actually
        the most important ingredient in the health of an organism, and
        that conventional processes of respiration, ingestion and
        sunlight exposure are only part of the puzzle – perhaps
        important only to the degree that each process is capable of
        continually renewing our supply of aetheric energy. Certain
        “non-eating saints” profiled in Autobiography of a Yogi by
        Paramahansa Yogananda and other sources have arrived at the
        point where they sustain the health of their physical bodies
        directly from this energy source, without eating or drinking.
        (We absolutely do not advise our readers to attempt this, as it
        could be fatal.) </p>
      <p><b>9.5 -- TORSION WAVES ARE “PHI” SPIRALS</b> </p>
      <p>Another point that should be mentioned early along in this
        chapter comes from the research into passive torsion generators
        and the cavity structural effect that was conducted by the A.E.
        Akimov group at the Physics Institute of the Ukraine Academy of
        Sciences and at Chernovitsky University. They were particularly
        interested in studying the effects that cones of different sizes
        would have upon various processes. From this research, it was
        determined that: The best passive torsion generators were formed
        by cones that were shaped into the “phi” ratio of 1 to 0.618.
        What this tells us is that torsion waves are indeed “phi”
        spirals, since a cone that duplicates this pattern will harness
        the waves most strongly. </p>
      <p><b>9.6 -- GREBENNIKOV AND THE “CAVITY STRUCTURAL EFFECT”</b> </p>
      <p>Russian scientist Dr. Victor Grebennikov is an entomologist,
        meaning that he works especially with insects. He first
        discovered the “cavity structural effect” when he ended up
        working too late in the steppes of the Kamyshlovo valley and
        tried to fall asleep relatively near the edge of a cliff. Deep
        in the side of the cliff just beneath him were massive “bee
        cities” with multitudes of tunnels and chambers created by an
        incredible number of different hives that had all formed within
        the same area. So many bees had made their homes there that the
        entire cliff face looked like a piece of Swiss cheese, and in
        places it was so porous that it almost looked like a sponge. </p>
      <p>As Grebennikov tried to fall asleep above these gently humming,
        living bee cities, he started to experience very bizarre effects
        that were too powerful to ignore. First his body felt as if it
        were continually expanding and contracting in size, while also
        feeling as if it were in a state of free-fall. Then, as the
        effect intensified, he began to see flashes in front of his eyes
        that would continue to appear whether his eyes were open or
        closed. His mouth suddenly had a strong metallic taste as if he
        had pressed his tongue onto the contact plates of a nine-volt
        battery, and he also experienced a loud ringing in his ears and
        an enhanced awareness of his heartbeat. When he moved as little
        as five feet away from this particular spot, all the effects
        would cease, but when he returned to the spot the effects would
        come back. </p>
      <p>For many years he wondered why he had experienced these effects
        without producing any solid explanation. Then, one day he had a
        wide container filled with spongy clay lumps from the original
        nest site sitting out on his desk. These lumps had
        honeycomb-style cavities inside them where the larvae had grown
        into adult bees. As he passed his hand above these porous
        fragments, he felt a sudden sensation of warmth emanating from
        them. When he touched the clay itself with his hand, it was
        cold, but this warm sensation was clearly noticeable above the
        clumps. Grebennikov also noticed a slight jerking or “ticking”
        sensation in his fingers from the clumps as well as the warmth.
        When he leaned over and put his head above the clay lumps, he
        again experienced all of the same bizarre symptoms as he had at
        the original site in the Kamyshlovo valley, including a sense of
        nausea. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9.1 – Clay Lumps from Kamyshlovo Valley bee nests</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grebennikov soon discovered that even if the container was
        covered with a thick metallic lid, the effects would still
        continue. He then took the container of clay honeycomb lumps to
        various institutes within the Agricultural Academy in
        Novosibirsk, where they were tested with thermometers,
        ultrasound detectors, magnetometers, electrometers and the like.
        None of these instruments responded to the nests in any unusual
        fashion. Precise chemical analyses of the clay showed no
        anomalies, and a radiometer showed no effect either. However, as
        Grebennikov indicated, "…ordinary human hands, and not only
        mine, would distinctly feel either warmth or cold, or a tingle,
        or sometimes a thicker, stickier environment. Some people’s
        hands felt heavier, others felt lighter as if pushed up. Some
        people’s fingers and arm muscles got numb, some felt giddy and
        developed profuse salivatio". </p>
      <p>Later, Grebennikov discovered that artificial honeycombs
        created from plastic, paper, metal and wood could create the
        same effects, if the basic structure of the bee nests were
        adhered to. As he wrote in his book, "It turned out that the
        cause of all those unusual sensations was not a biological
        field, but the size, shape, quantity and arrangement of cavities
        formed by and in any solid object. And as before, the organism
        felt it, while the instruments remained silent. I called the
        discovery the Cavity Structures Effect (CSE)…" Then, Grebennikov
        goes on to explain some of the biological effects that were
        noticed from the Cavity Structure Effect: "Nature has continued
        to reveal to me its innermost secrets one after another. It has
        turned out that the CSE zone inhibits the growth of saprophytic
        soil bacteria, inhibits the growth of yeast and other similar
        cultures as well as it inhibits wheat grain germination. The
        behavior of microscopic agile chlamydospores also changes in
        this effective zone. Leaf cutting bee larvae begin to
        phosphoresce [glow with light], while adult bees are much more
        active in this field and finish pollination two weeks earlier
        than they would otherwise. It has turned out that this CSE, same
        as gravitation, can’t be shielded." </p>
      <p>We shall see that although the insect-based Cavity Structural
        Effect inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeast, wheat grains and
        the like, the pyramid-related experiments show an opposite
        effect. This shows how the cavity structural effect seems to
        absorb torsion-wave energy away from most biological systems,
        whereas the concentrated energy inside of a pyramid will enhance
        them. </p>
      <p>In this next excerpt on the CSE, think back to Kozyrev’s
        discoveries that were discussed in the first chapter. Torsion
        fields are certainly capable of moving through solid matter
        without losing any of their strength. Furthermore, here again we
        see the “phantom” effect or “polarization of the vacuum” that
        Kozyrev and others observed:&nbsp; [The CSE field] affects
        living organisms through walls, thick metal and any other
        screens. It has turned out that if a porous object were moved, a
        person would not feel the change in CSE location immediately,
        but a few seconds or minutes later. While the old location would
        retain a “trace,” or as I called it a “phantom” of the CSE field
        perceivable by the hand for hours and sometimes for months
        thereafter. In this next passage we find additional support for
        the concept of “nested spheres” of energy, which in this case
        are formed by the cavity structural effect: </p>
      <p>"It has turned out that the CSE field did not decrease evenly
        with distance, but surrounded the honeycomb with a system of
        invisible, yet sometimes clearly perceivable “shells.”
        Grebennikov goes on to remind us that we are constantly
        surrounded by these effects, and that we therefore have an
        innate ability to adapt to such changes in our environment so
        that we are not bothered by them: It has turned out that animals
        (white mice) and humans entering the zone of the CSE field (even
        a very strong one) would soon adapt to it. It couldn’t be
        otherwise. We are surrounded everywhere by cavities, large and
        small, surrounded by grids and cells of living and dead plants
        (as well as our own cells.) We are surrounded by bubbles of foam
        rubber, foam plastic, foam concrete, rooms, corridors, halls,
        roofing, spaces between machine parts, trees, furniture and
        buildings. The next point should again remind us of Kozyrev’s
        findings, showing how the energy streaming into the Earth and
        the energy streaming away from the Sun have direct effects on
        this process: It has turned out that the CSE “ray” had a
        stronger impact on living organisms when it was directed away
        from the sun and also downwards, facing the Earth center. Next,
        we see where Grebennikov unknowingly replicated Kozyrev’s
        findings that show that time itself can be sped up or slowed
        down in the presence of torsion-wave energy: </p>
      <p>It has turned out that clocks, both mechanical and electronic,
        run inaccurately when placed in a strong CSE field. The CSE
        seems to have an effect on time too. All this is a manifestation
        of the will of matter, constantly moving and transforming and
        existing eternally. Grebennikov built detectors for torsion-wave
        energy that were relatively similar to Kozyrev’s, albeit far
        less complex. The key to remember here again is that these
        spiraling waves do exert a subtle pressure on physical matter
        that is detectable with sensitive instruments: I have managed to
        devise instruments for an objective registration of the CSE,
        which react accurately to the proximity of insect nests during
        all this time. Here they are in the drawings. They are sealed
        [glass] vessels with straws, burnt twigs or drawing coals
        suspended on spider web threads in them, with some water on the
        bottom countering the effects of static electricity, which
        hinders such experiments in dry air. If you point an old wasp
        nest, a bee honeycomb or a bunch of cereal ears at the upper end
        of the indicator, it turns slowly a few dozen degrees around.
        This is no miracle… Those who have doubts are welcome to visit
        the Agroecology Museum near Novosibirsk and see it all for
        themselves… </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9.2 – Grebennikov’s CSE detectors in action.</b> </p>
      <p>This next citation gives remarkable evidence for the ability of
        a bumble bee to feel the CSE from its hive even through a
        half-meter thick brick wall: "I’ve had reports of highly
        unpleasant effects of a few wasp nests in an attic. Besides
        that, most multiple cell devices and objects with a manifested
        CSE field have a far from beneficial effect on humans in the
        first few minutes. Honey bee combs are a rare exception. I have
        often observed the bumblebees living in our Isilkul flat in the
        1960s. A young bumble bee did not take the trouble to remember
        the entrance to the hive and it would spend hours wandering
        around the windows of our house and of a similar looking house
        nearby on its first trip out of the hive. It would give up on
        its poor visual memory in the evening and it would land on the
        brick wall precisely outside the hive and would try to break
        right through the wall. Now how did the insect know that its
        home nest was right there, four meters away from the entrance to
        the attic and a meter and a half below, behind the thick, half
        meter wall? I was lost at the time in conjectures but now I know
        exactly why the bumble bee behaved in that manner. Now let us
        remember the experiment in which hunter wasps returned not only
        to a given location but even to an entirely different location
        where the lump of soil with their nest had been moved. I do not
        doubt that they were able to find it because of the wave emitter
        created by their nest cavities. In this next passage,
        Grebennikov demonstrates how certain flowers have a shape that
        creates a resonant structure for torsion waves to be generated,
        thus attracting the bees for pollination. Again, we see mention
        of the “phantom effect” or “polarization of the vacuum” when
        Grebennikov discusses how he was able to find these flowers in a
        completely dark room using a stem, charcoal rod or short pencil:
        There was yet another mystery to be revealed to me by my insect
        friends. It has turned out that flowers also use similarly
        powerful and unstoppable wave emitters besides their color, odor
        and nectar in order to attract their pollinators. I have
        discovered it with a drawing charcoal, a burnt twig by passing
        it over large, bell shaped flowers (tulips, lilies, amaryllises,
        mallows or pumpkins). I could feel "braking" of this detector
        already at quite a distance from the flower. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9.3 – Detection of CSE fields from bell-shaped
          flowers.</b> </p>
      <p>I have learned to find a flower in a dark room standing one or
        two meters away from it with this detector, but only if it had
        not been moved. If it were moved, I would detect a "false
        target", the "ghost" field left in its old location, the
        residual "phantom" I have already mentioned. I do not possess
        any super sensory abilities, and any person would be able to do
        the same after some training. One could use a 10 cm long piece
        of a yellow sorghum stem instead of a charcoal rod, or a short
        pencil whose rear end should be facing the flower. Some people
        would be able to feel the flower (a "warm", "cold", or
        "shivering" sensation emanating from it) with their bare hands,
        tongues, or even faces. As many experiments demonstrated,
        children and adolescents are particularly sensitive to these
        waves of matter. In this next passage, Grebennikov describes how
        this system appears to be designed to keep bee nests from
        blending into each other, as well as to keep roots from growing
        into the nests: "When it comes to the bees, which nest
        underground, their "knowledge" of the CSE is vital to them.
        First of all, it enables the builder of a new gallery to stay
        away from the neighboring nests. Otherwise, the entire bee city
        all cut through with intersecting holes would simply collapse.
        Secondly, plant roots cannot be allowed to grow down into the
        galleries and honeycombs and indeed the roots stop growing any
        further a few centimeters away from the honeycomb of tunnels and
        chambers and start growing aside, feeling that nests are near. </p>
      <p>I have confirmed the latter conclusion by my many experiments
        on couching wheat seeds in a strong CSE field, as compared to
        the seeds germinating in the same climatic conditions but in the
        absence of the CSE field. Photographs and drawings show both the
        dying of roots in the experimental batch as well as their sharp
        deviation in a direction away from my artificial honeycomb.
        Therefore, the bees and the weeds back at the lake had made a
        pact long ago and they are another example of the highest
        ecological expediency of all being… Finally, our last passage in
        this chapter from Grebennikov shows how the torsion radiation
        caused anomalous electromagnetic effects, again reminding us of
        Kozyrev’s earlier findings: </p>
      <p>"I will only mention one more thing. My battery powered pocket
        calculator often malfunctioned in the CSE field. It either
        erred, or sometimes its display window failed to light up for
        hours. I used the field of a wasp nest combined with that of my
        two palms. None of these structures had any effect on their own.
        " </p>
      <p><b>9.7 -- RUSSIAN AND UKRANIAN PYRAMID RESEARCH</b> </p>
      <p>Grebennikov’s discoveries with the “cavity structural effect”
        show that long, tubelike structures, especially if gathered in
        bundles, will harness torsion waves in a way that can be
        confusing and damaging to most forms of life. However, he also
        found that if such structures are placed above a person, such as
        in a specially-built chair that he designed, the added torsion
        energy that they draw up from the earth has beneficial health
        properties. Such devices can be built rather simply by gluing
        several large egg crates above each other at their mutually
        shared points and mounting them above a chair where a person
        will sit. </p>
      <p>The beneficial health effects of a person being placed under a
        CSE generator can be duplicated and enhanced with the pyramid
        shape. Grebennikov did a certain degree of interesting research
        in this area, but until Dr. John DeSalvo of the Giza Pyramid
        Research Association published the Russian and Ukranian pyramid
        research of A. Golod, V. Krasnoholovets and associates, the
        complete picture of how much progress had been made in these
        areas was not available online. This research comes from the
        Institute of Physics in Kiev, Ukraine, a basic institution of
        the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, which was one of
        the leading scientific centers in the former USSR and the
        premier military research association. </p>
      <p>Two steep pyramids with 70-degree slope angles were constructed
        in Russia near Moscow, one at a height of 22 meters and another
        at a height of 44 meters [144 feet,] costing over a million
        dollars to build. Over the last 10 years, a total of 17
        different pyramids have been built altogether. In order for the
        pyramid effects to emerge, it was found that no metal could be
        used in the construction of these structures, thus modular
        fiberglass plastics were used instead. The pyramids were aligned
        to the North Star and built away from populated areas in the
        natural countryside. At the base of the 22-meter pyramid, the
        fiberglass wall was 36 centimeters thick, and at the base of the
        44-meter pyramid the fiberglass wall was 70 centimeters thick.
        The 22-meter pyramid weighed a total of 25 tons and the 44-meter
        pyramid weighed a total of 55 tons. Several different teams from
        the Russian Academy of Sciences carried out all sorts of
        experiments in these pyramids, with surprising results. [These
        results are discussed in greater scientific detail in the
        article, referenced at the end of this chapter.] </p>
      <p><b>9.7.1 -- STRENGTHENING OF ANTI-VIRAL MEDICINE</b> </p>
      <p>The first study cited in Dr. Krasnoholovets’ summary paper is
        by Prof. S.M. Klimenko and D.N. Nosik, MD from the Ivanovskii
        R&amp;D Institute of Virology within the Russian Academy of
        Medical Science. This study involved the drug venoglobulin,
        which is a naturally-occurring antiviral compound in human
        beings. When the drug was diluted into a concentration of 50
        micrograms per milliliter and stored in the pyramid for a time,
        it then became approximately three times more effective at
        fighting viruses than it normally would. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.2 -- STRENGTHENING OF HEALING BENEFITS OF GLUCOSE AND
          WATER</b> </p>
      <p>The team of Prof. A.G. Antonov from the Russian R&amp;D
        Institute of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology tested the
        effects of a solution of 40% glucose in distilled water after it
        had been stored in the pyramid. By administering only 1
        milliliter of the glucose to 20 different prematurely born
        infant patients with compromised immune systems, their levels of
        health were seen to rapidly increase up to practically normal
        values. The researchers furthermore discovered that the glucose
        was not necessary, as the same effect could be produced by
        simply using 1 milliliter of ordinary water that had been stored
        in the pyramid. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.3 -- INCREASED HEALING RESPONSE FOR ORGANISMS WITHIN
          PYRAMID</b> </p>
      <p>Another study was performed by Dr. N.B. Egorova at the
        Mechnikov R&amp;D Institute within the Russian Academy of
        Medical Science. In this study, the torsion-wave harnessing
        capability of the pyramid was tested directly on living
        organisms placed inside. An experimental and a control group of
        white underbred mice weighing 12 to 14 grams were both tainted
        with strain 415 of the virus S.typhimurium in equal amounts over
        the course of one day. In smaller doses of contamination, the
        mice stored in the pyramid survived at a rate of 60% whereas
        only 7% survived in the control group. In larger doses of
        contamination, 30% of the mice in the pyramid survived as
        opposed to only 3% in the control group. In other experiments,
        mice were exposed to various carcinogens, and an experimental
        group drank water from the pyramid whereas the control group
        drank ordinary water. The mice drinking the pyramid water had
        significantly fewer tumors develop than the mice drinking the
        ordinary water. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.4 -- CHANGES OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF MATERIALS IN
          PYRAMID</b> </p>
      <p>Prof. V.I. Kostikov and Dr. A.C. Katasonov from the R&amp;D
        Institute “Graphite” within the Russian Academy of Sciences
        performed various studies on the changes in electrical
        resistance that can be induced by a pyramid structure. In one
        example, a pyrocarbon material was tested that normally had a
        resistance of 5 to 7 micro-ohms. After a one-day stay in the
        pyramid, the material became 200% more resistant to electric
        current, which is an abnormal effect for pyrocarbon. Irradiating
        the same material with ~10^19 neutrons per square meter would
        only change the resistance of the pyrocarbon by about 5% in
        comparison. Similarly, silicon semiconductors would have an
        exponential lowering of their electrical resistance, moving from
        10^5 to 10^4 ohms per centimeter, and high-temperature
        superconducting materials would lose their superconductive
        properties after a one-day stay in the pyramid. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.5 -- ROCKS FROM PYRAMID DISTRIBUTE ELECTRICAL CHARGES
          MORE EVENLY</b> </p>
      <p>A group of researchers from the All-Russian Electrotechnical
        Institute in Moscow conducted an experiment to demonstrate how
        pyramid-charged rocks could dissipate strong electric charges,
        rendering them less harmful. The setup involved a flat metallic
        plate that was zapped by positively-charged electric blasts at
        up to 1400 kilovolts in intervals between 250 and 2500
        microseconds. The electric blasts were generated by a rod that
        was suspended 5 meters above the metallic plate. Each of these
        blasts will typically “discharge” and burn up a portion of the
        metallic plate, which is known as a “defeat,” and these defeats
        are logged and plotted. </p>
      <p>Two identical systems of this type, and experimental and a
        control, were created. In the experimental system, seven
        100-gram chunks of granite that had been stored inside the
        pyramid were then placed on the flat plate in a one-meter wide
        ring. The researchers discovered that there were five times more
        burn marks on the control plate as opposed to the experimental
        plate. Obviously, normal granite rocks would not produce such an
        effect – only those that have stayed in the pyramid. It seems
        that the rocks exposed to the torsion fields in the pyramid were
        much more capable of distributing the electrical charges. This
        appears to be due to the fact that the electron clouds of the
        atoms in the rocks became more uniformly spin-polarized in the
        pyramid, thus helping to absorb and spread out electrical
        charges more evenly. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6 -- A.A. GOLOD’S PYRAMID EXPERIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Five major categories of experiments, as follows, were
        performed by a team of researchers from the Scientific
        Manufacturing Union Gidrometpribor in Russia, directed by A.A.
        Golod. </p>
      <p>9.7.6.1 -- <b>WATER DOES NOT FREEZE IN THE PYRAMID UNLESS
          DISTURBED</b> </p>
      <p>In the first experiment, plastic bottles of distilled water
        were kept in the pyramid over the course of three winter months.
        During this time, the air temperature in the pyramid sank as low
        as -38° C, or -6° F. Thermometers inside the bottles revealed
        that the temperature of the water was the same as the
        below-freezing air temperatures surrounding them, yet the water
        remained in a liquid form and would not turn into ice! However,
        if the water in any of the bottles was shaken or bumped in any
        way, it would immediately start crystallizing and quickly turn
        into a block of ice. Golod and his associates have videotaped
        these results. </p>
      <p>This first experiment obviously suggests that the presence of
        the torsion-wave energy was able to keep the water molecules
        from crystallizing into ice, yet a simple disruption in the
        harmonic stillness of the water would cause this equilibrium to
        disappear and ice would quickly form. One slight bump on the
        edge of the bottle would disrupt the even flow of the torsion
        radiation and allow the molecules to begin crystallizing. </p>
      <p>This same experiment also showed that water would retain its
        purity indefinitely while within the pyramid. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6.2 -- VISIBLE RINGS FORM IN ROCKS SCATTERED INSIDE THE
          PYRAMID</b> </p>
      <p>In the second of Golod’s experiments, chunks of granite and
        crystal were scattered along the floor of the pyramid for longer
        periods of time. A visible ring would appear evenly throughout
        the chunks, showing a clear change in the appearance of the
        stones when under the torsion-wave influence. Between the end of
        1997 and the beginning of 1999, this result was able to be
        duplicated 40 different times in the same pyramid, with
        different rocks each time. Each ring would cover between 50 and
        300 rocks, with a total weight from 20 to 200 kilograms. Golod
        et al. have gathered evidence to suggest that when the rings
        form most visibly, the amount of epidemics in the surrounding
        area will decrease. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6.3 -- A COLUMN OF “UNKNOWN ENERGY” APPEARS ABOVE THE
          PYRAMID</b> </p>
      <p>In the third of Golod’s experiments, the Joint-stock company
        “R&amp;D Institute TTR” conducted studies of the air above the
        pyramid with a Russian instrument similar to radar known as a
        “military locator.” A column of “unknown energy” was detected at
        a width of 500 meters and a height of 2000 meters. Further
        studies confirmed that a larger circle of this energy surrounded
        the area above the pyramid in a 300-kilometer-wide range, with
        the highest concentration being directly above the vertical
        fulcrum of the pyramid. Golod’s team calculated that if such an
        energy column were to be produced electromagnetically, it would
        require all the energy of the various power plants in Russia
        combined. Furthermore, less rigorous was the observation that
        after the pyramid’s presence was established, an ozone hole that
        had existed over that area of Russia was seen to repair itself
        in only two months’ time. </p>
      <p>This column of unseen energy did have other immediate uses and
        effects as well. Electrical energy from the pyramid could be
        harnessed by a capacitor that was placed at the apex of the
        pyramid; the capacitor would spontaneously take on a charge.
        Furthermore, pieces of the capacitor assembly were seen to break
        away and rise into the air on the energetic column that the
        pyramid was producing. It was also discovered that people
        working near the top of the pyramid might start to experience
        dizziness and nausea, and need to be taken some distance away
        from the pyramid for these effects to subside. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6.4 -- OIL WELLS BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH PYRAMIDS
          ABOVE THEM</b> </p>
      <p>In Golod’s fourth experiment, a series of pyramids were built
        over one of a number of oil wells. It was discovered that the
        viscosity of the oil under the pyramids decreased by 30%, while
        the production rate accordingly increased by 30% compared to the
        surrounding wells. There was a decrease in the amount of
        unwanted materials in the oil, such as gums, pyrobitumen and
        paraffin. These results were confirmed by the Gubkin Moscow
        Academy of Oil and Gas. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6.5 -- AGRICULTURAL SEEDS INCREASE THEIR YIELD</b> </p>
      <p>In Golod’s fifth experiment, agricultural seeds were kept in a
        pyramid for 1 to 5 days before being planted. More than 20
        different seed varieties were planted across tens of thousands
        of hectares. In all cases, the seeds from the pyramid had a 20
        to 100-percent increase in their yield; the plants did not get
        sick and they were not affected by droughts. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.6.6 -- ADDITIONAL PYRAMID EFFECTS RELATED TO BIOLOGY AND
          HEALTH</b> </p>
      <p>Under less strenuous laboratory conditions, Golov’s team
        determined the following: </p>
      <p>a. Poisons and other toxins become less destructive to living
        systems after even a short term of exposure in the pyramid. </p>
      <p>b. Radioactive materials held inside a pyramid would decay more
        rapidly than expected. </p>
      <p>c. Pathogenic viruses and bacteria become significantly less
        damaging to life after being held in the pyramid. </p>
      <p>d. Psychotropic drugs have less of an effect on people either
        staying inside a pyramid or within close range of a pyramid. </p>
      <p>e. Standard solutions such as glucose and iso-osmotic solution
        become effective for treating alcoholism and drug addiction
        after being placed in the pyramid. They can be administered
        either intravenously or outwardly. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.7 -- PYRAMID STUDIES OF DR. YURI BOGDANOV</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. Yuri Bogdanov conducted pyramid studies on behalf of the
        Joint-stock Company, “Scientific and Technological Institute of
        Transcription, Translation and Replication” (TTR), in Kharkiv,
        Ukraine. In one experiment, a 12-meter pyramid was used to
        increase the productivity of wheat by 400% in the Ramenskoe
        settlement of Moscow. The following effects were also
        discovered: </p>
      <p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; The half-life of radioactive carbon was altered
      </p>
      <p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crystallization patterns of salts would
        change </p>
      <p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concrete would change in its strength </p>
      <p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystals would exhibit different optical
        behaviorsIn the biological arena, rabbits and white rats exposed
        to the pyramid gained 200% more endurance and their blood gained
        a higher concentration of leukocytes, or white blood cells. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.7.1 -- WATER PURIFICATION BY PYRAMID POWER</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. Bogdanov also built a complex of pyramids in a town near
        the Arkhangelsk region of Russia by order of the domestic
        administration there. In this case, strontium and heavy metals
        that had contaminated a well were able to be cleared by the
        effects of the pyramids, similar to how unwanted materials were
        filtered out of oil in the above example. In the town of
        Krasnogorskoe near Moscow, a pyramid was constructed that would
        reduce the amount of salt in water, again making it more
        drinkable. </p>
      <p>In addition, Dr. Bogdanov performed many laboratory studies on
        medicinal preparations, fungi and so forth. In the city of Kiev,
        Dr. Bogdanov studied how matter interacts with different
        torsion-field patterns created by various pyramid shapes, and
        these investigations also studied how the consciousness of the
        person would affect these energy fields. These studies were
        performed by a torsion-wave detecting device that he named the
        “Tesey,” which allows its user to detect peculiar properties in
        a particular geological feature, energetic “breathing” activity
        in the Earth as well as the torsion effects of various buildings
        including pyramids. These results were discussed on the
        Conference on Problems of Harmonization of Mankind, held in
        Kiev, and were subsequently published. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.8 -- INCREASED HARDNESS AND PURITY OF SYNTHESIZED
          CRYSTALS</b> </p>
      <p>The torsion-wave-focusing properties of the pyramid structure
        were seen to have a direct effect on how crystallization takes
        place. Diamonds that were synthesized within the pyramid turned
        out harder and purer than they would otherwise. Again, this
        suggests that the torsion-wave component is of central
        importance in the forming of chemical bonds to create a crystal.
      </p>
      <p><b>9.7.9 -- DIMINISHED SEISMIC AND WEATHER ACTIVITY</b> </p>
      <p>Teams from the Russian National Academy of Sciences also
        studied the earthquake data from the areas surrounding the
        pyramids and compared it to earlier data before the pyramids
        were built. They discovered that the pyramids have the ability
        to dissipate the energetic buildup that would normally create
        sudden, violent earthquakes. Instead of seeing one large and
        powerful quake, several hundred tiny earthquakes are registered
        instead. Furthermore, the atmosphere surrounding the pyramid
        seems to be shielded from severe weather as well, causing an
        overall decrease in the amount of violent weather patterns. This
        gives a clear illustration of the usefulness of pyramids for
        balancing the aetheric energies streaming into a planet. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.10 -- FOODS STORED IN PYRAMID INCREASE HUMAN COMPASSION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another experiment was conducted where a quantity of salt and
        pepper was stored inside the pyramid. This salt and pepper was
        later removed and fed continually to about 5000 people in
        different jails in Russia. Amazingly, within a few months there
        was a dramatic improvement in their behavior, and most criminal
        behavior almost completely disappeared. This is one of the more
        important points, as it validates the idea that aetheric energy
        is “spiritual energy” and that as a person is exposed to higher
        intensities of it, there is a propensity for greater feelings of
        love and compassion for others. </p>
      <p><b>9.7.11 -- LIGHT-PRODUCING EFFECTS AND RAZOR-BLADE SHARPENING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Krasnoholovets built a small and simple resonator to study
        these pyramid effects, which appears to have been a piece of
        cardboard or glass folded in half to form a small “roof”
        structure. Within this small resonator, a KIO3*HIO3 crystal
        experienced a greater clustering of hydrogen atoms in the
        crystal. Rare gases and the surface of metals were also seen to
        have a photoelectric effect while in the resonator, meaning that
        they were producing light. [This seems to explain why the large
        outdoor pyramids could not involve metal in their construction.]
        Furthermore, Dr. Krasnoholovets replicated Patrick Flanagan’s
        historic “pyramid power” experiments by studying the effects on
        a razor blade within this resonator. The blade was aligned east
        to west, perpendicular to the Earth’s magnetic field, while a
        piece of the edge was removed and stored away from the
        resonator. Under scanning electron microscope, the edge of the
        razor blade from the resonator was seen to take on a smoother,
        less angular form over time. </p>

      <p><b>9.8 -- HYPERSPACE PHYSICS OF JOE PARR</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. John DeSalvo of the Giza Pyramid Research Association has
        also brought the pyramid research of Joe Parr to the world’s
        attention through his various media appearances such as on the
        Laura Lee Show and Jeff Rense. Joe Parr holds a law degree and
        also has over 40 years experience as an electronics engineer.
        Parr’s interest in pyramid research first came about from his
        meeting George Van Tassel, an early contactee, in the 1950s, who
        informed him about the “pyramid power” experiments of Pat
        Flanagan that had demonstrated the sharpening of razor blades in
        the pyramid structure. Other experiments showed that organic
        materials would naturally dehydrate without putrefying while
        inside a pyramidal structure. Even raw, unrefrigerated milk
        would keep from spoiling if properly positioned. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.1 -- STATIONARY PYRAMID RESEARCH</b> </p>
      <p>Parr went on to begin studying pyramid-related phenomena, first
        by simply using stationary pyramids and taking measurements from
        them. These pyramids could be made of nothing more than four
        horizontal rods forming a base and four vertical rods forming
        the edges. He would then place sources of radio waves, magnetic
        fields, ion sources and radioactive sources inside the pyramids,
        and measure their strength outside the pyramids. From this
        study, he found that a spherical energy field surrounds any
        pyramid structure. The exact center of this orb corresponds to
        the Queen’s Chamber position in the Great Pyramid of Giza.
        Inside this “orb,” the strength of the electromagnetic or
        radioactive source that he placed inside will still be measured
        at its full potential, but areas outside the orb will have a 1
        to 3 percent reduction in the amount of measurable energy. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.2 -- VARIANCE WITH SOLAR, LUNAR AND OTHER CYCLES</b> </p>
      <p>After 13 years of studying this phenomenon, Parr found that a
        negative ion generator (air ionizer) would strengthen the orb,
        causing it to shield and hold in even more energy than before.
        Specific sound frequencies such as 51.5 hertz could also be used
        to strengthen the orb. Over the course of 20 years of
        measurements, Parr determined that the strength of this energy
        orb varies with the common 11-year sunspot cycle, and the width
        of the orb expands and contracts with the phases of the moon.
        All of these observations again suggest that the spherical orb
        is a static torsion field that gathers around the pyramid, and
        is strengthened by absorbing dynamic torsion fields. These
        fields can be strengthened by the electrostatic energy in the
        ions or in the acoustic vibration of air, which also is a
        vibration of the aether. Solar and lunar activity also has a
        direct impact on the strength of dynamic torsion energy
        streaming into the earth. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.3 -- IMPORTANCE OF “PHI” CYCLE OF TIME</b> </p>
      <p>Further analysis determined that the classic “phi” ratio was
        very important to these energy fields as well, again showing a
        clear connection to torsion fields. Parr found that a form of
        “virtual” clock would begin counting at the time that the
        pyramid was first set in a certain position. This means that
        once the pyramid was placed in a fixed spot, the orb surrounding
        the pyramid would gradually become stronger and stronger in its
        ability to contain the energy fields inside, and the rate of
        growth for the energy bubble was directly proportional to “phi”.
        At certain mathematically-defined points in this “phi” cycle,
        the bubble will expand and contract in size, outside of the
        effect caused by the moon. This suggests a slow, long-term
        harmonic “wobble” in the energy field, reverberating like a gong
        in synchrony with the phi-proportions of the instreaming torsion
        waves. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.4 -- ENERGY FROM GALACTIC CENTER</b> </p>
      <p>Parr’s experiments were abruptly disturbed on December 4, 1979,
        when the spherical energy orbs around the pyramids started
        rapidly disappearing on all but one experiment for an unknown
        reason. This caused the electromagnetic and radioactive sources
        inside the pyramids to suddenly flow without interruption into
        the surrounding space. Years later, Parr was very surprised to
        find out that the stream of X-rays from the center of our galaxy
        had abruptly shut off that day, and the anomaly was widely noted
        by astronomers. Other pyramid-energy shutdown events documented
        by Parr also corresponded precisely with drop-offs in our
        galaxy’s X-ray emissions, though he was unaware of this
        connection at the time the measurements were made. </p>
      <p>This is another valuable piece of data, as it shows us that the
        center of the galaxy is actually our primary source of
        instreaming torsion wave energy. In this case, the torsion waves
        appear to be propagating in tandem with the X-ray wavelengths of
        the electromagnetic energy spectrum. Even though the activity of
        the Sun can increase or decrease the strength of torsion waves
        coming into the Earth, without the input from the Galactic
        Center we will have much less energy available to us. This will
        prove to be a very important point that we will use to explain
        the importance of the Mayan Calendar end-date on Dec. 21, 2012.
      </p>
      <p>About nine days after Dec. 4, 1979, the spherical energy fields
        started to return, yet all but one pyramid had lost the original
        energy strength of the orb, which had slowly accumulated over
        time according to the “virtual clock” of the phi radio. The only
        pyramid that did not lose its energy field throughout this
        entire time period was a pyramid that was rotating by a mere 5
        degrees every 10 days. As Parr allowed this particular
        experiment to continue running, he found that the strength of
        its energetic orb continued increasing, eventually surpassing
        all of his other stationary pyramids. As we now know, the slight
        rotation caused the pyramid to absorb a small but measurable
        amount of torsion waves that would otherwise be traveling
        straight down and / or straight up with the gravitational field.
      </p>
      <p><b>9.8.5 -- IMPORTANCE OF ROTATION IN ENERGY-SHIELDING EFFECT</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, only the rotating pyramid survived the galaxy-induced
        “blackout” of December 4, 1979, and somehow the rotation caused
        it to eventually harness more energy than all the others. This
        was Parr’s first realization that rotating the pyramids could
        dramatically enhance the strength of energy that they were
        absorbing and radiating, as Russian scientists such as Kozyrev
        had already discovered. For several years he tinkered with
        various designs to rotate pyramids, and he also found out that
        he could strengthen their energy fields even further by passing
        them through alternating magnetic fields as they rotated. This
        allowed him to reach levels much higher than the 1 to 3 percent
        shielding for a stationary pyramid. As he reached these higher
        levels, he also noticed that there would be a reduction in the
        weight of objects inside the pyramid as well; gravity was also
        being shielded. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.6 -- “PINCH-OFF” AND HYPERSPACE</b> </p>
      <p>Over this time, he calculated that when he could get the
        pyramids to reach a certain speed while also bathing the
        surrounding air with atomic particles such as ions, there would
        be a “pinch-off” where the shielding would reach 100 percent. At
        this point the pyramid’s energy field would completely shield
        off all electromagnetic, radioactive and gravitational energy.
        Rotation alone could create a 50% shielding effect when the
        proper speed was attained, and the atomic particles were
        required to reach the 100% pinch-off point. Sunlight could also
        be used as the source of atomic particles to achieve complete
        shielding in the energy orb. </p>
      <p>Obviously, this fits in with our previously stated ideas about
        objects displacing into higher levels of aetheric density,
        drawing from the concepts of Dr. Vladimir Ginzburg, Dr. A.M.
        Mishin and Dr. Harold Aspden. Indeed, it appears that an object
        will gradually displace into a higher aetheric density as it
        vibrates closer to the speed of light. Eventually, a complete
        shift can be made into the higher density at that point, and
        when the pressure is later released, the object will naturally
        shift back down into our own density. This also correlates with
        the patent of David Hudson, where microcluster iridium was seen
        to disappear when it was heated up to 850° Celsius, but would
        reappear when the temperature was reduced. </p>
      <p>Therefore, it shouldn’t surprise us that once the 100%
        shielding level was attained in Parr’s experiments, the pyramid
        would temporarily disappear from our known “three-space”
        reality. At these times, the pyramids would disconnect from
        their epoxy mountings on the rotating arm, which was calculated
        to require 2000 pounds of force, or a sudden increase in kinetic
        (movement) energy that was 113,000 times greater than before. In
        55 different experiments of this type, the pyramid would pass
        through solid objects such as the wall of the machine, which
        formed an enclosed shell that surrounded the path of the
        pyramid’s rotation. When the pyramid would re-emerge into our
        own space after passing through the solid casing of the machine,
        it would be traveling at a tremendous speed like a bullet and
        often end up embedding itself into the wall of his laboratory or
        exploding. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.7 -- SETUP OF EXPERIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Now that we have established that this very anomalous effect
        would occur, it is good for us to have a better understanding of
        how this machine was actually constructed. In Parr’s setup, a
        5-inch thick, 3-foot diameter circular chamber houses a blade
        that rotates in a propeller-like fashion. The wood blade is 3
        inches wide by 1/8-inch thick and swings in a 25-inch diameter
        circle. At both ends of the arm, two small one-inch base
        pyramids weighing eight grams each and made of ABS plastic are
        attached. The points of the pyramid are horizontally aligned
        with the base, pointing away from the center of the arm. The
        centrifuge is driven by a 12-volt DC ¼ horsepower motor in the
        700-2400 rpm range. As the pyramids rotate, they pass through 36
        pairs of magnets arranged in a giant circle, each pair attached
        just over one inch above and below the path of the pyramids on
        the ends of the rotating arm. The magnetic pairs alternate
        between north and south polarity, causing a continuing
        fluctuation in the fields that the pyramids were exposed to. </p>
      <p>As we said, Parr determined that under sufficiently energetic
        conditions, the interior of the 1-inch wide plastic pyramids
        would start to shield all known energy fields, whether
        gravitational, electromagnetic or radioactive. The area inside
        the bubble surrounding the pyramids would lose weight.
        Radioactive materials, radio frequency sources and magnetic
        sources placed inside the small pyramids would be shielded from
        the outside. When pinch-off is achieved, the pyramids would
        either self-destruct or travel through solid objects, as
        indicated. This would also have the effect of causing extensive
        damage to the rotating arm and the entire inside of the machine.
      </p>
      <p><b>9.8.8 -- ENERGY STREAM BETWEEN SUN AND ORION’S BELT</b> </p>
      <p>Parr found that this sudden increase of energy leading to
        pinch-off would occur most reliably every year on Dec. 13-16,
        and his measurements were taken over a 13-year period.
        Eventually, Parr discovered that at this time, the Earth’s
        orbital path was intersecting an imaginary line that could be
        drawn between the Sun and the belt stars of Orion. This led Parr
        to conclude that an active energy conduit of some sort exists
        between the Sun and the stars of Orion’s belt. This also falls
        in line with our expectations related to torsion fields, as
        there will be streams of aetheric energy connecting all the
        stars together and flowing between them. The closer we are to a
        star, the stronger the stream will be, and in the case of
        Orion’s belt we have three central stars in close proximity with
        four other close stars surrounding them in a giant “X” shape.
        Thus, the shape of the stars in the Orion constellation forms a
        passive torsion generator in its own right. </p>
      <p><b>9.8.9 -- ACCELERATION TO AND FROM THE MOON</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most interesting findings of Joe Parr comes from his
        observations of which direction the pyramids would travel in
        once they achieved pinch-off. Under the following experimental
        conditions, we should assume that the moon is new, meaning that
        it is not giving off light. Parr found that if the rotating
        chamber for the pyramid was bathed with negative ions, it would
        accelerate away from the moon. However, if the chamber was
        filled with positive ions, the pyramid would accelerate towards
        the moon. This fits in line with our quantum physics models,
        where in this case we would see the Earth as if it were a giant
        atom. A pyramid that is displaced into a higher aetheric density
        with negative ions will move towards the center of the earth,
        just as the negatively-charged electron clouds will press
        towards the center of the atom. Similarly, a pyramid charged
        with positive ions will accelerate away from the center of the
        earth, repelling against the negative charge. </p>
      <p><b>9.9 -- STAN TENEN’S DISCOVERY OF GIZA PYRAMID AS RESONATOR</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a 2000 appearance on the Laura Lee Show, researcher Stan
        Tenen noted that the Great Pyramid of Giza is built in harmony
        with the molecular structure of its materials. The vast majority
        of blocks that make up the pyramid are limestone, which is
        primarily a calcium carbonate [CaCO3] crystal. The Great Pyramid
        was built with a 51 degree, 51 minute slope angle, and Tenen
        pointed out that the calcium carbonate molecule has an
        approximately 52-degree angle in its shape. This is known as a
        “cleavage angle” and means that when pure calcium carbonate
        crystals are split, they will tend to split along this 52-degree
        angle. Therefore, Tenen claims, the slope angle of the pyramid
        brings its entire shape into harmony with the molecules of the
        matter that makes it up. Tenen knows of no other structure on
        Earth that fits this pattern. Clearly, such a harmonic
        connection between “micro” and “macro” would only further
        enhance the pyramid’s effects. </p>
