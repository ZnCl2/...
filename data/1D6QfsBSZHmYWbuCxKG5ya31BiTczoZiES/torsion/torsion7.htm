      <p>I was doing some physics reading and stumbled across something
        that would be of interest to this forum: a scientific
        explanation for metaphysics/parapsychology. I found it in
        relation to non-locality of the space time continuum. Hope you
        enjoy! </p>
      <p>What is a Torsion Field? According to A. Akimov, these fields
        come in at least three types: E-fields, S-fields, and G-fields.
        The E, S, and G stand for Electric, Spin, and Gravity fields.
        The torsion field and its emanations are subtle energy fields.
        They are separate and distinct from classical Electric,
        Magnetic, and Gravity fields. Generators for these fields can be
        shielded against electro-magnetic fields and the <b>torsion</b>
        field still manifest itself through such shielding. <b>Torsion</b>
        fields can be generated, detected, switched on and off (such as
        for communication purposes), and are a distinct type of energy
        field heretofore not included in today's classical physics. <b>Torsion</b>
        field emanations can travel at velocities at least as high as
        109 times the speed of light. <b>Torsion</b> fields can
        interact with laser beams (change frequency); affect biological
        processes; are generated by melting or solidifying some
        materials; affect quartz crystals; affect some electronic
        components; can favorably change some beverages; and have been
        noted to affect gravity. </p>
      <p>According to Akimov, <b>torsion</b> fields coupled with the
        standard electric, magnetic, and gravity fields should provide
        means for a unified field theory that will extend the realm of
        science to include the effects of consciousness. The concept of
        dowsing, for example, can now have a scientific basis for
        explanation of the phenomenon. If this suggestion by Akimov
        proves viable, then science has an opportunity to extend its
        borders more rapidly into the so-called psychic realms. That
        could be a multi-decade venture of considerable importance to
        the expansion of scientific knowledge. </p>
      <p>A couple of issues ago, NEN began advertising "gravity-wave
        tapes" and a multi-channel "gravity-wave detector". You may
        question our motive. After reading some of the Russian
        literature about <b>torsion</b> fields, your editor became
        almost convinced that there was a similarity between the
        so-called gravity waves of Ramsay and Hodowanec and the <b>torsion</b>
        fields. If correct, then the Ramsay gravity-wave detector will
        be an excellent <b>torsion</b>-field measuring instrument.
        Therefore, we have obtained copies of professional papers from
        three groups of scientists working on <b>torsion</b> fields in
        Russia. All three of these <b>torsion</b>-field articles are
        published in volume2, no. 3-4 of the Journal of New Energy. </p>
      <p>In Russia, several types of <b>torsion</b>-field generators
        have been patented and some are available to purchase. </p>

      <p>As a result Akimov et al. view the vacuum as a physical medium
        that can assume various polarization states. Given charge
        polarization, the vacuum is manifested as the electromagnetic
        field. Given matter- polarization, it is manifested as the
        gravitational field. And given spin- polarization, the vacuum
        manifests as a spin- field. All fundamental fields known to
        physics correspond to specific vacuum polarization- states. </p>
      <p>Thus the above "<b>torsion</b>- field theory of the physical
        vacuum" can claim that all objects, from quanta to galaxies,
        create vortices in the vacuum. The vortices created by particles
        and other material objects are information carriers, linking
        physical events quasi- instantaneously. The group- speed of
        these "<b>torsion</b>- waves" is of the order of 109 C â€” one
        billion times the speed of light. Since not just physical
        objects, also the neurons in our brain create and receive <b>torsion</b>-
        waves, not only particles are "informed" of each other's
        presence (as in the famous EPR experiments), also humans can be
        so informed: our brain, too, is a vacuum- based "<b>torsion</b>-
        field transceiver." This suggests a physical explanation not
        only of quantum non- locality, but also of telepathy, remote
        viewing, and the other telesomatic effects discussed above. </p>

      <p>Spin waves in condensed matter are a current and well-studied
        topic in modern physics. However, there is a less-known
        backwater in this field: <b>Torsion</b> Fields, the quantum
        spin of empty space; the large-scale coherent effects of the
        spin of the particles in the virtual sea. </p>
      <p>Initial work in this field was performed by Einstein and Cartan
        in the 1920's, now known as ECT (Einstein-Cartan-theory.)
        Currently there are rumors that spin waves have real physical
        consequences, and that useful technology can be based on such
        things. If "<b>torsion</b> fields" can be used for
        communication, they could explain such things as telepathy and
        PK. Most of the recent work has been done in Russia, but now and
        then interesting things appear in the US as well. </p>

      <p><b><u>Torsion fields and bioenergy healers</u></b> </p>
      <p>Russian research posits an approach for describing many, if not
        all, the biopositive and parapsychological phenomena related to
        bioenergy healing and conscious intention. This research has
        postulated and tested the existence of "<b>torsion</b> fields."
        Russian scientist Akimov and his team consider the quantum
        vacuum as a universal <b>torsion</b> wave carrying medium. The
        <b>torsion</b> field is said to fill all of space isotropically,
        including its matter component. It has a quantal structure that
        is unobservable in non-disturbed states. However, violations of
        vacuum symmetry and invariance create different, and in
        principle observable, states. These theorized "violations" and
        "invariances" may be what the energy practitioners are creating,
        which induces changes in the gamma radiation previously
        described. </p>
      <p>The theory linking biopositive physiological effects of
        bioenergy therapies with radiation hormesis has been well
        described.4,5 Radiation hormesis is the concept of using small
        doses of ionizing radiation in a manner which has a beneficial
        affect on the body. In summary, whole body exposures of mammals
        to low-dose irradiation (doses &lt;10 cGy/y; &lt;10 rad/y) has
        been found to stimulate major physiologic parameters including
        reproduction, growth, muscular development, mental acuity, cell
        repair systems (DNA, RNA, membranes and shock proteins), and
        immune competence.12,13,14 </p>
      <p>Similar biopositive effects have been noted following bioenergy
        healing therapies including reduced anxiety in hospitalized
        cardiovascular patients,15 chemotherapy oncology patients,16 and
        premature neonates.17 Other research has shown bioenergy
        therapies reduce tension headache pain17 and dramatically
        increase the rate of healing of dermal punch wounds.18 One pilot
        study demonstrated a decrease in the concentration of suppressor
        T-cells implying an increased immune response.19 A separate
        study showed significant changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit
        values after treatment.20 </p>
      <p>Work by renowned Chinese scientist Dr. Shu-Zheng Liu of the MH
        Radiobiology Research Unit of Norman Bethune University
        demonstrates that in both human populations and animal studies
        low-dose radiation (LDR) stimulates the immunological
        responses.21 The up-regulation of immunity following LDR
        involves a series of cellular and molecular reactions as well as
        their systemic regulation. The results obtained by Lui and many
        others have compelled researchers to conclude that whole-body
        irradiation (WBI) with X- and gamma-rays in the dose range
        within 0.2 Gy has definite positive effect on the immune system
        which can be considered as beneficial to the organism.22 </p>
      <p>Similar types of improved immune responses have been reported
        by the Russian scientists with the use of generated <b>torsion</b>
        fields. "In a laboratory of radiobiology of Perm University we
        have investigated the effect of static <b>torsion</b> field on
        mice. . . The experiments have shown that <b>torsion</b> field
        has immune-stimulating effect showing itself in the activation
        of both cellular and humoral parts of the immune system. Being
        53.3% for the control mice, the content of rosette forming cells
        was a high as 71.0% (p&lt;.001) for the mice subjected to the
        action of <b>torsion</b> radiation. Appreciable differences in
        the response of the humoral part of the immune system for the
        unexposed and exposed mice were also detected: the titer of
        antibodies being 8.33 for the former and 11.70 for the
        latter."11 </p>

      <p><b><u>Remote Viewing, Predictions &amp; Military Applications</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>"Theoretical works appeared, confirming the reality of&nbsp;
        PSI-phenomena, the existence of so called <b>torsion</b>
        component in the right part of of the gravitational equation by
        A. Einstein (19), and the construction of technical models of
        the <b>torsion</b> fields radiation generators is reported in
        some works (20, 2). All such publications and communications
        talk about the possibility to use the presented PSI-phenomena
        with the intent to attack as well as with the intent of the
        perfection of the defense of the government and its means of
        armament. . The following PSI phenomena of human being and
        animals are the object of the study: prediction of future,
        secret reading of the present and past time, hypnotical effects
        and zombieng, search and finding of indicated lost objects </p>
      <p>The basic problems of the construction and areas of the use of
        psychotronic weapon result from those: construction and use of
        military PSI generators, collecting of inteligence
        (PSI-detectors), construction and use of battlefield PSI
        generators, construction and use of TSULIPs - centers for
        control of people and apparatus - basic system of communication:
        networks of telephone, radio and television broadcasting; system
        of <b>torsion</b> communication and radiation, i.e. networks of
        PSI effects, construction of bioautomats-robots </p>
      <p>Building of models and analogs of PSI-abilities and phenomena -
        the task whic is nowadays in the order of the day. </p>
      <p>PSI weapon this is the "ray weapon" (powerfull generators,
        radiating pencils of rays, serving as a striking factor) and
        ENERGO-INFORMATIONAL CURRENTS OF RADIATION ORGANIZED IN A
        SPECIAL WAY (coherently), of known as well as unknown physical
        nature. <br>
        . <br>
        To make the reader understand everything what will follow we
        will give some definitions and a short survey of the PSW
        problem. </p>
      <p>The first level - this is the psychological problem. I would
        call it a MACRO-problem. This is the problem of the control of
        the state of the consciousness of human being and society and,
        consequently, depending from the consciousness - of the
        psychology of the behavior of human being as a person, group,
        socium. This is the&nbsp; problem of the use of internal
        biological mechanisms and laws controling such or other
        psychological condition or behavior. </p>
      <p>With respect to numerous manifestations of anomalous, unusual
        (for the classical psychology) or parapsychological phenomena as
        is the case of clairvoyance, extrasensory perception,
        telekinesis, phenomenal memory and out of the ordinary
        calculating abilities (the experiments by Messing, Kuna, Gorin)
        and other mysterious qualities of the psyche, the new direction
        of scientific research and technical design&nbsp; (construction
        of technical means of registration, measurement and influencing
        of the brain) came into being called PARAPSYCHOLOGY. </p>
      <p>The second level - MICRO-problem. The designation of this
        problem as a PSI problem is derived from the use of mathematical
        apparatus, methods and means of measurement of the QUANTUM
        MECHANICS (QM) for the research on AP (anomalous phenomena) of
        the psyche. </p>
      <p>The fundamental wave equation of QM, the equation by
        Schrodinger, contains the mathematical symbol of the greek
        letter PSI defining the wave function which describes the
        undulatory behavior of quantum mechanical object (ensemble). It
        is believed that the processes and the mechanisms of
        consciousness (thinking), the processes of subconsciousness
        (under the threshold processes), i.e. all psychic processes in
        the brain, are governed by quantum-mechanical laws. Aside from
        that a much more sophisticated scientific discipline came into
        being - scientific and technical <br>
        PSI-quantum mechanical discipline of the research and control of
        the mechanisms and laws of thinking and psyche at the
        MICRO-level -the level of elementary particles and physical
        vacuum (19). </p>
      <p>So the two apparently opposed worlds or levels, MACRO world and
        MICRO world, enter the worlds of thinking, consciousness and
        psyche. </p>
      <p>And a hell of a lot more at:</p>

      <blockquote><b><u>Nazis, Torsion Fields &amp; Remote Viewing</u></b>
        <p>During the last stages of World War II nazi scientists,
          directed by the SS, were looking for radical new sciences with
          which to defeat the allied powers. In the process the Germans
          first discovered <b>Torsion</b> fields, a new branch of field
          phenomena generated by spinning objects. The SS scientists
          found that spinning an impellor, which compresses air into an
          inwardly spiralling vortex, produces lift when spun above
          20,000 RPM. In turn this appeared to ionise the air and was
          self sustaining. They also experimented with <b>torsion</b>
          fields to manipulate space/time. </p>
        <p>This new science may have remained unexplored with Germany,s
          defeat but in 1995 the Tomsk Polytechnic in Siberia began
          studies in the field of spin <b>torsion</b> interaction. It
          must also be remembered that while the Nazis were conducting
          scientific research they did so with a thorough understanding
          of metaphysics. </p>
        <p>When you spin an impellor above 20,000 RPM it produces a
          spinning electro-magnetic field from the ionisation of the air
          particles by centripetal motion; the Russians have done
          experiments with electro dynamic generators and the nazis
          experimented with spinning radioactive metallic fluids. The
          spinning electromagnetic field is, as it were, a warping of 5
          dimensional space; so the <b>torsion</b> field itself can be
          thought of as a warping of 5th dimensional space. </p>
        <p>Hal Puthof the NSA scientist who ran the Stanford Research
          Institute,s Remote Viewing program has been promoting the idea
          of zero point energy, the energy of the quantum vacuum which,
          if it can be tapped into, would provide limitless power. John
          Hutchinson, an eccentric Canadian inventor, has been using
          bizarre electronic equipment that has produced has produced
          levitation, telekinetic force, transmutations of metals and
          pyrotechnic phenomena. </p>
        <p>This author concludes that <b>torsion</b> fields disturb the
          5th dimensional plenum that provides energy for 4th
          dimensional manifestation; when rotated above 20,000 RPM this
          breaks the ground state energy for manifestation and causes: </p>
        <p>Changes in the 4th dimensional space time continuum. This in
          turn can affect gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and
          weak nuclear force. May produce energy for use in the everyday
          world. Can affect the manifestation of 4th dimensional space.
        </p>
        <p>In quantum mechanics the observer collapses the quantum wave
          function simply by observing the event; <b>torsion</b> field
          generators can raise this process from the microscopic to the
          macroscopic realm. If we think of a human beings physical body
          as being a 4th dimensional energy system, a trained Remote
          Viewer has developed a 5th dimensional energy body which, with
          the right protocols, can then interact with spin <b>torsion</b>
          fields; in effect acting on the 5th dimensional plenum to
          change 4th dimensional manifestations. </p>
        <p>By this method every single semi-conductor in the arsenal of
          US weapons systems can be rendered completely useless by
          changing the quantum mechanical parameters of the electronics.
          This means that a single Russian Remote Influencer could
          render the entire US war machine to so much expensive scrap
          metal. US Remote Influencers are now routinely implanted and
          are thus disturbed or even driven mad in the presence of <b>torsion</b>
          fields; which means that the Russians will have few effective
          adversaries in this new form of warfare. </p>

        which is shown on <span class="postlink">www.orgonelab.org...</span>
        will be able to act as a spin field detector. This is due to my
        observations of interactions between the spin field and orgone
        accumulators. One night, quite by accident, I left an orgone
        "shooter" exposed to a spin field for some 3 hours. (I was
        experimenting to see if there was any interaction between the
        spin field and orgone.) I had noted, before I became distracted,
        that when the orgone "shooter" was exposed perpendicular to the
        spin field, that the orgone output, as registered by my
        percepetions of orgone, had increased multifold. (The orgone
        "shooter" is a tube through an orgone accumulator which causes
        the orgone energy collected by the accumulator, to be funneled
        out of one end of the tube.) When I returned, I turned the spin
        field generator off. To my surprize, the orgone shooter
        continued to produce its extraordinarily prodigious output for
        some 15 hours after the spin field was turned off! After that 15
        hours, I observed another extraordinary phenomena: A black
        funnel appeared in space centered on the opposite end of the
        tube from which orgone had been prodigiously pouring. This
        funnel became larger and more dense with time. And a strange
        sensation arrived with the funnel. The black funnel persisted
        for about 15 minutes, then faded rapidly. I got the sense that
        the energy which had radiated out the one end of the tube, was
        being "neutralized" by this dark funnel effect. This seems to me
        to be an effect of the vacuum compensation mechanism.</blockquote>
