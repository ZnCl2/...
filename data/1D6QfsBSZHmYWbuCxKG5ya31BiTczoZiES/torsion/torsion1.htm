        <p><i>In this article the experimental results obtained by
            various researchers in the period 1950-1990 are discussed.
            Since all experimental results under consideration could not
            be explained in the framework of existing theories, these
            results were placed under the catagory of
            "experimentally-observed phenomena." It is shown that all of
            the experiments considered here have demonstrated a
            manifestation of spin-torsion interactions.</i> </p>
        <p>Over the course of the XX century, various investigations in
          different countries, representing a variety of professional
          interests, repeatedly reported the discovery of unusual
          phenomena that could not be explained in the framework of
          existing theories. Since these authors could not understand
          the physics of the observed phenomena, they were forced to
          give their own names to the fields, emanations and energies
          responsible for the creation of these phenomena. For instance,
          N.A.Kozyrev's "time emanation" [1-4], W.Reich's "O-emanation"
          or "orgone" [5], M.R.Blondlot's "N-emanation" [6],
          I.M.Shakhparonov's "Mon-emanation", A.G.Gurvich's "mitogenetic
          emanation" [7], A.L.Chizhevsky's "Z-emanation", A.I.Veinik's
          "chronal field" [8,9], "M-field" [10], A.A.Deev's "D-field",
          Yu.V.Tszyan Kanchzhen's "biofield", H.Moriyama's "X-agent"
          [11], V.V.Lensky's "multipolar energy" [12], "radiesthesietic
          emanation" [13], "shape power", "empty waves" [19],
          "pseudomagnetism" [20], H.A.Nieper's "gravity field energy"
          [21], T.T.Brown's "electrogravitation" [22], "fifth force"
          [23], "antigravitation" [24], "free energy". This list can be
          easily continued. </p>
        <p>As the result of the theoretical and experimental
          investigations conducted beginning in the mid 60s, for
          instance by the V.G.Baryshevsky [25-28] group and G.V.Skrotsky
          [20] in the USSR, by the A.Abragam and M.Goldman group in
          France [29-31] and others, spin-spin interactions of
          spin-polarized particles with spin-polarized nuclei targets,
          and the distant correlations of nuclei spins' states were
          discovered and investigated. These interactions were called
          "pseudomagnetism" [20]. In one case, the "pseudomagnetic
          field" was interpreted as exchange Coulomb interaction, and in
          other cases, as nucleus interactions. During this period, an
          opinion existed that known spin-spin interactions had another
          nature [31]. Thus a clear understanding of the mechanism of
          spin-spin interactions was absent. Later, major investigations
          of spin-spin interactions of ensembles of particles were
          conducted [34-38]. Distant spin-spin interactions were
          theoretically and experimentally examined in the
          investigations of nuclear spin waves and nuclear magnetic
          resonance [34-40]. </p>
        <p>In 1977 A.C.Tam and W.Happer showed experimentally that two
          circularly-polarized laser beams attract or repel depending on
          mutual orientation of their circular polarization. If the
          direction of rotation of polarization of the two laser beams
          is similar, then these beams attract, and if the rotation of
          polarization is opposite, then they repel [41]. These results
          collided with quantum electrodynamics and could not be
          explained. </p>
        <p>In the mid 80s the A.D.Krisch group was experimentally
          investigating the interaction process between spin-polarized
          protons and a spin-polarized proton target [32,33]. It was
          found that the observed process of spin-spin interaction could
          not be described in the framework of the quark model. The
          obtained results collided with quantum chromodynamics and
          could not be explained. Analogous results were observed in the
          USSR in experiments conducted at Dubna and Protvino [42]. </p>
        <p>During this time, theoretical results were obtained that let
          spin-spin interactions be considered as the manifestation of
          an independent fundumental characteristic of matter. These
          investigations showed that numerous phenomena which were hard
          or impossible to explain, had a rigorous theoretical
          interpretation in the framework of torsion field theory. The
          convincing theoretical results which allowed understanding of
          the mechanism of Tam-Happer effect were first obtained by
          P.C.Naik and T.Pradhan in the USA [43] and then by P.I.Pronin,
          Yu.N.Obukhov and I.V.Yakushin in the USSR. Later De Sabbata
          and C.Sivaram in Italy [44] and then E.A.Gubarev, A.N.Sidorov
          and G.I.Shipov in Russia [45] with the use of torsion
          theories, gave a theoretical interpretation of experimental
          results obtained by A.D.Krish [32,33] and others [42]. </p>
        <p>It is useful to note experiments demonstrating effects which
          were usually interpreted as the manifestation of the so called
          "fifth force" [23]. Probably the first researcher to encounter
          the "fifth force" in the end of IXX century was a professor of
          Russian physical-chemical society N.P.Myshkin [46]. In 1990,
          De Sabbata and C.Sivaram demonstrated that phenomena connected
          with the "fifth force" can be interpreted as manifestation of
          torsion [47]. </p>
        <p>It is also important to note the experiments which demonstrat
          anomalies connected with gyroscopes and gyroscopic systems.
          Probably the first researcher to establish that the behaviour
          of gyroscopic systems cannot be explained in the frame work of
          Newton's mechanics was russian astrophysicist N.A.Kozyrev. In
          the 50s, N.A.Kozyrev cunducted a large series of experiments
          with gyroscopes and found that variations of the gyroscope's
          weight exists depending on the angular velocity and the
          direction of rotation [1,2]. Later, Kozyrev's results were
          completely confirmed by a member of the Belarus Academy of
          Sciences A.I.Veinik, who in the 60s - 80s conducted a major
          research of the anomalies demonstrated by gyroscopic systems
          [8]. In 1989 H.Hayasaka and S. Takeuchi published results of
          their experiments in which the fall-time of freely falling
          spinning gyroscope was measured. These experiments showed that
          the fall-time varies depending on the angular velocity and the
          direction of rotation [48]. The unusual behaviour of spinning
          gyroscopes was observed by S.M.Polyakov in the USSR [24] and
          many others, and basically was interpreted as a manifestation
          of antigravitation. In 1991, G.I.Shipov showed that the
          violation of Newton's mechanics demonstrated by gyroscopic
          systems was caused by the appearance of torsion fields
          generated by spinning masses [49]. </p>
        <p>From the mid-50s to the late 70s, N.A.Kozyrev (with
          V.V.Nasonov) conducted astronomical observations using a
          receiving system of a new type. When the telescope was
          directed at a certain star, the detector (designed by
          N.A.Kozyrev and V. V.Nasonov) positioned within the telescope
          registered the incoming signal even if the main mirror of the
          telescope was shielded by metal screens. This fact indicated
          that electromagnetic waves (light) had some component that
          could not be shielded by metal screens. When the telescope was
          directed not at the visible position but at the <i>true</i>
          position of a star, the detector then registered an incoming
          signal that was much stronger. The detection of the true
          positions of different stars could be interpreted only as
          detection of star radiation that had velocities billions of
          times greater than the speed of light. N.A.Kozyrev also found
          that the detector registered an incoming signal when the
          telescope was directed at a position symmetrical to the
          visible position of a star relative to it's true position.
          This fact was interpreted as a detection of the <i>future</i>
          positions of stars [3,4]. </p>
        <p>In the late 80s to early 90s, astronomical observations using
          the Kozyrev-type detector were successfully conducted by a
          group of academicians at the Russian Academy of Sciences
          M.M.Lavrentiev. While the sky was scanned by the shielded
          telescope with the detector inside, it registered signals
          coming from the visible position of each star, the true
          position, and also a position symmetrical to the visible
          position of a star relative to it's true position.
          M.M.Lavrentiev could not give a theoretical interpretation to
          these facts [50-52]. In 1992 these experiments were
          successfully repeated by the A.E.Akimov group at the Main
          astronomical observatory of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences
          (Kiev) and at the Crimean astrophysical observatory
          (Nauchnyi). The obtained results were interpreted as detection
          of torsion waves. (As is well known, stars are objects with
          large angular momentum.) [53-54]. It should be noted that the
          fact of detection of future star positions has also been given
          a rigorous theoretical interpretation. In the framework of
          G.I.Shipov's "Physical vacuum theory" it is shown that torsion
          fields can propagate not only in the future but in the past as
          well [55]. There exists a fundamental (theoretical and
          experimental) reason to suppose that various psychophysical
          phenomena (e.g. precognition) are connected with certain
          manifestations of torsion fields. (The connection of
          psychophysics phenomena with torsion fields' manifestations
          was discussed in [56,57].) </p>
        <p>The concept of torsion fields is not new. Torsion field
          theory is a trend in theoretical physics dating back to 1913.
          As is well known in GR, A.Einstein showed the existence of a
          close interconnection between gravitation and the curvature of
          space-time. About then E.Cartan showed that a connection may
          exist between some physical values and another geometric
          abstraction - torsion [67]. E.Cartan performed the first
          theoretical works devoted to a theory of gravitation
          containing torsion, but at the early stages, Cartan's
          gravitation theory never obtained support, since spin was not
          yet discovered at that time. Cartan was the first to point to
          the possibility of the existence of fields generated by the
          spin angular momentum density. </p>
        <p>In the late 50s - late 60s, attempts to complement Einstein's
          gravitation theory with torsion were made. The first such
          attempts were made by T.W.Kibble [58] and D.W.Sciama [59]. But
          the explosive rise of publications devoted to torsion only
          occurred after the first (and sensational) torsion effect was
          calculated. In the works of A.Trautman and W.Kopczynski, it
          was persuasively demonstrated that the torsion of space-time
          can eliminate the cosmological singularities in non-stationary
          models of the Universe [60-62]. After the works of Trautman
          and Kopczynski, hundreds of works devoted to the theory of
          gravitation with torsion were published in a short period of
          time. The so called Einstein-Cartan theory (ECT) (sometimes
          -Sciama-Kibble is added) became the best known [63-65]. </p>
        <p>In the framework of ECT, spin-torsion interaction is
          practically a contact spin-spin interaction, and the torsion
          of space-time does not propagate in this theory. In ECT, the
          constant of spin-torsion interactions is proportionate to the
          product of the gravitational constant G and Planck's constant
          <i>h</i>. Thus in ECT the constant of spin-torsion
          interactions is approximately 27 orders of magnitude weaker
          than the constant of gravitation interactions. Owing to the
          above, many authors have repeatedly stated that experimentally
          observed phenomena cannot be explained by torsion theories,
          since torsion effects cannot be observed. But as is well known
          to the experts, this conclusion holds true only for those
          theories which consider the torsion field to be a static field
          which cannot propagate (e.g. ECT). After ECT, which describes
          torsion fields generated by spinning objects without
          propagation, a large number of non-linear torsion theories
          appeared. These theories operated with spinning sources having
          radiation. It was demonstrated that the Lagrangian of a
          spinning source having radiation can contain a large number of
          terms with constants that do not depend on G or <i>h</i>.
          Thus the constant of spin-torsion interactions can be a
          significant value according to these theories. For instance,
          according to G.I.Shipov's torsion theory [55,66] the constant
          of spin-torsion interactions is valued at no less than 10 <sup>-5




          </sup>- 10 <sup>-6</sup>. It should be noted that the
          correctness of this evaluation has been confirmed in various
          experiments (e.g.[1-4,8,9]). </p>
        <p>As was already mentioned, E.Cartan was the first to
          theoretically investigate the physical properties of fields
          generated by the spin angular momentum density. The phenomena
          presented in the experimental investigations of gyroscopic
          systems appeared to be the natural manifestation of torsion
          fields. Probably the first researchers to interpret the
          observed "anomalous" variations in gyroscope weight as a
          manifestation of torsion fields generated by spinning
          gyroscope, were H.Hayasaka and S.Takeuchi [48]. It is
          important to note the fact that in order to obtain the efect,
          the gyroscope must be subjected to non-stationary rotation
          [49]. For instance, N.A.Kozyrev [2] and A.I.Veinik [8]
          employed special vibrations of the gyroscope, and in
          H.Hayasaka's experiments, free-falling gyroscopes were used
          [48]. This important condition was not taken into
          consideration by those researchers who declared the absence of
          any weight variation in their experiments. </p>
        <p>Torsion fields are generated by the classical spin [73,74] or
          by the spin angular momentum density (on a macroscopic level).
          Torsion fields' characteristics differ substantially from the
          characteristics of electromagnetic and gravitation fields.
          Torsion fields have axial symmetry, unlike electromagnetic and
          gravitation fields that have central symmetry. There exist
          both right and left torsion fields (depending on the classical
          spin orientation or rotational orientation). Fig.1 depicts a
          diagram of the torsion field generated by a mechanically
          rotated object (e.g. gyroscope) <i>(at present fig.1 is
            unavailable)</i>. If the rotation (including classical spin)
          is stationary (i.e. the angular velocity is constant; the
          rotating mass is distributed uniformly relative to the
          rotation axis; the precession and nutation are absent, etc.),
          then this object generates a static torsion field. The static
          torsion field exists in the region of space within a certain
          distance from the source. If rotation is non-stationary, then
          this object generates propagating torsion radiation (torsion
          waves). </p>
        <p>Torsion fields transmit information without transmitting
          energy, and they propagate through physical media without
          interacting (in traditional sense) with this media. But
          propagating torsion fields alter the spin state of physical
          media. Thus torsion fields can be detected by various types of
          detector. Torsion fields cannot be shielded by most materials,
          but they can be shielded by materials having certain
          spin-structures [55,75]. The lower bound of torsion signal
          velocity is estimated at 10<sup>9</sup><i>c</i>, where <i>c</i>
          is the velocity of light. This is due to the fact that torsion
          fields are identical to the transverse spin polarization of
          the physical vacuum [75]. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that the spatial configuration of the
          torsion field generated by a spinning particle differs from
          the spatial structure of an "artificially" rotated object
          (e.g. gyroscope). A diagram of the torsion field generated by
          a spinning particle is presented on fig.2 <i>(at present
            fig.2 is unavailable)</i>. </p>
        <p>Torsion fields are generated not only by a single spinning
          particle, but also by an ensemble of particles as well. This
          situation is similar to electricity, where we often encounter
          the colective electric fields generated by the ensembles of
          electric charges (nuclei, atoms, charged bodies, etc.). Thus
          any nuclear spin-polarized target is a source of a torsion
          field. As was mentioned already, this fact was repeatedly
          observed in many experiments, and since analogous spins
          attract, while opposite spins repel [55], then the interaction
          of a spin-polarized particle with a spin-polarized target
          nucleus results in the appearance of "anomalous" forces which
          depend on mutual spin orientation of the particle and the
          target (e.g. A.D.Krisch experiments [32,33]). </p>
        <p>Since all substances (except amorphous materials) have their
          own stereochemistry which determines not only the location of
          atoms in molecules, but also determines their mutual spin
          orientation, then the superposition of the torsion fields
          generated by the atomic and nuclear spins of each molecule
          determines the intensity of the torsion field in the space
          surrounding each molecule. The superposition of all these
          torsion fields determines the intensity and spatial
          configuration of the characteristic torsion field for that
          substance. Thus each substance possess its own characteristic
          torsion field. Each physical object in living or non-living
          nature possesses its own characteristic torsion field. The
          torsion fields of any object can be detected by various
          methods [1-4,8,9]. Torsion fields can be observed visually by
          the Kirlian method [17]. (It should be noted that the torsion
          fields of various objects also can be visually observed by
          "psychics". This is usually interpreted as "aura"
          observation.) </p>
        <p>The property which is open to influence by torsion fields is
          spin. Thus the structure of the torsion field of every
          physical object can be altered by the influence of an external
          torsion field. As a result of such an influence, the new
          configuration of the torsion field will be fixed as a
          metastable state (as a transverse spin polarization state,)
          and will remain intact even after the source of the external
          torsion field is moved to another region of space. Thus
          torsion fields of certain spatial configurations can be
          "recorded" on any physical object. This fact was repeatedly
          observed by many researchers (e.g. [1,8,9,14,76]). </p>
        <p>The magnetization of ferromagnets results in the appearance
          of a collective magnetic field. But as a matter of fact, the
          sequencing of the orientation of magnetic moments
          automatically results in a sequencing of classical spins which
          are generated by the motion of electrons in circular molecular
          currents. So, the magnetization of ferromagnets results not
          only in the appearance of a collective magnetic field, but in
          appearance of a collective torsion field as well. Thus any
          permanent magnet possesses its own torsion field. This fact
          was first experimentally discovered by A.I.Veinik [8,9]. Fig.3
          is a diagram of the torsion field of permanent magnet. </p>
        <center><a href="http://www.amasci.com/freenrg/tors/fig3.jpg"><img

              associated="" r=""></a>Figure 3.</center>
        <p>Since any physical object possess its own torsion field, then
          the torsion field of permanent magnet is able to affect any
          physical object. Understanding this important property of
          magnetic fields allows us to understand a variety of
          phenomena, for instance the phenomenon known as "magnetization
          of water," which consists of changing the biological activity
          of water (including distilled water) by subjecting it to the
          influence of a magnet. Since the distilled water is
          diamagnetic, then the process of influencing it with a
          magnetic field lacks sense from a traditional point of view.
          But the "magnetization of water" effect can be clearly
          detected by various methods [8]. In this case the effect is
          caused not by a magnetic field but by a torsion field which
          affects the torsion field of water. </p>
        <p>The following fundamentally important fact should be
          emphasized. In the framework of the theory of electro-torsion
          interactions [66], it is shown that if an electrostatic or
          electromagnetic field exists in some region of space, then
          there <i>always </i>exists a torsion field in that region of
          space. Electrostatic or electromagnetic fields without a
          torsion component do not exist. This was shown rigorously by
          G.I.Shipov [55,66]. Strong torsion fields are generated by
          high electrical potentials and by devices having organized
          circular or spiral electromagnetic processes. (Probably the
          first researcher to investigate the torsion fields created by
          these types of generators was Nikola Tesla. In Russia, similar
          results were obtained by S.V.Avramenko, G.F.Ignatjev and
          others.) </p>
        <p>The principles considered above allow us to classify three
          types of torsion generators. The first type employs materials
          (objects) having specially organized spin polarization (e.g.
          permanent magnets). In the second type of torsion generator,
          the torsion component of electromagnetic or electrostatic
          field is employed (e.g. generators created by S.V.Avramenko,
          G.F.Ignatjev, G.A.Sergejev, S.N.Tarakhtiy and many others).
          The third type of torsion generator employs a specially
          organized rotation of a material substance: e.g. a variety of
          generators created by A.I.Veinik [8]; K.N.Perebeinos'
          generators with mechanically rotating masses [68]; and
          V.M.Yurovitsky's generators created based upon the rotation of
          magnetic fields (magnets). V.M.Yurovitsky was the first to
          point out that many phenomena could be explained as a result
          of a manifestation of long-range fields generated by classical
          spin or spin angular momentum density [69]. Later generators
          based on mechanically rotating magnets were developed by
          V.V.Bobyr and many others. As a result of a series of
          experiments conducted in the Institute of Material Research
          ("Institut problem materialovedeniya" in russian) (Kiev,
          Ukraine) it was established that torsion radiation produced by
          this sort of generator is able to alter the inner structure of
          any substance (it's spin structure). It was also established
          that an identical alteration of the structure of various
          substances can be achieved by "sensitives" ("psychics,") and
          could not be achieved by the use of other known technologies
          [70]. </p>
        <p>There exists a fourth type of torsion generator. Torsion
          fields can be generated as the result of a distortion of the
          geometry of the physical vacuum. Every object having a certain
          surface geometry will simultaneously generate left and right
          torsion fields of a certain configuration depending on the
          geometry of the object. This fact can be detected by various
          types of physical, chemical and biological indicators. The
          unusual effects demonstrated by pyramids, cones, cylinders,
          flat triangles, etc. were repeatedly observed by many
          researchers in different countries. Different researchers
          usually have given their own names to the observed effects:
          for instance, "radiesthesietic radiation" [13], "cellular and
          hollow structures effect" [14], "shape power", "pyramid
          power", etc. In the USSR, the effects demonstrated by objects
          with various geometry have been investigated by A.I.Veinik
          [8], V.S.Grebennikov [14], Yu.V.Tszyan Kanchzhen,
          I.M.Shakhparonov, A.A.Beridze-Stakhovsky and others. </p>
        <p>In the mid 80s, V.S.Grebennikov found that the empty
          honeycomb of certain bees could have an influence upon any
          biological object: from microorganisms to human beings. The
          affected person basically felt sickness, illusions of falling,
          flying, etc [14]. The observed influence could not be
          shielded. As the result of the conducted experiments, it was
          determined that the effect was caused by the shape (form) of
          bee honeycomb. The understanding of this fact allowed the
          development of various types of devices having certain
          geometric proportions that demonstrated the same effects.
          V.S.Grebennikov has interpreted the discovered effect as
          "resonance interactions" between an organism and the objects
          of a special shape. </p>
        <p>In the late 80s, an experimental investigation of the torsion
          fields generated by objects having various surface geometries
          was conducted by the A.E.Akimov group at the Physics Institute
          of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences and at Chernovitsky
          University. In particular, the influence of torsion fields
          generated by cones of different sizes and proportions upon
          various processes was investigated. It was experimentally
          established that objects having geometrical sizes that obey
          the rule of "golden section" (1:0,618) can be considered as
          passive torsion generators [71]. Fig.4 depicts the diagram of
          the torsion field generated by a cone. The points that divide
          the cone's height in 3 equal parts (points B and C on fig.4)
          correspond to the maximum strength of a left torsion field
          inside the cone. </p>

        <p>As is well known to experts in meditation, the shape of the
          building plays an important role in the process of meditation.
          Thus the spires and domes of churches and temples (as well as
          pyramids in Egypt and other countries) should be considered as
          so called passive torsion generators. The torsion fields of a
          meditating person can be significantly magnified if the
          meditation takes place in a building having particular
          geometric proportions. This fact is employed in the generators
          developed by A.A.Beridze-Stakhovsky. Over the course of the
          latter 30 years, torsion generators based upon the shape
          effect were developed by many specialists. </p>
        <center><a href="http://www.amasci.com/freenrg/tors/fig5.jpg"><img
              src="fig5.jpg" alt="[Top view, 5-sided enclosure connected
              to 4-sided enclosure]"></a>Figure 5.</center>
        <p>The fifth type of torsion generator employs a combination of
          the principles described above. For instance, a combination of
          high-frequency electromagnetic oscillations and topological
          effect (shape effect) is used in the generators developed by
          Yu.V.Tszyan Kanchzhen. (The operation of his devices was
          interpreted as "high-frequency bio-communication".) Fig.5
          shows the diagram of Tszyan Kanchzhen's torsion generator. The
          object 6 (e.g. a hen) is placed into the receiver-enclosure 5.
          Another object 4 (e.g. a duck) is placed into the
          transmitter-enclosure. The transmitter-enclosure is a
          three-dimensional shape consisting of pentagon 1. Cones 2 are
          placed on the sides of these pentagons. The object 4 is
          subjected to the influence of a generator of high-frequency (~
          11 GHz) electromagnetic oscillations 3. The torsion component
          of these EM ocsillations excites the torsion field of object
          4. This torsion field is also intensified by the topological
          effect of 1,2. The excited torsion field is concentrated at
          the tops of the cones 2 and then is directed to the
          receiver-enclosure 5. As a rule, a several-day stay of objects
          4 and 6 in them resulted in following. If a hen is placed in
          the receiver-enclosure and a duck is placed in the
          transmitter-enclosure, then a hen gradually starts to look
          like a duck. (For instance, a hen gained duck webs and etc.) </p>
        <p>An analogous effect was discovered in the 60s by the
          V.P.Kaznacheev group. Their research was connected with
          theoretical and experimental investigations that were
          conducted in the 20s by A.G.Gurvich. As is well known to
          biophysics experts, in the 20s A.G.Gurvich experimentally
          discovered the super-weak radiation of cells that has been
          called "mitogenetic radiation". A.G.Gurvich has found that
          mitogenetic radiation of one cellular culture was able to
          stimulate or to suppress the vital activity of another
          cellular culture [7]. In the 60s, the V.P.Kaznacheev group
          conducted a series of experiments using the following scheme
          [15]. An infected cellular culture was encapsulated in an
          airtight enclosure. Another cellular culture that was intact
          (not infected) was encapsulated in another sealed enclosure.
          Then the two enclosures were attached together so that optical
          contact alone (e.g. a glass or quartz plate) could exist
          between the two enclosures. The airtight seals of both
          enclosures remained intact. The degradation of the infected
          cellular culture was observed. After a certain period of time,
          the analogous process started in the other enclosure (i.e. the
          cells in the intact enclosure became infected in spite of the
          sealing of both enclosures). Many different cell types were
          used in various experiments, including cells of the human
          organism. In 1973 this effect was annnounced as the discovery
          of "remote intercellular interactions in the system of two
          cultures" [16]. </p>
        <p>V.P.Kaznacheev has used an electromagnetic concept for the
          interpretation of the observed phenomenon (as well as
          A.G.Gurvich and Yu.V.Tszyan Kanchzhen). But in other
          experiments conducted by several research groups, it was
          established that the main factor in Kaznacheev's effect (as
          well as in A.G.Gurvich's "mitogenetic radiation" and in
          Yu.V.Tszyan Kanchzhen's effect) is the intercellular
          interactions created by means of the torsion fields of cells.
          In particular, this conclusion was confirmed in the
          experiments conducted by the L.N.Lupichev group in the late
          80s [72]. In these experiments, the distant influence of
          various chemical substancs on different cells was
          investigated. It was established that it is possible to create
          conditions where the influence can be detected even if the
          chemical substance is shielded by metal screens. Thus the main
          factor in the observed effect had a non-electromagnetic
          nature. The second important confirmation of the torsion
          nature of the detected interactions was the fact that
          screening by aluminum was efficient (while others were not).
          (It should be noted that torsion fields in some cases can be
          screened by aluminum.) This fact was first discovered by
          N.A.Kozyrev [1] and later it was confirmed repeatedly by many
          researchers. The possibility of reflecting torsion waves by a
          mirror with aluminum coating is responsible for the
          possibility of reflecting torsion waves by the mirrors of
          telescope (even if those mirrors are shielded by various
          screens) [3, 50-54].) </p>
        <p>Over the course of the latter 30 years, various devices that
          could be seen as torsion generators were patented in many
          countries (e.g.[77-81]). As a rule no theoretical
          interpretation of their work was given. For example, devices
          which employ a combination of topological effects (fourth type
          of torsion generator) and an intense electric field (second
          type of torsion generator) is described in the French patent
          [77]. The construction of the described devices is similar to
          Yu.V. Tszyan Kanchzhen's generator. According to [77], 2 pairs
          of electrodes having a voltage between 60-300 kV are connected
          to a 16-sided prism. On one part of its sides the cones are
          placed. As the authors of [77] claim, this generator reduces
          gravitation, accelerates the speed of chemical reactions, etc.
          Since the generation of static torsion fields results in
          transverse spin polarization of the physical vacuum that can
          be retained as metastable state, then many effects were
          observed up to four days after the generator was turned off.
          The analogous principle is employed in one of A.I.Veinik's
          generators [8]. The developed device has demonstrated various
          physiological effects. The influence remained even when the
          generator was turned off and moved to another area of space. A
          number of generators using the combination of topological
          effects and electromagnetic fields were developed by
          I.M.Shakhparonov and others. </p>
