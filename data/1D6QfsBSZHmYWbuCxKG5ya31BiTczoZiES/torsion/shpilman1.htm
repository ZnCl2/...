      <p>In the article: "Physical properties of axion (spin) fields" (<i>Almanac</i>
        N1/98) were already mentioned components axion field. For study
        of their properties separately it is possible them to separate
        to an attribute of the attitude to an electrical field with the
        using of the device represented on Fig.1. The electrodes 3 and 4
        are made from a set of leaden plates forming in the area of 5
        electrical capacitors with firm dielectric (for example: from a
        celluloid film). The beam axion field 5 from the generator 1 is
        directed to an end face of this capacitor. On an electrode 3
        negative voltage move and on an electrode 4 positive. </p>

      <p>The lead, in the given design, in relation to axion field
        executes a role similar to a role of an optical quartz fibre
        (lightguide) for light (idea P.M.Miacshin). The toroidal coils
        with the iron core 6 and 7, interfere with a premature output of
        components axion field through lateral surfaces of leaden
        electrodes 3 and 4. When on electrodes 3 and 4 voltage are equal
        to zero two a beam axion field on an output of the device "are
        drawn" and leave on large distance oscillate of a rather mean
        position, generally, are torque in a spiral (see. Fig.2).At a
        difference of voltage between electrodes 3 and 4 in ~ 20 volts,
        occur something reminding (counter) "short circuit" axion beams
        (see. Fig.3). Apparently, it also is a moment of a beginning of
        separation axion field on a fraction in an electrical field. </p>
      <p>In space, ambient the device, there are places of concentration
        of intensity axion field under the form reminding volumetric
        interference bands of the difficult form, which strongly
        complicate the further observations. These bands continuously
        change the form and sizes at the further increase of a
        difference of voltage. It can mean that, at separation into a
        fraction, the components axion field change the internal energy
        differently. At increase of voltage up to 180 volts, "arch"
        axion field "curtsey" (see. Fig.4) and at 190 volts is closed
        practically on direct (see. Fig.5). </p>
      <p>At the further increase of voltage down to 260 - 300 volts
        occur appearance stratification and increase of their definition
        (thus "the electric arc" of interference bands continuously fall
        downwards). Then there is a sharp gap of short circuit of beams
        and neatly show two divergent beams (see are shown. Fig.6). The
        further increase of voltage results in increase of mutual
        repulsion beams, their bending, and at voltage ~ of 600 volts
        there is their short circuit on a source axion field (see.
        Fig.7). It can mean that, interaction between components axion
        field, in many respects, resonant. </p>
      <p>Naturally, adduced number of a difference of voltage on
        electrodes relative. As they strongly depend on the used
        materials and design of the device, and also, strongly depend on
        a source axion field. To reproduce necessary effect it is
        possible and not resorting to for external sources of voltage.
        It is possible to pick up a combination of used materials so,
        that, effect decreasing of a longitudinal moment of a impulse
        axion field in dense substance and contact difference of voltage
        will execute necessary action. For finding-out, how the
        components axion field interact with itself similar, are
        possible are to manufacture the device represented on Fig.8. It
        is made from a V-figurative leaden plate with shoulders 1,3 to
        which are attached of a leaden plate 2 and 4, so the plate 2
        forms with a shoulder 1 capacitor in the zone of 5, and plate 4
        in the zone of 6 (with opposite the side). A plate 2 and 4 are
        bent so, that, the similarity four side of a pyramid is formed.
        On a V-figurative plate positive potential, and on a plate 2 and
        4 negative moves. </p>
      <p>If on an edge of a pyramid to direct a beam axion field (as
        well as on Fig.1) that, on an output of the device, at zero
        voltage, we can receive four beams interacting among themselves
        similarly represented on Fig.2. At supply of sufficient voltage
        (~ 20 volts) occur formation of "arch" axion field between
        electrodes 1 - 2 and 3 - 4. Thus between electrodes 2 - 3 and 1
        - 4 "arches" do not arise, even if we shall push together their
        upper ends practically closely. </p>
      <p>It can mean that, though we and have separated axion field into
        components with the assistance of an electrical field,
        interaction between them it not interaction of electrical
        charges. The experiments, describing in next time to put in
        updating of representations about functioning generators of
        axion field. </p>
      <p>In realized experiments active assist of G.P.Ivanov. </p>
      <p>The additional remarks </p>
      <p>Probably, in single nuclear superconductors at low temperatures
        between atoms arise bridge of axion field (Fig.2), which cause
        appearance of an electron superconductivity. At increase of
        temperature, the difference energy of nucleuses of atoms is
        increased and there is a break "bridge axion field" (Fig.6). </p>
      <p>Probably, in high-temperature ceramic superconductors, at low
        temperatures arise "bridge axion field" similar on quality axion
        to "short circuit" represented on Fig.4. At increase of
        temperature, also, the difference energy of nucleuses of atoms
        is increased and there is a break "bridge axion field" (Fig.6).
