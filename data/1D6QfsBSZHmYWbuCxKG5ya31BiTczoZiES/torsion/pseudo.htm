        <p><b><font size="+1">Pseudoscience. How Does It Threaten
              Science and the Public?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Academician E. P. Kruglyakov</b> <br>
          <b>Translated by G. Goldberg</b> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p><b><i>(Report at a RAN Presidium meeting of 27 May 2003)</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The attitude of the government to science is changing for the
        better. This is remarkable. The President of the country, V. V.
        Putin, has announced a long-range program of support to science.
        It would see that there is every basis to view the future with
        optimism. However not everything is so cloudless. There are
        influential forces in society which are interested in reducing
        the role of science. One of these forces concerns us today. </p>
      <p>Here are statements of one of our newspapers with a large
        circulation, "An old threat hangs over new science which
        penetrating into the key secrets of the universe - it is from
        the Russian Academy of Sciences which has organized a Commission
        to Combat Pseudoscience". We will talk later about what they
        mean by "new science", but right now here's one more quote,
        "Succumbing to the most complex riddles which nature presents us
        with, the RAN is hastening to label as pseudoscientists those
        researchers who risk working on the leading edge of knowledge".
      </p>
      <p>The quotes cited are not the point of view of a rude
        journalist; this is an assignment. A systematic, intentional
        duping of the population is going on via the mass media. Just a
        few of these headlines are frightening, "Ordinary lasers destroy
        human blood", "The collapse of classical physics", "The monster
        blood-drinkers return", "Russian physicists have discovered a
        new lethal radiation". The terrible poison which they feed
        people leads to an estrangement of the public and the systematic
        cultivation of a doomed people for whom everything has been
        predetermined. They dissuade people from thinking critically but
        teach them to believe blindly. By the way, the very same
        attempts are also being made in the field of education. Whatever
        the apologists of reform say, they are trying to lower the
        educational level in Russia. Academician V. I. Arnold has
        written about this more than once and therefore I will not
        develop this theme. I note only that some "successes" have
        already been achieved in this direction. </p>
      <p>Who needs to drive the country back into the Middle Ages?
        People who cannot think critically, who are unacquainted with
        logic, and are easy to manipulate. If science is suppressed (in
        such an event education itself will weaken) a golden age will
        begin, for example, for businessmen working to sell the
        population completely absurd "instruments" treating up to 350(!)
        various ailments and for corrupt officials supporting [this]
        criminal business. The situation today in the market of medical
        instruments already seems completely abnormal. Quantum medicine
        instruments and senseless zircon bracelets are insistently
        advertised; a whole series of devices has arisen which catch the
        radiation of diseased cells, amplify them and return them to the
        diseased cells "in opposite phase", after which recovery occurs
        instantaneously. Various swindlers vary the idea in various
        ways: one directs the radiation of the diseased cells on the
        same [cells] thanks to the effect of the intensification at the
        expense of the interference. Another directs the radiation of
        healthy [cells] on diseased cells...It is surprising that, as a
        rule, the "instruments" have the permission of the Ministry of
        Health or the Chief Medical Officer so that they rob unfortunate
        sick people on a legal basis. </p>
      <p>A little here about the "instruments" referred to. For besides
        them are "instruments" generating electromagnetic radiation and
        gravitational waves (several such devices do not even require
        electrical power). The hit of last season was a neutrino
        generator for treating cancers at any stage. The author of this
        "masterpiece" produces neutrinos while passing acoustic waves
        through a vacuum. Even schoolchildren should know that there is
        no way a sound wave can pass through a vacuum but the author of
        this nonsense, passing himself off as a professor, firmly stands
        his ground. It also does not embarrass the inventor that
        physicists have to create detectors weighing hundreds of tons to
        detect neutrino particles or that neutrinos are created in the
        center of the Sun and get to its surface practically without
        hindrance, freely passing through the Earth's crust. </p>
      <p>One can judge how shamelessly some of the aforementioned
        devices are forcing their way into various regions of the
        country by the scale of corruption of high-ranking medical
        officials. By the way, they, too, will be more comfortable
        without science. </p>
      <p>Most of this market is built on deceiving buyers who are
        retirees. However, wealthy people are also not forgotten. Not
        long ago a holographic patch was offered for sale - "a planar
        torsion generator". This "instrument" protects owners from the
        influence of the harmful radiations of cell phones, microwave
        ovens, television sets, etc. </p>
      <p>With our support a group of enthusiasts from St. Petersburg
        tried to take licenses away from psychic healers which they got
        to....correct biofields. This action encountered rabid
        resistance. But at the same time biocorrectors and bioactivators
        which correct a non-existence biofield are spreading throughout
        the entire country. If our biologists are not involved and the
        Russian Academy of Medical Sciences [RAMN] is asleep on the job,
        the shameless robbery of sick people will continue in an
        ever-increasing scale. </p>
      <p>The mass adoption and use of pseudoscience began with the
        appearance of latter-day wonder workers on TV screens like A.
        Chumak. Today pseudoscience has penetrated into many government
        agencies. Its traces are observed in the Ministry of Defense,
        the Ministry of the Emergency Situations, the Ministry of
        Internal Affairs, and the State Duma. I will cite several
        examples. Speaking live on the eve of the New Year on the RTR
        channel S. Shoygu [the Minister of the Emergency Situations
        Ministry, MChS] said that the MChS uses the advice of
        astrologers in its work. Several years ago a laboratory of
        psychics was organized in the MChS. Military Unit 10003
        continues to operate in the Ministry of Defense, conducting
        quite dubious experiments with sorcerers. </p>
      <p>On 16 January 2003 on the "Culture" channel another minister
        (M. Shvydkoy), acting as the moderator of the program
        "Kul'turnaya Revolyutsiya [Cultural Revolution]", organized a
        show, "Only Astrologers Can Be Believed", where an actress
        completely removed from science was selected as the opponent of
        an inveterate astrologer and demagogue V. Ledovskikh while among
        the audience in the hall were several professional
        astrophysicists, who had no chance to speak seriously on the
        subject from a scientific perspective. </p>
      <p>A booklet by O. Krushel'nitskaya and L. Dubitskaya "Stories
        About Astrology" was published on order of the Ministry of
        Education (!) to help the next generation and the
        "Prosveshcheniye [Enlightenment]" Publishing House and T. Globa
        issued a series of handbooks, each of which was devoted to a
        particular sign of the Zodiac and accompanied by the
        corresponding text (about 10 pages), from which the student
        learns under the influence of which planet the year is, what
        problems it portends, etc. Of course, it doesn't come to his
        mind whether to check whether or not his horoscope is accurate.
        Thus the masters of deception are forming a Middle-Age
        consciousness in their selfish interests. It remains to add that
        in the Russian national classification of professions
        astrologers have already been placed on a level with
        soothsayers. Alright, but what the actual encouragement of
        astrologer charlatans is leading to, judge for yourself. </p>
      <p>Several years ago a theoretical and practical seminar was held
        in the Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Internal
        Affairs [NII MVD] where among others things means of identifying
        criminals with the aid of astrology, clairvoyance, and dowsing
        were discussed. Bringing in astrology, an NII MVD employee,
        Doctor of Juridical Sciences Ye. G. Samovichev, explained why
        serial murders remain unsolved for so long. "The difficulty of
        solving these crimes is dictated, in particular, by the
        resistance of these programs (determined by the date of birth
        and the date the crime was committed - Eh. K.) to outside
        influence since in practice a criminal can be arrested and
        convicted when the time of "operation" of his criminal program
        is coming to an end". It evidently never occurs to Mr.
        Samovichev that 300,000 people are born in the world daily. Thus
        300,000 serial murderers will appear on Earth after just one
        astrological cycle. So where are they? </p>
      <p>It is difficult for expert investigators after the lectures of
        such "scientists". And it is not accidental that they have
        already started to come from regional procurators' offices to
        our Commission for explanations, for the above seminar is not
        the only place where they teach pseudocriminology. A deputy
        committee chairman of a previous State Duma, Doctor of Technical
        Sciences V. Tetel'min, made his own contribution to this matter:
        "Orthodox science 'does not notice' the artificial bioresonance,
        the targeted influence of one person on the biofield of another.
        It is possible to do this by technical means, let's say, with
        the aid of an individual- or mass-action psychotronic weapon. It
        is true that until now it was thought that such a weapon had not
        been created but that if individual models were created then
        they could operate only at a very close range. But in a number
        of cases great distances are not required. Thus, in one version
        the wife of State Duma deputy Lev Rokhlin was subjected to
        zombification with the aid of a low-frequency quantum resonance
        emitter. Supposedly she did not know what she was doing
        [Rokhlin's wife killed him using his pistol - Eh. K.] inasmuch
        as her brain was controlled by other people". I think that there
        is no need to comment on such an absurdity. </p>
      <p>An unfortunately famous general, G. Rogozin, was observed in
        the entourage of the first President of Russia, B. N. Yel'tsin,
        who predicted the start of a thermonuclear war in August 1999 as
        well as a scoundrel, G. Grabovoy, exalting himself as a doctor
        of physicomathematical sciences. By the way, the latter said
        that today he mentally checks the condition of the President's
        aircraft before takeoff. He is the inventor of a unique
        instrument - a "crystal module" - with the aid of which the
        power of the nuclear explosion was substantially reduced during
        underground nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk. Although the
        absurdity of such a statement is completely obvious to any
        physicist, an investigation was conducted especially for
        nonprofessionals which showed that Mr. Grabovoy had never taken
        part in nuclear tests. Thus, G. Grabovoy is lying. Gullible
        officials ought to know this, for he has let it be known that
        the crystal module will be good at nuclear power stations. You
        can never tell; they might still set up the "instrument" at an
        atomic power station! From a recent television broadcast one
        happens to find that Mr. Grabovoy lectures at the MChS and is a
        consultant to the RF [Russian Federation] Security Council. </p>
      <p>Military astrologer A. Buzinov worked at the Ministry of
        Defense for a long time. Inasmuch as every tank, aircraft, and
        ship has its own date of "birth", Mr. A. Buzinov has indeed
        found a vein of gold, having extended the astrological rules of
        the game to military equipment. Our mass media has facilitated
        the growth of his popularity in every way. One should think so!
        For he has precisely predicted a number of crashes, in
        particular, the loss of the ferry boat "Estonia" in the Baltic,
        a "Ruslan" aircraft over Irkutsk, etc. True, for some reason we
        found out about these surprising predictions after the fact. I
        want to mention here a case which the mass media left out. Right
        after the tragic events connected with the explosion of
        apartment houses in Moscow he appeared at the Federal Security
        Service Directorate for Moscow and Moscow Oblast and declared
        that he was able to identify where the terrorists were hiding
        explosives. I cannot say whether the FSB officials believed the
        prophet or not but a careful investigation of about 10 addresses
        indicated by A. Buzinov was immediately organized: the
        consequences could have been too serious. Of course, no
        explosives were found. For some reason the mass media were
        silent about this. But this is enough by itself to forget about
        this person forever. </p>
      <p>One of the reasons for the growth of the influence of
        pseudoscience is associated with the attitude of a majority of
        scientists toward this phenomenon. This attitude could be
        described in such terms as squeamishness, scorn, condescension,
        and connivance. The majority of scientists do not yet recognize
        the degree of danger hanging over science. </p>
      <p>Speaking at the Vatican not long before the end of the last
        century, Academician V. I. Arnold said, "Considering the
        explosive nature of every kind of pseudoscience (like
        astrology), in the coming century a new era of obscurantism like
        the Middle Ages is completely likely in many countries. The
        present flowering of science can change to an irreversible
        decline similar to what occurred with painting after the Italian
        Renaissance". </p>
      <p>The well-known American philosopher P. Kurtz recently noted:
        "We live in a time when the progress of science at the frontiers
        of knowledge is unprecedented. At the very same time
        anti-science, pseudoscience, and faith in the paranormal are
        growing, challenging the vitality of scientific research". We
        see that the growth in the influence of pseudoscience is not
        just of concern to our Commission. </p>
      <p>Let's try to point out the primary "points of growth" of
        pseudoscience in our country. First of all, let's cite an
        excerpt from a document which landed on the desk of the head of
        the Soviet government 15 years ago. "A lag in the area of the
        theory and practice of spinor fields can have irreversible
        consequences in such defense areas as the methods and means of
        the highly-reliable detection of an enemy strategic weapon
        (ICBM, nuclear submarine, aircraft, etc.); the long-range
        destruction of enemy strategic weapons without contact; covert
        jamming-resistant communications with objects in space, on
        Earth, underground, and underwater; mobile equipment on
        gravitational principles; and psychophysical and biomedical
        influence on troops and the population, etc." It is easy for one
        to imagine what the Prime Minister would feel. We're talking
        about a weapon more powerful than a nuclear weapon. If you don't
        give the money you'll get the "irreversible consequences".
        Resources had to be allocated – 500 million rubles. But it was
        completely possible to deny them. All that was needed for this
        was a skilled expert review. A unique expert review was
        conducted in 1991 when from the rostrum of the General Meeting
        of the USSR Academy of Sciences [AN SSSR], corresponding member
        (now academician) of the AN SSSR Ye. B. Aleksandrov exposed the
        swindle of torsion fields (by this time spinor fields had been
        turned into torsion fields). After discussion in the AN SSSR
        General Physics and Astronomy Branch and an appeal to a USSR
        Supreme Soviet committee, the later adopted a decree "The
        Shameful Practice of Financing Pseudoscientific Research From
        State Sources". Right afterwards the Center of Nontraditional
        Technologies, created in the USSR GKNT [State Committee for
        Science and Technology] to implement the torsion program, was
        disbanded, and the director of the Center, Mr. A. Ye. Akimov,
        the godfather of this whole swindle, was fired. But soon A. Ye.
        Akimov organized a small enterprise with the sonorous name "The
        International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics" of
        the RAEN [Russian Academy of Natural Sciences]. The torsion
        swindle has grown and expanded from that time. For unknown
        reasons Akimov received financing from the Ministry of Science
        from 1992 to 1995 . In 1996-97 the Ministry of Defense financed
        Akimov's projects concerning mythical torsion communications
        channels. It is possible that financing continued further but
        this is difficult to establish: the work was done secretly. The
        fact itself that for almost 10 years confidential work has been
        done on a fifth type of interaction unknown to world science but
        known only to a small handful of initiates seems ridiculous and
        could have only one reasonable explanation: corruption. </p>
      <p>It is interesting that today Mr. Akimov has completely
        forgotten his promises about torsion superweapons. Now it's
        about unique peaceful torsion technologies. And from time to
        time he gets caught in fraud. For example, in 1996 he stated,
        "The first flying saucer will soon be tested at NPO [Scientific
        Production Association] 'Energiya'. [It is currently called the
        "Energiya" Missile and Space Corporation]. Its principle of
        propulsion is completely new - there is no use of a reactive
        force. If the tests are successful there is a real prospect of a
        conversion of all transportation (SIC - Eh. K.), automobiles,
        trains, etc. to a new principle without the use of internal
        combustion engines" ("Chisty Mir [A Clean World]", N4, 1996).
        And here is a comment of V. P. Legostayev, the First Vice
        President and First Deputy Chief Designer of RKK "Energiya":
        "RKK 'Energiya' has not been working on, is not working on, and
        does not expect to be working on the development of 'flying
        saucers' based on a torsion field generator". Why am I
        describing this adventure in so much detail? The problem is,
        although there is not a single supporter of A. Ye. Akimov in the
        Physics Branch of the RAN and although the Physics Section of
        the RAEN has harshly condemned the activity of A. Ye Akimov and
        his henchman G. I. Shipov in the Physical Sciences Branch of the
        RAN, the torsion swindle is seizing newer and newer bridgeheads.
        Under the supervision of Mr. Akimov several closed stock
        companies have been formed which in recent years have gathered a
        harvest not only inside the country but also in the
        international arena. Among the unsuccessful operations of
        similar firms I can mention the attempt to introduce "torsion
        technologies" at the "Norilsk Nickel" industrial complex with
        the promise of an annual savings of $250,000,000. An attempt to
        clean the Yauza River with the aid of torsion generators barely
        failed. But here an operation to clean Gelendzhik Bay went
        brilliantly. Large funds were extracted from the budget. The
        secret consisted of comparing analyses from 1990, when waste
        runoffs in the bay were halted, and seven years later, after
        "processing" of the bay with approximately 100 milliwatt torsion
        generators. </p>
      <p>In 1998 they managed to dissipate the haze over Malaysia from
        forest fires in Indonesia with the aid of similar generators. In
        my view, these enormous scams are possible only with the corrupt
        participation of high-ranking officials. Only the support of
        high-ranking protectors can explain the audacity of Messers.
        Akimov and Shipov, who dared slander academician Ye. B.
        Aleksandrov in the magazine "Elektrosvyaz". Obviously the
        benevolence of similar protectors could explain the recent quite
        bold statement by A. Akimov about the capabilities of "torsion
        technologies". "With their aid we can get energy practically
        from nothing, replacing all the thermal and atomic power
        stations and creating an alternative to nuclear power. New kinds
        of motors have already been tested which burn neither oil, nor
        natural gas, nor any other hydrocarbon types of fuel, and this
        means they do not pollute the environment. It has been shown in
        experiments that new types of communications operate without
        sending out electromagnetic waves but by completely different
        principles which practically require no traditional power".
        ("Intellektual'naya sobstvennost' [Intellectual Property]", N4,
        2000). </p>
      <p>One can catch Mr. Akimov in a swindle or fraud at each step,
        but this is a separate topic. I would like to note that the
        indifference and connivance of many scientists has led to
        regrettable results. The myth of torsion fields and torsion
        technologies has found fertile ground in the most unexpected
        places. For example, in Novosibirsk a so-called "International
        Institute of Cosmic Anthropoecology" appeared under the aegis of
        academician V. N. Kaznacheyev of the RAMN and Doctor of Medical
        Sciences A. V. Trofimov, having been accredited by the Ministry
        of Science in a completely incomprehensible manner. For example,
        in this Institute there is a torsion generator and research is
        conducted "to study the vital substance in torsion fields". Two
        words about this unique Institute. As the director of the
        institute, A. V. Trofimov, reported, "In our research on the
        long-range transmission of information we compared the
        astrological and astrophysical data of the participants using
        NOVA, an American database on astrology. They can change the
        course of time in this institute with the aid of "Kozyrev's
        Mirrors". And also in the Institute a laser beam interacts with
        "a reflected human biophysical field". Do not the examples cited
        demonstrate that so-called state accreditation has been turned
        into particularly bureaucratic games if obvious pseudoscience
        receives state support, in spite of the negative findings of a
        number of scientists, incidentally? </p>
      <p>After the collapse of the USSR pseudoscience began to penetrate
        into the country's higher educational institutions. In 1994 a
        textbook by A. V. Vachayev and N. I. Ivanov was published in the
        Magnitogorsk Mining and Smelting Academy called "Power and the
        Technology of Structural Conversions". What is this book about?
        Models of the electromagnetic impulse rearrangement of the
        symmetry of elements are cited, as a result of which lighter and
        simpler elements are formed with an allocation of energy of the
        broken structural bonds". Here is one more excerpt from the
        text: "The impulse method of rearranging discharge water of any
        composition can become a reliable source of acquiring pure
        elements and energy". I think that no comments are necessary
        here. But [the names of the] irresponsible reviewers ought to be
        published. They are Doctor of Technical Sciences Prof. of
        Chelyabinsk State Technical University Ye. V. Toropov and
        Candidate of Technical Sciences, Senior Scientist of the MEhI
        [Moscow Power Institute], S. V. Kartavtsev. </p>
      <p>In Rostov-on-Don in 1997 a book came out titled "Concepts of
        Modern Natural Science" written by collective authors under the
        leadership of Doctor of Sociological Sciences Prof. S. I.
        Samygin. The Ministry of Education recommended the book as a
        textbook for students of humanitarian and economic specialties
        of higher educational institutions. Here's the kind of
        "discoveries" the book presents to students: "Scientists assume
        that there is information about each object and about animate
        and inanimate objects at all points of the universe
        simultaneously. One more "pearl": "The information field
        contains information about everything in the universe and is
        capable of producing life and directing its development". "A
        holographic model is considered the most suitable model for
        explaining psychophysical phenomena". I hope that one can do
        without comments here. </p>
      <p>A book of the late president of the International Academy of
        Informatics I. I. Yuzvishin, "The principles of
        Informationology", deserves special mention (Moscow, the
        "Informatsiologiya" Publishing House and the "Vysshaya Shkola
        [University]" Publishing House, 2000). I have already had
        occasion to analyze the previous book of Mr. Yuzvishin,
        "Informatsionlogiya" which contains many appalling absurdities.
        In particular, in it the speed of light has been changed from 10
        million km/sec to 1 m/sec. In the new book he is done with that.
        The author even thanked me for critical comments. Now there
        appear new stunning "discoveries": "it can be said that in the
        depths of the universe it is likely that there can be
        temperatures of zero degrees Kelvin and lower 00K: 5-K, 10-K,
        20-K, 30-K, and so on". "In order to expand scientific research
        and remove the orthodox quasi-scientific 'prohibition' it is
        proposed that the temperature scale be hypothetically expanded".
        As a result the newest, "Yuzvishin", scale will appear besides
        the Celsius and Kelvin scales. Of course, this nonsense seems
        funny but it is becoming sad when you find out that this book is
        "a textbook for higher and secondary educational institutions",
        self-education courses and proficiency improvement courses". It
        is sad that two representatives of the world of science, Doctors
        of Physicomathematical Sciences Prof. V. A. Ivanov and I. D.
        Sofronov appear in the role of reviewers. Did they read this
        absurdity? </p>
      <p>I don't know where this "textbook" being discussed has been
        introduced, but at the MIREhA [Moscow State Institute for Radio
        Engineering, Electronics, and Automation] for about 10 years Mr.
        Yuzvishin headed the department of informationology and read a
        two-semester course "The Principles of Informationology". In
        passing, Doctor of Technical, Physicomathematical,
        Informationological, and Biological Sciences I. Yuzvishin
        crippled students of the Moscow Institute of Informationology. </p>
      <p>In 2000 a textbook came to light in the I. I. Polzunov Altay
        State Technical University in Barnaul called "Physics and the
        Technology of Torsion Radiation. Torsion Technologies". Prof. G.
        I. Gos'kov of Altay University appears as a co-author of the
        textbook together with A. Akimov and G. Shipov. Today Mr.
        Gos'kov is deputy head of the information technologies
        department of this university. Among his recent "achievements"
        is the measurement of "energy information radiation", the
        detection of "bioenergy", and the "charging" of water with the
        aid of electromagnetic waves, ultrasound, an ordinary book, and
        hand movements. It is interesting whether the Ministry of
        Education knows whom Mr. Gos'kov is training for the country. </p>
      <p>A year earlier in 1999 the 2nd International Congress of
        "Bioenergy Information Science" was held in the very same
        university. The principle organizers, besides the bosses, were
        the International Academy of Energy Information Sciences and the
        International Academy of Informatization. Here's what kind of
        subject matter was offered the participants: </p>
      <blockquote>Physics and the Technology of Torsion Fields. <br>
        Bioenergy Information Science in Everyday Life, in
        Manufacturing, and in Healing (Bioenergy Information Healing,
        Bioenergy Information Science in Architecture and Construction,
        etc.) <br>
        Phenomena, Discoveries, and Explorations in the Field of
        Bioenergyinformatics (Anomalous or PSI Phenomena, Biolocation,
        UFOlogy, Bioenergy Information Science, and Extraordinary
        Situations, Bioenergy Information Science and Rehabilitative
        Medicine, etc).</blockquote>
      I should say that Barnaul is far from being the only city where
      pseudoscientific conferences are being held. Many cities of the
      country welcome pseudoscience.
      <p>A few words now about publications associated with the Russian
        Academy of Sciences. In 1997 the "Nauka [Science]" Publishing
        House published a monograph of G. Shipov entitled "The Theory of
        a Physical Vacuum" on a commercial basis (the reviewers were
        Doctors of Physicomathematical Sciences A. Rukhadze and R.
        Kuz'min). Although it received a proper evaluation in the review
        of academician V. Rubakov published in "The Successes of the
        Physical Sciences", all the same the publication of the book
        caused considerable harm to science. The experienced masters of
        a swindle even translated it into English. As a result the book
        has become a unique banner of torsion swindlers. The swindlers
        who earn their living from so-called "torsion technologies" are
        little concerned that neither G. Shipov nor A. Akimov has a
        single publication in any serious refereed journal of physics
        and that the technologies described in G. Shipov's book do not
        exist. The fraud literally begins with the first lines. The
        author states that the book contains lectures that he gave at
        the Physics Department of MGU [Moscow State University] in 1993
        and 1996. This is a lie! In a note the dean's office of the
        Physics Department it reports that "G. I. Shipov did not give a
        series of lectures at the MGU Physics Department on 'The Theory
        of a Physical Vacuum' or any other series of lectures". As has
        already been noted, the physics community does not like the
        torsion gentlemen. And all the same they have plenty of
        supporters. In an overwhelming majority of cases these are
        people who are quite remote from the fundamental problems of
        physics. </p>
      <p>In 1998 a collection entitled "Chemistry, Technology, and the
        Industrial Ecology of Non-Organic Compounds" was issued by the
        Perm State University publishing house. It contains an article
        by V. F. Panov, A. V. Klyuyev, V. I. Kichigin, and G. V.
        Khaldeyev, "Torsion Fields and Chemical Processes". The
        collection was published in the name of the Russian Academy of
        Sciences and the Science Council for Non-Organic Chemistry of
        the Ural Branch of the RAN. </p>
      <p>In the same year, 1998, a book by Yu. B. Shauba "Current
        Medical Research by New Physical Methods" was published in
        Vladivostok in the "Dal'nauka" publishing house in the name of
        the Russian Academy of Sciences (Far East branch). This work has
        a quite distant relationship to science. Judge for yourself:
        here are presented biofields and chakras, and the remote
        influence on a person of medicines and poisons. Microlepton
        radiation and torsion fields do not escape attention. I think
        that the reviewers who let this book come to light ought to be
        named. They are Doctor of Medical Sciences Yu. V. Kulakov and
        Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences B. V.
        Preobrazhenskiy. Unfortunately, the list of similar books is far
        from being limited to the three cited. </p>
      <p>The Russian Academy of Sciences publishes several popular
        science journals. There are many outstanding scientists on the
        editorial councils and editorial boards. However an impression
        is being formed that they are being used as famous names and do
        not set the journals' policy in any manner. How can it be
        explained otherwise that from time to time in these journals
        there appear articles extolling blatant pseudoscience? </p>
      <p>I remember several such cases. The pages of the journal "Nauka
        v Rossii [Science in Russia]" were offered to Mr. A. Ya.
        Grabovshchiner to extol so-called quantum medicine, which has
        nothing in common with science. A strange article, to put it
        mildly, was published in the journal "Elektronika [Electronics]"
        dedicated to drawing energy from the ether. In one of the recent
        issues of the journal "Energiya [Energy]" an article was printed
        singing the praises of Scottish astrologer Madame Marjorie Orr.
        A popular science journal actually called for humbly heeding
        astrological forecasts, rejecting attempts to build a future on
        the basis of logic, common sense, and scientific forecasts. I
        add that the newspaper "Poisk [Search]", one of whose founders
        is the Russian Academy of Sciences, was also notable for having
        published an article concerning experiments about so-called
        alternative vision conducted at MGU. I note that when they
        showed a girl who saw texts and pictures with her eyes
        blindfolded to one of the members of our Commission, he tied a
        mask around her that he had brought with him and all the
        miraculous effects immediately disappeared. </p>
      <p>In recent years pseudoscience has turned into a well-organized
        force having large financial capabilities. For example, the
        International Academy of Information Science regularly holds its
        forum in the State Kremlin Palace. Not a single scientific
        conference can permit itself anything of the sort. But this is a
        separate topic and we will not touch on it. We will dwell on a
        phenomenon which is rare for the time being - the penetration of
        pseudoscience into scientific conferences. I will cite the most
        scandalous example. The 2nd International Congress "Weak and
        Superweak Fields and Radiation in Biology and Medicine" was held
        in St. Petersburg in July 2000. Evidently the Congress'
        Organizing Committee did not conduct a selection of the reports
        presented. Judge for yourself what resulted. I will cite several
        titles of the reports. </p>
      <blockquote>The Biological Field and a Superfluid Physical
        Vacuum". <br>
        "The Effect of 'Vital" Water in Nature and Associated Natural
        Phenomena". This is what is stated in the report: "It was
        established that at 2320 the energetics of the water began to
        increase". The water is "vital", that is, charged up to the
        present". <br>
        "The Mechanism of Biolocational Interactions". Here is what kind
        of terminology is in this work: "Psychic Operator", "Mental
        Charging of Water", "Recording of the Charge was Conducted With
        the Aid of a Biolocational Framework". <br>
        "A Vital Substance in Weak Fields". It says in the report: "We
        assume that living systems are not only nucleic protein
        structures but also structures using spinor-torsion mechanisms".
        With the use of multidirectional torsion fields we have
        successfully modeled the possibility of transmitting the cell
        culture of conditions reflecting its past and future". <br>
        "The Energy Information Theory of Heredity, Mutation, and
        Morphogenesis". In this report "new scientific fields have been
        formulated: informational biology, informational genetics,
        informational medicine, informational physics, and space
        ecology".
        <p>Particularly commercial pseudoscience is also encountered in
          reports. </p>
        <p>"The influence of the "Mediv" applicator on the non-specific
          resistance of an organism with duodenal ulcers". By the way,
          expert examination has shown that this empty shell is
          completely useless. <br>
          "An assessment of the influence of biocorrectors on people
          using a fluorescent visualization method". In the report it
          talks about a GAMMA-7N instrument to which an article is
          devoted which gave the name to my book, "Swindlers Posing as
          Scientists".</p>
      </blockquote>
      But the inclusion in the program of a report entitled "The Essence
      of the Gravitational Constant" seems especially strange; there is
      no reference to the theme of the Congress and moreover it is
      mistaken. This, too, is irresponsibility and connivance.
      <p>Some words about the situation with the scientific journals
        published by the RAN. Alas, here too there is some defect in the
        work. In 1995 the journal "Biophysics" published an article of
        A. Ye. Akimov, V. Ya. Tarasenko, and G. I. Shipov entitled
        "Torsion Fields as a Cosmophysical Factor". Note that this is
        the only article about torsion fields which appeared in an RAN
        journal published not in the ZhEhTF [The Journal of Experimental
        and Theoretical Physics], where it properly belonged, but in a
        biophysics journal. Five years later one more article was
        published in the same journal, this time about pyramids. In 1989
        a publication by A. F. Okhatrin came out in the USSR DAN
        [Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences] presented by
        academician M. Sadovskiy about the discovery of so-called
        microleptons. Attempts by corresponding member of the USSR
        Academy of Sciences Ye. B. Aleksandrov to publish a refutation
        immediately afterwards were unsuccessful. Not long ago this
        story "echoed". In spring of last year TIEL, an English firm
        with Russian roots, tried to get a license to prospect for oil
        using "microlepton technology" methods. In spite of skepticism
        by geologists, who stated that there was no oil in the claimed
        region, the firm insisted on going ahead with the license all
        the same. Intrigued journalists went to the firm's management.
        The latter explained that they were searching for oil with the
        most modern methods. In 1995 Martin Perl received a Nobel Prize
        for the discovery of the tau lepton. So that's what microleptons
        are - something close to tau leptons in their properties. Having
        found out about the story about microleptons M. Perl was
        indignant. A scandal began. A commission of scientists arose
        which decided to investigate this story. Robin Marshall, an
        English physicist from Manchester University and a specialist in
        the theory of elementary particles, rather quickly found the
        1989 USSR DAN publication as the origin of this swindle. R.
        Marshall's comments about A. Okhatrin's article resounds as
        follows: "He is either insane or was drunk or is simply
        perpetrating a fraud". Prof. R. Marshall noted that "the
        existence of such a license will give them an enormous
        advantage". As regards the license, in the opinion of a number
        of members of the commission, "a license for drilling received
        from the British government could be used as a stamp of approval
        for marketing the technology in other regions of the world". One
        can imagine how things would be for our microlepton swindlers if
        they were already conducting oil and gas exploration in several
        regions of our country at state expense before receipt of the
        British license (which they will hardly get now)! Things have
        come to the point that swindlers have sent a letter to the head
        of the Russian government, M. M. Kas'yanov, with a proposal to
        investigate the oil and gas deposits in the Caspian [Sea]. The
        swindlers are ready to "appropriate" 500-600 million rubles a
        year. This is the sort of consequences that carelessness by
        editorial boards can lead to. This story served as a good lesson
        to us. I don't know about other branches but the Physical
        Sciences Branch does not let manuscripts go to the DAN without a
        review process. Not everyone likes this. "The fact that such an
        authority exists as a Commission to Combat Pseudoscience is a
        disgrace to the Russian Academy of Sciences. This Commission has
        one mission - to block the access to science of any new ideas".
        These words belong to academician M. M. Lavrent'yev. Mikhail
        Mikhaylovich is a mathematician, but for some reason he thinks
        that in the field of physics the entire community is not keeping
        abreast but that he alone is. He is angry at the Commission
        because for some time they have stopped the publication of his
        strange articles on physics in the DAN. And although the
        activity of the chairman of this Commission reminds M. M.
        Lavrent'yev of the activity of Torquemada, he has obviously
        overestimated my resources. In the final account, my influence
        obviously does not extend to the leading physics journals of the
        world. He could have tried to publish there. So if nothing
        happens, it won't be the Commission's fault. </p>
      <p>And one more academician, Natal'ya Petrovna Bekhtereva, is
        scaring the people with this terrible Commission through AiF
        [Argumenty i Fakty (Arguments and Facts)]. "Right now is not a
        suitable time to express very courageous ideas because in the
        Academy of Sciences there is a Commission on Pseudoscience". Why
        has academician N. P. Bekhtereva suddenly begun to fear the
        Commission? At the beginning of 2002 a group of authors headed
        by her published an article in the journal "Fiziologiya
        Cheloveka [Human Physiology]" entitled "About the So-Called
        Phenomenon of Direct Viewing". Even the authors themselves noted
        that this was a particularly preliminary investigation.
        Experiments were set up so that the possibility of simple
        peeking was not completely precluded. In such an event it is
        completely incomprehensible, how could one make dubious
        statements evoking a protest from any physicist, for example,
        "alternative viewing is performing with the aid of the skin" or
        with the aid of a locator [lokatsionnyy mekhanizm]? It is easy
        to say that there isn't the slightest sense contained in these
        statements. Meanwhile, the result of this absolutely
        unconvincing article was an uproar raised in the mass media
        about a dubious phenomenon presented by the press as a known
        fact established by academic science. Alas, there were several
        grounds for the mass media to refer to science this time.
        Natal'ya Petrovna herself recently stated, "This phenomenon has
        been thoroughly investigated by us" (AiF, N 1-2, 2003). But how
        can the authors of the article under discussion state with
        conviction that "this is a pilot work and a particularly
        preliminary qualitative investigation not claiming to have
        detected any quantitative patterns"? Is this really a crude work
        and also a "thorough investigation"? And does academician N. P.
        Bekhtereva really think that one unconvincing work is a
        sufficient basis to send the President of the country a letter
        with a suggestion about the need to introduce an "alternative
        viewing" training method in the special services? </p>
      <p>As regards Natal'ya Petrovna's fears for "very courageous
        ideas", then I want to note that not one physicist will regard
        "skin viewing" as a courageous idea; on the other hand, they
        would accompany it with another epithet. And the Commission has
        nothing to do with it here. The article evoked indignation not
        in the Commission but in the scientific community of the
        country. </p>
      <p>In December 2000 one of the best physics journals in Russia,
        "Letters to the ZhTF [Journal of Technical Physics]", published
        an article by V. V. Roshchin and S. M. Godin entitled "An
        Experimental Investigation of the Physical Effects in a Dynamic
        Magnetic System". The impression is created that the members of
        the editorial board did not look at the article, relying on the
        conclusion of the reviewer. Meanwhile, a casual glance would
        have been sufficient to understand that it could only have been
        published in some science fiction almanac. In reality, in a
        short note once can encounter antigravity (the weight of the
        apparatus during the experiments fell from 350 to 250 kg), and
        the observation of "magnetic walls" at a distance of up to 15
        meters from the axis of the apparatus without a reduction in the
        strength of the magnetic field with the distance from the axis,
        and a number of other wonders. </p>
      <p>To the editorial board's credit it needs to be said that it
        apologized on the pages of their journal to the readers for the
        publication of this article. And one more small touch about the
        article in question. It was published in the name of the
        Institute of High Temperatures; however the latter has no
        connection with this "research". And there is no such apparatus
        at the Institute. By the way, such forgeries are a standard
        practice of pseudoscience. </p>
      <p>It is known that science lives and develops according to its
        inherent ethical standards. Any new effect, any discovery must
        find first recognition in the scientific community. Therefore
        the authors of any significant scientific result attempt to
        publish it in the most prestigious scientific journals
        (refereed, of course). Publication of initial results in the
        mass media is considered bad form. Moreover, an appeal by
        scientists to the highest echelons of authority with a demand
        for immediate support for brilliant discoveries which the
        scientific community does not even suspect seems unacceptable. </p>
      <p>A year and a half ago V. Sobolev's group from Volgograd, which
        right away made seven (!) outstanding "discoveries" among which
        was a new inexhaustible source of energy, very much like a
        perpetual motion machine, a magnetic charger, a superconductor
        based on a low-temperature plasma, etc., turned to the President
        of the country, to the RF Security Council, to the government,
        and to a representative of the President. Physical scientists
        first heard about these sensational "discoveries" at a press
        conference to which none of them were invited and where they had
        ended up completely by accident. At this show it turned out that
        the group had not one scientific publication! It is true that,
        when replying to a proper question, V. Sobolev declared, "We are
        preparing articles, we will soon go to scientific journals, and
        the discussion will begin". A month later Mr. Sobolev had
        forgotten all about his promise. "To take time to write
        scientific articles, their review process, and pushing them
        through means taking much valuable time away from us". I hope
        that this reply needs no comment. </p>
      <p>Several months before the public appearance of V. Sobolev's
        group the mass media made yet one more "genius" a hero, L.
        Urutskoyev, who "discovered" a magnetic monopole and the effect
        of transforming elements, let's say, into gold and platinum. And
        not long ago in a letter to President V. V. Putin State Duma
        Deputy B. Ye. Nemtsov reported that L. Urutskoyev had managed to
        enrich uranium-238 by 50%. I would like to note that the
        concentration of this isotope in natural uranium without any
        enrichment is 99.28%. It is unworthy of a former physicist to
        "dash off" letters without even reading them. </p>
      <p>S. Shoygu also displayed concern about L. Urutskoyev by
        addressing a letter to the RF Security Council in support of L.
        Urutskoyev's activity. A strange picture is forming. Dozens of
        qualified physicists of Moscow, Novosibirsk, and St. Petersburg
        were forced to investigate the "discoveries" of L. Urutskoyev.
        They had to create a special commission in the Kurchatov
        Institute and listen to L. Urutskoyev and commission members at
        the Institute's Science Council. The experts were unanimous: L.
        Urutskoyev's experiments were faulty. But the latter, enjoying
        high-level support, changed his story: his correctness had been
        confirmed at the Joint Nuclear Research Institute [OIYaI]
        (Dubna) and in the nuclear center at Sarov (the former
        Arzamas-16). And here the director of the OIYaI, academician V.
        G. Kadyshevskiy, had already been forced to state that the OIYaI
        had no connection with L. Urutskoyev's experiments. It followed
        from those experiments which, by the way, were conducted at
        Sarov in the presence of L. Urutskoyev himself, that neither
        magnetic monopoles nor the transmutation of elements was
        observed. </p>
      <p>This was all reported to the RF Security Council. But one of
        the high-ranking officials very much wanted to create a new
        federal program under Mr. L. Urutskoyev. And here the acting
        chairman of the Security Council, V. Sherstyuk, distributed a
        new letter with a demand to conduct an expert analysis not just
        at the RAN but also at the Ministries of Atomic Energy and
        Science. This all seems absurd. For these organizations had
        already clearly expressed themselves clearly and unequivocably.
        What else was necessary? </p>
      <p>There are many volunteers among us to profit at state expense.
        And until the state decides to put projects in order with expert
        scientific review we will only watch from the sidelines how
        budget resources flow into the pockets of the con men and their
        protectors who hang around science. </p>
      <p>The problems of pseudoscience are quite multifaceted and we
        cannot cover all aspects of this phenomenon. For example, we
        have left the problem of the export of pseudoscience practically
        untouched. Nothing has been said about the completely abnormal
        situation with patent affairs in Russia. But even the facts
        mentioned in the report are sufficient to understand how
        dangerous is the phenomenon we are dealing with. We should
        organize a mass movement against pseudoscience. Branches of the
        Commission need to appear in the immediate future, at least in
        the largest cities of the country. </p>
      <p>The scientific community is beginning to open its eyes,
        although slowly. Today we have a sufficient number of qualified
        volunteer scientists who are ready to work in the Commission. I
        should note with satisfaction that Ukraine has followed our
        example. An analogous Commission has been organized there which
        has taken on itself a mission which includes the struggle
        against unprincipled advertising in medicine. Contacts have been
        established with this Commission just as with other
        international societies of skeptics which conduct educational
        work with the population of various countries. </p>
      <p>If we are to talk of the future, one of the most important
        tasks is the revival of popular scientific publications. I
        should note that the Siberian branch of the RAN has already
        displayed initiative in this matter. In the very near future the
        first four books will appear on the counters. I would like
        Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other large cities not to be left
        out of this undertaking. </p>
      <p>A no less important task is the involvement of the Russian
        Academy of Medical Sciences in the struggle against
        pseudoscience. The examples cited in the report are convincing
        evidence that the RAMN simply does not have the right to stand
        aside. </p>
      <p>Up to now the Commission has operated on a volunteer basis.
        However matters will go considerably better if the Presidium of
        the RAN agrees [to cover] small expenses. The Commission should
        have its own facilities in the RAN Presidium, means of
        communication, 2-3 staff members, and minimal financing. As
        regards the Commission members, they will work on a volunteer
        basis, as before. </p>
      <p>Today pseudoscience has enormous resources. It is absolutely
        clear that it is an unrealistic task to completely eliminate it.
        However if our plans are successfully realized, pseudoscience
        will have very great difficulty, however, as well as the
        unprincipled officials who are building their fortune in
        collusion with it. </p>
