      &nbsp;<br>
      Can used oil be recycled as fuel for vehicles? <br>
      <br>
      “Yes,” according to Teodorico Badua, the inventor of a so-called
      “fuel energy saving device.” <br>
      <br>
      This device, he says, transforms used oil and other combustible
      liquid waste into flammable gas that can be added to the engine
      fuel, which can translate to fuel savings of up to 30 percent. <br>
      <br>
      This La Union-based inventor says the device harnesses the energy
      from used oil by heating the combustible liquid waste into a gas
      generator. This process then generates fuel vapor that can be used
      for gasoline-based engines. <br>
      <br>
      The device has been tested to work with used cooking oil, engine
      oil and washing fuel, the Filipino inventor says. <br>
      <br>
      “The device promotes safe disposal of combustible liquid waste
      into the combustion chamber of the engine, which burns it as
      fuel,” says Badua.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The device is vying for the Tuklas (Most Outstanding
      Invention) category along with other novel inventions. It will be
      on display at the National Inventors’ Week exhibit at the
      Philippine Trade and Training Center until November 21. <br>
      <br>
      Badua has been working with vehicle engines since 1962. Seeing the
      load of used oil disposed as waste and hearing stories about waste
      disposal problems and the irreversible environmental impact of
      used oil, Badua says he started exploring how waste products,
      especially used oil, can be disposed in an eco-friendly manner and
      if possible, harness it further as fuel. <br>
      <br>
      The idea for the invention came while he was working in a power
      plant years ago. A co-worker added gasoline into the engine but
      some of the oil was converted into vapor because of an engine
      malfunction they discovered later. Despite this malfunction, he
      notices that the machine run faster. <br>
      <br>
      “I was inspired to develop a machine that can do this for used
      engine oil,” says Badua. <br>
      <br>
      It took Badua two years to develop the device. It became a project
      he did after work or during weekends. He already has invested
      about P100,000 for the development of the device. <br>
      <br>
      He tested his invention on a 1994 vehicle and was able to see
      increased engine power, torque and speed, which allows for longer
      mileage in every liter of fuel consumed. <br>
      <br>
      The lubricity of the gas oil reduces friction and heat between
      pistons and cylinders that also pronged engine life, he adds. <br>
      <br>
      Benefits for the environment include reduction of hydrocarbon and
      carbon monoxide exhaust emission in the atmosphere, as well as
      promotion of oil recycling to protect water resources from
      contamination, he says.<br>
      <br>
      “From processing a liter of used oil, you get several grams of
      sediments, which is a big help in reducing unnecessary disposal of
      waste oil,” he adds. <br>
      <br>
      With his invention, Badua says Filipinos should also learn how to
      extract from their experiences valuable lessons that can be
      developed into solutions to problems. For Badua, who finished a
      vocational course in diesel mechanics, inventing the fuel energy
      saving device shows that every Filipino can be an inventor.<br>

        <br>
        <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0001] The present invention relate to an speed booster gas
        saving device, that recovers exhaust energy of internal
        combustion engine to save fuel, wherein the exhaust force and
        the heat energy of exhaust gases that is wasted, is utilized to
        superheat a device to transform water instantly into steam
        energy upon injected inside, in addition to the exhaust force to
        drive a rotor blades connected to the propeller shaft or to the
        differential gear to increase the driving torque, power and
        speed of a moving vehicle, in addition to the engine power to
        gain more mileage with less fuel burning and emission of exhaust
        in the environment.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] The technology of the invention can also applies in the
        industrial sector especially in power generating plant and
        airline facilities to utilize the heat energy of exhaust gases
        of the turbine engine, to transform water instantly into steam
        energy upon injected inside in addition to the exhaust thrust of
        the turbine engine, to increase generating capacity or speed of
        an airplane. Carrying water on board in an airplane is not a
        problem, though waste water can be injected inside the
        superheated chamber to produce steam energy in addition to the
        exhaust thrust.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0003] In the internal combustion engine, the exhaust gas
        flowing out from the engine is a by-product of combustion after
        power stroke that has a remaining energy, the pressure, and
        heat, that is wasted as it flows out in the atmosphere. Although
        the exhaust pressure (force) is used to drive a turbo charger,
        the purpose is to increase the engine power to carry a heavier
        load by increasing the volume of air inside the combustion
        chamber for a higher compression to introduce more fuel during
        combustion to produce more power, but the exhaust energy remain
        as waste as it flows out and becomes more and greater in the
        processed.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] Conservation of energy is the core concept of the
        invention, wherein the exhaust energy wasted is converted into
        mechanical energy in addition to the engine torque to increase
        speed of a moving vehicle to achieve a greater distance with
        less fuel burning and emission of exhaust of internal combustion
        engine to reduce air pollution in the environment.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0005] The present invention relate to an speed booster gas
        saving device more particularly to the method of converting
        exhaust energy into mechanical force to save fuel of internal
        combustion engine, wherein the exhaust force and the heat energy
        of exhaust gases wasted is utilized to superheat a device, to
        transform water instantly into steam energy upon injected inside
        in addition to the exhaust force to drive a rotor blades
        connected to the propeller shaft, or to connect the rotor blades
        to a differential gear to drive the rear wheels of a front wheel
        driven car in addition to the engine force to increase the
        driving torque, power and speed of a moving vehicle to save fuel
        consumption and emission of exhaust in the environment.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] The method is consist of enlarging a portion of the
        exhaust pipe connected directly in the exhaust manifold of an
        engine, to encased inside a tubular stainless steel steam
        chamber to be superheated by the flowing hot gases that bears a
        temperature of 650° F. to 950° F. to transform water instantly
        into steam energy upon injected inside, by a water feed pump in
        a nozzle jet inserted horizontally on the steam chamber that
        taperedly closed at the upper end, having an opening on the
        opposing end below for the steam generated to discharge out, in
        addition to the exhaust force flowing on the exhaust pipe
        leading to the driven rotor blades connected to the propeller
        shaft inside a housing enclosure in addition to the engine
        torque to increase speed of a moving vehicle. With the rotating
        motion of the rotor blades, the exhaust gases flows continuously
        out in the housing enclosure exhaust outlet connecting the
        exhaust pipe into the atmosphere.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] To adapt the rotor blades in the propeller shaft, the
        cross-joint yoke is modified by replacing the yoke of the
        transmission gear sleeve coupling with a connecting flange, and
        securely fastened to the transmission gear power output shaft
        with an screw bolt on the shaft center end for the rotor blades
        a fixed axis when adapted, with a four connecting bolts together
        with the velocity joint in replacement of the cross-joint to
        drive the propeller shaft.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] The rotor blades housing enclosure is firmly attached to
        the transmission gear housing end with supporting bars connected
        to each other, to secure the rotor blades housing body with a
        side cover to enclosed the rotor blades inside. On the inlet
        exhaust pipe connected on the housing enclosure exhaust inlet, a
        heat expansion joint is connected to protect the driven blades
        from thermal expansion of the exhaust pipe, and also a by-pass
        exhaust valve is connected across the housing enclosure exhaust
        inlet pipe and exhaust outlet pipe that open in time the vehicle
        stops on traffic lights or somewhere, and when the vehicle is
        shifted in reverse gear, to allow the exhaust to flow freely to
        prevent the engine from suffocation. The speed booster gas
        saving device is provided with a water supply and control
        system. From the tank, a water supply tube is connected to the
        water feed pump suction side. The pump is electrically operated
        on and off through a control switch mechanically actuated
        through the engine accelerating mechanism, to control the flow
        of water into the water nozzle jet inserted horizontally inside
        the water transforming device, to minimize using water
        especially when the vehicle is running down hills that the
        engine power is not much needed, to save water to carry less
        volume on board.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] This invention does not affect nor bear damage to the
        engine, since the technology of the invention is applied outside
        the engine body, on the exhaust discharge line to recover the
        exhaust energy wasted to convert into mechanical energy in
        addition to the engine torque to save fuel of internal
        combustion engine and to reduce exhaust emission in the
        environment.<br>

        <b> </b><br>
        [0013] In drawing FIG. 1, the arrow represent the direction of
        exhaust flow from the engine to the enlarge portion of the
        exhaust pipe (1) to be connected in flange (2) in the exhaust
        manifold of an engine is seen partially cut-out to present the
        water transforming device tubular stainless steel steam chamber
        body (3) taperedly close at the upper end (4) with support plate
        (5) inside. The tapered end is to allow the exhaust gases to
        flow smoothly where the water nozzle jet (6) is inserted
        horizontally a little below on its side, with a water delivery
        tube (7) connected from a water feed pump (31) FIG. 3. On the
        opposing end below of the steam chamber body is slightly reduced
        in size for steam discharge opening (8) in which the enlarged
        portion of the exhaust pipe lower end is gradually reduced to
        the exhaust pipe (9) original size to placed a heat expansion
        joint (10) to protect the driven rotor blades (11) inside the
        housing enclosure (12) from thermal expansion of the exhaust
        pipe connecting housing enclosure exhaust inlet (13) and exhaust
        outlet (14) in flanges. The device is also provided with exhaust
        by-pass valve (15) connected across the housing enclosure
        exhaust pipe inlet (9) and exhaust pipe outlet (16) to allow a
        continuous flow of exhaust gases to prevent the engine from
        suffocation in time that the vehicle stop on traffic lights or
        somewhere and when the vehicle is shifted in reverse gear.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] In drawing FIG. 2, is seen that the rotor blades (11) is
        inside in the housing enclosure (12) that firmly attached on the
        transmission gear housing end (17) with supporting bars (18)
        connected to each other in screw bolts (19), in the opposite
        side is the housing enclosure side cover (20) with a fastening
        bolts (21) around. Inside, said rotor blades is adapted in a
        modified cross joint yoke by replacing the yoke in the
        transmission gear sleeve coupling (22) with a connecting flange
        (23) and securely fastened with screw bolt (24) on the
        transmission gear power output shaft (25) center end, to adapt
        the rotor blades and the velocity ball joint (26) together, with
        a connecting bolts (27) for the rotor blades a fixed axis during
        operation. Said velocity ball joint with a flexible dust guard
        (28) is in placed of the cross joint to drive the propeller
        shaft (29).<br>
