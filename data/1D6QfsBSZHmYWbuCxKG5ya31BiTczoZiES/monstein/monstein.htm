      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- The object of
      the invention is to provide a method and device for use in the
      field of intense electromagnetic pulse generation, for example for
      investigating or influencing materials structures as well as for
      use in EMC investigations, so as to provide a novel technological
      alternative for developing further areas of application. This
      object is achieved in that the structure of the core member of the
      device essentially takes the form of 2 + n (i.e. 5 when n = 3)
      electromagnetic resonant cavities fitted into one another
      according to the "Russian doll" principle; and in that the
      resonant circuit system is connected for circuitry and
      metrological purposes to the pulse generators (33, 34, 35, 36,
      37), used for generation, and to an evaluation and control unit
      (38) and a vibration-measuring device (40). The invention concerns
      a method and device for generating electromagnetic pulses on the
      basis of electrical, magnetic and mechanical interactions between
      electromagnetically and mechanically oscillatory systems and can
      be used in fundamental research for materials structure,
      solid-state physics, material investigations and EMC
      investigations.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Apparatus for
      changing the properties of materials comprises an outer hollow
      cylindrical electromagnetic magnetic arrangement (1) having a
      recess for an excitation coil (2) in its wall; two inner
      electromagnetic arrangements (3, 4) arranged over each other in an
      axial direction and having inner excitation coils (6, 7); an inner
      plate-like hollow chamber (5) between the inner magnetic
      arrangements acting as a reaction chamber for the materials to be
      treated; and two immersion anchors (8, 9) which close the inner
      chamber of the outer magnetic arrangement. An Independent claim is
      also included for a process for operating the apparatus. Preferred
      Features: The inner magnetic arrangements are coated with a
      diamagnetic material with the same or lower friction coefficient
      and the same of higher heat resistance as PTFE. A copper
      intermediate layer is arranged between the immersion anchors and
      the inner magnetic arrangements.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Since there has been no success achieved yet in explaining all
      physical facts and results of experiments with a universal and
      unified theory, the serious and absurd step away from reality into
      abstraction was taken. In so doing, explicitly and consciously,
      one gave up the idea of creating a concrete and visual picture of
      physical phenomena. One seems to be happy with purely mathematical
      proofs. Experimental facts take a secondary place and are only
      accepted, if they "fit" into the official doctrine. A different
      opinion , for example, was held by Goethe, who believed that
      mathematics was not at all required in order to understand
      natural, scientific phenomena. It is believed, therefore, that
      nature can be explored according to the principle of the
      sorcerer's apprentice:"If you do thus and so, then this and that
      will happen", but one does not have the minutest idea of what in
      reality and, actually is happening. The problem of the unification
      of the world view of physics can not be solved on the basis of
      mathematical fictions. This has been proven sufficiently by now
      since all attempts thus far have failed. The total takeover of
      physics by mathematics, changed it into an abstract discipline,
      which conveniently overlooks the facts. Physics should not be
      conducted in the dragnet of mathematics alone, since it is a
      rather independent field, which can be described with logical,
      functional models. Significant for the reality of natural events
      can only be experimental facts, and by no means any mathematical
      abstractions. <br>
      <br>
      Even the smallest particle possesses a certain spatial volume and
      thus has 3 dimensions. Up to this time there has never been shown
      an actual structure with more or less than 3 dimensions. Even the
      thought of a 4-dimensional object is an absolute impossibility,
      and even more so its practical realization. Inspite of this,
      presently , as is well known, work is being done worldwide on the
      theory of "superstrings" based on 10 dimensions! (9 spatial
      dimensions and 1 dimension for time). Beyond this, establishment
      physics, however, is convinced, that nature somehow is able to
      create "structures" up to 26 spatial dimensions (!), for only thus
      can light waves be mathematically "described". Even the greatest
      nonsense can be mathematically described or `camouflaged' thus
      attaining credibility in the eyes of establishment physics. Empty
      Space: Empty space is defined as an "absolute nothing". but in an
      absolute nothing, nothing can change. If, however, an
      electromagnet is switched on inside a vacuum, then the building up
      of a magnetic field does cause a change in the so-called "absolute
      nothing"! The same thing happens when an electric field is
      established! Therefore, if changes in "empty" space do happen,
      then of necessity "something" has to be present which is changing.
      Consequently "empty" space must contain a substance yet to be
      defined or a medium must exist (but not in the sense of the
      classical ether-idea).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A space free from any matter is described as a vacuum. This state
      can be artificially created with the help of a vacuum pump.
      Strictly speaking, a pure vacuum, however, does not exist. Even
      between galaxies there are found elementary particles, even if
      only in a minute density. A point in space, however, can very well
      have an electromagnetic potential. Electromagnetic radiation
      penetrates the vacuum at the velocity of light. <br>
      <br>
      All of physics abounds with "phenomena" (unexplained facts), which
      establishment physics can not explain nor prove. These "phenomena"
      are therefore "ignored" and for obvious reasons do not find a
      place in textbooks or instructions in universities and higher
      schools of learning. Ether is what Aristotle called the heavenly
      substance, which light penetrates in order to reach earth. Ether,
      is the Greek word for `shine'. Since the ether can not be
      differentiated from the vacuum, it can not move and thus remains
      at absolute rest. If there is absolute rest, there will also be
      absolute motion, absolute space and absolute time. The next
      question was, what is the absolute velocity of the earth compared
      to this resting ether. Such a value would be of great importance
      for the philosophy of science. If light consists of ether waves,
      as formerly assumed, then velocity measurements of light in the
      direction of travel and against the Classical Ether (Aether) Idea
      Ether is what Aristotle called the heavenly substance, which light
      penetrates in order to reach earth. Ether, is the Greek word for
      `shine'. Since the ether can not be differentiated from the
      vacuum, it can not move and thus remains at absolute rest. If
      there is absolute rest, there will also be absolute motion,
      absolute space and absolute time. The next question was, what is
      the absolute velocity of the earth compared to this resting ether.
      Such a value would be of great importance for the philosophy of
      science. If light consists of ether waves, as formerly assumed,
      then velocity measurements of light in the direction of travel and
      against the direction of travel of the earth, should show
      differences. (Michelson-Morley-experiment). Since, however,
      surprisingly, no differences were measured, the idea of an
      absolute space was dropped. The theory of relativity was born.
      This theory can not decide whether there is an ether or not. The
      great physicist Dirac said in 1953, that the etherless basis of
      physics theory would soon reach the end of its validity.. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Working Strategy </span><br>
      <br>
      Other ways had to be found therefore, because, using the same
      knowledge and the same methods, by default, the same (incorrect)
      results will be obtained. Therefore the following working strategy
      was devised: <br>
      <br>
      1. For this work, only clear, concrete functional models can be
      used. Not one single abstract factor can be allowed. Everything
      must be clear down to the smallest detail and it must be possible
      to describe it with the parameters of classical mechanics.
      Absolute causality is the basic principle. Causality Causality is
      that relationship, in which cause and effect stand. With respect
      to events in nature, philosophically, an unbroken and complete
      causal relationship is assumed. In this the same causes result in
      the same effects. In physics one tries to relate events to
      previous events. The circumstance, that an event can only be the
      consequence of an earlier event, is called causality. From this
      can be deduced, that time travel is impossible, especially not
      into the past. In the theory of relativity, however, it is
      assumed, that there are events, which have no causal relationship
      since in time they are so remotely placed, that even light rays
      can not connect them. In quantum mechanics cause and effect are
      only connected by means of statistics. This purely statistical
      interpretation, by default, results in a total break with all
      previous ideas in physics. Modern physics rejects determinism
      (causality) for the microcosmic events, but in so doing it also
      rejects it for any other events, generally, which are but built up
      from innumerable micro events. Einstein was convinced, that behind
      the world of quanta there was hidden the well known world of
      classical physics (hidden parameters). For this reason he
      consequently rejected the quantum theory. <br>
      <br>
      2. Mathematics can only be used from now on, for example, to
      determine exact values or relationships, but in no case must
      fictional, abstract structures be "designed" without any
      relationship to reality. <br>
      <br>
      3. The analytical method is not to be used any more, but rather
      that of synthesis. The question then is: How is space structured,
      to produce entities such as elementary particles, atomic nuclei,
      electric fields, magnetic fields, gravitation etc. and how do they
      exist? <br>
      <br>
      4. The goal will have been reached in reducing all functional
      models designed to one functional model which then can be used and
      applied to all of physics. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.1. Demands for a Unified
        Functional Model </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      We will now show the most basic demands required for such a
      functional model (there are many more), without using the
      knowledge gained from the completed theory. We have two different
      particles, one A (proton), one B (electron). Each of these
      particles will repell another of the same kind. The repelling of
      the A-particles amongst themselves must be equally as strong as
      the repelling of the B-particles amongst themselves. However, A
      and B attract each other with the same force as the repelling
      force. On the outside nothing is noticed of this force, it has
      been neutralized. B is about 2000 times lighter than A, yet its
      electrical charge is just as strong as that of A, yet of opposite
      polarity. <br>
      <br>
      Besides this there is another third particle C (neutron), which is
      neither attracted nor repelled by either A or B, nor does it have
      any electrical charge. When A or B are moving, they generate a
      magnetic field at right angles to their direction of motion. If A
      moves, it generates a magnetic field which is identical with that
      of B, if it (B) moves in the opposite direction of A. Likewise B
      generates a magnetic field, which is identical to that of A, if it
      (A) moves in the opposite direction of B. A and B rotate about
      their own axis and in so doing they also generate a magnetic
      field. If A rotates in a certain direction, then it will generate
      a magnetic field that in fact corresponds to that of B, if B
      rotates in the opposite direction of A. Likewise B generates a
      magnetic field, which in fact corresponds to that of A, if A
      rotates in the opposite direction of B. Besides this, there is the
      third particle C (neutron), which, though it has no electrical
      charge, does, however, generate a magnetic field due to its
      "rotation", which corresponds to that of B. If A, B or C are
      moving, a resistance is encountered in the direction of motion,
      which has to be overcome. Without any further influence, these
      particles move uniformly in a straight line in the given
      direction. <br>
      <br>
      Any deviation from this uniform, straight line motion again
      encounters resistance. In order to stop the particles, the same
      force must be expended, as was used to accelerate them. At very
      high velocities a mass increase seems to be noticed in A, B and C,
      with simultaneous particle contraction in the direction of motion,
      as well as a slow down of time (dilatation). All three changes
      start at the same time and increase proportionally with uniform
      intensity in relation to the velocity. Particles A and C can
      combine into atomic nuclei, in which case C can only remain stable
      inside the nucleus. At a certain size or certain amount of mass
      between A and C the nucleus becomes unstable (radioactive). This
      limits the number of particles A and C in the nucleus. Among the
      particles A, B and C there is also a small attractive force which
      is identical with that of gravitation. These few examples may be
      impressive, but they are only a fraction of the demands required
      for a functional model. It seems unlikely that in past
      publications the relatively simple functional model presented, did
      in fact perfectly fulfill all these highly complex and seemingly
      contradictory demands. Beyond this, it is the only solution of a
      functional model, that is possible, as has been found out in more
      than 30 years of research. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Problems </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Against expectation, the main difficulty was found, not in the
      complication of the problem, but on the contrary, in the fact that
      nature "functions" rather simply. This is according to the
      principle: "This is as simple as is possible!" Man thinks much too
      complicated. The reason is, that a very simple solution of a
      difficult problem makes tremendous demands on the thinking
      apparatus. However, a complicated, elaborate solution of the same
      problem does not strain the brain at all. Therefore it is terribly
      difficult to find terribly simple solutions. (having quoted Paul
      Scherrer). Present physics offers these complicated, elaborate
      solutions to problems, even in totally abstract form. Thus it was,
      at the beginning, a rather troublesome path to represent a
      concrete, realistic functional model based on all the connected
      facts, of which a partial field of physics consists. But the fact
      alone that such functional models could be realized (at first only
      for few partial fields of physics), was enough motivation to
      continue the work. To this must be added that these models did
      withstand any criticism, and so far no one has been able to refute
      even the smallest detail. In the course of time a specific thought
      model developed from the individual functional models constructed,
      which made further work essentially easier. Conventional physics
      also has its own thought model. <br>
      <br>
      After the basic functional models had been constructed with great
      effort, it was found to be fairly simple to reduce these to one
      fundamental model, for not once was there a choice among several
      possibilities. Inside the framework of this functional model,
      there is always only one specific solution possible. This makes it
      logically and factually consequent, since real events in nature
      agree exactly with this unified theory, and this all the more, as
      literally every single, physical function can be reduced to
      pressure and counterpressure. This is simple and it can not be
      simpler. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foundational Prerequisites </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The entire contents of the universe consists of an ideal gas,
      which is highly degenerated within high density zones. Density and
      pressure of this medium are extremely high, even if compared to
      the proportions inside the atomic nucleus. This gas consists of
      uniform particles called "space-quanta" (SQ). The volume of these
      SQ is many orders smaller than elementary particles. All
      elementary particles and force fields consist of these SQ.
      Compared to the normal SQ-density (static medium pressure)
      positive elementary particles constitute zones with smaller
      SQ-density (low pressure zone) and negative elementary particles
      are zones with greater SQ-density (high pressure zones). <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ideal, strongly degenerated Gas </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The concept of an ideal gas is found in connection with the change
      of volume of gases. If this volume change is indirectly
      proportional to the pressure, which is imposed on an enclosed gas,
      then it is called an ideal gas. (Law of BoyleMariotte). Helium, a
      real gas, is considered an ideal gas at a sufficient distance from
      the condensation point. Water vapor, however, has an approximately
      10% higher coefficient of expansion and can therefore not be
      called an ideal gas. As a consequence of the equation of state it
      is also true, that the volume of an ideal gas is proportional to
      its temperature, as long as the pressure does not change (Law of
      Gay-Lussac). If a gas is heated it will expand if no extra
      pressure is exerted on the piston at the same time. Matter is
      called degenerated if it is totally ionized, that is, if the
      positive and negative particles are not coupled together. We know
      about so-called "free" electrons in a metal. If those electrons
      were bound to the atomic nuclei, then the metal would not be able
      to conduct electricity. By analogy: If in a gas all electrons are
      free, then the gas is called degenerated and often called a
      plasma. Since the atomic nuclei and electrons surrounding them are
      independent of each other, one can not talk about a common
      temperature any longer, which means, the concept of temperature
      has no more meaning. <br>
      <br>
      Local pressure differences within a medium can only be kept up by
      outward energy input. For the existence of elementary particles it
      is therefore absolutely required to have a permanent energy
      supply. Therefore we postulate the introduction of a central
      oscillator (spherical transmitter of zero order), which transmits
      longitudinal, mechanical oscillations, with a frequency of about
      1023 Hz, to the SQ-medium. These progressive waves are reflected
      at the periphery of the universe. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spherical Oscillator of Zero
        Order </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Most sonic transmitters (oscillators) can be classified in three
      basic types, depending on the type of direction of propagation,
      which are spherical transmitters of zero, first and second order.
      The spherical transmitter (or radiator) of zero order, also called
      "acoustic monopole", can be represented by a pulsating sphere.
      This is a sphere which periodically changes its radius. The
      generation of sound therefore depends on a periodic change of
      volume. Thus sound propagates uniformly and symmetrically in all
      directions. Longitudinal and Transverse Waves Longitudinal waves
      can best be described as compressions and rarefactions of a
      medium, which due to mutual repulsion of the particles propagate
      with the so-called signal velocity. The waves are caused by a one
      time or periodic displacement of a particle or that of a spherical
      oscillator. If it is a periodic displacement, then the particles
      oscillate about their position of rest by periodically moving in
      the direction of propagation of the wave or against it. If the
      original oscillation is harmonic, then we have a sine wave. Sound
      waves are typically longitudinal waves. The signal velocity of
      sound is that velocity which depends on the medium. Transverse
      waves are waves in which the particles move at right angles to the
      direction of advance of the wave. In these waves the crests and
      the valleys of the wave alternate. The point behind the crest of
      the wave, where no displacement occurs, corresponds to the zone of
      greatest compression. The corresponding point behind the valley in
      the wave is the zone of greatest rarefaction in longitudinal
      waves. Waves on the surface of a liquid are typically transverse
      waves. Electromagnetic waves also belong to the transverse waves.
      Their signal velocity is equal to the velocity of light. <br>
      <br>
      Consequently, standing waves (SW) are generated, without gaps, in
      the entire space between the central oscillator and the periphery
      of the approximately spherical universe. Standing waves are the
      result of interference between two coherent, opposing waves of
      equal frequency and amplitude. For the existence of elementary
      particles and force fields (such as gravitation) it is absolutely
      required, that the amplitude pressure of the SW will be
      significantly higher than the static SQ-medium pressure. This
      results in an asymmetry, because the amplitude pressure of the low
      pressure phase can only go to a zero value, while in the high
      pressure phase it can reach any value. This causes an oscillation,
      the negative half-wave of which has a smaller amplitude than the
      positive half-wave. This, amongst other things, makes the signal
      velocity `c' dependent on the pressure of the amplitude. We are
      specifically dealing here with mechanical, longitudinal waves
      (comparable to ultra sonic waves of extremely high frequency),
      which contrary to electromagnetic waves, can assume any energy
      values while remaining at the same frequency. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Progressive and Standing Waves </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Two waves, which are simultaneously traversing the same medium in
      opposite directions will superimpose upon a standing wave,
      provided that both waves agree in amplitude, frequency and
      wavelength. Most often such standing waves originate if a
      longitudinal, one-dimensional (linear) wave or a transverse,
      three-dimensional, spherical wabe reaches superposition with
      itself after it has been reflected. A reflection results when
      entering into a thinner medium, as well as when entering a denser
      medium. If no reflection with above conditions is observed, then
      one calls it a progressive wave. The amplitude of the standing
      wave is twice as great as that of a progressive wave. <br>
      <br>
      The frequency of 1023 Hz yields the elementary length of 10 -13
      cm, and likewise we have the elementary time period of 10 -23
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Signal Velocity `c' </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The velocity of propagation of waves is also called signal
      velocity. It depends on the type of wave, and sometimes also on
      the wave length, but it always depends on the medium which
      oscillates, respectively on the medium through which the
      electromagnetic wave travels. Surface waves can be very slow,
      while pressure waves range from 170-5400 meters / second.
      Electromagnetic waves all have approximately the velocity of
      light. If dispersion shows up, then it is better called group
      velocity due to the different signal velocities found with
      different wave lengths. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mechanical and Electromagnetic
        Waves (Difference) </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      While in mechanical waves particles of matter are oscillating, the
      propagation of electromagnetic waves is not bound to matter. Its
      signal velocity, contrary to that of mechanical waves, is nearly
      constant in different media and almost one million times greater.
      The potential and kinetic energy (energy of motion) of the
      mechanical wave corresponds to the average electrical,
      respectively the average magnetic energy density of the
      electromagnetic waves. The total energy density for both types of
      waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude. The
      outstanding difference between the two types of wabes, however, is
      this: The energy density of electromagnetic waves has a fixed
      relationship to the oscillation frequency. Mechanical waves,
      however, can assume any energy value at any frequency.
      Interference If several waves traverse a medium, superposition
      takes place, which is called interference. This calls for the
      principle of the undisturbed superposition (superposition
      principle), which means, that at any place and any time, the
      momentary displacements of the waves involved, may be added to
      obtain the resulting displacement. These resulting displacements
      may be positive or negative, which can also result in
      extinguishing the waves. The maximum total amplitude corresponds
      to the greatest possible displacement, which can be caused by the
      interference at a certain place at a certain time. Even light
      waves can interfere, provided they are coherent. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Static Medium-Pressure </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A pressure exerted on a liquid or a gas, distributes over the
      entire medium in all directions with equal force. Or: Inside, as
      well as at the boundaries of a resting medium, which is not
      subject to external forces, the same pressure exists everywhere.
      This is the static pressure of the medium. This all around
      pressure distribution is explained by the easy displacement of the
      light-weight particles in liquids and gases. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coherence </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is has been found, that several light sources in a room will
      never extinguish by interference or show any intensity patterns.
      The reason for this is, that different types of light sources
      generally are incoherent. If light waves from the same wave train
      are split by reflection, refraction or diffraction then the waves
      thus generated are called coherent. Only these types of waves are
      capable of interference. Laser light allows extreme coherence
      which is important in holography. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sound Waves </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Sound waves are mechanical, longitudinal waves. Originating from a
      sound source, an oscillating body, they travel in solid bodies,
      liquids and gases in the form of pressure variations (pressure
      waves). The human ear usually can hear frequencies from 16000 -
      20000 Hertz. Higher frequencies are designated as ultrasound,
      lower ones as infrasound. The amplitude corresponds to the
      loudness, the frequency of the tone or the pitch, and the shape of
      oscillation to the overtones or harmonics. The velocity of sound
      reaches from 170 meters / second (in the noble gas Xenon) to over
      1403 m / s (in water at zero degrees Celsius) to 5400 m / s (in
      quartz glass). In dry air of zero degrees Celsius the velocity is
      332 meters / second. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationship Frequency -
        Oscillation Energy </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Energy is transported in every wave as oscillation energy, which
      is passed on from particle to particle of the medium. Standing
      waves are an exception, the energy of which remains in the same
      place and is not transported. At the zero point a particle has
      maximum velocity and maximum kinetic energy. At the valley (return
      point) it has no velocity, but maximum potential energy, is
      proportional to the square of the amplitude. This means if the
      amplitude (loudness or volume in acoustics) is doubled, the energy
      will increase fourfold. If the energy for a small unit volume is
      calculated, which is the energy density, then it is found that it
      also is proportional to the frequency of a wave. If therefore the
      frequency of a wave is doubled, keeping the same amplitude (in
      acoustics this means one octave higher), then the energy density
      increases fourfold. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition of the Electric Field</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      All positive and negative elementary particles, being resonators,
      are forced to carry out radial pulsations in rhythm with the
      central oscillator (1023 Hz), thus generating progressive waves,
      which are identical with the electric field of the respective
      particle. Negative particles (high pressure zones) reflect
      pressure as pressure and low pressure as low pressure. Positive
      particles (low pressure zones) however, reflect pressure as low
      pressure and low pressure as pressure, which results in a phase
      displacement of 180. Between negative particles on the one hand
      and positive particles on the other hand, interference causes
      twice as high a pressure as can be found outside the particular
      particle. This is identical with the repulsion of like charges.
      Resonators A resonator is a device which can be excited to
      resonant oscillations. Some resonators are used to make acoustical
      measurements. Gas filled hollow spaces, of any shape (especially a
      sphere) with a neck for an opening are resonators comparable to a
      spring to which a mass is attached.The oscillation of the spring
      corresponds to the periodic change of volume of the gases in the
      sphere. The mass of gas in the neck is being moved back and forth.
      It can be shown, that such a sphere has a precisely definable
      resonant frequency which depends on the volume of gas, the
      dimensions of the neck, as well as the velocity of sound in that
      particular gas. If many of those resonators of different size are
      lined up in a row, it is possible to make acoustical analyses,
      which are the records of the frequency portions of an acoustic
      wave. There are also resonators for electromagnetic waves. A well
      known example is the optical laser. <br>
      <br>
      Due to the phase displacement of 180* , however, a compensation
      (extinction) occurs between negative and positive particles
      resulting in lower pressure compared to the pressure outside the
      particle. This is identical to the "attraction" of unlike charges.
      The particles of course are not "attracted" but pushed together.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Different Actions of Reflection
        (phase displacement) of Longitudinal Waves and Transverse Waves
      </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Longitudinal waves</span>: If a
      stiff spring is elastically supported and brought to oscillation
      by pulling it down briefly, then a compression of the spiral
      windings will transmit downward to the end of the spring. When the
      compression has reached the end it runs out freely. A subsequent
      rarefication (loosening) of the windings runs back up. The
      reflection at the free or "soft " end turns the compression into a
      rarefaction, which is called a phase shift or phase displacement
      of 180 degrees. If the spring is held tight at the lower, the free
      end, then the compression is reflected and runs back as a
      compression. In other words, the compression is not followed by a
      rarefaction, but another compression. A rarefaction will run back
      as a rarefaction. The reflection at the firm or "hard" end will
      reflect a compression as a compression, and a rarefaction as a
      rarefaction. Transverse waves: If a horizontally supported rope is
      fastened flexibly at one end and the other end is made to
      oscillate by an upward thrust, then a wave crest will move to the
      other end of the rope. Since the rope is freely movable it can let
      the wave crest oscillation move upward freely. It is as if this
      end of the rope is subjected to an upward thrust, which runs back
      as a wave crest. A wave trough (valley) arriving will run back as
      a trough. The reflection at the free or "soft" end sends a wave
      crest back as a wave crest and a wave trough is reflected as a
      trough. If, however, the rope is fixed at the end, then the rope
      end is not able to carry out an oscillation vertically to the
      direction of the rope. If therefore a crest arrives, then the
      previous rope particles can not fully carry out the motion
      imparted to them, since the fixed end of the rope exerts a pull
      downward on them, which results in a motional impulse that also
      goes down. This causes a wave trough to be formed which moves in
      the opposite direction. For the same reason an arriving wave
      trough runs back as a wave crest. A reflection at the firm or
      "hard" end sends a wave crest back as a wave trough and a wave
      trough is reflected as a wave crest. This reflection action is
      called phase shift or phase displacement of 180 degrees. <br>
      <br>
      The electrostatic repulsion and "attraction" is based on two
      criteria: <br>
      <br>
      1. All positive elementary particles pulsate in the same phase
      position. All negative particles pulsate in the same phase
      position. <br>
      <br>
      2. Between positive and negative elementary particles exists a
      phase displacement of 180?. Progressive waves generated by
      positive and negative elementary particles (which are resonators),
      do not only interfere with each other, thus causing the "electric
      field", but also interfere with the SW. There is a superposition
      of the reflected component of the SW, arriving from the outside,
      with the negative particles. This causes a high pressure along the
      axis of incidence, which reaches its maximum value right at the
      particle and then decreases with the square of the distance. The
      reflected portion of the component of the SW, (being 180* out of
      phase) and arriving from the outside, interferes with the positive
      particles. This causes a low pressure in the axis of incidence (by
      extinction), which reaches its maximum value right at the particle
      and then decreases with the square of the distance. This
      interference with SW only happens, if the respective electrical
      charges are not compensated. Low pressure or high pressure are
      thus only depending specifically on the wave. The static pressure
      of the medium is not changed. This can be stated as follows: <br>
      <br>
      A positive electrostatic field causes a low pressure. A negative
      electrostatic field causes a high pressure. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition of the Biefeld-Brown
        Effect</span> <br>
      <br>
      Based on a proposal by Prof. Paul Biefeld (former fellow student
      of Einstein in Zurich), the physicist Townsend Brown carried out
      an experiment in 1923 as follows: A high voltage plate condenser
      was charged and suspended horizontally, being free to move.
      Townsend Brown observed that the condenser started to move on its
      own in the direction of the positive pole (low pressure)
      sustaining a constant thrust. When the condenser was vertically
      fastened to a beam scale a weight increase showed if the positive
      pole (low pressure) was pointing down. Correspondingly a weight
      loss occurred when the negative pole (high pressure) was pointing
      down. The intensity of the effect was determined by the size of
      the pole plate areas, the voltage level and the polarization
      capability of the dielectric. The exact explanation for the event
      of this effect was given, in detail, under the title: <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Definition of the Electric Field</span>.
      Therefore, the Biefeld -Brown Effect has nothing to do with
      gravitation. It is a pure effect of the electric field. Dielectric
      A dielectric is a non-conducting substance, which is placed
      between two oppositely charged plates (for instance in a plate
      condenser).This changes the field strength between the plates. The
      type of change is described by a characteristic of the dielectric,
      called permittivity (dielectric coefficient). Vacuum and air have
      a minimum permittivity of one (1). Water has the highest
      permittivity (about 80). [ A BaTiO3 crystal can have a value of
      2000, if the electric field is perpendicular to the principal axis
      of the crystal]. <br>
      <br>
      The Biefeld-Brown Effect directly proves the pressure decrease in
      the direction of the positive electric charge and that of pressure
      increase in the direction of the negative electric charge. This,
      in turn, is an absolute, basic requirement for the origin of a
      space quantaflux (SQF), respectively that of a magnetic field.
      (Please see the following definition of the magnetic field). This
      advances the Biefeld-Brown Effect to one of the most important,
      fundamental effects of physics. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition of the Magnetic Field</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      If a negative particle ( e.g. electron) is moved it will create a
      high pressure zone at right angles to its direction of motion.
      Behind the negative particle the previous high pressure (caused by
      the presence of the particle) will decrease. This causes a
      pressure difference, which is again equalized by the space quanta
      flux (SQF). This SQF is identical with the "magnetic field" and,
      with a negative particle, flows counter to the particle direction.
      (Fig. 1). If a positive particle is moved, it creates at right
      angles to its direction of motion a low pressure zone. Behind the
      positive particle normal pressure will build up again. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Repulsion of Opposite Flows </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In oppositely directed flows, particles in the boundary layers of
      the two flows hit each other slightly out of line ( such as two
      billiard balls in a non-centered stroke). Thus the particles
      sustain an impulse which drives them apart. Oppositely directed
      flows therefore can not mix and will push each other aside
      (repulsion). Pressure Decrease in Flows A flow contains two
      pressure components: The static pressure of tjhe medium and the
      dynamic pressure caused by the flow. The static pressure
      corresponds to the potential, and the dynamic pressure to the
      kinetic (motional) energy of the medium. Since the energy of a
      stationary flow remains constant, this also is valid for the total
      pressure, which is made up of the dynamic and static pressure. If
      a resting medium is caused to flow (by opening a valve), then a
      dynamic pressure results and thus the static pressure of the
      medium decreases, in order to keep the total pressure the same.
      (Law of Bernoulli). This pressure decrease shows its effect at
      right angles to the direction of flow. The principle is used
      technicalls in many spray cans and atomizers, as well as in
      so-calles venturi pumps or hose end sprayers. <br>
      <br>
      This causes a pressure difference which again equalizes as SQF
      (magnetic field). This SQF for the positive particle flows in the
      same direction as the particle itself. (Fig.2).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      During induction the primary current produces an SQF opposing the
      direction of motion of the electrons. In the direction of flow a
      stagnation point develops with the free electrons of the secondary
      coil, which shifts the electrons in the flow direction to one end
      of the coil, as far as the electrostatic repulsion (negative pole)
      will allow it. At the other end of the coil this causes a
      deficiency of electrons (positive pole). Thus an electric voltage
      can be measured at the ends of the coil. Moving electrons also
      generate a high pressure at right angles to their direction of
      motion. Behind the electrons the previous high pressure will again
      decrease. This pressure difference equalizes with a secondary-SQF,
      which is opposing the primary-SQF. These two SQ- <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Process of Induction </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A voltage will be induced in a coil, if the magnetic flux
      penetrating it does change. A similar action occurs when moving a
      conductor across a magnetic field. This process is called
      induction. If the conductor loops are closed the induced voltage
      will generate an induction current. The prerequisite of induction
      is always a momentary change of the magnetic flux, which can be
      achieved by changing the magnetic field, or moving the conductor
      within the field. The induction voltage, respectively the
      induction current, in a closed loop always acts against the
      generating flux change (Lenz's Law). With an increase in the
      magnetic flux the induced current flows against the direction
      which is derived from the so-called cork screw-rule (right hand
      rule). <br>

        charge (proton) </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If the primary-SQF remains constant, then the resistance of the
      conductor, as well as the electron stagnation at one end of the
      coil (repulsion of like charges), will cause the secondary
      electrons to slow down until they stop. This has decreased the
      secondary-SQF and now a stationary (primary-SQF) will form around
      these electrons, which will have symmetrical pressure points at
      the front and the back. There is no voltage to be measured at the
      coil ends at that moment. (Fig. 4). Stationary Flow (Pressure
      Points) A flow (flux) means a motion of liquid or gases. The cause
      of a flow are, for example, gravitation or pressure differences.
      In order to designate the direction of motion of the flow one uses
      streamlines. If the paths of the individual particles agree with
      these streamlines, and if the streamlines keep the same shape for
      some time, then the flow is called stationary. If an ideal
      (frictionless) liquid flows around a sphere, then a stagnation
      point is formed at the foremost point of contact. At this point
      the flow velocity becomes zero and simultaneously a maximum
      pressure builds up at that point (pressure point). Starting at
      this point the flow will split, flow around the sphere and form
      another analogous point on the opposite side 180* away. The flow
      velocity will increase and reach its maximum value at the equator
      of the sphere, then decrease until it slows to a standstill at the
      opposite stagnation point.The pressure decrease inside the flow
      (at right angles to the flow) around the sphere, will reach its
      maximum value at the point of the maximum velocity, which is at
      the equator of the sphere.The forces acting on the sphere at the
      two stagnation points or pressure points are of equal magnitude,
      but oppositely directed, thus compensating to zero (see also 12.9
      in the Glossary). No forces will act on a sphere submerged into
      the (constant) flow of an ideal liquid. On the other hand, a
      sphere will not be subject to any resistance, of it moves with a
      constant velocity (uniformly-straight) through a resting, ideal
      liquid or a resting, ideal gas. <br>

        Current </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If the primary current is switched off, thus decreasing the
      primarySQF, the rear pressure points of the secondary-electrons
      will be relieved first and then they receive an impulse from the
      front pressure points in the opposite direction (compared to the
      initial current switched on). Again the electrons are pushed to
      one of the coil ends (negative pole), as far as the electrostatic
      rejection pressure will allow. This causes a deficiency of
      electrons at the other end (positive pole). A voltage can now be
      detected at the ends of the coil. The moving secondary-electrons
      themselves create a high pressure at right angles to their
      direction of motion. Behind the electrons the previous high
      pressure builds up until it reaches normal pressure. The pressure
      difference equalizes with a secondary-SQF in the same direction as
      that of the primary-SQF. Between both of these SQF, flowing in the
      same direction, a low pressure builds up, which due to the static
      pressure of the medium will push them together ("attraction"). In
      the primary coil we see, analogous to this, the decrease of the
      primary-SQF with a simultaneous, so-called break surge. (Fig.5). <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Self-Induction </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If an electric voltage is applied to the ends of a conductor (for
      example a coil), then the free electrons will move in the
      direction of the positive pole, and generate an SQF opposite to
      the direction of motion. Each free electron will hinder adjacent
      electrons due to the structure of its own specific SQF (opposite
      to the direction of motion). This will achieve a common flux with
      symmetrical pressure points in the front and the back of the
      electrons. When the current is turned off the SQF decreases again
      by relieving the front pressure points first.<br>
      <br>
      secondary primary pressure point <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.5. SQF when switching off
        primary current </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The rear pressure points now impart an impulse to the free
      electrons which is identical with the break surge. Self-Induction
      Changes of the magnetic flux induce a voltage not only in another
      conductor, but also in the coil itself which produces the magnetic
      field. This phenomenon is called self-induction. In this case the
      voltage generated by self induction opposes the change of current
      in the coil, which first caused the induction. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic "Attraction" and
        Repulsion</span> <br>
      <br>
      The magnetic "attraction" and repulsion follows the Bernoulli
      Principle: Flows traveling in the same direction (SQF) "attract"
      Flows traveling in opposite directions (SQF) "repel" The pressure
      decreases in any flow at right angles to its direction of motion.
      This is also true for the SQF. The static SQ-medium pressure acts
      as a radially, inward directed force on any SQF (e.g. pinch
      effect, Fig.6). Two SQF in the same direction do not "attract"
      each other, but they are pushed together by the static SQ-medium
      pressure. Field lines used before are an exact cross section
      through the SQF (disregard vector arrows) and are identical with
      equipotential surfaces. They are an excellent help to represent
      the exact path and the local intensity of the SQF. The magnetic
      field of a cylindrical bar magnet consists of the SQF revolving,
      in a circle, around the cylinder axis. In any sector of such a
      circular flux there is at 180? on the opposite side a sector in
      which the flow is of opposite direction. [This is more easily seen
      if the circle is really small]. Since opposing flows repel, this
      causes an expansive pressure, working from the inside to the
      outside on the entire circular SQF-flow. This pressure wants to
      divert the flow, as is well seen in the field lines of a bar
      magnet, especially at the poles (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the
      static pressure of the medium exerts a radial pressure from the
      outside on the SQF trying to compress it at right angles to the
      direction of flow<br>

          <br>
          Comment: magnet size: D=61mm, d=24mm, h=4mm<br>
          <br>
          Distance between magnet and metallic desk of the motor - 45mm<br>
          <br>
          Cooper foil thick - 0.1mm<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, Monstein Effect was not confirmed, all results
          may be explained by aerodynamics and vibration effects.<br>
          <br>
          Experiments with big magnet to be continued...( Feb 10, 1998 )<br>
