          infections</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      New Pitt research uses electrochemical approach to treat
      infections of metal-based implants<br>
      <br>
      Titanium has many properties that make it a great choice for use
      in implants. Its low density, high stiffness, high biomechnanical
      strength-to-weight ratio, and corrosion resistance have led to its
      use in several types of implants, from dental to joints. However,
      a persistent problem plagues metal-based implants: the surface is
      also a perfect home for microbes to accumulate, causing chronic
      infections and inflammation in the surrounding tissue.
      Consequently, five to 10 percent of dental implants fail and must
      be removed within 10-15 years to prevent infection in the blood
      and other organs.<br>
      <br>
      New research from the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of
      Engineering introduces a revolutionary treatment for these
      infections. The group, led by Tagbo Niepa, PhD, is utilizing
      electrochemical therapy (ECT) to enhance the ability of
      antibiotics to eradicate the microbes.<br>
      <br>
      "We live in a crisis with antibiotics: most of them are failing.
      Because of the drug- resistance that most microbes develop,
      antimicrobials stop working, especially with recurring
      infections," says Dr. Niepa, author on the paper and assistant
      professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the Swanson
      School, with secondary appointments in civil and environmental
      engineering and bioengineering. "With this technique, the current
      doesn't discriminate as it damages the microbe cell membrane. It's
      more likely that antibiotics will be more effective if the cells
      are simultaneously challenged by the permeabilizing effects of the
      currents. This would allow even drug-resistant cells to become
      susceptible to treatment and be eradicated."<br>
      <br>
      The novel method passes a weak electrical current through the
      metal-based implant, damaging the attached microbe's cell membrane
      but not harming the surrounding healthy tissue. This damage
      increases permeability, making the microbe more susceptible to
      antibiotics. Since most antibiotics specifically work on cells
      that are going to replicate, they do not work on dormant microbes,
      which is how infections can recur. The ECT causes electrochemical
      stress in all the cells to sensitize them, making them more
      susceptible to antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers hope this technology will change how infections
      are treated. Researchers focused their research on Candida
      albicans (C. albicans), one of the most common and harmful fungal
      infections associated with dental implants. But while dental
      implants are one exciting application for this new technology,
      Niepa says it has other potential applications, such as in wound
      dressings.<br>

          Fluconazole-Tolerant Candida albicans using Implantable
          Titanium</b><br>
        <b>Eloise Eyo Parry-Nweye, et al.</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A persistent problem in modern healthcare derives from the
      overwhelming presence of antibiotic-resistant microbes on
      biomaterials, more specifically, fungal growth on metal-based
      implants. This study seeks to investigate the antifungal
      properties of low-level electrochemical treatments delivered using
      titanium electrodes against Candida albicans. We show that C.
      albicans can be readily controlled with electrical
      currents/potentials, reducing the number of viable planktonic
      cells by 99.7% and biofilm cells by 96.0-99.99%. Additionally,
      this study explores the ability of the electrochemical treatments
      to potentiate fluconazole, a clinically used antifungal drug. We
      have found that electrochemical treatment substantially enhances
      fluconazole killing activity. While fluconazole alone exhibits a
      low efficiency against the stationary phase and biofilms C.
      albicans cells, complete eradication corresponding to 7-log
      killing is achieved when the antifungal drug is provided
      subsequently to the electrochemical treatment. Further mechanistic
      analyses have revealed that the sequential treatment shows a
      complex multi-modal action, including disruption of cell wall
      integrity and permeability, impaired metabolic functions, and
      enhanced susceptibility to fluconazole, while altering the biofilm
      structure. Altogether, we have developed and optimized a new
      therapeutic strategy to sensitize and facilitate the eradication
      of fluconazole-tolerant microbes from implantable materials. This
      work is expected to help advance the use of electrochemical
      approaches in the treatment of infections caused by C. albicans in
      both nosocomial and clinical cases.<br>

      A system and method for treating bacterial cells with an
      electrochemical process, alone or in combination with antibiotics.
      Weak electric currents are used to effectively eliminate bacterial
      cells. The method may be adapted for novel therapies of chronic
      infections and strategies to control persistent biofouling. The
      system has broad spectrum applications in treating chronic and
      drug resistant infections, such as those caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and methicillin resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus, and may also be used for decontamination of
      medical devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to electrochemical control of
      bacterial cells and, more particularly, the effect of weak
      electric currents on bacterial cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Previous studies of persister cells have led to important
      discoveries that are shifting the paradigm of research in
      microbiology and antimicrobial therapy. It is now well recognized
      that subpopulations of bacterial cells in a culture can enter a
      dormant (non-growing) state that are extremely tolerant to a
      variety of unrelated stresses such as antibiotics and heat. Such
      heterogeneity has been reported to exist in even well mixed shake
      flask cultures at exponential phase. This phenotypic variation can
      lead to three subpopulations in a given culture including the
      normal cells, type I persister cells from the stationary inoculums
      and type II persister cells that are generated during growth.
      Persister cells are not mutants with drug resistant genes, but
      rather phenotypic variants of the wild-type strain. Persister
      cells neither die nor grow in the presence of an antibiotic, and
      when reinoculated, they grow into a normal culture with a similar
      percentage of cells as persisters, leading to high antibiotic
      tolerance.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Although persister cells normally only make up a small
      portion of the population, they play a critical role in antibiotic
      tolerance. Most antibiotics inhibit bacteria by targeting growth
      related cellular activities, e.g., protein, DNA, and cell wall
      syntheses. They can eliminate the majority of bacterial population
      by killing the normal cells. For persister cells, however,
      antibiotics can only repress but not eliminate this subpopulation
      because persister cells are non-growing dormant cells. Thus, the
      seeming disadvantage of being dormant in normal environment
      becomes an advantage for persister cells when being challenged by
      antibiotics. When the treatment is stopped, some persister cells
      revert back to normal cells and reestablish the population. Such
      tolerance leads to reoccurrence of infections and facilitate the
      development and spread of multidrug resistance through true
      mutations.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Recent research has demonstrated that persister cell
      formation increases significantly in stationary-phase cultures and
      the surface-attached highly hydrated structures known as biofilms.
      Formed in a dynamic process, mature biofilms typically have
      mushroom-like structures with cells embedded in a polysaccharide
      matrix secreted by the bound bacterial cells. Biofilm cells are up
      to 1000 times more tolerant to antibiotics and disinfectants
      compared to their planktonic counterparts. Thus, deleterious
      biofilms cause serious problems such as chronic infections in
      humans as well as persistent corrosion and equipment failure in
      industry. Although not completely understood at the molecular
      level, the biofilm-associated tolerance is due to several factors
      acting in concert. Bacterial cells in biofilm produce a
      polysaccharide matrix, which creates a physical barrier that
      retards or blocks the toxic compounds from reaching the cells.
      However, protection by the polysaccharide matrix can only
      partially explain the tolerance because at least some antibiotics
      can readily penetrate the matrix yet still can not eliminate
      biofilm cells. Biofilm mode of growth is also associated with
      changes in bacterial membrane structure and reduction in cell
      growth rate. The changes in membrane structure could reduce the
      permeability to toxic compounds, while the reduction in growth
      rate can lead to higher tolerance to growth-dependent killing by
      antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that the slow growth,
      especially that associated with persister cells, is the most
      challenging mechanism for treating chronic infections.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The rapid development and spread of multidrug resistant
      infections present an increasing challenge to public health and
      disease therapy. As an intrinsic mechanism of drug resistance,
      biofilm formation renders bacteria up to 1000 times less
      susceptible to antibiotics than their planktonic (free-swimming)
      counterparts of the same genotype. Such intrinsic resistance also
      facilitates the development of resistance through acquired
      mechanisms that are based on genetic mutations or drug resistance
      genes. Consistently, excessive antibiotic treatment of biofilm
      infections at sublethal concentrations has been shown to generate
      antibiotic-tolerant strains. It is estimated that biofilms are
      responsible for at least 65% of human bacterial infections. For
      example, it is estimated that in the United States 25% of urinary
      catheters become infected with a biofilm within one week of a
      hospital stay, with a cumulative 5% chance each subsequent day.
      Biofilms are also detected on implanted devices and are a major
      cause of explanation. Orthopedic implants showed a 4.3% infection
      rate, or approximately 112,000 infections per year in the U.S.
      This rate increases to 7.4% for cardiovascular implants, and
      anywhere from 5%-11% for dental implants.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In the biofilm state, bacteria undergo significant changes
      in gene expression leading to phenotypic changes that serve to
      enhance their ability to survive challenging environments.
      Although not completely understood, the tolerance to antibiotic
      treatments is thought to arise from a combination of limited
      antibiotic diffusion through the extracellular polymeric
      substances (EPS), decreased growth rate of biofilm cells, and
      increased expression of antibiotic resistance genes in biofilm
      cells (10). Treatments that are capable of removing biofilms from
      a surface are by necessity harsh and often unsuitable for use due
      to medical or environmental concerns. It is evident that
      alternative methods of treating bacterial infections, and most
      notably biofilms, are required.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Electric currents/voltages are known to affect cells.
      However, most of the studies have been focused on high voltages
      and current levels such as eletctroporation, electrophoresis,
      iontophoresis, and electrofusion except for a few studies about
      biofilm control using weak electric currents. In 1994, Costerton
      and colleagues reported an interesting synergistic effect between
      low level direct currents (DCs) and tobramycin in killing
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm cells grown in a continuous-flow
      chamber. This synergistic phenomenon was termed the “bioelectric
      effect.” In addition to P. aeruginosa, bioelectric effects have
      also been reported for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli,
      Staphylococcus aureus, P. fluorescens, as well as mixed species
      biofilms. Although the impact of electric currents on bacterial
      susceptibility to antibiotics and biocides is well accepted, there
      is little understanding about the mechanism of bioelectric effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] An electric current at an electrode surface can trigger ion
      flux in the solution as well as electrochemical reactions of the
      electrode materials and redox species with electrolyte and
      generate many different chemical species, e.g. metal ions,
      H&lt;+&gt; and OH&lt;−&gt;. Although pH change has been shown to
      cause contraction of the biofilm formed on the cathodic electrode,
      change of medium pH to which prevails during electrolysis did not
      enhance the activity of antibiotics. Consistent with this
      observation, buffering the pH of the medium during electrolysis
      fails to eliminate bioelectric effect. Another finding suggesting
      the existence of other factors is that the bioelectric effect has
      been observed for biofilms formed in the middle of an electric
      field, but not in contact with either the working electrode or
      counter electrode. Since the electrochemically-generated ions
      accumulate around the electrodes, the biofilms in the middle of an
      electric field are not experiencing significant changes in pH or
      other products of electrochemical reactions. This is also
      evidenced by the report that radio frequency alternating electric
      current can enhance antibiotic efficacy. Since no
      electrochemically generated molecules or ions will likely
      accumulate with alternating currents, other factors may play a
      critical role.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The bioelectric effect was also observed when the growth
      medium only contained glucose and two phosphate compounds. This
      observation eliminates the electrochemical reaction of salts as an
      indispensable factor of bioelectric effect. Previous studies have
      also ruled out the impact of temperature change during
      electrolysis (less than 0.2° C.). Although these studies provided
      useful information about bioelectric effect, its mechanism is
      still unknown. The exact factors causing bioelectric effect and
      their roles in this phenomenon remain elusive. Compared to
      biofilms, even less is known about the effects of weak electric
      currents on planktonic cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is important to note that many aspects of cellular
      functions are electrochemical in nature. That is, the redox state
      of cells is related to membrane status, oxidative status, energy
      generation and utilization and other factors. Therefore, it is
      possible that redox state of cells may be affected by
      electrochemical currents (henceforth ECs). To better understand
      the effects of ECs on planktonic and biofilm cells, we conducted a
      systematic study of the effects of weak ECs on the planktonic and
      biofilm cells of the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
      subtilis. Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for 50% of
      infections in the United States, and 60% of nosocomial infections.
      With the emergence and wide spread of multidrug resistant
      bacteria, effective methods to eliminate both planktonic bacteria
      and those embedded in surface-attached biofilms are badly needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] The present invention provides a system and method for
      treating persister cells with an electrochemical process, alone or
      in combination with antibiotics. The present invention also
      includes an electrochemical cell for treating persister cells.
      Weak electric currents are used to effectively eliminate persister
      cells and the efficacy can be further improved through synergistic
      effects with antibiotics. The present invention demonstrates
      unprecedented efficacy in controlling persister cells and the
      present invention may be adapted for novel therapies of chronic
      infections and strategies to control persistent biofouling. The
      present invention has a broad spectrum applications in treating
      chronic and drug resistant infections, such as those caused by
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and MRSA
      (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The present
      invention may also be used for decontamination of medical devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] According to a first aspect of the present invention is an
      electrochemical method for killing persister cells, the method
      comprising the step of applying a weak electrical current to a
      bacterial culture, either planktonic culture or a biofilm, wherein
      the current is between 1 and 500 microamperes per square
      centimeter. According to a preferred embodiment, the current is a
      direct current of approximately 75 microampheres per square
      centimeter.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] According to a second aspect of the present invention is an
      electrochemical method for killing persister cells, the method
      comprising the step of applying an electrical current to a
      bacterial culture, either planktonic culture or a biofilm, wherein
      the current is between 1 and 500 microamperes per square
      centimeter, and where the medium is an electrically-conductive
      saline solution such as 0.85% NaCl.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] According to a third aspect of the present invention is an
      electrochemical method for killing persister cells, the method
      comprising the step of applying an electrical current to a
      bacterial culture, either planktonic culture or a biofilm, wherein
      the current is between 1 and 500 microamperes per square
      centimeter, and wherein the medium also contains an effective
      amount of an antimicrobial compound such as an antibiotic. The
      concentration of the antibiotics can be significantly lower than
      what it is required to work in the absence of a current.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] According to a fourth aspect of the present invention is a
      method for treating an item comprising a biofilm, the method
      comprising the steps of: (i) placing the item at least partially
      in a medium; and (ii) applying an electrical current of between 1
      and 500 microamperes per square centimeter to the medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] According to a fifth aspect of the present invention is a
      system for killing persister cells, the system comprising: (i) a
      treatment cell with a treatment area for receiving an item and
      which contains a reference electrode, a working electrode, a
      counter electrode; (ii) a medium (liquid or cream) that at least
      partially fills the treatment area and is in communication with
      the reference electrode, the working electrode, and the counter
      electrode. The treatment cell applies an electrical current
      between 1 and 500 microamperes per square centimeter to the medium
      in order to kill the persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] According to a sixth aspect of the present invention is a
      system for killing persister cells, the system comprising: (i) a
      treatment cell with a treatment area for receiving an item and
      which contains a reference electrode, a working electrode, a
      counter electrode; (ii) a medium that at least partially fills the
      treatment area and is in connection with the reference electrode,
      the working electrode, and the counter electrode; and (ii) an
      effective amount of an antimicrobial compound such as an
      antibiotic. The concentration of the antibiotics can be
      significantly lower than what it is required to work in the
      absence of a current. The treatment cell applies an electrical
      current between 1 and 500 microamperes per square centimeter to
      the medium in order to kill the persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another embodiment of the present invention, Bacillus
      subtilis was used as the model Gram-positive species to
      systematically investigate the effects of electrochemically-based
      currents on bacteria including the morphology, viability, and gene
      expression of planktonic cells, and viability of biofilm cells.
      The data suggest that the weak electrochemical currents can
      effectively eliminate Bacillus subtilis both as planktonic cells
      and in biofilms attached to surfaces in a dose-dependent manner.
      DNA microarray results indicated that the genes associated with
      oxidative stress response, nutrient starvation, membrane
      functions, and sporulation were induced by electrochemical
      currents. These findings suggest that ions and oxidative species
      generated by electrochemical reactions might be responsible for
      the cidal effects of these currents.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference
      numerals refer to like parts throughout, the present invention
      provide a system and method for the elimination of persister cells
      by electric currents and synergy with antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example I</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] The present invention was tested using an electrochemical
      cell seen in FIG. 2 and with the use of E. coli HM22 constructed
      by the pioneer work of Moyed and Bertrand because it produces 1000
      times more persister cells in exponential-phase cultures than the
      wild-type E. coli strains and has been used in most studies of
      persister cells. To evaluate the effects of electric currents, the
      persister cells were first isolated as described previously.
      Briefly, the exponential culture of HM22 at optical density at 600
      nm (OD600) of 0.3 in LB medium was treated with 100 μg/mL
      ampicillin for 3 h to kill and lyse the normal cells. The
      persister cells were then collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm
      at 4° C. for 10 min and resuspended in 0.85% NaCl buffer. The
      persister cells were then treated in a customized electrochemical
      cell, shown in FIG. 2. Electrodes with a dimension of 1 cm×5.6 cm
      were cut from a flat 304L stainless steel sheet (MSC; Melville,
      N.Y.) or graphite sheet (McMaster—CARR, Santa Fe Springs, Calif.).
      The same material was used for both the counter electrode and
      working electrode, which were placed into a 4.5 mL standard-style
      polystyrene cuvette (Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.). A 0.48 mm
      diameter silver wire (A-M Systems; Sequim, Wash.) was placed in
      bleach for 30 min to produce an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The
      bottom 1″ of a borosilicate glass Pasteur pipette (Fisher) was cut
      and the reference wire was placed inside to prevent contact with
      the working or counter electrode. An AFCBP1
      potentiostat/galvanostat (Pine Instrument Company, Grove City,
      Pa.) was connected via alligator clamps to the electrodes and used
      to control the current. The volume of medium in the
      fully-constructed electrochemical cell was 3 mL (see FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Significant killing of persister cells was observed both
      with stainless steel and graphite electrodes. For example,
      treatment with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(voltage around 1V) for 50 min in
      0.85% NaCl buffer caused complete killing of persister cells (a 6
      log reduction in viability, FIG. 3A) by counting colony forming
      units (CFUs) before and after treatment. The killing was not
      simply caused by the products of electrochemical reactions since
      incubation with the pre-treatment buffer (0.85% NaCl buffer
      treated with the same level and duration of current) did not cause
      any apparent killing (data not shown). Interestingly, the electric
      current was more effective in killing persister cells than normal
      cells. As shown in FIG. 3A, the same treatment of normal cells
      only caused a 3 log reduction in the number of viable cells.
      Effective killing of persister cells was also observed using
      graphite electrodes. As shown in FIG. 3B, treatment with the same
      current level (75 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;) for 60 min caused a 3 log
      reduction of viable persister cells, whereas pre-treated medium
      only reduced the viable cells by less than 1 log. Furthermore, the
      efficacy of persister control can be improved through synergistic
      effects with antibiotics. The graphite electrode was used for this
      experiment since it does not cause complete killing, allowing the
      synergistic effects to be observed. As shown in FIG. 3B,
      application of 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;current or 20 μg/mL cinoxacin
      (Cin) alone caused a 3 log or no apparent reduction in the number
      of viable persister cells, respectively. When these two treatments
      were applied together, however, nearly complete killing (more than
      5 log reduction) was observed. Such synergistic effects have not
      been reported for persister cells. It is also worth noticing that
      the synergy is not only limited to Cin since tobramycin (Tob) also
      exhibited synergistic effect with electric current (see FIG. 3B).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] To determine if electric currents are also effective in
      killing persister cells in biofilms, E. coli HM22 biofilms were
      cultured on 304L stainless steel coupons. The biofilm-coated
      coupons were then used as anodic or cathodic electrode, and
      treated with direct current alone or with tobramycin together.
      Immediately after treatment, the cells were removed from the
      biofilm-coated coupons by sonication and vertexing. A portion of
      the cells was directly plated on LB+DPA plates to quantify the
      total number of viable cells by counting CFU, the other part of
      the sample was treated with 100 μg/mL ampicillin for another 3 h
      and plated on LB+DPA plates to quantify the number of the viable
      persister cells. This approach allowed us to study the killing
      effects on normal and persister cells separately.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] As shown in these FIG. 4, when treating biofilm persisters
      with tobramycin alone (20 μg/mL or 150 μg/mL), there was no
      significant reduction in total number of viable cells and number
      of viable persister cells compared to the untreated control
      sample. These results are consistent with the knowledge that
      biofilms have significantly enhanced tolerance to antibiotics
      compared to planktonic cells. However, treatments with 75
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;alone for 60 min reduced the number of viable
      persister cells by 3.5 logs. After treating biofilms with currents
      and tobramycin together for 60 min, the number of viable persister
      cells was reduced by 5.4 log (nearly complete killing, FIG. 4).
      Thus, synergy between electric currents and antibiotics also exist
      for killing persister cells in biofilms.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] With the capability to quantify the expression level of
      each gene at the genome-wide scale, DNA microarrays have been
      extensively used to monitor global gene expression profiles in
      response to different stimuli including persister formation and
      biofilm formation. However, currently there are no reported data
      about the effects of weak electric currents on bacterial gene
      expression at the genome-wide scale. To identify the effects of
      electric currents on cell physiology of persister cells and normal
      cells at the genetic level, the present invention utilized two
      experiments that revealed clues about the effects of weak electric
      currents on bacterial cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In the first experiment, persister cells and normal cells
      of E. coli HM22 harvested using the same method as describe above
      were treated with and without 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC for 15 min in
      0.85% NaCl buffer. In a parallel experiment, the persister cells
      were also treated with M56 buffer with the same level and duration
      of the current. After harvesting HM22 normal and persister cells,
      they were concentrated 40 times and resuspended in 6 mL 0.85% NaCl
      buffer and 6 mL M56 buffer respectively. Both samples were
      separated into two equal aliquots: one was left untreated,
      meanwhile the other one was treated with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC.
      After 15 min incubation with and without current, all of the cells
      were centrifuged immediately for 30 s at 13,200 rpm and 4° C. to
      harvest the cells. For RNA isolation, each cell pellet was
      resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent buffer (Invitrogen Co.,
      Carlsbad, Calif.) and beaten rigorously at 4,800 beats per min for
      30 s in a closed bead beater tube with 200 μl of silicon beads
      using a mini bead beater (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville,
      Okla.). The following isolation steps were conducted by following
      Trizol reagent protocol and the total extracted RNA was
      subsequently purified using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN Inc.,
      Valencia, Calif.). The quality and quantity of the total RNA
      samples were evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
      Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) and the microarray
      hybridizations were performed using E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays
      (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Both were performed using
      the DNA microarray core facilities at the SUNY Upstate Medical
      University (Syracuse, N.Y.).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Stringent criteria were applied to select the
      induced/repressed genes based on p-values (&lt;0.0025 or
      &gt;0.9975) calculated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and
      Tukey By weight. The applied current in 085% NaCl buffer was found
      to induce 9 genes and repressed 36 genes in E. coli HM22 persister
      cells (see Table 1). While 27 of these genes have unknown
      functions, the treatment did induce the genes of the trp operon
      (trpEL), acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase (acpD), L-serine
      dehydratase (sdaB), oxidative stress response (oxyS), and
      repressed the cys operon (cysCDJKNP), production of tryptophanase
      (tnaL) and nitrite extrusion (narU) (see Tables 1-5). In
      comparison, treatment with the same current level in M56 buffer
      induced 15 genes (yibP, cysU, csgD, nrdE, narW, hisL, oxyS, etc)
      and repressed only 4 genes of persister cells (see Tables 1-5).
      Interestingly, the induced genes have functions of central
      intermediary metabolism, protease for cell division, PTS system,
      sulfate transport, surface structure, DNA synthesis, his operon,
      oxidative stress response and unknown functions. Three of the four
      repressed genes have unknown functions, while the forth gene uvrB
      has functions of DNA damage recognition and repair. These data
      suggest that weak electric currents are able to activate certain
      cellular activities including those related to oxidative response,
      membrane structures and functions.<br>

      [0055] The effects on cell membrane functions are corroborated by
      a parallel but more complete study regarding the effects of
      electric currents on the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis
      168. In this experiment, the cells of B. subtilis 168 in late
      exponential phase was treated for 15 min in LB medium with 42, 139
      or 417 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC using 304L stainless steel as electrodes
      in the electrochemical cell shown FIG. 2. Each condition was
      tested in duplicate and the data was analyzed using cluster
      analysis. To differentiate the effects of currents from those of
      the electrochemical reaction products, the control samples were
      incubated for 15 min in the LB medium that was pre-treated with
      the same level and duration of the current. Since the control
      samples were prepared in pre-treated LB medium containing all the
      electrochemical reaction products, the gene expression changes are
      mainly caused by the currents as well as the movement and gradient
      of chemical species, e.g. ions. The genes that were induced or
      repressed in all conditions are listed in Table 6. There were also
      839 genes induced under some but not all conditions, such as
      transport genes encoding glycine betaine/carnitine/choline ABC
      transporters, amino acid transporters, and putative monovalent
      cation/H+ antiporters (gene list not shown). Overall, the
      microarray results suggest that electric current and associated

      [0056] The DNA microarray data suggests that treatment with
      electric currents may lead to generation and accumulation of
      reactive oxygen species (“ROS”) (e.g., induction of oxyS, a global
      regulatory RNA). Thus, the treatment could render the persister
      cells more susceptible to external ROS. To test this hypothesis,
      we treated E. coli HM22 persister cells with 100 μA for 20 min and
      followed by treatment with and without H2O2 (500 μM) for 1 h.
      These cells were then split into two parts: one for microscopic
      analysis and the other for CFU count. For microscopic study, cells
      were treated with 200 μM dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
      (H2DCFDA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 30 min in dark at
      room temperature. After incubation, cells were spin down and
      resuspended in PBS buffer for visualization using a fluorescence
      microscope (Axio Imager M1, ZEISS, Jena, Germany). The dye H2DCFDA
      can penetrate bacterial cells and get cleaved by cellular esterase
      to produce H2DCF. If there is any ROS present, this H2DCF will be
      converted to DCF and give fluorescence (Invitrogen, USA). The
      results showed that treatment with 15 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;direct
      current, similar to treatment with H2O2 (500 μM) caused
      accumulation of ROS in persister cells. For the CFU count, cells
      were plated on LB plates supplemented with DPA and incubated
      overnight at 37° C. The CFU data further confirmed that the
      treatment with electric current rendered the persister cells more
      sensitive to H2O2 since treatment with electric current followed
      by H2O2 killed more persister cells than either the EC or H2O2
      alone (see FIG. 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Construction and use of a flow cell system is possible to
      directly visualize the effects of electric currents on biofilm
      cells. To directly visualize the effect of electric currents on
      biofilm cells and biofilm structure, the FC81 flow cell system
      (BioSurface Technologies Corporation, Bozeman Mont.) was modified
      to deliver electric current. The flow cell contains two slides to
      form a channel with a dimension of 47.5×12.7 mm and 1.6 mm space
      between the two slides. The cover glass was coated with 50 Å Ti
      followed by 70 Å Au. This engineered surface is transparent and
      conductive, allowing the direct visualization of bioelectric
      effect with microscopy. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was also
      inserted at the exit of the flow cell (through a Y-junction)
      without touching the other two electrodes. The bottom surface
      could be made with any material of interest and cut into the
      dimension of regular glass slides (2.54 cm by 7.62 cm). The flow
      cell was assembled with a gold-coated slide as the counter
      electrode and the bottom plate as the working electrode (see FIG.
      6). A Y-junction was attached at the exit of the flow cell, with
      one line for insertion of reference electrode and the other for
      the effluent of biofilm culture. The tubing that holds the
      reference electrode was clamped as a dead-end to prevent any
      leakage.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The electrodes were connected to a model AFCBP1
      potentiostat/galvanostat (PINE Research Instrumentation) by Cu
      wires. This is the first flow cell system containing reference
      electrode to allow precise control of the potential and current.
      The mature one-day biofilm of E. coli RP437/pRSH103 expressing red
      fluorescent protein (RFP) constitutively was treated with 50
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC for 1 h. The flow of LB medium (63) at 10 mL/h
      was stopped before the treatment with current and resumed after
      the treatment. Significant detachment of biofilm cells by electric
      current was observed (see FIG. 7). This flow cell system is an
      ideal tool for studying the effects of electric currents on
      biofilm-associated persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] It is well documented that persister cells are
      metabolically inactive compared to normal cells. Conceivably, an
      approach that can target this difference could have high efficacy.
      As shown in FIG. 3A, some of the conditions are more effective in
      killing persister cells than normal cells. Thus, the treatment
      conditions may be fine tuned to selectively kill this population
      that is highly resistant to antibiotics. All living cells need to
      maintain a membrane potential for metabolism and transfer of
      nutrients. If the membrane potential is disrupted, the cells could
      lose the capability to maintain the ion gradients and cell death
      will occur. Normal cells may have higher membrane potential than
      persister cells due to higher metabolic activities. In this sense,
      the persister cells could be more sensitive to reduction of
      membrane potential. This is evidenced by recent mechanistic
      studies of pyrazinamide for tuberculosis therapy. Unlike
      conventional antibiotics that are more active against growing
      cells, pyrazinamide is more effective in killing non-growing
      bacilli. A recent study has shown that pyrazinamide kills cells by
      disrupting the membrane energetics and transport function at acid
      pH. An applied electric current can either positively or
      negatively influence the membrane potential, which consequently
      affects the viability of persister cells and susceptibility to
      antibiotics (FIG. 8). If the membrane potential is reduced by the
      applied current, direct killing of persister cells can be
      expected. If the membrane potential is positively affected by the
      current, however, it may work as a “wake up” call of the persister
      cells to enter a metabolically more active stage and therefore
      render the cells more susceptible to antibiotics. The membrane
      permeability to antibiotics may also be affected by the applied
      current. The exact impact on persister cells may rely on the
      current level, material of the electrodes and the associated ions
      released, medium composition and the antibiotics applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Membrane potential can be measured using either florescent
      or radioactive methods. The persister cells of E. coli HM22 and P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 cells at different growth phases may be treated
      with electric currents; and the cells before and after treatments
      may be analyzed to evaluate the effects of electric currents on
      membrane potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In light of the above, the membrane potentials of E. coli
      HM 22 normal and persister cells were compared. Briefly,
      approximately 1×10&lt;6 &gt;persister cells per mL were washed
      with PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 145 mM sodium chloride,
      pH 7.4) followed by addition of carbocyanine dye DiOC2
      (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to 30 μM and incubation at room
      temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was determined using a LSR II
      flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.), with
      excitation at 495 nm and emission at 575 nm. The red/green
      ratiometric parameter was set according to the manufacturer's
      instructions for histogram analysis. The ratiometric parameter was
      calculated as [(red value)−(green value)+384]. The overlay
      histogram of membrane potential analysis was obtained using CXP
      software. As shown in FIG. 9A, the membrane potential of persister
      cells is lower than that of normal cells. To our knowledge, this
      is the first direct comparison of membrane potential between
      normal and persister cells of E. coli. In addition, treatment with
      15, 30 and 45 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;direct current significantly reduced
      the membrane potential of persister cells, but not that of normal
      cells (FIGS. 9B and 9C). These data confirm our hypothesis and
      suggest that membrane potential is a potential target of new
      therapies. Further study on this finding could help understand the
      mechanism of persister control by electric current and synergistic
      effects with antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] For the conditions that exhibit synergistic effects with
      antibiotics, the membrane permeability may also be tested using
      radioactively labeled antibiotics. In particular, the
      intracellular concentration of benzyl-14C-penicillin (potassium)
      and &lt;3&gt;H-oxytetracycline (American Radiolabeled Chemicals,
      Inc., St. Louis, Mo.) may be measured after incubation with cells
      for 30 min in the presence or absence of a current using a liquid
      scintillation counter. These data are expected to corroborate the
      results regarding the effects of current on membrane potential and
      permeability. It will be integrated with the results in the
      following study to get insight into the mechanism of persister
      control with electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] As described in the results above, the present invention is
      premised on promising evidence that weak electric currents have
      significant effects on gene expression of both persister cells and
      normal cells of bacteria. As a result, gene expression in response
      to electric currents may be further studied to understand the
      mechanism at the genetic level by identifying the differentially
      expressed genes and pathways.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] First, E. coli HM22 may be used to prepare persister cells
      as described above. The harvested persister cells may be treated
      with different levels of electric currents (75, 150 and 300
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC) using graphite electrodes in 0.85% NaCl buffer
      or M56 buffer. The gene expression of these cells may be compared
      with that of persister cells incubated in the buffer pre-treated
      with the same level and duration of current. In addition, normal
      cells of HM22 may be treated with the same conditions to identify
      the persister-specific genes and pathways affected by electric
      currents. Similar experiments may also be performed to treat P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 cells at exponential and stationary phases. The
      treatment time may be 15 min and extended if more profound changes
      are needed to identify the pathways. Each experiment may be
      conducted in duplicate and the data may be analyzed using cluster
      analysis to identify the gene expression patterns and the pathways
      involved in response to current treatments. The representative
      induced/repressed genes may be confirmed by RNA dot blotting.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Compared to other stimuli, e.g., starvation and temperature
      change, electric currents (especially constant DCs) are not the
      common challenges or evolutionary pressures that bacteria
      experience in nature. Thus, the expression patterns may provide
      unique information for understanding bacterial physiology in
      general, and for developing better control methods. With the gene
      expression patterns identified, one may further study to
      corroborate the results using mutants of the differentially
      expressed genes. For example, the mutants of induced genes could
      be more sensitive to electric currents. Electric currents,
      especially those with higher current levels and longer duration
      than described here, have been found to improve the efficacy of
      antibiotics in treating biofilms. However, the mechanism of such
      effects remains unknown. Since persister cells play an important
      role in biofilm-associated drug tolerance, it is possible that
      antibiotics and electric currents are both capable of killing
      susceptible biofilm cells, while electric currents can also kill
      some persister cells and the efficacy can be enhanced through
      synergy with antibiotics. This is supported by the fact that
      electric current can be more effective in killing persister cells
      than normal cells (FIG. 3A). This may create more friendly
      treatment conditions with lower current level and shorter
      treatment time.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 may be used to
      inoculate biofilm cultures using the flow chamber described in
      results of the present invention (FIG. 6). As discussed above,
      these two are the best-studied strains of persister formation and
      many genetic tools are available.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The preformed biofilms of E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa
      PAO1 can be treated with electric currents and antibiotics under
      the effective conditions identified. The number of viable cells
      can be quantified by counting CFUs after collecting biofilm cells
      from the surface by sonication and spreading cells on LB agar
      plates. Meanwhile, part of the collected cells may be treated with
      100 μg/mL ampicillin (for E. coli HM22) or 200 μg/mL ofloxacin
      (for P. aeruginosa PAO1) for 3 hours and then tested using the
      same CFU method to quantify the viable persister cells. The CFU
      data of biofilms with and without treatment may be compared to
      evaluate the effects of electric currents on the viability of
      persister cells in biofilms. The adhesion and metabolic activity
      of biofilm-associated persister cells may be analyzed in situ
      using the flow cell system described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The effects of electric current on biofilm structure may be
      followed in situ using a fluorescence microscopy to obtain the
      three dimensional information of biofilms. The structural
      parameters of biofilms including surface coverage, thickness,
      roughness, and biomass may be calculated using the computer
      program COMSTAT (31). The dynamic 3-D imaging data may then be
      obtained to help elucidate the effects of electric current on
      biofilm formation and structure. To visualize biofilm-associated
      persister cells three dimensionally, the promoterless gfp(LVA)
      gene may be cloned in pCA24N (for E. coli, available at NIGJ) and
      pME290 (for P. aeruginosa, available from ATCC) under the promoter
      rrnBP1 of E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, respectively, and
      inserted in the corresponding hosts. Thus, the intensity of GFP
      will be proportional to the cell growth rate. In addition, all
      biofilm cells may be strained with the BacLight™ Red fluorescent
      dye (Invitrogen). Thus, all biofilm cells may be strained red and
      the green dye can be used to differentiate persister cells (weak
      or no green signal) from normal cells (stronger green signals).
      Compared to the highly stable native GFP, the unstable GFP(LVA),
      which has a half-life less than 40 min, may be used to allow the
      dynamic monitoring of cell growth. The constructed reporters may
      then be used to study the effects of electric currents on the
      adhesion/detachment and growth of persister cells in three
      dimensions and in real time at different stages of biofilm
      formation (from initial adhesion to maturation).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] To understand the mechanism of persister control using
      electric currents and to develop better biofilm control methods,
      the above studies may systematically investigate the effects of
      electric currents on physiology of persister cells, gene
      expression and pathways, as well as the effects on
      biofilm-associated persister cells. These results may be
      integrated to develop a model to explain the mechanism. The
      results from these studies may also help develop more effective
      control methods, e.g., electrically enhanced antibiotic therapies
      and anti-biofouling approaches.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Conceivably, application of an electric current can cause
      complex changes to the chemical composition of the medium. The
      effects of currents on bacterial physiology may be carefully
      compared with pre-treated medium to eliminate the effects of
      electrochemical reactions products. In addition, the
      electrochemical reactions may be systematically studied to
      identify the roles of each reaction product on persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Continued experiments, for example, have already shown that
      the effects of electric current and synergy with antibiotics is
      not species specific, as similar results were shown using P.
      aeruginosa. The experiments were conducted in the same way as
      described for E. coli HM22. Briefly, an overnight culture of P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 was used to inoculate LB medium to an OD600 of
      ̃0.005 (1:1000 dilution of an overnight culture with LB) and
      incubated till OD600 reached ̃0.7. Then the cells were washed
      twice with 0.85% NaCl buffer and treated in the same way as
      described for planktonic E. coli cells. As shown in FIG. 10,
      treatment with 1.5 μg/mL Tob did not cause any significant
      killing. Treatment with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 60 min reduced the
      number of viable P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells by 3 logs. When the two
      treatments were combined, however, up to 5 logs of killing was
      observed. Thus, synergistic effects clearly also exist between
      electric current and tobramycin on P. aeruginosa PAO1, suggesting
      this effect is not species specific and can potentially be applied
      to treated human bacterial infections.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] To identify the condition for isolating P. aeruginosa PAO1
      persister cells, the overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was
      treated for 3.5 h with various concentrations of ciprofloxacin
      (“Cip”) to determine the appropriate concentration that can kill
      normal cells. As shown in FIG. 11, the killing of P. aeruginosa
      PAO1 increased with Cip concentration up to 50 μg/mL and no
      further killing was observed even when Cip was added as 200 μg/mL.
      Thus, the 1% cells that survived the treatment were persister
      cells and treatment with 200 μg/mL Cip was used in the following
      experiments to harvest persister cells and ensure the complete
      killing of normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Synergistic effects were also observed for treatment with
      electric current and Tob, similar to the data of normal cells
      described above. The results indicate that 1.5 μg/mL Tob was not
      able to kill P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells. However,
      treatment with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(500 μA total) current reduced
      the number of viable persisters by ̃2.5 logs and another 2 logs of
      killing was obtained when treating with Tob together, as shown in
      FIG. 12. It is worthy noticing that the efficiency in killing by
      electric current and synergistic effects with Tob were similar for
      persisters and normal cells. This is a significant advantage
      compared to traditional antibiotics, which commonly fail to kill
      bacterial cells that are in stationary phase or are persisters.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] To understand if the killing by electric currents was due
      to the ions generated by electrochemical reactions, P. aeruginosa
      PAO1 persister cells were also treated with pretreated buffer,
      which was prepared by treating 0.85% NaCl buffer with SS304
      stainless steel electrodes for the same current level and duration
      as used for the above experiments. The pretreated buffers were
      collected after 20, 40 or 60 min of treatment. P. aeruginosa PAO1
      persister cells were collected as described above and resuspended
      in the pretreated buffers in the presence and absence of Tob. The
      cells were then incubated at room temperature without shaking for
      up to 1 h and samples were collected every 20 min to count CFU. As
      shown in FIG. 13, the ions released from the electrode caused less
      than one log of killing of persister cells, significantly less
      than that with current treatment (2-3 logs), suggesting the
      movement of ions or some short-term ions might be essential for
      the effectively killing with electric current. The generation of
      ROS as described in E. coli HM22 data could be partially
      responsible for the killing. In addition, no synergy was observed
      between pretreated buffer and 1.5 μg/mL Tob. This finding suggests
      that electric current may enhance the penetration of Tob and/or
      the susceptibility of persisters.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In addition to stainless steel, carbon electrodes were also
      found to control E. coli persister cells (discussed above). Here
      we also compare the effects of stainless steel and carbon
      electrodes on P. aeruginosa persister cells. As shown in FIG. 14,
      killing by about two logs was achieved using carbon electrodes. It
      is slightly less than the 3 logs of killing by stainless steel
      electrodes; however, it does confirm that the killing effects are
      not limited to stainless steel electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Since the current treatment with 304 stainless steel
      electrodes was more effective than that with carbon electrodes in
      killing persisters, another experiment was conducted to treat P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells using carbon electrodes and 0.85%
      NaCl buffer pretreated with 304 stainless steel electrodes. As
      shown in FIG. 15, additional killing was observed compared to
      treatment with 304 stainless steel electrodes (FIG. 15) or carbon
      electrodes (FIG. 14) alone. These results confirm that ions or
      charge movement induced by electric current treatment may be a key
      factor in killing persister cells. Thus, a pre-prepared solution
      or cream containing such chemical species might be applied for
      disease therapy with electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Embodiments of the electrically-enhanced control of
      bacterial persister cells, both planktonic persisters and those in
      biofilms, are described above. The use of a very small electric
      current to control persister cells, as well as the synergistic
      effects shown when used in conjunction with antimicrobial agents,
      is a new phenomenon. The low level of electric current/voltage
      required to control persister cells are believed to be
      physiologically safe for humans since similar and higher
      current/voltage levels have been used to stimulate tissue and bone
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Further, the effects of electric current and the synergy
      with antimicrobial agents is not species-specific, since similar
      results were shown using both E. coli strains and P. aeruginosa
      strains. Accordingly, the present invention can be used to kill a
      wide variety of microbial species.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The use of low electric current and/or low electric current
      together with an antimicrobial agent is a novel means of
      controlling persister cells and can be incorporated into devices
      or procedures in order to treat chronic infections both inside and
      outside the human body. For example, possible applications include
      the treatment of chronic wounds, chronic sinusitis,
      implanted-device-associated infections, and middle ear infection,
      the decontamination of medical devices, or devices with bare or
      coated electrodes, among many others.<br>

      shaking on an orbital shaker (Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.) at
      200 rpm. Biofilms were developed on stainless steel coupons (5.6
      cm by 1.0 cm) in batch culture at 37° C. in 100 mm petri dishes
      (Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.) for 48 hours. Luria-Bertani
      (LB) medium consisting of 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone, and 5 g/L
      yeast extract (all from Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.) was used
      for both planktonic and biofilm cultures. LB agar plates were
      prepared by adding 15 g/L Bacto agar (Fisher Scientific) to LB
      medium prior to autoclaving and pouring into 100 mm petri dishes
      (Fisher Scientific).<br>

      [0081] Poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA) is a viscous protein produced
      predominantly by members of the taxonomic order Bacillales.
      However, B. subtilis 168 does not produce PGA, due to mutations in
      the degQ promoter region and the gene swrA. This protein is
      required in B. subtilis for biofilm formation, and re-introduction
      of the wild-type genes into B. subtilis 168 allowed biofilm
      growth. B. subtilis BE1500 is a strain which produces PGA and
      therefore form relatively good biofilms, and is therefore suitable
      for the study of B. subtilis biofilms.<br>

      [0082] Electrochemical Cell Construction. Electrodes with a
      dimension of 1 cm×5.6 cm were cut from a 30.5 cm by 30.5 cm flat
      304L stainless steel sheet (&lt;0.08% C, 17.5-20% Cr, 8-11% Ni,
      &lt;2% Mn, &lt;1% Si, &lt;0.045% P, &lt;0.03% S; MSC; Melville,
      N.Y.). Counter electrodes were bent at the end to form a hook
      shape (see FIG. 16). A counter electrode and working electrode
      were placed into a 4.5 mL standard-style polystyrene cuvette
      (Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.). A 0.015″ diameter silver wire
      (A-M Systems; Sequim, Wash.) was placed in bleach for 30 min to
      generate an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The bottom 1″ of a
      borosilicate glass Pasteur pipette (Fisher Scientific) was cut and
      the reference wire was placed inside to prevent accidental contact
      with the working or counter electrode. A potentiostat/galvanostat
      (Model #AFCBP1, Pine Instrument Company, Grove City, Pa.) was
      connected via alligator clamps to the electrodes and used to
      control the voltage and current. The volume of medium in the
      fully-constructed electrochemical cell was 3 mL. A schematic of
      the system is shown in FIG. 16.<br>

      [0083] Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and
      Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations. To determine the minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin on planktonic
      cells, B. subtilis 168 and B. subtilis BE1500 were cultured in LB
      medium overnight as described above. The overnight cultures were
      subcultured by a 1:1000 dilution in LB medium containing various
      concentrations of ampicillin with seven replicates in a 96-well
      plate and allowed to grow at 37° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 24
      hours. The OD600 was measured immediately after inoculations and
      at 24 hours after inoculation with a microplate reader (Model
      EL808, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The MIC was defined as
      the lowest concentration of ampicillin that completely inhibited
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] MIC is not a useful measurement of the response of biofilms
      to antibiotics because antibiotics added in the growth medium
      before inoculation could kill planktonic cells before they can
      form a biofilm. Therefore it is important to characterize the
      minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ampicillin on
      established biofilms. B. subtilis BE1500 was cultured overnight as
      described above. Flat stainless steel electrodes were placed in a
      100 mm petri dish with 20 mL LB medium, which was inoculated with
      20 μL of an overnight culture. Biofilms were allowed to develop
      for 48 hours at 37° C. without shaking. The electrodes with
      biofilms were gently washed three times in 0.85% NaCl buffer and
      immersed in LB medium containing various concentrations of
      ampicillin for 15 min. Immediately after treatment, the electrodes
      with biofilms were placed in a 15 mL polystyrene test tube (Fisher
      Scientific) containing 4 mL 0.85% NaCl buffer and sonicated for 2
      min to remove the biofilm cells from the surface. The stainless
      steel electrode was then removed and the tube was vortexed for 30
      s to break up any remaining cell clusters. CFUs were counted after
      spreading the buffer with cells on LB agar plates and incubated
      overnight at 37° C.<br>

      [0085] Treatment of Planktonic Cells with DCs. B. subtilis 168 was
      cultured overnight as described above, subcultured by a 1:1000
      dilution in LB medium and grown to OD600 of 0.8. Cells from 3 mL
      of sub-culture were pelleted at 16.1 rcf for 2 min in a
      microcentrifuge (Model 5415R Eppendorf, Westbury, N.Y.), and
      resuspended in 0.85% NaCl buffer. This process was repeated three
      times to wash the cells, which were then resuspended in 3 mL LB or
      3 mL pre-treated LB medium (see below). Samples in LB medium were
      treated for 15 min with a total current of 150 μA, 500 μA, or 1500
      μA in the electrochemical cell described above. Pre-treated LB
      medium was prepared by treating LB medium with 150 μA, 500 μA, or
      1500 μA total current (corresponding to 0, 25, 83 and 250
      μA/cm&lt;2&gt;, respectively) for 15 minutes in the
      electrochemical cell described above. Cells were incubated in the
      pre-treated LB medium for 15 min without current to evaluate the
      cellular response to the ions generated by the currents, serving
      as control samples. Immediately after treatment, cells were
      aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted for 1 min at 16.1
      rcf and 4° C., and the supernatant decanted off. Cells used for
      DNA microarray analysis were frozen immediately after decanting in
      a dry ice-ethanol bath and then stored at −80° C.<br>

      [0086] RNA Extraction. RNA extraction was performed using the
      Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) by following the
      manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications. Briefly, the
      homogenization was performed with a model 3110BX mini bead beater
      and 0.1 mm diameter Zirconia/Silica beads (both from Biospec
      Products, Bartlesville, Okla.) for 1 min. On-column DNA digestion
      was performed with 120 μL DNase I; and wash with RPE buffer was
      repeated three times rather than once. The isolated RNA was stored
      at −80° C. until DNA microarray analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] DNA Microarray Analysis. The total RNA samples were sent to
      the DNA Microarray Core Facilities at SUNY Upstate Medical
      University for hybridization to Affymetrix DNA microarrays
      (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, Calif.). The hybridizations was
      performed by following the Prokaryotic Target Preparation protocol
      in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix).
      cDNA was hybridized on GeneChip B. subtilis Genome Arrays
      (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, Calif.) for 16 hours at 45° C. in an
      Model 640 Hybridization Oven (Affymetrix). The arrays were washed
      and stained using the F5450—0004 protocol on an Affymetrix
      Fluidics Station 450, and then scanned with an Model 7G Plus
      GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix). For each data set, genes with a
      p-value between 0.05 and 0.95 were considered as statistically
      insignificant. Cluster analysis was performed with the TIGR
      MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software (J. Craig Venter Institute;
      Rockville, Md.) using a k-means sorting with the default
      parameters. A hierarchical tree was also constructed.<br>

      [0088] Treatment of Biofilm Cultures with Ampicillin and DC. B.
      subtilis BE1500 biofilms were prepared as described for MBC
      experiments. Prior to treatment, biofilms were gently washed three
      times with 0.85% NaCl buffer. Each stainless steel coupon with
      biofilm was placed as the working electrode in the electrochemical
      cell cuvette shown in FIG. 16. Prior to placing the electrode with
      biofilm in the cuvette, 3 mL LB medium was added to the cuvette to
      prevent the biofilm from drying out. Samples were treated for 15
      min with 0, 25, 83 and 250 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;. Immediately after
      treatment, the biofilms were placed in a 15 mL polystyrene test
      tube containing 4 mL 0.85% NaCl buffer and sonicated for 2 min to
      remove the biofilm from electrode. The stainless steel electrode
      was then removed and the tube containing the cells and buffer was
      vortexed for 30 s to break up any remaining cell clusters. Cell
      densities were determined by plating the cultures on LB/agar
      plates and counting CFUs. The effect of current-generated ions was
      tested in the same way except that the cells were incubated in
      pre-treated LB in the absence of a current.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Atomic Force Microscopy. B. subtilis 168 planktonic cells
      were cultured and treated with electric currents as described
      above. Immediately after pelleting, the cells were centrifuged at
      16.1 rcf for 2 min at 4° C. and the supernatant was decanted. Cell
      pellets were re-suspended in de-ionized (DI) water and centrifuged
      at 16.1 rcf for 2 min at 4° C. to wash away ions. The washing was
      repeated twice, and the pellet was resuspended in DI water. To
      prepare the samples for AFM analysis, 2 μL of suspended cells was
      placed on a piece of No. 2 borosilicate cover glass (VWR, West
      Chester, Pa.) and placed in a vacuum dessicator (Fisher
      Scientific) to dry for 15 min. Samples were examined using the
      contact mode of an atomic force microscope (Veeco Instruments;
      Malvern, Pa.). Both height and displacement images were captured
      at field widths of 50, 25, 10 and 5 μm.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Effects of DCs on planktonic cells. To determine the effect
      of electric currents on planktonic cells, B. subtilis 168 cultures
      were grown overnight and treated in the electrochemical cell (FIG.
      16) with total currents of 0, 150, 500 or 1500 μA, corresponding
      to 0, 25, 83 and 250 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;, respectively. To make a
      distinction between the effect of metal cations generated by
      electrochemical reactions and electric current on the planktonic
      cells, cells were also incubated for 15 min in LB medium
      pre-treated with the same current level and duration (pre-treated
      LB medium). The number of viable cells was determined by CFU
      counts as described in the Materials and Methods section.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Planktonic cells exposed to pre-treated medium and applied
      current both showed a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability
      (FIG. 17). At 25 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and 83 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;, both
      pre-treated LB medium and LB medium with applied current resulted
      in similar reduction of cell viability. For example, cell
      viability was reduced approximately 1 log by 25 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;,
      and 2 logs by 83 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;versus the untreated control. At
      250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;level, however, the pre-treated medium appeared
      to kill more cells (4-log reduction) than current treatment (3-log
      reduction).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] AFM analysis. To identify if DC treatments caused any
      physical damage to the cells, AFM analysis was performed to
      determine the effects of electric currents on planktonic cell
      morphology. The images suggest the width of the flagella to be
      less than 100 nm, the length to be at least 10 μm, and the
      wavelength to be approximately 2.5 μm. These numbers are in
      agreement with measurement of flagellar dimensions in the
      literature, suggesting that AFM is suitable for detecting changes
      in cell morphology. AFM images of B. subtilis 168 in FIG. 18
      showed no apparent membrane features, appearing to be relatively
      smooth, consistent with an earlier report of AFM study that the
      membrane surface of B. subtilis W23 was observed to be smooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Treatments with DC did not cause apparent changes in cell
      morphology (FIG. 18). Interestingly, during AFM and light
      microscopy, debris of an unknown type was observed, particularly
      in samples treated with 83 and 250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;currents (FIG.
      18). To determine if this debris originated from the cells or from
      electrochemical reactions, LB medium without cells was treated
      with the same currents, washed, and analyzed in the same
      procedure. AFM images were taken at several resolutions (images
      not shown). There was an apparent increase in debris as applied
      current increased. This debris was similar to the debris observed
      for samples containing cells. The apparent increase in debris with
      current suggests that these precipitates may be electrochemical
      reaction products and the results of their interactions with the
      components of LB medium. This finding suggests that the killing by
      DC is not only through direct physical forces of the currents. The
      effects of such debris on bacterial cells, however, remain to be
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] DNA microarray analysis. To understand the effect of
      electric currents on B. subtilis at the genetic level, RNA from
      planktonic B. subtilis 168 treated with applied currents or
      pre-treated LB media were analyzed using GeneChip B. subtilis
      Genome Arrays (Affymetrix). B. subtilis 168 treated with
      pre-treated LB medium was used as a control so as to minimize the
      influence of electrochemical products on gene expression. Cluster
      analysis was performed to categorize the gene expression patterns.
      Five clusters were found, corresponding to up-regulation at only
      one current level (25, 83 or 250 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;), up-regulation at
      all current levels, and down-regulation at all current levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A selected list of the genes can be seen in Table 7 below,
      where the genes were selected based on operons with multiple genes
      showing altered regulation, as well as those showing high levels
      of regulation. SLR is given as a range for operons that showed
      similar trends. For the genes in Cluster 4 that were up-regulated
      at all tested currents, the SLR range is given for the 1500 μA
      testing condition. For Cluster 5, negative numbers are in
      parenthesis for clarity.<br>

      Representative Genes Showing Altered Regulation in Response to DC
      Currents.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] At all current levels, the genes tuaABCD from the tua
      operon was induced by current treatment. Additionally, at 250
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;two more genes from the same operon, tuaF and tuaG
      also showed increased expression. The tua operon is responsible
      for the synthesis of teichuronic acid, an anionic polymer found in
      the cell membrane only under phosphate-limited conditions. The
      up-regulation of genes related to envelope synthesis suggests that
      the cell membranes may have been damaged or altered in some
      manner, perhaps related to a loss of phosphate. Although AFM
      analysis did not reveal any significant change in cell morphology,
      the cells appeared to be more sensitive to the shear force of the
      AFM tip after treatment with 250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(images not
      shown). Further study at protein level will be helpful for
      understanding the mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The pathway for teichuronic acid synthesis is controlled by
      the Pho regulon, responsible for response to phosphate-limited
      conditions. The gene ydhF, encoding a lipoprotein that showed
      increased expression at all tested currents, is also controlled by
      the PhoPR regulation system. These findings suggest that phosphate
      limitation may have occurred due to current treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Effects of DC treatments on biofilms. To determine the
      effect of electric currents on biofilms, B. subtilis biofilms were
      developed on 304L stainless steel electrodes and treated with the
      same total applied current as described for the planktonic cells
      (0, 25, 83, and 250 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;). To determine the effects of
      electrochemical reactions on biofilms, biofilms were also treated
      with pre-treated LB medium as with the planktonic cells.
      Immediately after treatment the biofilm cells were detached via
      sonication, washed with 0.85% NaCl buffer, and plated on LB-agar
      plates to quantify the viable cells by counting CFUs. A decrease
      in cell viability was seen for biofilm cells treated with current
      as well as those treated with pre-treated LB medium (FIG. 19). At
      each tested current level, treatment with pre-treated LB medium
      reduced cell viability by only 8-10%. Biofilms treated with
      current showed a further reduction in viability compared to those
      exposed to pre-treated LB medium; e.g., treatment with 25, 83 and
      250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;decreased cell viability by 97%, 88% and 98.5%,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Consistent with the general knowledge that biofilms are
      highly resistant to antibiotics, treatment of B. subtilis BE1500
      biofilms with 1000 μg/mL ampicillin for 15 min only killed 59% of
      biofilm cells; while the MIC for planktonic B. subtilis BE1500 was
      found to be ≦2 μg/mL (data not shown), comparable to the MIC for
      B. subtilis 168 of 0.2 μg/mL reported in the literature. To
      determine if electric currents can improve biofilm control with
      antibiotics, biofilms grown on stainless steel electrodes were
      treated simultaneously with 0, 50, 100, and 1000 μg/mL ampicillin
      and 83 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC current for 15 min at 37° C. As discussed
      above, treatment with 83 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC current for 15 min
      alone decreased cell viability by 88%. In comparison, treatment
      with 50, 100 or 1000 μg/mL ampicillin in the presence of 83
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC decreased cell viability by 93%, 79%, and 86%
      versus antibiotic alone, respectively (FIG. 20). Thus, no apparent
      synergy was found when treated with 83 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC and
      ampicillin together.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Complex electrochemical reactions occur at the surface of
      electrodes when an external voltage is applied. Ionic species can
      be generated from the electrode, and these may interact with the
      medium, antibiotics, and bacterial cells. The grade of stainless
      steel used in this study contains &lt;0.08% C, 17.5-20% Cr, 8-11%
      Ni, &lt;2% Mn, &lt;1% Si, &lt;0.045% P, and &lt;0.03% S. Ions and
      compounds of some of these components could be toxic. For example
      Cr(VI), found in chromate and dichromate ions, is highly toxic to
      cells. To determine the effects of metal ions generated during
      treatment, biofilms were also grown on graphite electrodes rather
      than stainless steel (FIG. 21). Treatment with 500 μA DC current
      for 15 min decreased biofilm cell viability by 57% on graphite
      electrodes versus 88% on stainless steel. Treatment with 500 μA DC
      current and 50 μg/mL ampicillin decreased cell viability by 44% on
      graphite electrodes versus 93% on stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The electrochemical generation of chlorine-containing
      species such as hypochlorite (ClO&lt;−&gt;), chlorite
      (ClO2&lt;−&gt;), and chloramines (NH2Cl, NHCl2, NCl3) by DC
      current in the medium has been implicated in the killing of
      biofilm cells. Increases in viability of biofilm cells grown and
      treated on graphite electrodes compared to that on stainless steel
      suggest that metallic ions released from the latter have stronger
      bactericidal effects on B. subtilis biofilms. To understand if
      killing was partially due to hypochlorite generated by DC current,
      biofilms grown on graphite electrodes were also treated with
      chlorine-free M56 buffer. The viability of biofilm cells (with
      untreated control normalized as 100%) in M56 was 50% when treated
      with 500 μA DC current alone, and 74% when treated with 500 μA DC
      current with 50 μg/mL ampicillin. Biofilms grown on stainless
      steel and treated with current with or without ampicillin in
      chlorine-free M56 buffer did not show significant difference in
      cell viability compared to those grown on stainless steel and
      treated in LB medium. This finding implies that the majority of
      killing of biofilm cells on stainless steel surfaces in LB medium
      was through the activity of metal ions, and only minimally through
      chloride ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Treatment with low level DCs can effectively reduce the
      viability of B. subtilis cells. When biofilms were grown on
      graphite electrodes and subjected to current treatment, however,
      only a slight decrease in viability was seen. This finding
      suggests that certain metal cations interacted with biofilm cells
      and caused the decreased viability. Biofilms subjected to the
      metal cations released in pre-treated LB medium showed a slight
      decrease in cell viability versus the control. However, there was
      less killing of biofilm cells by incubating in the pre-treated
      medium than when the current was directly applied, especially for
      biofilms treated with 250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(FIG. 19). Thus, movement
      of ions may be partially responsible for the killing of biofilm
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In contrast to the biofilm samples, planktonic cells were
      much more susceptible to the effects of electric current. However,
      planktonic cells exposed to current and to pre-treated medium
      showed similar reduction in cell viability. It is possible that
      the presence of the biofilm matrix could affect the chemical
      reaction of current-generated ions. The majority of the planktonic
      cells are not likely to be attaching to the electrode surface,
      especially given the vertical positioning of the electrodes (the
      turbidity in the cuvette appeared to be homogeneous). In contrast,
      biofilms are formed on the surface of the electrodes, positioned
      vertically, and held there by EPS. When the current is applied
      directly, biofilm cells are in direct contact with the metal
      cations, possibly for the entire period of treatment as the ions
      were generated from the working electrode and diffused through the
      biofilm matrix. In the pre-treated LB medium, metal cations may
      have been converted to more inert metal compounds relatively
      rapidly through reactions with water, oxygen, and hydroxide. In
      addition, biofilms treated with pre-treated LB medium were not
      exposed to current directly; this may lead to a decreased exposure
      to metal cations, which were released from the anodic electrode.
      This can probably explain why treatments of biofilms with applied
      currents were more effective than using the pre-treated media
      prepared with the same level and duration of DC, especially at 250
      μA/cm&lt;2&gt;. Precipitation of metal complex may also explain
      the additional killing by treating planktonic cells with 25 and 83
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC compared to pre-treated media. At
      μA/cm&lt;2&gt;, however, applied DC was less effective than
      pre-treated media. This is probably due to the changes in
      electrochemistry, which may generate metal complex that are more
      effective than ions moving in an electric field as existed for
      treatments with DC. The exact nature of these reactions, however,
      remain to be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] During electrochemical reactions involving stainless steel
      as the working electrode, a multitude of ions and other chemical
      species can be formed depending on the voltage and current levels
      and composition of the medium. In particular, the chemical species
      formed of four key elements are of particular interest with
      regards to cell viability include iron, chromium, chlorine, oxygen
      and hydrogen (pH). Fe&lt;2+&gt; ions can be generated during
      electrochemical reactions with stainless steel or graphite as an
      electrode. This effect may be intensified by the presence of
      biofilms on the stainless steel due to an increase in the
      resistance of the system, leading to an increased voltage when
      current is held constant. Ferrous ion can react with hydrogen
      peroxide via the Fenton reaction, resulting in the production
      ferric ion, hydroxide ion, and the hydroxyl radical. This reaction
      has been reported to kill bacteria through further formation of
      the superoxide radicals. In B. subtilis, oxidative stress due to
      H2O2 causes several genes to be up-regulated based on the response
      by the per regulon. The up-regulation of katA by 25 μA/cm&lt;2
      &gt;and 83 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;and of the hemAXCDBL operon by 83
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;suggests oxidative stress due to hydrogen peroxide
      may have been present. The decreased cell viability in biofilms
      treated with current may be in part due to oxidative stress as a
      result of the products of the Fenton reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The second-most abundant metal in stainless steel is
      chromium, at amounts of up to 20% in 304L. Chromium ions,
      specifically Cr(VI) in chromate and dichromate, are highly toxic
      to bacterial cells. The presence and concentration of Cr(VI) in
      our system during treatment is unknown. B. subtilis 168 has a
      metabolic pathway by which it can reduce Cr(VI) to the much less
      toxic Cr(III) that functions when chromate ions are present in
      concentrations of up to 0.5 mM. However, genes for chromate
      reduction (ywrAB, ycnD) did not show significant changes in
      expression under our experimental conditions. Genes related to
      oxidative stress, such as the hemX operon, however, were
      up-regulated, providing a possible alternative mechanism for
      protection against chromium. It has also been reported that the
      presence of heavy metals, such as zinc, cadmium, and copper, can
      inhibit chromate reduction by B. subtilis. Genes related to zinc,
      cadmium, and copper toxicity (cadA, copA) were up-regulated in the
      presence of 250 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;current in our study. This suggests
      that ions of some heavy metals may be present in our system when
      using stainless steel as electrodes. Chromium reduction can also
      occur by chemical processes in solution, and can be enhanced or
      inhibited by other chemical species in the medium. Most
      significantly, the presence of Fe&lt;2+&gt; enables the reduction
      of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), at a ratio of 3 Fe&lt;2+&gt; to 1
      Cr&lt;6+&gt;, possibly forming Fe/Cr complexes. However, the
      presence of organic ligands can modify this reaction; ligands
      specific for Fe&lt;2+&gt; inhibit the reaction, while those for
      Fe&lt;3+&gt; enhance it. In summary, the interactions of chromium
      within the system are complex, and killing via hexavalent chromium
      can not be ruled out. However, the significant killing of B.
      subtilis using graphite electrodes suggests that the Cr(VI) ions
      are not indispensable for the cidal effects of electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] If metal cations are responsible for a loss of cell
      viability, one would expect to see genes up-regulated that are
      related to metal tolerance. Indeed, six metal resistance genes
      were up-regulated—arsBCR at 83 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;, and cadA and copA
      at 250 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;. The arsBCR operon is responsible for the
      transport of arsenate, arsenite, and antimonite. These molecules
      bear little resemblance to divalent iron or hexavalent chromium
      compounds. It is interesting to note that arsenic is in the same
      group as phosphorous. It is possible that up-regulation of this
      operon may be related to the phosphate starvation. Notably absent
      were putative genes responsible for chromium reduction—ywrAB. It
      is possible that chromate and dichromate are not being produced in
      quantities that would result in a cellular response, or that they
      are neutralized by other ions in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In the absence of metal ions in solution as charge
      carriers, chloride ions in solution can react with hydroxyl ions
      to form hypochlorite, which is well known to be toxic to cells.
      Experiments with graphite electrodes in M56 medium that did not
      contain chlorine showed that there was no significant decrease in
      the viability of the cells after treatment with 83 μA/cm&lt;2
      &gt;current compared to the untreated sample. This finding
      suggests that chlorine containing compounds, most notably
      hypochlorite, are partially responsible for significant decreases
      in cell viability in our electrochemical system.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The bioelectric effect suggests that electric currents will
      have a synergistic effect with antibiotics to improve the overall
      efficacy of bacterial killing. Surprisingly, when ampicillin was
      added to the solution with current, the amount of killing was not
      significantly altered versus current alone. In the case of
      biofilms grown on graphite electrodes and treated in chlorine-free
      M56 buffer with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and 500 μA current there was
      even a slight decrease in killing. It is well documented that iron
      can interfere with the action of antibiotics, including
      ampicillin, through a variety of mechanisms including chelation of
      ferric cations by antibiotics. It is possible that the presence of
      iron and other metal cations is inhibiting ampicillin activity
      through chelation mechanisms. Such interaction may be dependent on
      the nature of antibiotics since some other antibiotics do show
      synergy with electric currents in killing biofilm cells. It is
      also important to note that in the present invention employed a
      shorter treatment time (15 min) than Costerton and others (24 h).<br>
      <br>
      [0109] In summary, the present invention involved a detailed study
      of the effects of weak EC on viability, gene expression and
      morphology of B. subtilis and revealed that the ions and oxidative
      species generated by electrochemical reactions have significant
      influence on bacterial gene expression and viability. Further
      testing with additional conditions and different antibiotics will
      help unveil the mechanism of bioelectric effects<br>
      <br>

      that modifications, alterations, and additions can be made to the
      invention without departing from the scope of the invention as

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention relates to electrochemical control of
      bacterial persister cells and, more particularly, the synergistic
      effect between weak electric currents and antibiotics on persister
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Previous studies of persister cells have led to important
      discoveries that are shifting the paradigm of research in
      microbiology and antimicrobial therapy. It is now well recognized
      that subpopulations of bacterial cells in a culture can enter a
      dormant (non-growing) state that are extremely tolerant to a
      variety of unrelated stresses such as antibiotics and heat. Such
      heterogeneity has been reported to exist in even well mixed shake
      flask cultures at exponential phase. This phenotypic variation can
      lead to three subpopulations in a given culture including the
      normal cells, type I persister cells from the stationary inoculums
      and type II persister cells that are generated during growth.
      Persister cells are not mutants with drug resistant genes, but
      rather phenotypic variants of the wild-type strain. Persister
      cells neither die nor grow in the presence of an antibiotic, and
      when reinoculated, they grow into a normal culture with a similar
      percentage of cells as persisters, leading to high antibiotic
      tolerance.<br>
      <br>
      Although persister cells normally only make up a small portion of
      the population, they play a critical role in antibiotic tolerance.
      Most antibiotics inhibit bacteria by targeting growth related
      cellular activities, e.g., protein, DNA, and cell wall syntheses.
      They can eliminate the majority of bacterial population by killing
      the normal cells. For persister cells, however, antibiotics can
      only repress but not eliminate this subpopulation because
      persister cells are non-growing dormant cells. Thus, the seeming
      disadvantage of being dormant in normal environment becomes an
      advantage for persister cells when being challenged by
      antibiotics. When the treatment is stopped, some persister cells
      revert back to normal cells and reestablish the population. Such
      tolerance leads to reoccurrence of infections and facilitate the
      development and spread of multidrug resistance through true
      mutations.<br>
      <br>
      Recent research has demonstrated that persister cell formation
      increases significantly in stationary-phase cultures and the
      surface-attached highly hydrated structures known as biofilms.
      Formed in a dynamic process, mature biofilms typically have
      mushroom-like structures with cells embedded in a polysaccharide
      matrix secreted by the bound bacterial cells. Biofilm cells are up
      to 1000 times more tolerant to antibiotics and disinfectants
      compared to their planktonic counterparts. Thus, deleterious
      biofilms cause serious problems such as chronic infections in
      humans as well as persistent corrosion and equipment failure in
      industry. Although not completely understood at the molecular
      level, the biofilm-associated tolerance is due to several factors
      acting in concert. Bacterial cells in biofilm produce a
      polysaccharide matrix, which creates a physical barrier that
      retards or blocks the toxic compounds from reaching the cells.
      However, protection by the polysaccharide matrix can only
      partially explain the tolerance because at least some antibiotics
      can readily penetrate the matrix yet still can not eliminate
      biofilm cells. Biofilm mode of growth is also associated with
      changes in bacterial membrane structure and reduction in cell
      growth rate. The changes in membrane structure could reduce the
      permeability to toxic compounds, while the reduction in growth
      rate can lead to higher tolerance to growth-dependent killing by
      antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that the slow growth,
      especially that associated with persister cells, is the most
      challenging mechanism for treating chronic infections.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals
      refer to like parts throughout, the present invention provide a
      system and method for the elimination of persister cells by
      electric currents and synergy with antibiotics. The present
      invention was tested using an electrochemical cell seen in FIG. 2
      and with the use of E. coli HM22 constructed by the pioneer work
      of Moyed and Bertrand because it produces 1000 times more
      persister cells in exponential-phase cultures than the wild-type
      E. coli strains and has been used in most studies of persister
      cells. To evaluate the effects of electric currents, the persister
      cells were first isolated as described previously. Briefly, the
      exponential culture of HM22 at optical density at 600 nm (OD600)
      of 0.3 in LB medium was treated with 100 μg/mL ampicillin for 3 h
      to kill and lyse the normal cells. The persister cells were then
      collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm at 4° C. for 10 min and
      resuspended in 0.85% NaCl buffer. The persister cells were then
      treated in a customized electrochemical cell, shown in FIG. 2.
      Electrodes with a dimension of 1 cm×5.6 cm were cut from a flat
      304L stainless steel sheet (MSC; Melville, N.Y.) or graphite sheet
      (McMaster—CARR, Santa Fe Springs, Calif.). The same material was
      used for both the counter electrode and working electrode, which
      were placed into a 4.5 mL standard-style polystyrene cuvette
      (Fisher Scientific; Hampton, N.H.). A 0.48 mm diameter silver wire
      (A-M Systems; Sequim, Wash.) was placed in bleach for 30 min to
      produce an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The bottom 1″ of a
      borosilicate glass Pasteur pipette (Fisher) was cut and the
      reference wire was placed inside to prevent contact with the
      working or counter electrode. An AFCBP1 potentiostat/galvanostat
      (Pine Instrument Company, Grove City, Pa.) was connected via
      alligator clamps to the electrodes and used to control the
      current. The volume of medium in the fully-constructed
      electrochemical cell was 3 mL (see FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      Significant killing of persister cells was observed both with
      stainless steel and graphite electrodes. For example, treatment
      with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(voltage around 1V) for 50 min in 0.85%
      NaCl buffer caused complete killing of persister cells (a 6 log
      reduction in viability, FIG. 3A) by counting colony forming units
      (CFUs) before and after treatment. The killing was not simply
      caused by the products of electrochemical reactions since
      incubation with the pre-treatment buffer (0.85% NaCl buffer
      treated with the same level and duration of current) did not cause
      any apparent killing (data not shown). Interestingly, the electric
      current was more effective in killing persister cells than normal
      cells. As shown in FIG. 3A, the same treatment of normal cells
      only caused a 3 log reduction in the number of viable cells.
      Effective killing of persister cells was also observed using
      graphite electrodes. As shown in FIG. 3B, treatment with the same
      current level (75 μA/cm&lt;2&gt;) for 60 min caused a 3 log
      reduction of viable persister cells, whereas pre-treated medium
      only reduced the viable cells by less than 1 log. Furthermore, the
      efficacy of persister control can be improved through synergistic
      effects with antibiotics. The graphite electrode was used for this
      experiment since it does not cause complete killing, allowing the
      synergistic effects to be observed. As shown in FIG. 3B,
      application of 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;current or 20 μg/mL cinoxacin
      (Cin) alone caused a 3 log or no apparent reduction in the number
      of viable persister cells, respectively. When these two treatments
      were applied together, however, nearly complete killing (more than
      5 log reduction) was observed. Such synergistic effects have not
      been reported for persister cells. It is also worth noticing that
      the synergy is not only limited to Cin since tobramycin (Tob) also
      exhibited synergistic effect with electric current (see FIG. 3B).<br>
      <br>
      To determine if electric currents are also effective in killing
      persister cells in biofilms, E. coli HM22 biofilms were cultured
      on 304L stainless steel coupons. The biofilm-coated coupons were
      then used as anodic or cathodic electrode, and treated with direct
      current alone or with tobramycin together. Immediately after
      treatment, the cells were removed from the biofilm-coated coupons
      by sonication and vertexing. A portion of the cells was directly
      plated on LB+DPA plates to quantify the total number of viable
      cells by counting CFU, the other part of the sample was treated
      with 100 μg/mL ampicillin for another 3 h and plated on LB+DPA
      plates to quantify the number of the viable persister cells. This
      approach allowed us to study the killing effects on normal and
      persister cells separately.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in these FIG. 4, when treating biofilm persisters with
      tobramycin alone (20 μg/mL or 150 μg/mL), there was no significant
      reduction in total number of viable cells and number of viable
      persister cells compared to the untreated control sample. These
      results are consistent with the knowledge that biofilms have
      significantly enhanced tolerance to antibiotics compared to
      planktonic cells. However, treatments with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;alone
      for 60 min reduced the number of viable persister cells by 3.5
      logs. After treating biofilms with currents and tobramycin
      together for 60 min, the number of viable persister cells was
      reduced by 5.4 log (nearly complete killing, FIG. 4). Thus,
      synergy between electric currents and antibiotics also exist for
      killing persister cells in biofilms.<br>
      <br>
      With the capability to quantify the expression level of each gene
      at the genome-wide scale, DNA microarrays have been extensively
      used to monitor global gene expression profiles in response to
      different stimuli including persister formation and biofilm
      formation. However, currently there are no reported data about the
      effects of weak electric currents on bacterial gene expression at
      the genome-wide scale. To identify the effects of electric
      currents on cell physiology of persister cells and normal cells at
      the genetic level, the present invention utilized two experiments
      that revealed clues about the effects of weak electric currents on
      bacterial cells.<br>
      <br>
      In the first experiment, persister cells and normal cells of E.
      coli HM22 harvested using the same method as describe above were
      treated with and without 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC for 15 min in 0.85%
      NaCl buffer. In a parallel experiment, the persister cells were
      also treated with M56 buffer with the same level and duration of
      the current. After harvesting HM22 normal and persister cells,
      they were concentrated 40 times and resuspended in 6 mL 0.85% NaCl
      buffer and 6 mL M56 buffer respectively. Both samples were
      separated into two equal aliquots: one was left untreated,
      meanwhile the other one was treated with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC.
      After 15 min incubation with and without current, all of the cells
      were centrifuged immediately for 30 s at 13,200 rpm and 4° C. to
      harvest the cells. For RNA isolation, each cell pellet was
      resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent buffer (Invitrogen Co.,
      Carlsbad, Calif.) and beaten rigorously at 4,800 beats per min for
      30 s in a closed bead beater tube with 200 μl of silicon beads
      using a mini bead beater (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville,
      Okla.). The following isolation steps were conducted by following
      Trizol reagent protocol and the total extracted RNA was
      subsequently purified using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN Inc.,
      Valencia, Calif.). The quality and quantity of the total RNA
      samples were evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
      Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) and the microarray
      hybridizations were performed using E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays
      (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Both were performed using
      the DNA microarray core facilities at the SUNY Upstate Medical
      University (Syracuse, N.Y.).<br>
      <br>
      Stringent criteria were applied to select the induced/repressed
      genes based on p-values (&lt;0.0025 or &gt;0.9975) calculated
      using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Tukey By weight. The
      applied current in 085% NaCl buffer was found to induce 9 genes
      and repressed 36 genes in E. coli HM22 persister cells (see Table
      1). While 27 of these genes have unknown functions, the treatment
      did induce the genes of the trp operon (trpEL), acyl carrier
      protein phosphodiesterase (acpD), L-serine dehydratase (sdaB),
      oxidative stress response (oxyS), and repressed the cys operon
      (cysCDJKNP), production of tryptophanase (tnaL) and nitrite
      extrusion (narU) (see Tables 1-5). In comparison, treatment with
      the same current level in M56 buffer induced 15 genes (yibP, cysU,
      csgD, nrdE, narW, hisL, oxyS, etc) and repressed only 4 genes of
      persister cells (see Tables 1-5). Interestingly, the induced genes
      have functions of central intermediary metabolism, protease for
      cell division, PTS system, sulfate transport, surface structure,
      DNA synthesis, his operon, oxidative stress response and unknown
      functions. Three of the four repressed genes have unknown
      functions, while the forth gene uvrB has functions of DNA damage
      recognition and repair. These data suggest that weak electric
      currents are able to activate certain cellular activities
      including those related to oxidative response, membrane structures
      and functions.<br>

      The effects on cell membrane functions are corroborated by a
      parallel but more complete study regarding the effects of electric
      currents on the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis 168. In
      this experiment, the cells of B. subtilis 168 in late exponential
      phase was treated for 15 min in LB medium with 42, 139 or 417
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC using 304L stainless steel as electrodes in the
      electrochemical cell shown FIG. 2. Each condition was tested in
      duplicate and the data was analyzed using cluster analysis. To
      differentiate the effects of currents from those of the
      electrochemical reaction products, the control samples were
      incubated for 15 min in the LB medium that was pre-treated with
      the same level and duration of the current. Since the control
      samples were prepared in pre-treated LB medium containing all the
      electrochemical reaction products, the gene expression changes are
      mainly caused by the currents as well as the movement and gradient
      of chemical species, e.g. ions. The genes that were induced or
      repressed in all conditions are listed in Table 6. There were also
      839 genes induced under some but not all conditions, such as
      transport genes encoding glycine betaine/carnitine/choline ABC
      transporters, amino acid transporters, and putative monovalent
      cation/H+ antiporters (gene list not shown). Overall, the
      microarray results suggest that electric current and associated
      ion movement/gradient have significant influence on cellular
      activities of bacteria especially metabolism and membrane
      functions.<br>
      <br>

      The DNA microarray data suggests that treatment with electric
      currents may lead to generation and accumulation of reactive
      oxygen species (“ROS”) (e.g., induction of oxyS, a global
      regulatory RNA). Thus, the treatment could render the persister
      cells more susceptible to external ROS. To test this hypothesis,
      we treated E. coli HM22 persister cells with 100 μA for 20 min and
      followed by treatment with and without H2O2 (500 μM) for 1 h.
      These cells were then split into two parts: one for microscopic
      analysis and the other for CFU count. For microscopic study, cells
      were treated with 200 μM dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
      (H2DCFDA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 30 min in dark at
      room temperature. After incubation, cells were spin down and
      resuspended in PBS buffer for visualization using a fluorescence
      microscope (Axio Imager M1, ZEISS, Jena, Germany). The dye H2DCFDA
      can penetrate bacterial cells and get cleaved by cellular esterase
      to produce H2DCF. If there is any ROS present, this H2DCF will be
      converted to DCF and give fluorescence (Invitrogen, USA). The
      results showed that treatment with 15 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;direct
      current, similar to treatment with H2O2 (500 μM) caused
      accumulation of ROS in persister cells. For the CFU count, cells
      were plated on LB plates supplemented with DPA and incubated
      overnight at 37° C. The CFU data further confirmed that the
      treatment with electric current rendered the persister cells more
      sensitive to H2O2 since treatment with electric current followed
      by H2O2 killed more persister cells than either the EC or H2O2
      alone (see FIG. 5).<br>
      <br>
      Construction and use of a flow cell system is possible to directly
      visualize the effects of electric currents on biofilm cells. To
      directly visualize the effect of electric currents on biofilm
      cells and biofilm structure, the FC81 flow cell system (BioSurface
      Technologies Corporation, Bozeman Mont.) was modified to deliver
      electric current. The flow cell contains two slides to form a
      channel with a dimension of 47.5×12.7 mm and 1.6 mm space between
      the two slides. The cover glass was coated with 50 Å Ti followed
      by 70 Å Au. This engineered surface is transparent and conductive,
      allowing the direct visualization of bioelectric effect with
      microscopy. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was also inserted at
      the exit of the flow cell (through a Y-junction) without touching
      the other two electrodes. The bottom surface could be made with
      any material of interest and cut into the dimension of regular
      glass slides (2.54 cm by 7.62 cm). The flow cell was assembled
      with a gold-coated slide as the counter electrode and the bottom
      plate as the working electrode (see FIG. 6). A Y-junction was
      attached at the exit of the flow cell, with one line for insertion
      of reference electrode and the other for the effluent of biofilm
      culture. The tubing that holds the reference electrode was clamped
      as a dead-end to prevent any leakage.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes were connected to a model AFCBP1
      potentiostat/galvanostat (PINE Research Instrumentation) by Cu
      wires. This is the first flow cell system containing reference
      electrode to allow precise control of the potential and current.
      The mature one-day biofilm of E. coli RP437/pRSH103 expressing red
      fluorescent protein (RFP) constitutively was treated with 50
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;DC for 1 h. The flow of LB medium (63) at 10 mL/h
      was stopped before the treatment with current and resumed after
      the treatment. Significant detachment of biofilm cells by electric
      current was observed (see FIG. 7). This flow cell system is an
      ideal tool for studying the effects of electric currents on
      biofilm-associated persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      It is well documented that persister cells are metabolically
      inactive compared to normal cells. Conceivably, an approach that
      can target this difference could have high efficacy. As shown in
      FIG. 3A, some of the conditions are more effective in killing
      persister cells than normal cells. Thus, the treatment conditions
      may be fine tuned to selectively kill this population that is
      highly resistant to antibiotics. All living cells need to maintain
      a membrane potential for metabolism and transfer of nutrients. If
      the membrane potential is disrupted, the cells could lose the
      capability to maintain the ion gradients and cell death will
      occur. Normal cells may have higher membrane potential than
      persister cells due to higher metabolic activities. In this sense,
      the persister cells could be more sensitive to reduction of
      membrane potential. This is evidenced by recent mechanistic
      studies of pyrazinamide for tuberculosis therapy. Unlike
      conventional antibiotics that are more active against growing
      cells, pyrazinamide is more effective in killing non-growing
      bacilli. A recent study has shown that pyrazinamide kills cells by
      disrupting the membrane energetics and transport function at acid
      pH. An applied electric current can either positively or
      negatively influence the membrane potential, which consequently
      affects the viability of persister cells and susceptibility to
      antibiotics (FIG. 8). If the membrane potential is reduced by the
      applied current, direct killing of persister cells can be
      expected. If the membrane potential is positively affected by the
      current, however, it may work as a “wake up” call of the persister
      cells to enter a metabolically more active stage and therefore
      render the cells more susceptible to antibiotics. The membrane
      permeability to antibiotics may also be affected by the applied
      current. The exact impact on persister cells may rely on the
      current level, material of the electrodes and the associated ions
      released, medium composition and the antibiotics applied.<br>
      <br>
      Membrane potential can be measured using either florescent or
      radioactive methods. The persister cells of E. coli HM22 and P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 cells at different growth phases may be treated
      with electric currents; and the cells before and after treatments
      may be analyzed to evaluate the effects of electric currents on
      membrane potential.<br>
      <br>
      In light of the above, the membrane potentials of E. coli HM 22
      normal and persister cells were compared. Briefly, approximately
      1×10&lt;6 &gt;persister cells per mL were washed with PBS buffer
      (10 mM sodium phosphate, 145 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) followed
      by addition of carbocyanine dye DiOC2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
      Calif.) to 30 μM and incubation at room temperature for 30 min.
      Fluorescence was determined using a LSR II flow cytometer (Becton
      Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.), with excitation at 495 nm and
      emission at 575 nm. The red/green ratiometric parameter was set
      according to the manufacturer's instructions for histogram
      analysis. The ratiometric parameter was calculated as [(red
      value)−(green value)+384]. The overlay histogram of membrane
      potential analysis was obtained using CXP software. As shown in
      FIG. 9A, the membrane potential of persister cells is lower than
      that of normal cells. To our knowledge, this is the first direct
      comparison of membrane potential between normal and persister
      cells of E. coli. In addition, treatment with 15, 30 and 45
      μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;direct current significantly reduced the membrane
      potential of persister cells, but not that of normal cells (FIGS.
      9B and 9C). These data confirm our hypothesis and suggest that
      membrane potential is a potential target of new therapies. Further
      study on this finding could help understand the mechanism of
      persister control by electric current and synergistic effects with
      antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      For the conditions that exhibit synergistic effects with
      antibiotics, the membrane permeability may also be tested using
      radioactively labeled antibiotics. In particular, the
      intracellular concentration of benzyl-14C-penicillin (potassium)
      and &lt;3&gt;H-oxytetracycline (American Radiolabeled Chemicals,
      Inc., St. Louis, Mo.) may be measured after incubation with cells
      for 30 min in the presence or absence of a current using a liquid
      scintillation counter. These data are expected to corroborate the
      results regarding the effects of current on membrane potential and
      permeability. It will be integrated with the results in the
      following study to get insight into the mechanism of persister
      control with electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      As described in the results above, the present invention is
      premised on promising evidence that weak electric currents have
      significant effects on gene expression of both persister cells and
      normal cells of bacteria. As a result, gene expression in response
      to electric currents may be further studied to understand the
      mechanism at the genetic level by identifying the differentially
      expressed genes and pathways.<br>
      <br>
      First, E. coli HM22 may be used to prepare persister cells as
      described above. The harvested persister cells may be treated with
      different levels of electric currents (75, 150 and 300 μA/cm&lt;2
      &gt;DC) using graphite electrodes in 0.85% NaCl buffer or M56
      buffer. The gene expression of these cells may be compared with
      that of persister cells incubated in the buffer pre-treated with
      the same level and duration of current. In addition, normal cells
      of HM22 may be treated with the same conditions to identify the
      persister-specific genes and pathways affected by electric
      currents. Similar experiments may also be performed to treat P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 cells at exponential and stationary phases. The
      treatment time may be 15 min and extended if more profound changes
      are needed to identify the pathways. Each experiment may be
      conducted in duplicate and the data may be analyzed using cluster
      analysis to identify the gene expression patterns and the pathways
      involved in response to current treatments. The representative
      induced/repressed genes may be confirmed by RNA dot blotting.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to other stimuli, e.g., starvation and temperature
      change, electric currents (especially constant DCs) are not the
      common challenges or evolutionary pressures that bacteria
      experience in nature. Thus, the expression patterns may provide
      unique information for understanding bacterial physiology in
      general, and for developing better control methods. With the gene
      expression patterns identified, one may further study to
      corroborate the results using mutants of the differentially
      expressed genes. For example, the mutants of induced genes could
      be more sensitive to electric currents. Electric currents,
      especially those with higher current levels and longer duration
      than described here, have been found to improve the efficacy of
      antibiotics in treating biofilms. However, the mechanism of such
      effects remains unknown. Since persister cells play an important
      role in biofilm-associated drug tolerance, it is possible that
      antibiotics and electric currents are both capable of killing
      susceptible biofilm cells, while electric currents can also kill
      some persister cells and the efficacy can be enhanced through
      synergy with antibiotics. This is supported by the fact that
      electric current can be more effective in killing persister cells
      than normal cells (FIG. 3A). This may create more friendly
      treatment conditions with lower current level and shorter
      treatment time.<br>
      <br>
      E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 may be used to inoculate
      biofilm cultures using the flow chamber described in results of
      the present invention (FIG. 6). As discussed above, these two are
      the best-studied strains of persister formation and many genetic
      tools are available.<br>
      <br>
      The preformed biofilms of E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 can
      be treated with electric currents and antibiotics under the
      effective conditions identified. The number of viable cells can be
      quantified by counting CFUs after collecting biofilm cells from
      the surface by sonication and spreading cells on LB agar plates.
      Meanwhile, part of the collected cells may be treated with 100
      μg/mL ampicillin (for E. coli HM22) or 200 μg/mL ofloxacin (for P.
      aeruginosa PAO1) for 3 hours and then tested using the same CFU
      method to quantify the viable persister cells. The CFU data of
      biofilms with and without treatment may be compared to evaluate
      the effects of electric currents on the viability of persister
      cells in biofilms. The adhesion and metabolic activity of
      biofilm-associated persister cells may be analyzed in situ using
      the flow cell system described above.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of electric current on biofilm structure may be
      followed in situ using a fluorescence microscopy to obtain the
      three dimensional information of biofilms. The structural
      parameters of biofilms including surface coverage, thickness,
      roughness, and biomass may be calculated using the computer
      program COMSTAT (31). The dynamic 3-D imaging data may then be
      obtained to help elucidate the effects of electric current on
      biofilm formation and structure. To visualize biofilm-associated
      persister cells three dimensionally, the promoterless gfp(LVA)
      gene may be cloned in pCA24N (for E. coli, available at NIGJ) and
      pME290 (for P. aeruginosa, available from ATCC) under the promoter
      rrnBP1 of E. coli HM22 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, respectively, and
      inserted in the corresponding hosts. Thus, the intensity of GFP
      will be proportional to the cell growth rate. In addition, all
      biofilm cells may be strained with the BacLight™ Red fluorescent
      dye (Invitrogen). Thus, all biofilm cells may be strained red and
      the green dye can be used to differentiate persister cells (weak
      or no green signal) from normal cells (stronger green signals).
      Compared to the highly stable native GFP, the unstable GFP(LVA),
      which has a half-life less than 40 min, may be used to allow the
      dynamic monitoring of cell growth. The constructed reporters may
      then be used to study the effects of electric currents on the
      adhesion/detachment and growth of persister cells in three
      dimensions and in real time at different stages of biofilm
      formation (from initial adhesion to maturation).<br>
      <br>
      To understand the mechanism of persister control using electric
      currents and to develop better biofilm control methods, the above
      studies may systematically investigate the effects of electric
      currents on physiology of persister cells, gene expression and
      pathways, as well as the effects on biofilm-associated persister
      cells. These results may be integrated to develop a model to
      explain the mechanism. The results from these studies may also
      help develop more effective control methods, e.g., electrically
      enhanced antibiotic therapies and anti-biofouling approaches.<br>
      <br>
      Conceivably, application of an electric current can cause complex
      changes to the chemical composition of the medium. The effects of
      currents on bacterial physiology may be carefully compared with
      pre-treated medium to eliminate the effects of electrochemical
      reactions products. In addition, the electrochemical reactions may
      be systematically studied to identify the roles of each reaction
      product on persister cells.<br>
      <br>
      Continued experiments, for example, have already shown that the
      effects of electric current and synergy with antibiotics is not
      species specific, as similar results were shown using P.
      aeruginosa. The experiments were conducted in the same way as
      described for E. coli HM22. Briefly, an overnight culture of P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 was used to inoculate LB medium to an OD600 of
      ̃0.005 (1:1000 dilution of an overnight culture with LB) and
      incubated till OD600 reached ̃0.7. Then the cells were washed
      twice with 0.85% NaCl buffer and treated in the same way as
      described for planktonic E. coli cells. As shown in FIG. 10,
      treatment with 1.5 μg/mL Tob did not cause any significant
      killing. Treatment with 75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 60 min reduced the
      number of viable P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells by 3 logs. When the two
      treatments were combined, however, up to 5 logs of killing was
      observed. Thus, synergistic effects clearly also exist between
      electric current and tobramycin on P. aeruginosa PAO1, suggesting
      this effect is not species specific and can potentially be applied
      to treated human bacterial infections.<br>
      <br>
      To identify the condition for isolating P. aeruginosa PAO1
      persister cells, the overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was
      treated for 3.5 h with various concentrations of ciprofloxacin
      (“Cip”) to determine the appropriate concentration that can kill
      normal cells. As shown in FIG. 11, the killing of P. aeruginosa
      PAO1 increased with Cip concentration up to 50 μg/mL and no
      further killing was observed even when Cip was added as 200 μg/mL.
      Thus, the 1% cells that survived the treatment were persister
      cells and treatment with 200 μg/mL Cip was used in the following
      experiments to harvest persister cells and ensure the complete
      killing of normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Synergistic effects were also observed for treatment with electric
      current and Tob, similar to the data of normal cells described
      above. The results indicate that 1.5 μg/mL Tob was not able to
      kill P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells. However, treatment with
      75 μA/cm&lt;2 &gt;(500 μA total) current reduced the number of
      viable persisters by ̃2.5 logs and another 2 logs of killing was
      obtained when treating with Tob together, as shown in FIG. 12. It
      is worthy noticing that the efficiency in killing by electric
      current and synergistic effects with Tob were similar for
      persisters and normal cells. This is a significant advantage
      compared to traditional antibiotics, which commonly fail to kill
      bacterial cells that are in stationary phase or are persisters.<br>
      <br>
      To understand if the killing by electric currents was due to the
      ions generated by electrochemical reactions, P. aeruginosa PAO1
      persister cells were also treated with pretreated buffer, which
      was prepared by treating 0.85% NaCl buffer with SS304 stainless
      steel electrodes for the same current level and duration as used
      for the above experiments. The pretreated buffers were collected
      after 20, 40 or 60 min of treatment. P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister
      cells were collected as described above and resuspended in the
      pretreated buffers in the presence and absence of Tob. The cells
      were then incubated at room temperature without shaking for up to
      1 h and samples were collected every 20 min to count CFU. As shown
      in FIG. 13, the ions released from the electrode caused less than
      one log of killing of persister cells, significantly less than
      that with current treatment (2-3 logs), suggesting the movement of
      ions or some short-term ions might be essential for the
      effectively killing with electric current. The generation of ROS
      as described in E. coli HM22 data could be partially responsible
      for the killing. In addition, no synergy was observed between
      pretreated buffer and 1.5 μg/mL Tob. This finding suggests that
      electric current may enhance the penetration of Tob and/or the
      susceptibility of persisters.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to stainless steel, carbon electrodes were also found
      to control E. coli persister cells (discussed above). Here we also
      compare the effects of stainless steel and carbon electrodes on P.
      aeruginosa persister cells. As shown in FIG. 14, killing by about
      two logs was achieved using carbon electrodes. It is slightly less
      than the 3 logs of killing by stainless steel electrodes; however,
      it does confirm that the killing effects are not limited to
      stainless steel electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Since the current treatment with 304 stainless steel electrodes
      was more effective than that with carbon electrodes in killing
      persisters, another experiment was conducted to treat P.
      aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells using carbon electrodes and 0.85%
      NaCl buffer pretreated with 304 stainless steel electrodes. As
      shown in FIG. 15, additional killing was observed compared to
      treatment with 304 stainless steel electrodes (FIG. 15) or carbon
      electrodes (FIG. 14) alone. These results confirm that ions or
      charge movement induced by electric current treatment may be a key
      factor in killing persister cells. Thus, a pre-prepared solution
      or cream containing such chemical species might be applied for
      disease therapy with electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the electrically-enhanced control of bacterial
      persister cells, both planktonic persisters and those in biofilms,
      are described above. The use of a very small electric current to
      control persister cells, as well as the synergistic effects shown
      when used in conjunction with antimicrobial agents, is a new
      phenomenon. The low level of electric current/voltage required to
      control persister cells are believed to be physiologically safe
      for humans since similar and higher current/voltage levels have
      been used to stimulate tissue and bone growth.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the effects of electric current and the synergy with
      antimicrobial agents is not species-specific, since similar
      results were shown using both E. coli strains and P. aeruginosa
      strains. Accordingly, the present invention can be used to kill a
      wide variety of microbial species.<br>
      <br>
      The use of low electric current and/or low electric current
      together with an antimicrobial agent is a novel means of
      controlling persister cells and can be incorporated into devices
      or procedures in order to treat chronic infections both inside and
      outside the human body. For example, possible applications include
      the treatment of chronic wounds, chronic sinusitis,
      implanted-device-associated infections, and middle ear infection,
      the decontamination of medical devices, or devices with bare or
      coated electrodes, among many others.<br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention has been described in connection
      with a preferred embodiment, it should be understood that
      modifications, alterations, and additions can be made to the
      invention without departing from the scope of the invention as
      defined by the claims.<br>
