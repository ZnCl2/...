      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- A clear
      solution and a method for preparing the solution which has a pH in
      the range of from 10 to 13.9 and containing sulfate ions in a
      concentration range less than 500 parts per million. The solution
      is prepared by mixing two solutions in which one solution has one
      equivalent of <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnesium sulfate</span>
      and an equivalent of <span style="font-weight: bold;">sulfuric

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to methods of making aqueous magnesium
      hydroxide solutions and particularly to a solution that is clear
      of the magnesia sludge that characterizes typical industrial
      aqueous magnesia solutions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART AND INFORMATION
        DISCLOSURE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Standard magnesium hydroxide is manufactured by crushing an ore
      containing magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate and putting
      the ore through a kiln in order to drive off CO2 leaving magnesium
      oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO).<br>
      <br>
      Numerous chemical processes include steps that require strong base
      solutions with a high pH. Such processes include, for example,
      paint stripping operations where it is desirable to loosen and
      remove an old coating on a steel or cast iron surface down to the
      bare metal in order to repaint or replate the metal surface.
      Another group of processes relates to the cleaning of an aluminum
      surface in which it is required to remove aluminum oxide scale as
      an initial step in the typical anodizing or alodining process.
      Extreme care must sometimes be taken in these preliminary steps to
      prevent etching of the base metal (aluminum) that can damage the
      metal part.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, solutions including sodium hydroxide (caustic
      solutions) are used for these operations. The use of sodium
      hydroxide has the advantage that the salt is very highly soluble
      and is the agent for obtaining the very high pH necessary to
      support the desired reaction with the coatings. Usually inhibitors
      are added to the caustic solution which coat the metal as soon as
      the offending coating of paint or oxide has been removed. The
      inhibitors protect the newly exposed surface from further attack
      by the caustic solution. However, the inhibiting agent, itself can
      become a problem since it must be removed from the virgin metal
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      The use of sodium hydroxide in these processes has the advantages
      that the salt is very highly soluble and provides the means for
      obtaining the very high pH necessary to support the desired
      reaction with the coatings and/or underlying oxides. However, an
      important problem associated with using caustic solutions is the
      difficulty in removing the sodium ion from the spent (waste)
      solution. The only practical approach is by major dilution. The
      presence of sodium in drinking water is not desirable because its
      presence raises blood pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Attempts have been made to substitute oxide compounds of calcium
      or magnesium for sodium in order to overcome the problems with
      sodium. However, such substitutions have not been successful
      because of the strong tendency of oxide compounds of magnesium and
      calcium to precipitate and form sludges. Removal of such sludges
      and the following step of dewatering the sludge has proven to be
      too expensive for practical application. Furthermore, the pH at
      which such objectionable precipitation occurs is generally in the
      range of 9.0 to 10.0 which is appreciably lower than can be
      obtained with the caustic solutions or is actually required to
      precipitate and remove heavy metal constituents to a level that is
      acceptable according to present standards.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In view of the these difficulties, it is an object of this
      invention to produce a basic solution in a range between pH=10 to
      pH=13.9 whose cation is primarily magnesium and which does not
      form a sludge upon standing.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object that the basic solution of this invention
      be non-reactive with human tissue and is much safer to handle than
      compounds containing Na and K intended for the same applications.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object that the solution be inexpensive to produce
      and require no special equipment and that waste solutions of the
      invention be neutralized by electrical chemical processes rather
      than by the addition of acid neutralizing agents.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF A BEST MODE</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Turning now to a discussion of the drawings, FIG. 1 is a flow
      chart showing steps for producing the high pH magnesia solution of
      this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In step 1, a first solution was formed by adding concentrated
      sulfuric acid containing one gram atomic weight of H2 SO4 and one
      gram atomic weight of Mg SO4.7H2 O to two liters of deionized
      water and agitating so that the resulting MgSO4 is completely
      dissolved after 30 mins. of mild agitation.<br>
      <br>
      In step 2 a second solution was formed by completely dissolving
      one gram atomic weight of Ca(OH)2 and two grams atomic weight of
      K(OH) in two liters of deionized water and agitating for 30 mins.<br>
      <br>
      In step 3, the first and second solutions were mixed together
      causing a precipitate to form.<br>
      <br>
      In step 4, the solution was filtered through an 11 micron filter
      thereby producing a filtrate that is the solution of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The pH of the filtrate was measured and observed to be 13.7. The
      filtrate was examined in a spectrometer and found to contain 54
      parts per million of Ca@++, less than 500 parts per million of
      SO4@++. Any concentration of K@+ in the first-rate was below the
      limit of detection by the spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      By performing the steps in accordance with the method of the
      invention, a solution containing Mg@++ was formed stabilized by
      the presence of OH@-- such that the solution has a pH of about
      13.7. Appropriate dilution of this solution can be used to reduce
      the solution to any value in the range from 7@+ to at least 13.7.<br>
      <br>
      In order to compare these results with what would normally be the
      most direct method of producing an aqueous solution of magnesium
      hydroxide, the following procedures were performed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure 1</span>--100.0 grams
      of Premier Chemical Brucite 200 (MgO*H2 O) was added to 750 ml of
      deionized water, stirred for two hours, then allowed to set
      overnight. The solution was then filtered. The precipitate weighed
      100.0 gms. indicating that most all of the MgO*H2 O originally
      mixed into the water had settled out. The pH of the filtrate was
      9.45.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure 2</span> -- To 750 ml
      of water was added conc. H2 SO4 such as to lower the pH to 3.0. To
      this sample was added 100.0 gms. of Brucite and mixed and allowed
      to stand overnight. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was
      dried. The filtrate was weighed and found to weigh 99.6 gms
      indicating that 0.4% of the original Brucite had dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure 3</span>.-- To 750 ml
      of water was added conc. NaOH such as to raise the pH to 11.0. To
      this solution was added 100.0 gms. of Brucite, mixed and allowed
      to stand overnight. The solution was filtered and the filtrate
      dried and weighed. The filtrate was weighed and it was found that
      only 0.15% of the original magnesium compound had dissolved. The
      end pH was found to be 10.1, lower than the initial 11.0 of the
      NaOH solution in water.<br>
      <br>
      Procedures 1, 2 and 3 demonstrate the difficulty in dissolving
      magnesium oxide compounds in water such as to obtain a clear
      solution with a pH greater than 9-10.<br>
      <br>
      Although we do not wish to be bound by theory, it is believed that
      the results presented above are in accordance with the following
      discussion.<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium Oxide is known to form a true hydroxide Mg(OH)2 which is
      very soluble in water, and/or a hydrate, MgO*H2 O which is
      relatively insoluble. Under the conditions prevailing in
      procedures 1, 2 and 3, which are general conditions that typify
      many industrial processes, insoluble MgO*H2 O is the dominant
      species of magnesium hydroxde when the pH of the solution exceeds
      10.0. so that additional amounts of added MgO simply result in
      forming MgO*H2 O precipitate without further raising the pH.<br>
      <br>
      Under the conditions prevailing according to step 2 of the
      invention, the hydrated hydroxide ions are formed and remain after
      the steps of adding the dissolved KOH and Ca(OH)2 to the solution
      of H2 SO4 and MgSO4. CaSO4 is insoluble in water and KSO4 is
      soluble in water only to the extent of 10 gms/100 ml water.
      However, it is also known that potassium forms double sulfate
      salts with alkali earth metals and so it is reasoned that any K@+
      that would otherwise remain in solution will coprecipitate with
      the precipitated CaSO4, thereby explaining the absence of K@+ in
      the solution of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      A major advantage for using the solution of this invention
      compared to state of the art processes using caustic solution to
      neutralize waste acid solutions is the ability to remove the
      magnesium ions from waste solutions using electrochemical means
      which is a method of this invention. FIG. 2 shows an apparatus for
      removing the magnesium ion. There is shown a pair of iron anodes
      12 between which the spent solution containing magnesium ions is
      passed. A voltage from power supply 14 is applied between the
      electrodes in the range 79 to 83 volts. This step causes a
      precipitate of Mg(OH)3 to form which is filtered out of the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 lists the steps included in a typical process for applying
      the principles of this invention to situations where the magnesium
      containing solution is used such as in the neutralization of waste
      acid solutions or in cleaning operations whereafter the magnesium
      is removed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 1, a first solution was
        formed by adding concentrated sulfuric acid containing one gram
        atomic weight of H2 SO4 and one gram atomic weight of Mg SO4.7H2
        O to two liters of deionized water and agitating so that that
        the resulting MgSO4 is completely dissolved after 30 mins. of
        mild agitation.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 2 a second solution was
        formed by completely dissolving one gram atomic weight of
        Ca(OH)2 and two grams atomic weight of K(OH) in two liters of
        deionized water and agitating for 30 mins.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 3, the first and second
        solutions are mixed together causing a precipitate to form.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 4, the solution was
        filtered through an 11 micron filter thereby producing the a
        filtrate that is the solution of this invention.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 5, the solution from step
        4 is used in the intended operation which is typically a metal
        cleaning operation or acid neutralizing operation.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 6 the solution is passed
        between electrodes with a voltage in the range between 79 to 83
        volts providing that magnesium precipitate forms and removing
        the magnesium ions from solution.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In step 7, the precipitate is
        filtered out of the solution.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      Other concentrations of H2 SO4, Ca(OH)2, KOH, and Mg SO4 have been
      investigated in the course of reducing this invention to practice
      which have produced solutions with characteristics similar to the
      above example and the use of this range of compositions is within
      the scope of the invention. These ranges are one quarter to three
      quarter gram atomic weight of H2 SO4, Ca(OH)2, MgSO4 and one half
      to one gram atomic weight of K(OH) in a liter of water.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is presently believed that the conditions listed in
      steps 1-4 are optimum for many situations.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing discussion discloses an example of the application
      of principles of the invention to produce a solution having a high
      pH and a heavy concentraion of magnesium ions. The solution is
      useful in processes such as cleaning or neutralization where it is
      desired to avoid the formation of sludge and be amenable to post
      treatment utilizing electrochemical techniques. The principles of
      the invention include adding a solution of a soluble salt of
      magnesium (MgSO4) dissolved in an acid having an anion common with
      the salt to a solution of a strong base (KOH) and a base (Ca(OH)2)
      in which the cation (Ca@++) and the anion of the soluble salt
      (SO4@--) precipitate out of soltuion and pull the cation (K@+) of
      the strong base (KOH) out of solution by coprecipitation leaving,
      in solution, hydrated (stabilized) hydroxyl ions (OH)*(H2 O)n and
      Mg@++. Application of these principles thereby provides a solution
      having a much greater concentration of Mg@++ and a greater pH than
      has been disclosed by other related processes of the prior art.
      Other elements can be substituted in the process of this invention
      to which the same considerations can apply. For example, Barium
      ions form insoluble precipitates with the sulfate ion and could be
      a useful substitute for Calcium in some applications.<br>
      <br>
      Other variations of the invention may be suggested after reading
      the specification that are within the scope of the invention. We
      therefore wish to define the scope of our invention by the
      appended claims. <br>

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRSA<br>
        <br>
        Signs and symptoms</span><br>
      <br>
      S. aureus most commonly colonizes the anterior nares (the
      nostrils), although the rest of the respiratory tract, opened
      wounds, intravenous catheters, and urinary tract are also
      potential sites for infection. Healthy individuals may carry MRSA
      asymptomatically for periods ranging from a few weeks to many
      years. Patients with compromised immune systems are at a
      significantly greater risk of symptomatic secondary infection.<br>
      <br>
      MRSA can be detected by swabbing most of the nostrils of patients
      and isolating the bacteria found inside. Combined with extra
      sanitary measures for those in contact with infected patients,
      screening patients admitted to hospitals has been found to be
      effective in minimizing the spread of MRSA in hospitals in the
      United States,[1] Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands.[2]<br>
      <br>
      MRSA may progress substantially within 24–48 hours of initial
      topical symptoms. After 72 hours MRSA can take hold in human
      tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment. The initial
      presentation of MRSA is small red bumps that resemble pimples,
      spider bites, or boils that may be accompanied by fever and
      occasionally rashes. Within a few days the bumps become larger,
      more painful, and eventually open into deep, pus-filled boils.[3]
      About 75 percent of community-associated (CA-) MRSA infections are
      localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated
      effectively. However, some CA-MRSA strains display enhanced
      virulence, spreading more rapidly and causing illness much more
      severe than traditional healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA
      infections, and they can affect vital organs and lead to
      widespread infection (sepsis), toxic shock syndrome and
      necrotizing ("flesh-eating") pneumonia. This is thought to be due
      to toxins carried by CA-MRSA strains, such as PVL and PSM, though
      PVL was recently found to not be a factor in a study by the
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at
      the NIH. It is not known why some healthy people develop CA-MRSA
      skin infections that are treatable whereas others infected with
      the same strain develop severe infections or die.[4] The bacteria
      attack parts of the immune system, and even engulf white blood
      cells, the opposite of the usual.[4]<br>
      <br>
      The most common manifestations of CA-MRSA are skin infections such
      as necrotizing fasciitis or pyomyositis (most commonly found in
      the tropics), necrotizing pneumonia, infective endocarditis (which
      affects the valves of the heart), or bone or joint infections.[5]
      CA-MRSA often results in abscess formation that requires incision
      and drainage. Before the spread of MRSA into the community,
      abscesses were not considered contagious because it was assumed
      that infection required violation of skin integrity and the
      introduction of staphylococci from normal skin colonization.
      However, newly emerging CA-MRSA is transmissible (similar, but
      with very important differences) from Hospital-Associated MRSA.
      CA-MRSA is less likely than other forms of MRSA to cause
      cellulitis.<br>
      [edit] Risk factors<br>
      <br>
      At risk populations include:<br>
      <br>
      People with weak immune systems (people living with HIV/AIDS,
      cancer patients, transplant recipients, severe asthmatics, etc.)<br>
      Diabetics<br>
      Intravenous drug users<br>
      Use of quinolone antibiotics[6]<br>
      Young children<br>
      The elderly<br>
      College students living in dormitories<br>
      People staying or working in a health care facility for an
      extended period of time<br>
      People who spend time in coastal waters where MRSA is present,
      such as some beaches in Florida and the west coast of the United
      States[7][8]<br>
      People who spend time in confined spaces with other people,
      including prison inmates, soldiers in basic training,[9] and
      individuals who spend considerable time in changerooms or gyms.<br>
      Hospital patients<br>
      Prison inmates<br>
      People in contact with live food-producing animals<br>
      <br>
      Diagnosis<br>
      <br>
      Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories
      are key for identifying outbreaks of MRSA. New rapid techniques
      for the identification and characterization of MRSA have been
      developed. This notwithstanding, the bacterium generally must be
      cultured via blood, urine, sputum, or other body fluid cultures,
      and grown up in the lab in sufficient numbers to perform these
      confirmatory tests first, so there is no quick and easy method to
      diagnose an MRSA infection, therefore initial treatment is often
      based upon 'strong suspicion' by the treating physician, since any
      delay in treating this type of infection can have fatal
      consequences. These techniques include Real-time PCR and
      Quantitative PCR and are increasingly being employed in clinical
      laboratories for the rapid detection and identification of MRSA
      strains.[19][20]<br>
      <br>
      Another common laboratory test is a rapid latex agglutination test
      that detects the PBP2a protein. PBP2a is a variant
      penicillin-binding protein that imparts the ability of S. aureus
      to be resistant to oxacillin.[21]<br>
      <br>
      Strains<br>
      <br>
      In the UK, where MRSA is commonly called "Golden Staph", the most
      common strains of MRSA are EMRSA15 and EMRSA16.[22] EMRSA16 is the
      best described epidemiologically: it originated in Kettering,
      England, and the full genomic sequence of this strain has been
      published.[23] EMRSA16 has been found to be identical to the
      ST36:USA200 strain, which circulates in the United States, and to
      carry the SCCmec type II, enterotoxin A and toxic shock syndrome
      toxin 1 genes.[24] Under the new international typing system, this
      strain is now called MRSA252. It is not entirely certain why this
      strain has become so successful, whereas previous strains have
      failed to persist. One explanation is the characteristic pattern
      of antibiotic susceptibility. Both the EMRSA15 and EMRSA16 strains
      are resistant to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. It is known that
      Staphylococcus aureus can survive intracellularly,[25] for example
      in the nasal mucosa [26] and in the tonsil tissue ,.[27]
      Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin are precisely the antibiotics that
      best penetrate intracellularly; it may be that these strains of S.
      aureus are therefore able to exploit an intracellular niche.<br>
      <br>
      Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is more easily treated, though
      more virulent, than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). CA-MRSA
      apparently did not evolve de novo in the community but represents
      a hybrid between MRSA that spread from the hospital environment
      and strains that were once easily treatable in the community. Most
      of the hybrid strains also acquired a factor that increases their
      virulence, resulting in the development of deep-tissue infections
      from minor scrapes and cuts, as well as many cases of fatal
      pneumonia.[28]<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, most cases of CA-MRSA are caused by a CC8
      strain designated ST8:USA300, which carries SCCmec type IV,
      Panton-Valentine leukocidin, PSM-alpha and enterotoxins Q and
      K,[24] and ST1:USA400.[29] Other community-acquired strains of
      MRSA are ST8:USA500 and ST59:USA1000. In many nations of the
      world, MRSA strains with different predominant genetic background
      types have come to predominate among CA-MRSA strains; USA300
      easily tops the list in the U. S. and is becoming more common in
      Canada after its first appearance there in 2004. For example, in
      Australia ST93 strains are common, while in continental Europe
      ST80 strains predominate (Tristan et al., Emerging Infectious
      Diseases, 2006). In Taiwan, ST59 strains, some of which are
      resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics, have arisen as
      common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community.
      In a remote region of Alaska, unlike most of the continental U.
      S., USA300 was found rarely in a study of MRSA strains from
      outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004–06
      (David et al., Emerg Infect Dis 2008).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Surface sanitizing</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      NAV-CO2 sanitizing in Pennsylvania hospital exam room<br>
      <br>
      Alcohol has been proven to be an effective surface sanitizer
      against MRSA. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with
      alcohol to extend the longevity of the sanitizing action.[37] The
      prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal
      cleaning. Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems
      (NAV-CO2) do not corrode metals or plastics used in medical
      environments and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.<br>
      <br>
      In healthcare environments, MRSA can survive on surfaces and
      fabrics, including privacy curtains or garments worn by care
      providers. Complete surface sanitation is necessary to eliminate
      MRSA in areas where patients are recovering from invasive
      procedures. Testing patients for MRSA upon admission, isolating
      MRSA-positive patients, decolonization of MRSA-positive patients,
      and terminal cleaning of patients' rooms and all other clinical
      areas they occupy is the current best practice protocol for
      nosocomial MRSA.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hand washing</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      At the end of August 2004, after a successful pilot scheme to
      tackle MRSA, the UK National Health Service announced its Clean
      Your Hands campaign. Wards were required to ensure that
      alcohol-based hand rubs are placed near all beds so that staff can
      hand wash more regularly. It is thought that even if this cuts
      infection by no more than 1%, the plan will pay for itself many
      times over.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      As with some other bacteria, MRSA is acquiring more resistance to
      some disinfectants and antiseptics. Although alcohol-based rubs
      remain somewhat effective, a more effective strategy is to wash
      hands with running water and an anti-microbial cleanser with
      persistent killing action, such as Chlorhexidine[38]<br>
      <br>
      A June 2008 report[citation needed], centered on a survey by the
      Association for Professionals in Infection Control and
      Epidemiology, concluded that poor hygiene habits remain the
      principal barrier to significant reductions in the spread of MRSA.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Essential oil diffusion</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An in vitro study on the inhibition of MRSA by essential oil
      diffusion found that 72 of 91 investigated essential oils
      exhibited zones of inhibition in soy agar plates streaked with
      MRSA (strain ATCC 700699). The most effective being lemongrass oil
      (Cymbopogon flexuosus), lemon myrtle oil (Backhousia citriodora),
      mountain savory oil (Satureja montana), cinnamon oil (Cinnamomum
      verum), and melissa oil (Melissa officinalis) essential oils. Of
      these, lemongrass essential oil was the most effective, completely
      inhibiting all MRSA colony growth.[39]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tea tree oil</span> also kills
      all MRSA strains that have been tested.[40]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decolonization</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      After the drainage of boils or other treatment for MRSA, patients
      can shower at home using chlorhexidine (Hibiclens) or
      hexachlorophene (Phisohex) antiseptic soap from head to toe, and
      apply mupirocin (Bactroban) 2% ointment inside each nostril twice
      daily for 7 days, using a cotton-tipped swab. Household members
      are recommended to follow the same decolonization protocol.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors may also prescribe antibiotics such as clindamycin,
      doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, there is
      very little evidence that using more antibiotics actually has the
      effect of preventing recurrent MRSA skin infections.[41]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Proper disposal of hospital gowns</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Used paper hospital gowns are associated with MRSA hospital
      infections, which could be avoided by proper disposal.[42]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Isolation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Current US guidance does not require workers in the general
      workplace (excluding medical facilities) with MRSA infections to
      be routinely excluded from going to work.[43] Therefore, unless
      directed by a health care provider, exclusion from work should be
      reserved for those with wound drainage that cannot be covered and
      contained with a clean, dry bandage and for those who cannot
      maintain good hygiene practices.[43] Workers with active
      infections should be excluded from activities where skin-to-skin
      contact is likely to occur until their infections are healed.
      Health care workers should follow the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention's Guidelines for Infection Control in Health Care
      Personnel.[44]<br>
      <br>
      To prevent the spread of staph or MRSA in the workplace, employers
      should ensure the availability of adequate facilities and supplies
      that encourage workers to practice good hygiene; that surface
      sanitizing in the workplace is followed; and that contaminated
      equipment are sanitized with Environmental Protection Agency
      (EPA)-registered disinfectants.[43]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restricting antibiotic use</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Glycopeptides, cephalosporins and in particular quinolones are
      associated with an increased risk of colonisation of MRSA.
      Reducing use of antibiotic classes that promote MRSA colonisation,
      especially fluoroquinolones, is recommended in current
      guidelines.[6][10]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Treatment</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are resistant to traditional
      anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalexin.
      CA-MRSA has a greater spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility,
      including to sulfa drugs (like
      co-trimoxazole/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), tetracyclines (like
      doxycycline and minocycline) and clindamycin, but the drug of
      choice for treating CA-MRSA has is now believed to be Vancomycin,
      according to a Henry Ford Hospital Study. The study was presented
      on October 23, 2010, at the 48th annual meeting of the Infectious
      Diseases Society of America in Vancouver. HA-MRSA is resistant
      even to these antibiotics and often is susceptible only to
      vancomycin. Newer drugs, such as linezolid (belonging to the newer
      oxazolidinones class) and daptomycin, are effective against both
      CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.<br>
      <br>
      Vancomycin and teicoplanin are glycopeptide antibiotics used to
      treat MRSA infections.[54] Teicoplanin is a structural congener of
      vancomycin that has a similar activity spectrum but a longer
      half-life.[55] Because the oral absorption of vancomycin and
      Teicoplanin is very low, these agents must be administered
      intravenously to control systemic infections.[56] Drugs are
      administered via a Peripherally inserted central catheter, or a
      Picc Line, which is inserted by radiologists, doctors, physician
      assistants (in the U.S.), radiologist assistants (in the U.S.), or
      specially trained certified registered nurses.[57] Treatment of
      MRSA infection with vancomycin can be complicated, due to its
      inconvenient route of administration. Moreover, many clinicians
      believe that the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA is inferior
      to that of anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics against
      MSSA.[58][59]<br>
      <br>
      Several newly discovered strains of MRSA show antibiotic
      resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin. These new
      evolutions of the MRSA bacterium have been dubbed Vancomycin
      intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA).[60] [61]
      Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin(synercid), daptomycin, and
      tigecycline are used to treat more severe infections that do not
      respond to glycopeptides such as vancomycin.[62]<br>
      <br>
      There have been claims that bacteriophage can be used to cure
      MRSA. [63]<br>
      <br>
      The psychedelic mushroom <span style="font-weight: bold;">Psilocybe







        semilanceata</span> has been shown to strongly inhibit the
      growth of Staphylococcus aureus.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Initial studies at the University of East London have demonstrated
      that <span style="font-weight: bold;">allicin</span> (a compound
      found in garlic) exhibits a strong antimicrobial response to the
      bacteria, indicating that it may one day lead to more effective
      treatments.[64]<br>

      <br>
      It has been reported that maggot therapy to clean out necrotic
      tissue of MRSA infection has been successful. Studies in diabetic
      patients reported significantly shorter treatment times than those
      achieved with standard treatments.[78][79][80]<br>
      <br>
      Many antibiotics against MRSA are in phase II and phase III
      clinical trials. eg:<br>
      <br>
      * Phase III : ceftobiprole, Ceftaroline, Dalbavancin, Telavancin,
      Aurograb, torezolid, iclaprim...<br>
      * Phase II : nemonoxacin.[81]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-clinical</span><br>
      <br>
      An entirely different and promising approach is phage therapy
      (e.g., at the Eliava Institute in Georgia[82]), which in mice had
      a reported efficacy against up to 95% of tested Staphylococcus
      isolates.[83]<br>
      <br>
      On May 18, 2006, a report in Nature identified a new antibiotic,
      called platensimycin, that had demonstrated successful use against
      MRSA.[84][85]<br>
      <br>
      Ocean-dwelling living sponges produce compounds that may make MRSA
      more susceptible to antibiotics.[86]<br>
      <br>
      Cannabinoids (components of Cannabis sativa), including
      cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabichromene (CBC) and
      cannabigerol (CBG), show activity against a variety of MRSA
      strains. [87]<br>
