          <p>This device, patented by Harold Colman and Ronald
            Seddon-Gillespie on 5 December 1956, is quite remarkable. It
            is a tiny lightweight device which can produce electricity
            using a self-powered electromagnet and chemical salts. The
            working life of the device before needing refurbishment is
            estimated at some 70 years with <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">an output of about one kilowat</span>t. </p>
          <p>The operation is controlled by a transmitter which bombards
            the chemical sample with <span style="font-weight: bold;">300











              MHz</span> radio waves. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This











              produces radioactive emissions from the chemical mixture
              for a period of one hour maximum</span>, so that the<span
              style="font-weight: bold;"> transmitter needs to be run
              for 15 to 30 seconds once every hour</span>. The chemical
            mixture is shielded by a lead screen to prevent harmful
            radiation from reaching the user.... </p>
          <p>This generator unit includes a magnet. a tube containing a
            chemcial mixture of elements whose nuclei becomes unstable
            as a result of a bombardment by short waves so that the
            elements become radio-active and release electrical energy,
            the mixture being mounted between, and in contact with, a
            pair of different metals such as copper and zinc, and a
            capacitor mounted between those metals. </p>
          <p>The mixture is preferably composed of the elements <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">Cadmium, Phosphorus and Cobalt</span>
            having atomic weights of 112, 31, and 59 respectively. The
            mixture, which may be of powdered form, is mounted in a tube
            of non-conducting, high heat resistivity material and is
            compressed between<span style="font-weight: bold;">
              granulated zinc at one end of the tube and granulated
              copper at the other end</span>, the ends of the tube being
            closed by brass caps and the tube being carried in a
            suitable cradle so that it is located between the poles of
            the magnet. The magnet is preferably an electromagnet and is
            energized by the current produced by the unit. The
            transmitter unit which is used for activating the generator
            unit may be of any conventional type operating in the
            ultra-shortwave band and is preferably crystal-controlled at
            the desired frequency with the necessity of tuning. The
            quartz tube containing the chemical mixture, works best if
            made up of a number of small cells in series. In other
            words, considering the cartridge from one end to the other,
            at one end and in contact with the brass cap, there would be
            a layer of copper powder, then a layer of the chemical
            mixture, then a layer of powedered zinc, a layer of powdered
            copper, etc., with a layer of powdered zinc in contact with
            the brass cap at the other end of the cartridge. With a
            cartridge some<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 45 mm long

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to a new apparatus for producing electric
      current such apparatus being in the form of a completely novel
      secondary battery.<br>
      <br>

      above kind which is considerably lighter in weight than and has an
      infinitely greater life than a known battery cr similar electrical
      characteristics and which can be re-activated as and when required
      in a minimum of time.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention we provide apparatus comprising
      a generator unit said unit including a magnet adapted to produce a
      magnetic field, means for suspending a chemical mixture in said
      field, said mixture being composed of elements whose nuclei
      becomes unstable as a result of bombardment by short waves so that
      the elements become radio-active and also release electrical
      energy, said mixture being mounted between and in electrical
      contact with a pair of different metals, such as copper and zinc,
      a condenser mounted between said metals, a terminal electrically
      connected to each said metal, means for conveying said waves to
      said mixture and a lead shield surrounding said unit to prevent
      harmful radiation s from said mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture is preferably composed of the elements Cadmium,
      Phosphorus and Cobalt having Atomic Weights of 112, 31 and 59
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture which may be of powdered form (Price 3 a O d) is
      mounted in a tube of non-conducting, high heat resistivity
      material and is compressed between granulated zinc at one end of
      the tube and granulated copper at the other end, the ends of the
      tube being closed by brass caps 50 and the tube being carried in a
      suitable cradle so that it is located between the poles of the
      magnet.<br>

      <br>
      In the form of our invention illustrated the generator unit
      comprises a base 10 upon which 75 the various components are
      mounted this base having projecting upwardly therefrom a pair of
      arms 11 which are adapted to form a cradle or housing 12 for a
      quartz tube 13 the cradle 12 being preferably made of spring
      material go so that the tube 13 is firmly, yet removably held in
      position The arms 11 are so disposed in relation to the poles 14
      of an electromagnet that the tube 13 when in position is disposed
      immediately between the poles of the 85 magnet so as to be in the
      strongest magnetic field created thereby The magnet serves to
      control the alpha and beta rays emitted by the cartridge when it
      is in operation.<br>
      <br>
      The ends of the quartz tube 13 are each provided with a brass cap
      16 and these caps 16 are adapted to engage within the spring
      cradles 12 and the coils 17 associated with the magnet being so
      arranged that if the base 10 of the unit is in a horizontal plane
      the poles 14 of the magnet are in a substantially vertical plane.<br>
      <br>
      Also connected across the cradles is a lead condenser 18 which may
      conveniently be housed in the base 10 of the unit and connected in
      parallel with this condenser 18 is a suitable high frequency
      inductance coil 19.<br>
      <br>
      The unit is provided with a lead shield 20 so as to prevent
      harmful radiation from the quartz tube as will presently be
      described.<br>
      <br>
      The quartz tube 13 has mounted therein at one end a quantity of
      granulated copper this copper being in electrical contact with the
      brass cap 16 at that end of the tube and mounted within the tube
      and in contact with the granulated copper is a chemical mixture
      which is of powdered form and which is capable of releasing
      electrical energy and which becomes radioactive when subject to
      bombardment by ultra short wireless waves Mounted in the other end
      of the tube and in contact with the other end of the powdered
      chemical mixture is a quantity of granulated zinc which is itself
      in contact with the brass cap on this end of the tube the
      arrangement being that the chemical mixture is compressed between
      the granulated copper and the granulated zinc.<br>
      <br>
      Projecting outwardly from each brass cap 16 and electrically
      connected therewith is an antenna 21 each antenna 21 corresponding
      exactly in dimension, shape and electrical characteristics to the
      antenna associated with a transmitter unit which is to produce the
      ultra short waves aforesaid.<br>
      <br>
      The electro-magnet 15 is conveniently carried by a centrally
      disposed pillar 22 which is secured to the base 10 this pillar 22
      carrying at its upper end a cross-bar 23 to one end of which is
      attached the high frequency coil 19.<br>
      <br>
      The other end of this cross-bar 23 is bent round into arcuate form
      as shown at 24 and is adapted to bear against an arcuate portion
      25 of the base 26 of the electromagnet 15 Suitable locking means
      is provided for securing the two arcuate portions 24 and 25 in the
      desired angular position so that the position of the poles 14 of
      the electromagnet can be adjusted about the axis of the quartz
      tube 13.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitter unit is of any suitable conventional type for
      producing ultra short waves and may be crystal controlled to
      ensure that it will operate upon the desired frequency without the
      necessity for tuning If the transmitter is only required to
      operate over a short range it may conveniently be battery operated
      but if it is to operate over a greater range then it may be
      operated from a suitable electric supply such as the mains.<br>
      <br>
      If the transmitter is to be tuned the tuning may be ope ated by a
      dial provided with a micrometer vernier scale so that the
      necessary "fineness" of tuning may be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture which is contained within the quartz tube is composed
      of the elements Cadmium, Phosphorus and Cobalt having Atomic
      Weights 112, 31 and 59 respectively Conven 70 iently these
      elements may' be present in the following compounds and where the
      tube is to contain thirty milligrams of the mixture the compounds
      and their proportions by weight are as follows: 75 1 Part of Co
      (No 3) 2 6 H 2 O 2 Parts of Cd Cl.<br>
      <br>
      3 Parts of 3 Ca (Po 3) 2 + 1 OC.<br>
      <br>
      The cartridge which consists of the tube 13 with the chemical
      mixture therein is preferably go composed of a number of small
      cells built up in series In other words considering the cartridge
      from one end to the other at the one end, and in contact with the
      brass cap, there would be a layer of powdered copper, then a layer
      of pi the chemical mixture, then a layer of powdered zinc, a layer
      of powdered copper etc with a layer of powdered zinc in contact
      with the brass cap at the other end of the cartridge.<br>
      <br>
      With a cartridge some forty-five millimetres 90 long and five
      millimetres diameter some fourteen individual cells may be
      included.<br>
      <br>
      The cradles 12 in which the brass caps 16 engage may themselves
      comprise terminals from which the output of the unit can be taken
      9, Alternatively a pair of terminals 27 may be connected across
      the cradles 12 these terminals 27 being themselves provided with
      suitable antennae 28, which correspond exactly in dimensions,
      shape and electrical characteristics 100 to the antennae
      associated with the transmitter these antennae 28, if provided,
      replacing the antennae 21.<br>
      <br>
      In operation with the quartz tube containing the above mixture
      located between the granu 105 lated copper and the granulated zinc
      and with the tube itself in position between the poles of the
      magnet the transmitter is switched on and the ultra short waves
      emanating therefrom are received by the antennae mounted at each
      end 110 of the tube and in contact with the copper and zinc
      respectively the waves being thus passed through the copper and
      zinc and through the mixture so that the mixture is bombarded by
      the short waves and the Cadmium, Phosphorus 115 and Cobalt
      associated with the mixture becomes radio active and also releases
      electrical energy which is transmitted to the granulated copper
      and granulated zinc causing a current to flow therebetween in a
      similar manner to the current 120 flow produced by a thermo couple
      It has been established that with a mixture having the above
      composition the optimum release of energy is obtained when the
      transmitter is operating at a frequency of 300 megacycles per 125
      second.<br>
      <br>
      The provision of a quartz tube is necessary for the mixture
      evolves a considerable amount of heat whilst it is reacting as a
      result of the bombardment by the short waves It is found 130
      763,062 763,062 that the tube will only last for one hour and that
      the tube will become discharged after an hour's operation, that is
      to say the radio activeness of the tube will only last for one
      hour and it is therefore necessary, if the unit is to be run
      continuously for the transmitter to be operated for a period of
      some fifteen to thirty seconds duration once every hour.<br>
      <br>
      With a quartz tube having an overall length of some forty-five
      millimetres and an inside diameter of five millimetres and
      containing thirty milligrammes of the chemical element the
      estimated energy which will be given off from the tube for a
      discharge of one hour is between 100 and 110 volts at 10 amps To
      enable the tube to give off this discharge it is only necessary to
      operate the transmitter at the desired frequency for a period of
      some 15 to seconds duration.<br>
      <br>
      The current which is given off by the tube during its discharge is
      in the form of direct current.<br>
      <br>
      During the discharge from the tube harmful radiations are emitted
      in the form of gamma and alpha and beta rays and it is therefor
      necessary to mount the unit within a lead shield so as to prevent
      the harmful radiations from affecting personnel and objects in the
      vicinity of the unit The alpha and beta rays which are emitted
      from the cartridge when it is in operation are controlled by the
      magnet When the unit is connected up to some apparatus which it to
      be driven by power obtained from the unit it is necessary to
      provide suitable fuses to guard against the cartridge being short
      circuited during discharge thereof, or when it is fully charged,
      for if such a short circuit should occur the cartridge is liable
      to explode.<br>
      <br>
      The estimated weight of such a unit including the necessary
      shielding, per kilowatt hour output is approximately twenty-five
      per cent of any known standard type of accumulator which is in use
      today and it is estimated that the life of the chemical mixture is
      probably in the region of seventy to eighty years when under
      constant use.<br>
      <br>
      It will thus be seen that we have provided a novel form of
      apparatus for producing an electric current which is considerably
      lighter than the standard type of accumulator at present known,
      which has an infinitely greater life than any known type of
      accumulator and which can be recharged or reactivated as and when
      desired and from a remote position depending upon the power output
      of the transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      Such form of battery has many applications.<br>
      <br>
      One for example, of which is the use of such batteries in marker
      and other buoys which are used in harbours and such like places
      and which 60 could be reactivated at given intervals from a shore
      base central transmitting station.<br>
