        <b>By Hannah Osborne</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Graphene has been used to turn seawater into clean drinking water.
      The graphene sieve was shown to filter common salts from the
      water, and scientist say the technology could be scaled up –
      potentially providing hope to the millions of people around the
      globe who have limited access to clean water.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene – often dubbed a wonder material – was first isolated by
      scientists in 2004. It is just one atom thick, extremely light and
      around 200 times stronger than steel. It is highly flexible and an
      excellent conductor of heat and electricity, making it of huge
      interest to scientists in real-world applications.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at the University of Manchester have now shown how
      graphene-oxide membranes can be used as an efficient filtration
      system. Publishing their findings in the journal Nature
      Nanotechnology, the researchers were building on previous work
      showing how these membranes could be used to filter nanoparticles,
      organic molecules and salts.<br>
      <br>
      The team had shown how when immersed in water, the graphene-oxide
      membranes would swell up, causing larger salt ions or molecules to
      be blocked out. Building on this, they created a sieve that stops
      the graphene membrane from swelling when exposed to water, meaning
      the pore size can be controlled. As a result, they could filter
      out common salts from water (like seawater), making it safe to
      drink.<br>
      <br>
      "Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable
      method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling,
      which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl [sodium chloride]," they
      wrote.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery has huge real-world implications. An estimated 663
      million people worldwide do not have access to clean water close
      to their homes, with many having to travel long distances or queue
      for hours to get it. Under its current Sustainable Development
      Goals, the United Nations hopes to make sure everyone on the
      planet has access to safe water by 2030.<br>
      <br>
      But this will not be easy. Climate change is putting more people's
      water security at risk – increased droughts, flooding and melting
      glaciers all lead to greater risk of shortages. And this, in turn,
      threatens food production, sanitation, energy and industry.<br>
      graphene<br>
      <br>
      The researchers said their graphene sieve can be scale up for
      industry, and membranes can be created with "on-demand
      filtration", meaning ions can be removed according to their sizes.<br>
      <br>
      Corresponding author Rahul Nair said: "Realisation of scalable
      membranes with uniform pore size down to atomic scale is a
      significant step forward and will open new possibilities for
      improving the efficiency of desalination technology.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first clear-cut experiment in this regime. We also
      demonstrate that there are realistic possibilities to scale up the
      described approach and mass-produce graphene-based membranes with
      required sieve sizes."<br>
      <br>
      Researchers hope the technology could be built on scales that
      allow it to be used by countries without the financial
      infrastructure to create large plants for water filtration.<br>
      <br>
      In a related News &amp; Views article, Ram Devanathan, from the
      Energy and Environment Directorate at the Pacific Northwest
      National Laboratory, said the sieve was a "promising approach to
      treat industrial wastewater".<br>
      <br>
      He added, however, that it will be some time before the sieve is
      commercially viable. "The ultimate goal is to create a filtration
      device that will produce potable water from seawater or wastewater
      with minimal energy input," he wrote. "Much more work remains to
      be done to produce graphene-oxide [GO] membranes inexpensively at
      an industrial scale, ensure the stability and durability of the GO
      laminate under prolonged operation with seawater, and enhance the
      resistance of the membrane to fouling by organics, salt and
      biological material."<br>

      <b>Water Purification</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to methods of purifying water using
      graphene oxide laminates which are formed from stacks of
      cross-linked individual graphene oxide flakes which may be
      predominantly monolayer thick. The laminates also comprise
      graphene and/or at least one cross-linking agent. The invention
      also relates to the laminate membranes themselves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The removal of solutes from water finds application in many
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] This may take the form of the purification of water for
      drinking or for watering crops or it may take the form of the
      purification of waste waters from industry to prevent
      environmental damage. Examples of applications for water
      purification include: the removal of salt from sea water for
      drinking water or for use in industry; the purification of
      brackish water; the removal of radioactive ions from water which
      has been involved in nuclear enrichment, nuclear power generation
      or nuclear clean-up (e.g. that involved in the decommissioning of
      former nuclear power stations or following nuclear incidents); the
      removal of environmentally hazardous substances (e.g. halogenated
      organic compounds, heavy metals, chlorates and perchlorates) from
      industrial waste waters before they enter the water system; and
      the removal of biological pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria,
      parasites, etc) from contaminated or suspect drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In many industrial contexts (e.g. the nuclear industry) it
      is often desirable to separate dangerous or otherwise undesired
      solutes from valuable (e.g. rare metals) solutes in industrial
      waste waters in order that the valuable solutes can be recovered
      and reused or sold.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Graphene is believed to be impermeable to all gases and
      liquids. Membranes made from graphene oxide are impermeable to
      most liquids, vapours and gases, including helium. However, an
      academic study has shown that, surprisingly, graphene oxide
      membranes having a thickness around 1 μηι which are effectively
      composed of graphene oxide are permeable to water even though they
      are impermeable to helium. These graphene oxide sheets allow
      unimpeaded permeation of water (10&lt;10&gt;times faster than He)
      (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444). Such GO laminates are
      particularly attractive as potential filtration or separation
      media because they are easy to fabricate, mechanically robust and
      offer no principal obstacles towards industrial scale production.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Sun et al (Selective Ion Penetration of Graphene Oxide
      Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013)) describes the selective ion
      penetration of graphene oxide membranes in which the graphene
      oxide is formed by oxidation of wormlike graphite. The membranes
      are freestanding in the sense that they are not associated with a
      support material. The resultant graphene oxide contains more
      oxygen functional groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural
      graphite and laminates formed from this material have a wrinkled
      surface topography. Such membranes differ from those of the
      present invention because they do not show fast ion permeation of
      small ions and also demonstrate a selectivity which is
      substantially related to chemical and electrostatic interactions
      rather than size of ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] This study found that sodium salts permeated quickly
      through GO membranes, whereas heavy metal salts permeated much
      more slowly. Copper sulphate and organic contaminants, such as
      rhodamine B are blocked entirely because of their strong<br>
      <br>
      interactions with GO membranes. According to this study, ionic or
      molecular permeation through GO is mainly controlled by the
      interaction between ions or molecules with the functional groups
      present in the GO sheets. The authors comment that the selectivity
      of the GO membranes cannot be explained solely by ionic-radius
      based theories. They measured the electrical conductivities of
      different permeate solutions and used this value to compare the
      permeation rates of different salts. The potential applied to
      measure the conductivities can affect ion permeation through
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Other publications (Y. Han, Z. Xu, C. Gao. Adv. Fund.
      Mater. 23, 3693 (2013); M. Hu, B. Mi. Environ. Sci. Technol. 47,
      3715 (2013); H. Huang et al. Chem. Comm. 49, 5963 (2013)) have
      reported filtration properties of GO laminates and, although
      results varied widely due to different fabrication and measurement
      procedures, they reported appealing characteristics including
      large water fluxes and notable rejection rates for certain salts.
      Unfortunately, large organic molecules were also found to pass
      through such GO filters. The latter observation is disappointing
      and would considerably limit interest in GO laminates as molecular
      sieves. In this respect, we note that the emphasis of these
      studies was on high water rates that could be comparable to or
      exceed the rates used for industrial desalination. Accordingly, a
      high water pressure was applied and the GO membranes were
      intentionally prepared as thin as possible, 10-50 nm thick. It may
      be that such thin stacks contained holes and cracks (some may
      appear after applying pressure), through which large organic
      molecules could penetrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Recently, Joshi et al have described the use of graphene
      oxide laminate membranes as size exclusion membranes (R. K. Joshi
      et al., 2014, Science, 343, 752- 754). These membranes selectively
      excluded solutes having a hydration radius greater than about 4.5
      A. allowing solutes with a smaller radius to pass through.
      Unfortunately many solutes which might be desirable to be able to
      filter out, including for example NaCI, have hydration radii which
      are below 4.5 A and thus cannot be excluded from passing through
      the membrane. The GO laminate membranes described in Joshi et al
      provide a water flux in the region of 2 L nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;,
      considerably lower than that typically obtained for commercial
      filtration membranes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] In a first aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      reducing the amount of one or more solutes in an aqueous mixture
      to produce a liquid depleted in said solutes, the method
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a) contacting a first face of a graphene oxide laminate membrane
      with the aqueous mixture comprising the one or more solutes;<br>
      <br>
      b) recovering the liquid from or downstream from a second face of
      the graphene oxide laminate membrane;<br>
      <br>
      wherein the graphene oxide laminate membrane has a thickness
      greater than about 100 nm and wherein the graphene oxide flakes of
      which the membrane is comprised have an average oxygen:carbon
      weight ratio in the range of from 0.2:1.0 to 0.5: 1.0 and wherein
      the membrane comprises GO flakes and at least one cross-linking
      agent. Thus, the membrane may comprise a cross-linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The cross-linked membranes used in the methods of the
      invention exhibit considerably higher fluxes compared to GO
      membranes which do not comprise cross- linking agents. Commercial
      desalination membranes typically provide water fluxes ranges from
      ~ 1 L m-&lt;2&gt;h-&lt;1&gt;bar for seawater desalination to ~7 L
      m-&lt;2&gt;h-&lt;1&gt;bar for high flux brackish water
      desalination. GO laminate membranes which do not comprise a
      cross-linking agent provide a water flux in the region of 2 L
      nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;with 25 bar pressure. The water flux of the
      cross-linked GO laminate membranes used in the methods of the
      invention are between 6 and 10 L nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;with 25 bar
      pressure, a significant improvement on the non-cross-linked
      membranes. It would not be expected that reducing the size of the
      pores in the hydrated membrane would lead to a higher flux.
      Furthermore, the presence of a foreign material such as a
      cross-linking agent in the GO membrane would be expected to impede
      the passage of fluid through the membrane as it would be expected
      to occupy some of the available voids of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In a second aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      reducing the amount of one or more solutes in an aqueous mixture
      to produce a liquid depleted in said solutes, the method
      comprising: a) contacting a first face of a graphene oxide
      laminate membrane with the aqueous mixture comprising the one or
      more solutes;<br>
      <br>
      b) recovering the liquid from or downstream from a second face of
      the graphene oxide laminate membrane;<br>
      <br>
      wherein the graphene oxide laminate membrane comprises GO flakes
      and graphene flakes. The membrane may also comprise at least one
      cross-linking agent. The graphene flakes may be monolayer flakes
      and/or few layer flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It may be that the graphene oxide laminate membrane has a
      thickness greater than about 100 nm and that the graphene oxide
      flakes of which the membrane is comprised have an average
      oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the range of from 0.2:1.0 to 0.5:
      1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The inventors have found that graphene/GO composite
      membranes can be used as filtration membranes. Given that graphene
      itself is impermeable it is perhaps surprising that such
      composites can form an effective membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The inventors have also found that by including
      cross-linking agents or graphene in GO laminate membranes, the
      expansion of the pores which usually occurs on hydration of GO
      laminate membranes is reduced. This in turn can allow the membrane
      to exclude smaller ions than would be excluded with GO laminate
      membranes which do not comprise a cross-linking agent or graphene,
      i.e. ions with hydration radii below 4.5 A. Additionally, or
      alternatively, it can allow the membrane to be more effective at
      excluding those smaller ions that can pass through. The extent to
      which any given cross-linking agent constrains the membrane (i.e.
      limits the expansion of the pores) on hydration of the membrane
      varies depending on the identity of the cross-linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] As the hydration radius at which an ion cannot pass through
      the membrane is directly related to the d-spacing of the hydrated
      laminate membrane, the size exclusion selectivity of these classes
      of membranes can be tuned by selecting an appropriate cross-
      linking agent and/or graphene. Thus, a membrane, and particularly
      the cross-linking agent and/or graphene of which the membrane is
      comprised, may be selected dependent on the size of the ions which
      are being filtered.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The cross-linked membranes used in the methods of the
      invention exhibit improved rejection of salts (e.g. NaCI) relative
      to GO membranes which do not comprise a cross-linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Likewise, the graphene-GO (Gr-GO) composite membranes used
      in the methods of the invention exhibit improved rejection of
      salts (e.g. NaCI) relative to GO membranes which do not comprise
      graphene. Gr-GO membranes do not exhibit a significant reduction
      in water flux relative to GO membranes which do not comprise
      graphene.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Indeed, for certain applications, the graphene GO composite
      membranes are more effective at rejecting salts than cross-linked
      GO membranes. Despite the fact that graphene is less effective
      relative to many cross-linking agents at constraining the
      expansion of membranes on hydration, the two dimensional structure
      and more homogeneous distribution of graphene flakes through the
      membrane than the cross-linking agents give rise to higher salt
      rejection. It is believed that the areas of inhomogeneity in the
      cross-linked GO membranes give rise to lower salt rejection than
      expected based solely on the constraint the cross-linker applies
      to the pores of the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It may be that the graphene flakes represent from 0.5 wt%
      to 10 wt% of the flakes of which the graphene oxide laminate
      membrane is comprised. It may be that the graphene flakes
      represent from 1 wt% to 7.5 wt% of the flakes of which the
      graphene oxide laminate membrane is comprised. It may be that the
      graphene flakes represent from 2 wt% to 6 wt% of the flakes of
      which the graphene oxide laminate membrane is comprised. The
      inventors have found that the salt rejection properties of a GO
      composite are improved by the inclusion of as little as about 1
      wt% graphene. They have also found that when about 5wt% graphene
      is included, the permeation rates of salts drop by around three
      orders of magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that
      the inclusion of too much graphene in the GO laminate membranes
      can make them too brittle for practical use and can also lead to a
      loss of capillaries within the membranes meaning that water flux
      can be lower for larger amounts of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater
      than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the
      graphene flakes have a diameter of less than 10 μηι. It may be
      that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight,
      greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene flakes have
      a diameter of greater than 50 nm. It may be that greater than 50%
      by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or
      greater than 98%) of the graphene flakes have a diameter of less
      than 5 μηι. It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g.
      greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%)
      of the graphene flakes have a diameter of greater than 100 nm. It
      may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene
      flakes have a diameter of less than 1 μηι. It may be that greater
      than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight, greater than
      90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene flakes have a diameter of
      less than 500 nm. [0023] It may be that greater than 50% by weight
      (e.g. greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than
      98%) of the graphene has a thickness of from 1 to 10 atomic
      layers. It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater
      than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the
      graphene has a thickness of from 1 to 5 molecular layers. Thus, it
      may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene has
      a thickness of from 1 to 3 molecular layers. It may be that
      greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight,
      greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene is single
      layer graphene.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater
      than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the
      graphene oxide flakes have a diameter of less than 10 μηι. It may
      be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene
      oxide flakes have a diameter of greater than 50 nm. It may be that
      greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight,
      greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene oxide flakes
      have a diameter of less than 5 μηι. It may be that greater than
      50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90%
      or greater than 98%) of the graphene oxide flakes have a diameter
      of greater than 100 nm. It may be that greater than 50% by weight
      (e.g. greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than
      98%) of the graphene oxide flakes have a diameter of less than 2
      μηι. It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than
      75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the
      graphene oxide flakes have a diameter of less than 1 μηι. It may
      be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene
      oxide flakes have a diameter of less than 500 nm. It may be that
      greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight,
      greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene oxide flakes
      have a diameter of greater than 500 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater
      than 75% by weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the
      graphene oxide has a thickness of from 1 to 10 atomic layers. It
      may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene
      oxide has a thickness of from 1 to 5 molecular layers. Thus, it
      may be that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by
      weight, greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene
      oxide has a thickness of from 1 to 3 molecular layers. It may be
      that greater than 50% by weight (e.g. greater than 75% by weight,
      greater than 90% or greater than 98%) of the graphene oxide is
      single layer graphene oxide. [0026] The solutes which are depleted
      in the liquid have a hydration radius below a specific size
      exclusion limit. It may be that the size exclusion limit is in the
      range of from about 3.0 A to about 4.5 A. It may be that the size
      exclusion limit is in the range of from about 3.25 A to about 4.25
      A. It may be that the size exclusion limit is in the range of from
      about 3.5 A to about 4.0 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The size exclusion limit depends in part on the average
      spacing between the GO flakes, i.e. the height of the capillaries.
      This average spacing can be measured indirectly, using x-ray
      diffraction, as the d-spacing, which can be calculated from the
      x-ray diffraction peaks using Bragg's law. The d-spacing of a
      laminate membrane is effectively the sum of the thickness of the
      GO flake and the distance between the GO flakes. The observed d-
      spacing will be an average, the standard deviation of which will
      depend on the width of the x-ray diffraction peaks. The width of
      the x-ray diffraction peaks indicates how much variation there is
      in the thickness of the GO flake and the distance between the GO
      flakes. The x-ray diffraction peaks in cross-linked GO laminate
      membranes tend to be broader than those in non-cross-linked
      membranes, indicating that there is a greater variation in the
      capillary size.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] It may be that, when hydrated, the graphene oxide laminate
      membrane has a d- spacing below 12 A. The d-spacing of the
      hydrated graphene oxide laminate membrane may be below 11 A. The
      d-spacing of the hydrated graphene oxide laminate membrane may be
      below 10 A. The d-spacing of the hydrated graphene oxide laminate
      membrane may be below 9 A. The d-spacing of the hydrated graphene
      oxide laminate membrane may be below 8 A. The d-spacing of the
      hydrated graphene oxide laminate membrane may be below 7 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The inventors have observed empirically a relationship
      between the size exclusion limit and the d-spacing of the hydrated
      membrane. The capillary size of the hydrated membrane is the
      d-spacing minus the thickness of the GO flakes (typically between
      3 and 3.5 A). The size exclusion limit is typically about half the
      capillary size. Thus hydrated GO membranes with a d-spacing of
      between 12 and 13 have a capillary size of between about 9 and 9.5
      and a size exclusion cut off of about 4.5. Likewise, a hydrated
      GO-polyAMPS cross-linked membrane has a d-spacing of about 9.1 A,
      which would be expected to provide a capillary size of between
      about 5.5 and 6 A and a size exclusion of about 3. It has been
      observed that the GO-polyAMPS cross-linked membrane exhibits
      excellent rejection of NaCI (the hydration radius of Na is 3.58
      A).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In certain embodiments, the method is a process of
      selectively reducing the amount of a first set of one or more
      solutes in an aqueous mixture without significantly reducing the
      amount of a second set of one or more solutes in the aqueous
      mixture to produce a liquid depleted in said first set of solutes
      but not depleted in said second set of solutes. In these
      embodiments, the or each solute of the first set has a radius of
      hydration greater than the size exclusion limit and the or each
      solute of the second set has a radius of hydration less than the
      size exclusion limit.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] It may be that the method is continuous. Thus, steps a) and
      b) may be carried out simultaneously or substantially
      simultaneously. Steps a) and b) may also be carried out
      iteratively in a continuous process to enhance enrichment or
      iteratively in a batch process.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] It may be that the aqueous mixture is permitted to pass
      through the membrane by diffusion and / or it may be that a
      pressure is applied. Preferably, pressure is applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Preferably, no electrical potential is applied across the
      membrane. In principle, an electrical potential could be applied
      to modify the transport of ions through the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The graphene oxide laminate membrane is optionally
      supported on a porous material. This can provide structural
      integrity. In other words, the graphene oxide flakes may
      themselves form a layer e.g. a laminate which itself is associated
      with a porous support such as a porous membrane to form a further
      laminate structure. In this embodiment, the resulting structure is
      a laminate of graphene flakes mounted on the porous support. In
      one illustrative example, the graphene oxide laminate membrane may
      be sandwiched between layers of a porous material. The use of a
      porous support is particularly preferred where the graphene oxide
      laminate membrane also comprises graphene. Such membranes can be
      brittle.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] It may be that the graphene oxide flakes of which the
      laminate is comprised have an average oxygen:carbon weight ratio
      in the range of from 0.2:1.0 to 0.5: 1.0, e.g. from 0.25: 1.0 to
      0.45:1.0. Preferably, the flakes have an average oxygen:carbon
      weight ratio in the range of from 0.3: 1.0 to 0.4: 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The GO flakes which form the membranes may have been
      prepared by the oxidation of natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The term "solute" applies to both ions and counter-ions,
      and to uncharged molecular species present in the solution. Once
      dissolved in aqueous media a salt forms a solute comprising
      hydrated ions and counter-ions. The uncharged molecular species
      can be referred to as "non-ionic species". Examples of non-ionic
      species are small organic molecules such as aliphatic or aromatic
      hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene, benzene, hexane, etc), alcohols (e.g.
      methanol, ethanol, propanol, glycerol, etc), carbohydrates (e.g.
      sugars such as sucrose), and amino acids and peptides. The
      non-ionic species may or may not bind with water through hydrogen
      bonds. As will be readily apparent to the person skilled in the
      art, the term 'solute' does not encompass solid substances which
      are not dissolved in the aqueous mixture. Particulate matter will
      not pass through the membranes of the invention even if the
      particulate is comprised of ions with small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The term "hydration radius" refers to the effective radius
      of the molecule when solvated in aqueous media.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The reduction of the amount one or more selected solutes in
      the solution which is treated with the GO membrane of the present
      invention may entail entire removal of the or each selected
      solute. Alternatively, the reduction may not entail complete
      removal of a particular solute but simply a lowering of its
      concentration. The reduction may result in an altered ratio of the
      concentration of one or more solutes relative to the concentration
      of one or more other solutes. In cases in which salt is formed
      from one ion having a hydration radius of larger than the size
      exclusion limit and a counter-ion with a hydration radius below
      the size exclusion limit, neither ion will pass through the
      membrane of the invention because of the electrostatic attraction
      between the ions. Thus, for example, if an NaCI solution were
      passed through a membrane having a size exclusion limit of 3.5 A,
      the amount of both the Na+ ions (hydration radius: 3.58 A) and the
      CI- ions (hydration radius: 3.32 A) would be reduced, even though
      the CI&lt;"&gt;ions have a hydration radius below the size
      exclusion limit.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The precise value of the size exclusion limit for any given
      laminate membrane may vary depending on application. In the region
      around the size exclusion limit, the degree of transmission
      decreases by orders of magnitude and consequently the effective
      value of the size exclusion limit depends on the amount of
      transmission of solute that is acceptable for a particular
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The flakes of graphene oxide which are stacked to form the
      laminate of the invention are usually monolayer graphene oxide.
      However, it is possible to use flakes of graphene oxide containing
      from 2 to 10 atomic layers of carbon in each flake. These
      multilayer flakes are frequently referred to as "few-layer"
      flakes. Thus the membrane may be made entirely from monolayer
      graphene oxide flakes, from a mixture of monolayer and few-layer
      flakes, or from entirely few-layer flakes. Ideally, the flakes are
      entirely or predominantly, i.e. more than 75%w/w, monolayer
      graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The graphene oxide laminates used in the methods of the
      invention have the overall shape of a sheet-like material through
      which solutes having a size below a certain size exclusion limit
      may pass when the laminate is wet with an aqueous or aqueous-based
      mixture optionally containing one or more additional solvents
      (which may be miscible or immiscible with water). The solute may
      only pass provided it is of sufficiently small size. Thus the
      aqueous solution contacts one face or side of the membrane and
      purified solution is recovered from the other face or side of the
      membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The method may involve a plurality of cross-linked graphene
      oxide laminate membranes. These may be arranged in parallel (to
      increase the flux capacity of the process/device) or in series
      (where a reduction in the amount of one or more solute is achieved
      by a single laminate membrane but that reduction is less than
      desired).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness
      greater than about 100 nm, e.g. greater than about 500 nm, e.g. a
      thickness between about 500 nm and about 100 μηι. The graphene
      oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness up to about 50 μηι.
      The graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness greater
      than about 1 μηι, e.g. a thickness between 1 μηι and 15 μηι. Thus,
      the graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness of about
      5 μηι.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A cross linking agent is a substance which bonds with GO
      flakes in the laminate. The cross linking agent may form hydrogen
      bonds with GO flakes or it may form covalent bonds with GO flakes.
      Examples (which are included in some embodiments of the invention
      but which may be specifically excluded from other embodiments of
      the invention) include diamines (e.g. ethyl diamine, propyl
      diamine, phenylene diamine), polyallylamines and imidazole.
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these
      are examples of crosslinking agents which form hydrogen bonds with
      GO flakes. Other examples include borate ions and polyetherimides
      formed from capping the GO with polydopamine. Examples of
      appropriate cross linking systems can be found in Tian et al,
      (Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 2980-2983), An et al (Adv. Mater. 2011 ,
      23, 3842-3846), Hung et al (Cross-linking with Diamine monomers to
      Prepare Composite Graphene Oxide- Framework Membranes with Varying
      d-Spacing; Chemistry of Materials, 2014) and Park et al(Graphene
      Oxide Sheets Chemically Cross-Linked by polyallylamine; J. Phys.
      Chem. C; 2009).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The crosslinking agent may be a polymer. The polymer may be
      interspersed throughout the membrane. It may occupy the spaces
      between graphene oxide flakes, thus providing interlayer
      crosslinking. Examples (which are included in some embodiments of
      the invention but which may be specifically excluded from other
      embodiments of the invention) include PVA (see for example Li et
      al Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 3426-3431), poly(4- styrenesulfonate),
      Nafion, carboxymethyl cellulose, Chitosan, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
      polyaniline etc. A preferred polymer is
      poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid. It may be that
      the polymer is water soluble. Alternatively, it may be that the
      polymer is not water soluble. [0047] The cross-linking agent may
      be a charged polymer, e.g. one which comprises sulfonic acids or
      other ionisable functional groups. Exemplary charged polymers
      include poly(4-styrenesulfonate), Nafion and
      poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The cross-linking agent (e.g. polymer or charged polymer)
      may be present in an amount from about 0.1 to about 50 wt%, e.g.
      from about 5 to about 45 wt%. Thus, the GO laminate may comprise
      from about 2 to about 25 wt% cross-linking agent (e.g. polymer or
      charged polymer), the GO laminate may comprise up to about 20 wt%
      cross-linking agent (e.g. polymer or charged polymer).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The graphene flakes may be monolayer graphene flakes. They
      may be few-layer (i.e. 2-10 atomic layers, e.g. 3-7 atomic layers)
      graphene flakes. The graphene may be a reduced graphene oxide or
      partially oxidized graphene. Preferably, however, it is pristine
      graphene. The graphene may be pristine graphene with small holes
      in it. The defects in reduced graphene oxide or partially oxidized
      graphene or holes in pristine graphene can lead to higher fluxes.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The GO laminates may comprise other inorganic materials,
      e.g. other two dimensional materials, such as hBN, mica. The
      presence of mica, for example can slightly improve the mechanical
      properties of the GO laminate.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] It may be that, if present, the porous support is an
      inorganic material. Thus, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may
      comprise a ceramic. Preferably, the support is alumina, zeolite,
      or silica. In one embodiment, the support is alumina. Zeolite A
      can also be used. Ceramic membranes have also been produced in
      which the active layer is amorphous titania or silica produced by
      a sol-gel process.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] It may be that, if present, the porous support is a
      polymeric material. Thus, the porous support may thus be a porous
      polymer support, e.g. a flexible porous polymer support.
      Preferably it is PES, PTFE, PVDF or Cyclopore™ polycarbonate. In
      an embodiment, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a
      polymer. In an embodiment, the polymer may comprise a synthetic
      polymer. These can be used in the invention. Alternatively, the
      polymer may comprise a natural polymer or modified natural
      polymer. Thus, the polymer may comprise a polymer based on
      cellulose. The polymer support may be derived from a charged
      polymer such as one which contains sulfonic acids or other
      ionisable functional groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] It may be that, if present, the porous support (e.g.
      membrane) may comprise a carbon monolith.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In an embodiment, the porous support layer has a thickness
      of no more than a few tens of μηι, and ideally is less than about
      100 μηι. Preferably, it has a thickness of 50 μηι or less, more
      preferably of 10 μηι or less, and yet more preferably is less 5
      μηι. In some cases it may be less than about 1 μηι thick though
      preferably it is more than about 1 μηι.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Preferably, the thickness of the entire membrane (i.e. the
      graphene oxide laminate and the support, if present) is from about
      1 μηι to about 200 μηι, e.g. from about 5 μηι to about 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The porous support should be porous enough not to interfere
      with water transport but have small enough pores that graphene
      oxide platelets cannot enter the pores. Thus, the porous support
      must be water permeable. In an embodiment, the pore size must be
      less than 1 μηι. In an embodiment, the support has a uniform
      pore-structure. Examples of porous membranes with a uniform pore
      structure are electrochemically manufactured alumina membranes
      (e.g. those with the trade names: Anopore™, Anodisc™).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The one or more solutes can be ions and/or they could be
      neutral organic species, e.g. sugars, hydrocarbons etc. Where the
      solutes are ions they may be cations and/or they may be anions.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In certain preferred embodiments, the solutes are
      Na&lt;+&gt;ions and/or CI&lt;"&gt;ions. Thus the method may be a
      method of desalination (i.e. a method of reducing the amount of
      NaCI in an aqueous mixture).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In a third aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      reducing the amount of one or more predetermined solutes having a
      hydration radius in the range of from about 3.5 A to about 4.5 A
      in an aqueous mixture to produce a liquid depleted in the<br>
      <br>
      predetermined solutes, the method comprising;<br>
      <br>
      a) determining the identity of one or more solutes in the aqueous
      mixture which are to be selected for exclusion by the membrane;<br>
      <br>
      b) correlating the required d-spacing in the graphene oxide
      membrane with the hydration radius of the or each predetermined
      solute;<br>
      <br>
      c) forming a graphene oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes
      and also comprising monolayer or few layer graphene flakes and/or
      at least one cross linking agent and having a reduced d-spacing
      relative to a membrane which does not comprise the cross-linking
      agent;<br>
      <br>
      d) contacting a first face of a graphene oxide laminate membrane
      with the aqueous mixture comprising one or more solutes; and<br>
      <br>
      e) recovering the liquid from or downstream from a second face of
      the membrane. [0060] It may be that steps d) and e) are performed
      continuously. Thus, steps d) and e) may be carried out
      simultaneously or substantially simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In a fourth aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      tuning the d-spacing of a cross-linked graphene oxide laminate
      size exclusion filtration membrane, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a) selecting at least one cross-linking agent and/or monolayer or
      few layer graphene flakes which provides a membrane having a
      desired capillary size when the membrane is hydrated; and<br>
      <br>
      b) forming a graphene oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes
      and also comprising monolayer or few layer graphene flakes and/or
      the at least one cross linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In a fifth aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      limiting the d-spacing of a hydrated graphene oxide laminate size
      exclusion filtration membrane to below 12 A, the method
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      forming a graphene oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes
      and also comprising monolayer or few layer graphene flakes and/or
      at least one cross linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The cross-linking agent is solubilised by reference to
      cross-linking agents that have been determined experimentally to
      provide the required d-spacing or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In a sixth aspect of the invention is provided the use of
      monolayer or few layer graphene flakes and/or at least one cross
      linking agent to limit the d-spacing of a hydrated graphene oxide
      laminate size exclusion filtration membrane to below 12 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Suitable cross-linking agents and the means for determining
      them are described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In a seventh aspect of the invention is provided a graphene
      oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes and a charged polymer
      (e.g. poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl- 1-propanesulfonic acid) as a
      cross-linking agent. The charged polymer may be one which
      comprises sulfonic acids or other ionisable functional groups.
      Exemplary charged polymers include poly(4-styrenesulfonate),
      Nafion and poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1- propanesulfonic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In an eighth aspect of the invention is provided a graphene
      oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes and at least one
      cross linking agent and having, when hydrated, a reduced pore size
      relative to a hydrated graphene oxide membrane which does not
      comprise the cross-linking agent, and wherein the pore size in the
      hydrated membrane is operative to substantially exclude at least
      the passage of solutes having a hydration radius in the range of
      from about 3.5A to about 4.5A when present in an aqueous mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In a ninth aspect of the invention is provided a graphene
      oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes and monolayer or few
      layer graphene flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In a tenth aspect of the invention is provided a method of
      producing a graphene oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes
      and graphene flakes, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a) providing a suspension of graphite flakes and graphite oxide
      flakes in an aqueous medium;<br>
      <br>
      b) subjecting the graphite flakes and graphite oxide flakes in the
      aqueous medium to energy to obtain an aqueous suspension
      comprising graphene flakes and graphene oxide flakes;<br>
      <br>
      c) optionally removing any graphite, graphite oxide or undesired
      few-layered graphene/graphene oxide flakes from the suspension;
      and<br>
      <br>
      d) filtering the suspension through a porous material to provide a
      graphene oxide laminate membrane comprising GO flakes and graphene
      flakes, the laminate membrane being supported on the porous
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The energy applied in step (b) may be sonic energy. The
      sonic energy may be ultrasonic energy. It may be delivered in
      using a bath sonicator or a tip sonicator.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively the energy may be a mechanical energy, e.g. shear
      force energy or grinding. The particles may be subjected to energy
      (e.g. sonic energy) for a length of time from 15 min to 1 week,
      depending on the properties and proportions (flake diameter and
      thickness) desired. The particles may be subjected to energy (e.g.
      sonic energy) for a length of time from 1 to 4 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Where the desired laminate membrane also comprises
      cross-linkng agents, these will be present in the aqueous medium
      prior to filtration. They may be present in the suspension of
      graphite and graphite oxide or they may be added after step b) or,
      if present, step c).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The term 'aqueous medium' can be understood to mean a
      liquid which contains water, e.g. which contains greater than 20%
      by volume water. The aqueous medium may contain more than 50% by
      volume water, e.g. more than 75% by volume water or more than 95%
      by volume water. The aqueous medium may also comprise solutes or
      suspended particles and other solvents (which may or may not be
      miscible with water). The aqueous medium may comprise additives
      which may be ionic, organic or amphiphillic. Examples of such
      additives include surfactants, viscosity modifiers, pH modifiers,
      iconicity modifiers, and dispersants. It may be however that the
      aqueous medium consists essentially of water, graphite and
      graphite oxide and optionally one or more cross-linking agents<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The step of reducing the amount of multilayered particles
      in the suspension may comprise using a centrifuge.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Graphene oxide is able to stabilise graphene flakes in an
      aqueous medium, similarly to the action of various surfactants.
      Thus, once the graphite oxide has been exfoliated, the thus formed
      graphene oxide flakes encourage the exfoliation of the graphite
      into graphene flakes and/or stabilise the graphene flakes ocne
      they have been exfoliated. Smaller GO flakes are more effective
      dispersants than larger GO flakes (e.g. less than 1 μηι or less
      than 500 nm).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Typically, the exfoliation of graphite oxide is more
      efficient than the exfoliation of graphite. Thus, the starting
      suspension might contain more graphite than graphite oxide.
      Indeed, the ratio of graphite to graphite oxide may be larger than
      that desired in the product membrane. For example, the inventors
      have found that a weight ratio of 9:1 graphite: graphite oxide
      mixture gives rise to a membrane which is 5.5 wt% graphene.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In an eleventh aspect of the invention is provided a
      filtration device comprising a membrane of the seventh, eighth or
      ninth aspects of the invention. The filtration device may be a
      filter assembly or it may be a removable and replaceable filter
      for use in a filter assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In certain embodiments, it may be that the cross-linking
      agent is not selected from: diamine; pollyallylamine; imidazole;
      borate ions; polyetherimides formed from capping GO with
      polypodamine; PVA; poly(4-styrenesulfonate); Nafion, caboxymethyl
      cellulose; chitosan; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and polyaniline. This
      applies in particular to the third to eighth aspects of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In any of the third to tenth aspects of the invention, it
      may be that the graphene oxide laminate membrane has a thickness
      greater than about 100 nm. Likewise, it may be that the graphene
      oxide flakes of which the laminate is comprised have an average
      oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the range of from 0.2: 1.0 to 0.5:
      1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Where not mutually exclusive, any of the embodiments
      described above in relation to the first and/or second aspects of
      the invention apply equally to one or more of the second to
      eleventh aspects of the invention.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0081] The present invention involves the use of graphene oxide
      laminate membranes. The graphene oxide laminates and laminate
      membranes of the invention comprise stacks of individual graphene
      oxide flakes, in which the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide. Although the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide, it is within the scope of this invention that some
      of the graphene oxide is present as two- or few-layer graphene
      oxide. Thus, it may be that at least 75% by weight of the graphene
      oxide is in the form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes, or it may
      be that at least 85% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes (e.g. at least 95 %, for
      example at least 99% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes) with the remainder made
      up of two- or few- layer graphene oxide. Without wishing to be
      bound by theory, it is believed that water and solutes pass
      through capillary-like pathways formed between the graphene oxide
      flakes by diffusion and that the specific structure of the
      graphene oxide laminate membranes leads to the remarkable
      selectivity observed as well as the remarkable speed at which the
      ions permeate through the laminate structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Graphene oxide flakes are two dimensional heterogeneous
      macromolecules containing both hydrophobic 'graphene' regions and
      hydrophilic regions with large amounts of oxygen functionality
      (e.g. epoxide, carboxylate groups, carbonyl groups, hydroxyl
      groups)<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In one illustrative example, the graphene oxide laminate
      membranes are made of impermeable functionalized graphene sheets
      that have a typical size L «1 μηι and the interlayer separation,
      d, sufficient to accommodate a mobile layer of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The solutes to be removed from aqueous mixtures in the
      methods of the present invention may be defined in terms of their
      hydrated radius. Below are the hydrated radii of some exemplary
      ions and molecules.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1</b><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="table1.JPG" alt="table1" width="422"
          height="537"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      [0085] The hydrated radii of many species are available in the
      literature. However, for some species the hydrated radii may not
      be available. The radii of many species are described in terms of
      their Stokes radius and typically this information will be
      available where the hydrated radius is not. For example, of the
      above species, there exist no literature values for the hydrated
      radius of propanol, sucrose, glycerol and PTS&lt;4"&gt;. The
      hydrated radii of these species which are provided in the table
      above have been estimated using their Stokes/crystal radii. To
      this end, the hydrated radii for a selection of species in which
      this value was known can be plotted as a function of the Stokes
      radii for those species and this yields a simple linear
      dependence. Hydrated radii for propanol, sucrose, glycerol and
      PTS&lt;4"&gt;were then estimated using the linear dependence and
      the known Stokes radii of those species.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] There are a number of methods described in the literature
      for the calculation of hydration radii. Examples are provided in
      'Determination of the effective hydrodynamic radii of small
      molecules by viscometry'; Schultz and Soloman; The Journal of
      General<br>
      <br>
      Physiology; 44; 1 189-1 199 (1963); and 'Phenomenological Theory
      of Ion Solvation'; E. R. Nightingale. J. Phys. Chem. 63, 1381
      (1959).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The term 'aqueous mixture' refers to any mixture of
      substances which comprises at least 10% water by weight. It may
      comprise at least 50% water by weight and preferably comprises at
      least 80% water by weight, e.g. at least 90% water by weight. The
      mixture may be a solution, a suspension, an emulsion or a mixture
      thereof. Typically the aqueous mixture will be an aqueous solution
      in which one or more solutes are dissolved in water. This does not
      exclude the possibility that there might be particulate matter,
      droplets or micelles suspended in the solution. Of course, it is
      expected that the particulate matter will not pass through the
      membranes of the invention even if it is comprised of ions with
      small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Particularly preferred solutes for removing from water
      include hydrocarbons and oils, biological material, dyes, organic
      compounds (including halogenated organic compounds), complex ions,
      NaCI, heavy metals, ethanol, chlorates and perchlorates and
      radioactive elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The graphene oxide or graphite oxide for use in this
      application can be made by any means known in the art. In a
      preferred method, graphite oxide can be prepared from graphite
      flakes (e.g. natural graphite flakes) by treating them with
      potassium<br>
      <br>
      permanganate and sodium nitrate in concentrated sulphuric acid.
      This method is called Hummers method. Another method is the Brodie
      method, which involves adding potassium chlorate (KCIO3) to a
      slurry of graphite in fuming nitric acid. For a review see, Dreyer
      et al. The chemistry of graphene oxide, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39,
      228-240.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Individual graphene oxide (GO) sheets can then be
      exfoliated by dissolving graphite oxide in water or other polar
      solvents with the help of ultrasound, and bulk residues can then
      be removed by centrifugation and optionally a dialysis step to
      remove additional salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In a specific embodiment, the graphene oxide of which the
      graphene oxide laminate membranes of the invention are comprised
      is not formed from wormlike graphite. Worm-like graphite is
      graphite that has been treated with concentrated sulphuric acid
      and hydrogen peroxide at 1000 °C to convert graphite into an
      expanded "worm-like" graphite. When this worm-like graphite
      undergoes an oxidation reaction it exhibits a higher increase the
      oxidation rate and efficiency (due to a higher surface area
      available in expanded graphite as compared to pristine graphite)
      and the resultant graphene oxide contains more oxygen functional
      groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite.
      Laminate membranes formed from such highly functionalized graphene
      oxide can be shown to have a wrinkled surface topography and
      lamellar structure (Sun et al,; Selective Ion Penetration of
      Graphene Oxide Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013) which differs
      from the layered structure observed in laminate membranes formed
      from graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite. Such membranes
      do not show fast ion permeation of small ions and a selectivity
      which is substantially unrelated to size (being due rather to
      interactions between solutes and the graphene oxide functional
      groups) compared to laminate membranes formed from graphene oxide
      prepared from natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The preparation of graphene oxide laminate supported on a
      porous membrane can be achieved using filtration, spray coating,
      casting, dip coating techniques, road coating, inject printing, or
      any other thin film coating techniques<br>
      <br>
      [0093] For large scale production of supported graphene based
      membranes or sheets it is preferred to use spray coating, road
      coating or inject printing techniques. One benefit of spray
      coating is that spraying GO solution in water on to the porous
      support material at an elevated temperature produces a large
      uniform GO film.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Graphite oxide consists of micrometer thick stacked
      graphite oxide flakes (defined by the starting graphite flakes
      used for oxidation, after oxidation it gets expanded due to the
      attached functional groups) and can be considered as a
      polycrystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Exfoliation of graphite oxide in water into individual graphene
      oxide flakes was achieved by the sonication technique followed by
      centrifugation at 10000 rpm to remove few layers and thick flakes.
      Graphene oxide laminates were formed by restacking of these single
      or few layer graphene oxides by a number of different techniques
      such as spin coating, spray coating, road coating and vacuum
      filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Graphene oxide membranes according to the invention consist
      of overlapped layers of randomly oriented single layer graphene
      oxide sheets with smaller dimensions (due to sonication). These
      membranes can be considered as centimetre size single crystals
      (grains) formed by parallel graphene oxide sheets. Due to this
      difference in layered structure, the atomic structure of the
      capillary structure of graphene oxide membranes and graphite oxide
      are different. For graphene oxide membranes the edge functional
      groups are located over the non-functionalised regions of another
      graphene oxide sheet while in graphite oxide mostly edges are
      aligned over another graphite oxide edge. These differences
      unexpectedly may influence the permeability properties of graphene
      oxide membranes as compared to those of graphite oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] A layer of graphene consists of a sheet of
      sp&lt;2&gt;-hybridized carbon atoms. Each carbon atom is
      covalently bonded to three neighboring carbon atoms to form a<br>
      <br>
      'honeycomb' network of tessellated hexagons. Carbon nanostructures
      which have more than 10 graphene layers (i.e. 10 atomic layers;
      3.5 nm interlayer distance) generally exhibit properties more
      similar to graphite than to mono-layer graphene. Thus, throughout
      this specification, the term graphene is intended to mean a carbon
      nanostructure with up to 10 graphene layers. A graphene layer can
      be considered to be a single sheet of graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In the context of this disclosure the term graphene is
      intended to encompass both pristine graphene (i.e.
      un-functionalised or substantially un-functionalised graphene) and
      reduced graphene oxide. When graphene oxide is reduced a graphene
      like substance is obtained which retains some of the oxygen
      functionality of the graphene oxide. It may be however that the
      term 'graphene' is excludes both graphene oxide and reduced
      graphene oxide and thus is limited to pristine graphene. All
      graphene contains some oxygen, dependent on the oxygen content of
      the graphite from which is it derived. It may be that the term
      'graphene' encompasses graphene that comprises up to 10% oxygen by
      weight, e.g. less than 8% oxygen by weight or less than 5% oxygen
      by weight. .<br>
      <br>

      specification, the words "comprise" and "contain" and variations
      of them mean "including but not limited to", and they are not
      intended to (and do not) exclude other moieties, additives,
      components, integers or steps. Throughout the description and
      claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural

      <b>EXAMPLE 1 - Cross-linked GO laminate membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      [00101] Graphite oxide was prepared from natural graphite through
      modified Hummer's method using sulphuric acid and potassium
      permanganate. The graphite oxide was then dispersed in water by
      ultrasonication to obtain the stable aqueous graphene oxide (GO)
      dispersion. The unexfoliated graphite oxide and few layer graphene
      oxide flakes were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant
      containing the single layer GO sheets was used for the membrane
      preparation. Then, a cross linker selected from poly vinyl alcohol
      (PVA), ethylenediamine (EDA), poly (styrene-4-sulfonate) (PSS),
      poly Allylamine (PAA) and
      poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (poly AMPS)
      (20% with respect to the weight of the GO present in solution) was
      dissolved in GO suspension and left for overnight stirring at room
      temperature. By adjusting the volume of each solution, GO-PVA,
      GO-EDA, GO-PSS, GO-PAA and GO-polyAMPS membranes of thicknesses ~
      500 nm, were prepared on the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane
      (diameter of 47 mm with pore size ~ 0.2 μηι) using vacuum
      filtration. The membranes were dried in a vacuum desiccator in
      prior to use for the pressure filtration experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to measure the
      inter-layer d spacing (capillary width) of the GO membranes. The
      d-spacing values are calculated from the peak position in XRD
      pattern using Bragg's law ηλ = 2d sinO. For XRD experiments,
      GO-PVA, GO-EDA, GO-PSS, GO-PAA and GO-polyAMPS membranes (of
      thickness ~ 5 μηι) are prepared by vacuum filtration of each
      solution through Anodisc alumina membranes with a pore size of
      0.02 μηι. These membranes were dried under vacuum to peel a free
      standing GO membrane with different linker molecules for the XRD
      measurements. Bruker D8-Discover X-ray diffractometer was used to
      estimate the d-spacing of the fabricated free standing membranes
      in both dry and wet states. XRD pattern (5 &lt; 2Θ &lt; 25) of the
      each free standing membrane was obtained at room temperature and
      room humidity and left these membranes in water for 24 hrs.
      Further, the XRD measurements were conducted on soaked membranes
      in the same 2Θ range to estimate the swelling effect. From the XRD
      measurements of all the GO membranes with different linker
      molecules, GO-polyAMPS membrane has shown very small increase in
      the d-spacing from 8.6 A (in dry state) to 9.1 A (in wet state).<br>
      <br>
      [00103] In the present study, we have used Sterlitech HP4750
      stirred cell for pressure filtration experiments. Various GO
      membranes with different linkers prepared on the PES were placed
      in the pressure filtration cell with a porous metal support and
      performed the pressure filtration experiments for 2 mg/ml MgC and
      NaCI solutions by applying 26 bar pressure using a compressed gas
      cylinder. The solution permeated through the membranes was
      collected from the permeate tube fixed to the pressure filtration
      cell. Among all the GO membranes with different linkers,
      GO-polyAMPS membrane has shown flux rate of 10 L
      nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;with a salt rejection ~ 50%. The data
      obtained is shown in figures 1 to 6.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 2 - Graphene oxide/graphene composite laminate
        membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      [00104] 250 mg of graphite oxide (prepared as in Example 1) and
      125 mg of pristine graphite powder were sonicated in 250 ml of Dl
      water for 24 hrs to prepare a Gr-GO dispersion. The Gr-GO
      suspension was then centrifuged at 2500 rpm to remove the
      unexfoliated graphite oxide and graphite particles with the
      supernatant containing the mono and few layers of GO and graphene
      flakes (this sample was denoted as denoted as Gr-GO-2500). In this
      method, graphene oxide helps exfoliated graphene to disperse in
      water to form a stable aqueous suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [00105] Gr-GO membranes were prepared by vacuum filtration of
      Gr-GO dispersion through an Anodisc membrane filter (47 mm in
      diameter, 0.2 mm pore size) similarly to the method described in
      Example 1. Gr-GO membranes with Anodisc support were glued onto
      copper plates which exposes an effective area of ~ 1 cm&lt;2&gt;of
      the membrane. The copper plate was then placed in a permeation
      setup containing the feed and permeates compartments. In a typical
      experiment, feed compartment filled with 1 M aqueous solution of
      various salts and the permeate compartment was filled with Dl
      water and kept undisturbed for 24 hrs. Inductively coupled plasma
      optical emission spectroscopy (ICP- OES) was used to find the ion
      species concentration in the permeate cell. Also these results
      were cross checked by carefully weighing the left over material
      after the evaporation of water in permeate compartment. It is
      found that the permeation rate for Mg&lt;+2&gt;and Na&lt;+&gt;ions
      for the Gr-GO membrane is ~ 2 x 10&lt;"3&gt;and 3 x
      10&lt;"3&gt;mol/h/m&lt;2&gt;which is 1000 times smaller when
      compared to that of the GO laminate membrane which does not
      comprise graphene or a cross-linking agent. In another permeation
      experiment with GO- polyAMPS, the permeation rate of
      Mg&lt;+2&gt;ions found to be ~ 1 x 10&lt;"2&gt;mol/h/m&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [00106] The amount of graphene present in the Gr-GO suspension can
      be controlled by centrifuging the dispersion obtained from
      sonication of the graphite and graphite oxide mixture at differing
      speeds. Thus, samples obtained from sonication of the graphite and
      graphite oxide mixture as described above were centrifuged at
      5000, 7500 and 10000 rpm and the resultant suspension was formed
      into a laminate membrane as described above. From the permeation
      experiments with Gr-GO membranes made of the Gr-GO dispersion
      centrifuged at 5000, 7500 and 10000 rpm (denoted as Gr-GO-5000,
      Gr-GO-7500 and Gr- GO-10000), it was found that permeation rate of
      the Mg&lt;+2&gt;ions (given in the table below) increased for
      Gr-GO membranes prepared with the Gr-GO dispersion centrifuged at
      higher speeds. Permeation rate of Mg&lt;+2&gt;ions in the
      GO/graphene-10000 is 10 times more than that of in the
      GO/graphene-2500. It is expected that lower centrifugation rates
      result in a higher proportion of the membrane containing few layer
      graphene too.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 3 - Graphene oxide/graphene composite laminate
        membranes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00107] Further, four different concentrations of Gr-GO aqueous
      dispersions were prepared by exfoliating the graphite flakes and
      graphite oxide in the weight ratio (graphite oxide/graphite) of 1
      : 1 , 1 :2, 1 :5 and 1 :9. 0.175 g of graphite oxide was sonicated
      in 120 ml deionised water along with different weights of graphite
      flakes varying as 0.175 g, 0.35 g, 0.875 g and 1.575 g for 50 hrs.
      Supernatant of the resulting dispersion was collected after few
      hours to avoid the unexfoliated graphite and unstable aggregates
      which settles down gradually. Subsequently, the supernatant was
      centrifuged twice for 25 mins at 2500 g to obtain the homogenous
      Gr-GO aqueous dispersion containing mono and few layers GO and
      graphene flakes. The Gr-GO membranes were prepared by vacuum
      filtration of Gr- GO dispersion through an Anodisc membrane filter
      (47 mm diameter, 0.02 μηι pore size) and dried in a vacuum
      desiccator.<br>
      <br>
      [00108] For the permeation experiments, Gr-GO membranes with
      Anodisc support were glued onto copper plates in such a way that
      an effective area of ~ 1 cm&lt;2&gt;of the membrane is exposed
      [15]. A typical permeation experiment was carried out for 24 hrs
      by fixing the membrane attached copper plate in a permeation setup
      where feed compartment filled with 1 M aqueous solution of various
      salts (KCI, NaCI, LiCI and MgC ) and the permeate compartment was
      filled with deionised water. Inductively coupled plasma optical
      emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to find the ion species
      concentration in the permeate cell and these results were cross
      checked by carefully weighing the left over material after the
      evaporation of water in permeate compartment.<br>
      <br>
      [00109] Fig. 8a shows the optical photograph of 100 μg/ml
      concentrated GO and Gr-GO aqueous colloidal suspensions with
      increasing wt% of graphene (from left to right). The pale brown
      coloured GO suspension gradually turns into dark with increasing
      initial amount of graphite starting material which suggests the
      increased amount of exfoliated graphene in Gr-GO dispersions in
      the case of higher initial graphite content. Weight of graphite
      oxide is kept constant and varied the initial weight of graphite
      flakes for preparation of each solution in order to estimate the
      actual wt% of graphene exfoliated into GO suspension. Fig. 8b
      shows the concentration and actual wt% of exfoliated graphene in
      GO and Gr-GO dispersions as a function of initial graphite
      oxide/graphite weight ratio. Three membranes (GO and Gr-GO)
      prepared from the known amount of volume of each dispersion were
      carefully weighed using '^g" precision microbalance to determine
      the concentration of GO and Gr-GO dispersions. Subsequently,
      actual wt% of exfoliated graphite in the different Gr- GO
      dispersion is estimated from the concentration values and found
      that ~ 5.5 wt%, 4.2 wt%, 2.2 wt% and 1.3 wt% of exfoliated
      graphene (with respect to the weight of GO) is present in the
      membranes made from the Gr-GO dispersions of 1 :9, 1 :5, 1 :2 and
      1 : 1 initial graphite oxide/graphite ratio, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [001 10] X-ray diffraction technique has been used to analyse the
      changes in the interlayer spacing of GO and Gr-GO membranes in
      both dry and wet states. In the dry state, both pristine GO and
      Gr-GO membranes show similar (001) diffraction peak at ~ 10.5±0.5°
      indicating similar laminar structures for both the membranes. To
      determine the swelling behaviour, GO and Gr-GO membranes were
      soaked for a day in deionised water. As expected, the interlayer
      spacing (-8.4 A in dry state) of GO membrane increased to 14 A
      after soaking. In contrast to the GO membranes, Gr-GO membranes
      having a higher wt% of exfoliated graphene flakes have shown less
      swelling. For example, the interlayer spacing of Gr-GO membranes
      with 5.5 wt% and 2.2 wt% of exfoliated graphene is respectively ~
      10.3 A and 11.4 A in the wet state. This indicates that
      incorporation of exfoliated graphene in the GO membrane controls
      the swelling of GO membrane by controlling the amount of water in
      the interlayer space. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this
      could be due to the more hydrophobic nature of exfoliated graphene
      which lowers the amount of water in the interlayer spaces of the
      membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [001 11] Homogeneity of the Gr-GO membranes was further confirmed
      by the SEM investigations. Fig. 7a and 7b show the cross-sectional
      and in-plain SEM image of Gr-GO membrane respectively.
      Distribution of exfoliated graphite (flaky features in Fig.7b) in
      the membrane is found to be very uniform and they are shown to be
      assembled in a layered structure. Fig. 7c shows the schematic
      structure of layered structure of Gr-GO membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [001 12] Fig. 8d summarizes the permeation rate for different ions
      (K&lt;+&gt;, Na&lt;+&gt;, Li&lt;+&gt;and Mg&lt;+2&gt;) through the
      GO and Gr-GO membranes made from 1 :2 and 1 :9 dispersions. From
      Fig. 8d, it is apparent that the value of permeation rate observed
      for Mg&lt;+2&gt;ions through Gr-GO membrane made of 1 :9
      dispersion is ~ 1000 times smaller than the permeation rate
      through pristine GO membrane. This can be explained by the lesser
      swelling effect in 1 :9 Gr-GO membrane with respect to the
      pristine GO membrane. Interlayer distance of 1 :9 Gr- GO membrane
      increases to 10 A, whereas it is 14 A for the pristine GO membrane
      after soaking in water. Similarly, significant decrease (~ 100 to
      1000 times) in the permeation rate for K&lt;+&gt;, Na&lt;+&gt;and
      Li&lt;+&gt;ions is observed in the case of 1 :9 Gr-GO membranes.
      The water permeation rate through GO and Gr-GO membrane has also
      been measured by monitoring the osmotic height difference and it
      was found that addition of graphene to GO membrane did not change
      the osmotic height difference, indicating similar water permeation
      rate for both GO and Gr-GO membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [001 13] NaCI salt rejection properties of 1 :9 Gr-GO membranes
      were further measured using forward osmosis technique by keeping
      concentrated sugar solution as a draw solute. Salt rejection was
      calculated using the equation 1-Cp/Cf where Cpis the concentration
      of NaCI in transmitted water and Cf is the concentration of NaCI
      in feed side. This analysis yields 96% salt rejection for the 1 :9
      Gr-GO membranes. The salt rejection of GO only membranes is around
      70%.<br>
