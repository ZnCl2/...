      <div align="center"><big><b>The brace that puts a smile on your
            face</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A "beautifying" brace that fixes faces instead of teeth has been
      launched in the UK.<br>
      <br>
      The device fits in the mouth and places a load on the facial
      muscles, improving tone and circulation.<br>
      <br>
      Wearers have reported remarkable anti-ageing effects, including
      reduced lines and eye bags, more prominent cheekbones, smoother
      skin, and a firmer jaw line.<br>
      <br>
      The "Oralift" brace is even said to improve hair quality and
      increase fullness of the lips.<br>
      <br>
      Inventor Dr Nick Mohindra, a dentist based in Wimpole Street,
      London, developed the Oralift over five years.<br>
      <br>
      It emerged from work he carried out pioneering the "dental
      facelift" which involves altering the height of the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      A research paper published in the British Dental Journal in 2002
      showed that 80 per cent of patients given the "facelift" were
      judged to look between five and 20 years younger.<br>
      <br>
      <i>No dental procedures required</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Unlike this technique the Oralift requires no dental procedures,
      such as the fitting of crowns.<br>
      <br>
      The tailor-made device is designed to increase the gap between the
      upper and lower teeth - known as the "free-way space" - which is
      usually no more than three millimetres.<br>
      <br>
      Separating the teeth with the Oralift forces the facial muscles to
      adapt to a new "free way space".<br>
      <br>
      This sets off a series of responses, including boosting the flow
      of blood and oxygen to the muscles of the face and neck, and
      triggering healing processes.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mohindra, of Added Dimension Dentistry said: "Orthodontic
      braces are often associated with gawky, self-conscious teenagers
      who are afraid to smile because they feel so unattractive.<br>
      <br>
      "It's funny to think of the Oralift as a brace that beautifies,
      but that's what it is. Here we have a simple device, worn in the
      mouth, that can turn an ugly duckling into a swan.<br>
      <br>
      "People spend a fortune on cosmetic surgery, which doesn't always
      have the desired result and can occasionally prove disastrous.
      Oralift sculpts the face without the need of a scalpel, using the
      body's own natural healing processes, and is completely safe."<br>
      <br>
      The appliance can be worn only at night, when it works passively,
      or during the day and while eating, said Dr Mohindra.<br>
      <br>
      Daytime use involves "active exercise" and loads the facial
      muscles even more. Other forms of active facial exercise include
      talking, laughing, grimacing and chewing.<br>
      <br>
      At Â£2,500, the Oralift is not cheap, though it is said to last a
      lifetime. One patient who can afford it is Janan Harb, 58, wife of
      the late King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.<br>
      <br>
      Quoted on Dr Mohindra's website, www.oralift.com, she said: "This
      treatment has given me back my youthful look and restored the
      vitality to my face. It is amazing."<br>

          rejuvenated her looks</i><br>

      <br>
      At the age of 46, I've done a lot to try to turn back the clock on
      my looks. I've been Botoxed, filled and lasered, had my skin
      peeled and had painful light treatments. But I've never tried
      anything quite like Oralift.<br>
      <br>
      For a start, I'm sitting in the dentist's chair - not a spot I
      normally associate with anti-ageing treatments.<br>
      <br>
      And secondly, I'm being fitted for a decidedly unglamorous small
      plastic mouthguard. <br>
      <br>
      Yet according to London-based dentist Dr Nick Mohindra, who
      invented the Oralift, this unprepossessing item has the power to
      resculpt my face, making it younger and prettier, with plumper
      cheeks, fuller lips and a nicer, wider, more even smile.<br>
      <br>
      It could even, he says, make my piggily-small eyes wider and
      eliminate the hollows under them. <br>
      <br>
      The Oralift, he says, can tighten my jawline, soften nose-to-mouth
      lines, tone my facial muscles and get rid of that turkey wattle on
      my neck.<br>
      <br>
      It can even make faces more oval and more symmetrical.<br>
      <br>
      Nor do the claims stop there. Mohindra says that many of his
      clients who wear the Oralift mouthguard for just an hour or two a
      day, once every three days, report clearer skin, vanishing thread
      veins and crow's feet that fade away.<br>
      <br>
      What's more, according to Mohindra, the benefits last pretty much
      for ever.<br>
      <br>
      He says clients start looking younger very quickly - sometimes in
      just days - reach a peak of youthfulness after three years of use,
      and carry on looking younger than the day they walked into his
      surgery for seven years.<br>
      <br>
      Then, when ageing does finally set in, patients have a seven-year
      head start on their peers.<br>
      <br>
      Keep using the miracle mouthguard, he says, and you can stay
      younger-looking for decades.<br>
      <br>
      Sound a bit too much like a snake oil salesman for your liking?<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="oralift.jpg" height="211"

      <br>
      Miracle-working mouthpiece: It is claimed the Oralift will make
      you look younger and prettier<br>
      <br>
      Well, it's certainly a pretty big claim to make for such a small
      thing, and I have to admit to feeling pretty sceptical -
      especially when I see the device that is supposed to achieve all
      this.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift is really a basic plastic mouthguard.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mohindra pops it into the microwave for a few seconds to soften
      it, then fits it to my bottom teeth as it cools.<br>
      <br>
      But this device has a 'secret'. It wears a little platform shoe -
      a tiny block of plastic - that is claimed to be the real secret of
      its success.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mohindra believes that many of us look older, plainer and more
      tired as we get old because we lose lower facial 'height'.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, the depth of our face from nose to chin is reduced
      as we age. Think of the collapsed, 'gurning' appearance of an old
      person with no teeth.<br>
      <br>
      A modified version of this look comes to most of us, he says, just
      through the ageing process. We grind our teeth, or simply wear
      them down with eating.<br>
      <br>
      This reduces the height of the bottom third of our face, from nose
      to chin. As someone who has been grinding their teeth in their
      sleep for years, especially when busy and stressed, I feel
      suddenly rather panicky about my poor shredded teeth.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift - which costs from Â£575, including fitting - helps us
      learn to separate our back teeth, putting the height back in our
      face.<br>
      <br>
      When we are relaxed, we tend to have what dentists call a 'freeway
      space' between our back teeth of between one and three
      millimetres.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift gradually stretches and activates facial muscles to
      increase that freeway space to between five and ten millimetres.<br>
      <br>
      As the stretching begins, the facial muscles instantly experience
      small amounts of stress, which, says Dr Mohindra, triggers them to
      release proteins that increase the amount of collagen around the
      muscle fibres.<br>
      <br>
      There is an instant increase in blood flow and oxygen to the skin,
      too, making it brighter and healthier.<br>
      <br>
      As we age, our faces lose volume, especially from under our eyes
      and our cheeks. It is this loss of volume, not gravity, that makes
      our skin become loose. Instead of a tight 'triangle of youth' -
      with the point being our narrow chin and the widest point our
      cheekbones - we develop a reversed ageing triangle, with thin
      cheeks and wide, saggy jowls.<br>
      <br>
      This change has been well-documented, but in cosmetic medicine the
      sole focus has been on the fat we lose from our cheeks, and how it
      can be replaced with synthetic fillers.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mohindra believes he can get the same result, or even better,
      by using the Oralift as a kind of personal trainer for the face,
      building muscle and collagen in the cheeks naturally.<br>
      <br>
      'You lose 40 per cent of the muscles of your face from the age of
      20 to 60,' he points out. 'That means you lose a lot of volume.
      But just as exercising your body can help you maintain muscle mass
      in your body, so using an Oralift can help you maintain it in your
      face, so it looks firmer, tauter and younger.'<br>
      <br>
      And there is science to back up Dr Mohindra's claims. The
      inspiration for the Oralift is his dental facelift.<br>
      <br>
      People who had lost teeth were given specially built-up dentures
      to wear, and a 2002 study published in the British Dental Journal
      found that 80 per cent of patients looked five to 20 years younger
      after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift was then developed to give the same effect to people
      with all their own teeth.<br>
      <br>
      So what is the Oralift like to wear? The best thing about it is
      that it is painless. It simply sits comfortably over my bottom
      back teeth. The worst thing is that you do look pretty stupid with
      it in.<br>
      Leah Hardy<br>
      <br>
      Don't wear in public: Leah admits the Oralift makes her look
      ridiculous<br>
      <br>
      For the Oralift to work, you have to concentrate on not allowing
      your upper back teeth to touch the appliance, which is more
      difficult than you might think, and you have to keep your lips
      closed.<br>
      <br>
      When the photographer first sees me do this, he bursts out
      laughing, and a quick glance in the mirror reveals why.<br>
      <br>
      I look as if I am struggling with a particularly frightening
      gobstopper sweet.<br>
      <br>
      My mouth protrudes and my eyes look round and surprised.<br>
      <br>
      However, says Dr Mohindra, this means that the device is also
      working the eye area, and 30 per cent of Oralift users found it
      improved crepey-looking skin around the eye.<br>
      <br>
      He suggests wearing my Oralift while I'm driving or watching TV.<br>
      <br>
      I'd say you could wear it on the bus or train, and with the
      boggle-eyed loon expression it creates, you might even ensure you
      keep the double seat to yourself.<br>
      <br>
      The device leaves my speech muffled and indistinct, but I'm not
      supposed to talk or eat with it in anyway. Which my husband might
      say was a bonus - especially if he's watching football.<br>
      <br>
      I must confess to a few worries. Will my face become so long that
      I end up looking like Mister Ed, the Talking Horse? Will I get a
      Desperate Dan jaw? Will I hate the result and want my own 'short'
      face back?<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mohindra says no one has yet regretted their treatment. After
      my consultation, which includes viewing a lot of impressive
      'before and after' pictures and having my own photographs taken so
      my progress can be monitored, I am sent away from the surgery with
      a 'training schedule'. <br>
      <br>
      On the first day, I have to wear the appliance in two sessions of
      15 minutes. I choose a solo car journey and a bath as the best
      times. Then I have two days off. On day four, I need to wear the
      Oralift for two half-hour sessions, building up gradually to two
      two hour sessions every third day.<br>
      <br>
      When I get used to this device, depending on the results, I might
      be given another one, with a higher 'platform', to increase the
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      After my first 30-minute Oralift session, I can feel a definite
      stretch in my cheeks. The prospect of instant youth is so tempting
      that I find myself sneaking in a couple of extra sessions on my
      'day off'.<br>
      <br>
      This is something that Dr Mohindra expressly forbids, as he says I
      must be careful not to overwork my muscles.<br>
      Who knew?<br>
      <br>
      The leading Harley Street orthodontist Les Joffe says 12 per cent
      of his adult clients are getting braces to straighten their
      crooked teeth<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      After ten days of using the Oralift every few days, often for just
      ten or 20 minutes at a time, I have to admit that the skin on my
      cheeks feels a little firmer and springier.<br>
      <br>
      But after much peering into mirrors, I'm convinced that,
      physically, there has been no change at all.<br>
      <br>
      I arrive at the clinic feeling as if I'm wasting everyone's time,
      but Dr Mohindra takes new pictures anyway, in exactly the same
      spot as before, and then flashes them on a big screen next to my
      old photos.<br>
      <br>
      I'm astonished to see that there is already a subtle but definite
      difference. My lips look fuller, my jawline is tighter and more
      defined, and my cheeks look firmer and higher.<br>
      <br>
      Even my skin looks smoother. Best of all, my profile, which I'd
      always loathed, looks so much better - younger even - because of
      the new smoothness of my neck, increased lip volume and the
      tightening of slackness under the jaw.<br>
      <br>
      I am genuinely surprised and impressed. So much so that I pop in
      my Oralift on the train home, regardless of how daft I might look.
      I also book in to see Dr Mohindra again in a month, and feel
      genuinely excited about how my face might look then.<br>
      <br>
      Oralift is fairly demanding in terms of the time you need to spend
      using it, but it is also natural, scalpel-free, much cheaper and
      safer than surgery - and painless.<br>
      <br>
      All I can say is, watch this face.<br>

      The Oralift device is designed to reduce and delay the signs of
      facial ageing. It fits over the lower teeth and looks similar to a
      small mouth guard. It is worn for just 2 hours, every third day.
      There is no exercise programme, the facial muscles are activated
      by just having it in the mouth. Oralift has gained international
      recognition from cosmetic surgeons as being one of the most
      impressive products to reduce and delay the signs of facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      In 1996 Nick Mohindra's first paper was published in the British
      Dental Journal showing that vertical dimension (lower facial
      height) could be increased by 20mm at a time in some cases. The
      thinking hitherto had been that vertical dimension could not be
      increased by more than 1 - 3mm. A subsequent paper was published
      in 2002 with JS Bullman Emeritus Reader in Public Health at the
      Eastman Dental Institute and University College London, entitled
      "The effect of increasing vertical dimension on facial
      aesthetics".<br>
      <br>
      From their research of 96 patients with a 72% response rate, Dr.
      Mohindra and Mr. Bullman discovered that 80% of those patients
      whose vertical dimension had been increased permanently looked
      between 5 and 20 years younger. The amount of increase in vertical
      dimension was determined by using the pivot appliance. These views
      were supported by an independent panel, which consisted of a
      dentist, a dermatologist, a health and beauty journalist, an
      artist and a patient who considered before and after photographs
      of the patients.<br>
      <br>
      Nick calls the above procedure The Dentalfacelift.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent to this research and as a continuation of this work,
      Dr. Mohindra developed the Oralift appliance, which is a device
      which fits over the lower teeth. The appliance separates the teeth
      to a degree greater than the original space between the upper and
      lower teeth (the "freeway space") and the muscles adapt by
      creating a new resting length and freeway space. The majority of
      patients fitted with the appliance have reported benefits and
      improvements to their skin and facial features.<br>
      <br>
      Nick Mohindra qualified as a dentist from Edinburgh in 1969. After
      gaining general dental experience at a number of practices in
      London he became principal of practices in South Wales and Kent,
      where he was appointed a vocational trainer over a nine year
      period. Nick lectured to various postgraduate and BDA groups.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1990's he developed an interest in TMD syndrome, which led
      him to working with and researching difficulties faced by
      edentulous patients, which in turn led to an interest in facial
      aesthetics.<br>
      <br>
      In 1999 Nick decided to leave general practice to concentrate his
      work in this field and to set up Added Dimension Dentistry in
      London where he continues his work.<br>

          Cosmetic dentistry as we know it is all about improving the
          smileâby tooth whitening, tooth straightening, crowns,
          veneers, cosmetic dentures. However, the smile is not just
          about lips and teeth. When you look at it as part of the
          bigger picture i.e. the face, we have to consider other
          aspects:<br>
          <br>
          The eyes- do they smile too?<br>
          The corners of the mouth - how much do they lift up when we
          smile?<br>
          How much tooth and how much gum show when we smile?<br>
          How do our teeth look when we are talking?<br>
          How does age affect our smile?<br>
          <br>
          These are the extra dimensions we look at when we are
          designing your smile at Added Dimension Dentistry. Improving
          the smile is not just about restoring the teeth but improving
          the muscle tone and the slackness of the face. Our
          Dentalfacelift and Oralift procedures address these issues.<br>
          <br>
          There is unprecedented interest in cosmetic surgery from both
          the media and the British public. More and more people in the
          U.K. every year are going under the plastic surgeon's knife.
          This webpage explains the different types of facelift
          available including the revolutionary new Dentalfaceliftâ¢ as
          well as examining alternatives.<br>
          <br>
          Everyone's heard of going under the knife to have a facelift.
          Growing numbers of people every year lay down in operating
          theatres. They put up with having to take time out of their
          lives and brave the anxiety, fear and stress. As well as the
          courage it takes to voluntarily have your face cut with a
          scalpel there's also the discomfort and pain of recovering
          from the operation in the weeks following the surgery.<br>
          <br>
          <i>So why do people have facelifts?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          Because they work. Unlike many of the pills and potions
          advertised so much on television having a facelift will make
          you look younger. Let's be honest. Would facelifts be so
          popular if they didn't work? Why else would people voluntarily
          agree to be put to sleep and have their face cut open with a
          sharp knife?<br>
          <br>
          <i>What about the latest anti-aging fine line reducing cream?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          It's likely you've tried many of the face creams, moisturisers
          and so called "anti-aging aging" formulations on the market.
          Some of these may produce minor improvements in "fine lines"
          but they won't make you look dramatically younger. Most simply
          do not work. Several major cosmetics companies have been
          repeatedly told to stop making claims they can't back up by
          the advertising standards authorities.<br>
          <br>
          <i>But what about the special formulations I've seen on the
            internet?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          Think about it. If the major cosmetic companies who have been
          household names for decades and have many millions with which
          to spend on research (as well as on all that advertising)
          haven't come up with a "miracle" cream what are the chances
          that some company you've never heard of before has suddenly
          discovered a cream or powder which produces real results?<br>
          <br>
          <i>So what's dentistry got to do with facelifts?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          With time the lower facial height (the area between the nose
          and chin) decreases due to the loss of teeth and/or the
          wearing down of teeth. Dr. Mohindra discovered that this is
          one of the key factors in facial aging. You have only to think
          an elderly person who has lost their teeth to see the
          difference this can make. Missing and ground down teeth result
          in the sucked in and collapsed appearance around the mouth
          which causes vertical lines on the upper and lowers lips and
          all around the mouth. The effects don't stop there. Because
          the tension on the skin of the face has been slackened the
          whole face is effected.<br>
          <br>
          <i>So in other words missing/worn teeth can make the whole
            face age?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          Exactly. The lack of tension on the skin results in the
          jawline loosening, the chin falling, the cheeks flattening and
          wrinkles appearing around the eyes and forehead. Literally the
          skin loosens on the whole face.<br>
          <br>
          <i>How does the Dental Facelift work?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          It works by re-building and replacing missing and worn teeth.
          This builds the muscles in the face back up and tightens the
          skin.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Why have a Dentalfaceliftâ¢ as an alternative to cosmetic
            surgery?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          Why? Because a Dentalfaceliftâ¢ is a real alternative to
          surgery. One that can achieve real results and make you look
          dramatically younger. Unlike surgery, as it is founded on
          existing dental techniques, there are no more risks than going
          to your dentist for a clean and polish.<br>
          <br>
          Facial ageing is regarded as the gravity assisted downward
          migration of the soft tissues of the face. Nowadays we believe
          this is not the only reason. Bones of the face also change,
          which causes flattening of the cheek bones exacerbating this
          downward movement of the soft tissues.<br>
          <br>
          Cosmetic surgeons think of the face in terms of a triangle. In
          youth the base of the triangle is at the cheeks and the point
          is at the chin. As we get older the triangle reverses. The
          formation of the jowls means that the base of the triangle is
          now at the chin and the tip goes upwards towards the nose.<br>
          <br>
          Up until now surgery was the only answer to reverse the
          triangle. But after a short time the soft tissues would sag
          again. Now there is another answer â the ADD Dentalfacelift .
          This can reverse the triangle and because this procedure is
          truly anti aging the ageing process gets put into reverse
          gear. As we get older, the face keeps on improving. (See the
          long term effects). The pictures below show this reversal of
          the triangle.<br>
          <br>
          ///<br>
          <br>
          <i>So why haven't I heard of Dentalfaceliftâ¢ before?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          It's new. Dr. Mohindra invented this revolutionary new
          technique after over 30 years in general dental practice.<br>
          <br>
          <i>How do I know it works?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          The technique has received coverage in the national press and
          on the BBC. The British Dental Journal has published an
          independently evaluated scientific study into its
          effectiveness. This is an academic journal not a glossy
          magazine supported by advertising. The study concluded...view

      <br>
      London based dentist, Dr. Nick Mohindra, is marketing his new
      anti-aging device, the âOralift.â Mohindra claims a patient can
      have plumper cheeks, fuller lips, wider smile, a tightened
      jawline, softer nose to mouth lines (naso-labial folds), make
      small eyes wider and eliminate the hollows below them as well as
      eliminate the dreaded chicken neck. He further claims that
      patients who wear the device for only a few hours a day, every
      three days, have reported clearer skin, vanishing thread veins and
      no more crowâs feet! Yowza! Where do I sign?<br>
      <br>
      The device, which appears to be a glorified night guard,
      essentially keeps the patient from being able to close completely.
      At rest, most people donât keep their teeth closed together. This
      provides what dentists refer to as âfree-way space.â The Oralift
      mouth guard trains the patient to keep their teeth wider apart,
      increasing the amount of free-way space, and lengthening the
      distance from nose to chin. So if you look in the mirror and
      separate your teeth a bit while keeping your lips closed youâll
      see the effect.<br>
      <br>
      Science tells us that as we age our face loses volume due to a
      decrease in collagen production. Mohindra claims we also lose 40%
      of our facial muscle mass from ages 20 to 60. Oh really? Nearly
      HALF of your facial musculature goes away?? Seems like that would
      look pretty creepy.<br>
      Mohindra took some liberties with age related muscle loss
      (Sarcopenia) data by cutting and pasting the statistics to support
      his claims. Sarcopenia largely affects inactive adults and is also
      influenced by diet. Moreover, the muscle loss is replaced by fat
      which fills the void, leaving the patient looking largely
      unchanged.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift website has a photo gallery of befores and afters.
      Thereâs definitely an improvement in hairstyle and makeup, camera
      angle, lighting and in one case probably a good dosing of Botox
      Cosmetic. The Maven can detect a slight increase in lower facial
      height, which is the goal of the treatment. But She canât help but
      ask: What happens when the patient eventually closes her mouth??
      Itâs something we do every time we chew. So, your âfaceliftâ is
      dependent upon never bringing your teeth together?<br>
      <br>
      The Maven could see this happening:<br>
      <br>
      Freshly âOralift-ed,â a forty-something divorcee lands a hot date.
      The evening is perfect, a few drinks, conversationâ¦and then
      dinner. A few minutes into the marinara and the transfiguration
      begins. The baggy eyes, chicken neck, loose jawline, crowâs feet
      and thread veins are back. Our 30 year old hot momma is morphing
      into the 40 something (okay, 50 year old) dowager she is.
      Horrified and puzzled by his initial babe-o-meter assessment, our
      handsome bachelor makes a quick break for his blackberry, offers
      up an excuse about âhis boss needing somethingâ¦ immediatelyâ and
      sprints to the nearest exit.<br>
      <br>
      The Oralift sells for 575Â£ which equates to roughly $911 at
      todaysâ exchange rates. When Mohindra makes the âOralift Plusâ
      which does laundry, grocery shopping and drags the recycle bin to
      the curb? Yeah. The Maven with be all over that. <br>

      <br>
      A mass produced universal dental appliancee ( 1 ) comprises two
      parts, the parts intended in use to contact the posterior teeth on
      respective opposite sides of either the upper or lower jaw, each
      part comprising a composite structure comprising: i) a first layer
      ( 2 ) formed a durable, resilient, elastomeric material having a
      softening point in the range from 35 to 100 DEG C. and which in
      use contacts and grips the occlusal biting surfaces of the
      posterior teeth; and ii) a second layer ( 3 ) formed from a
      durable, non-deformable material having a softening point over 100
      DEG C. and which in use provides a bite plate;; wherein the second
      layer of each part is provided with a protrusion ( 5 ), formed of
      durable, non-deformable material having a softening point over 100
      DEG C., which extends from at least 2 mm up to 20 mm from the
      surface ( 4 ) of the bite plate away from the first layer and
      which is positioned such that in use the protrusion extends from
      the surface of the bite plate above at least a part of the first
      and/or second molar teeth which are in contact with the first
      layer. The appliance is useful in a method for reducing facial
      aging.<br>
      <br>
      This invention is concerned with a method of reducing facial aging
      and an appliance which is intended to be worn in the mouth during
      an exercise programme which, over time, can lead to a reduction in
      facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      Pivot appliances have been used in dentistry since the 1930s to
      alleviate pain experienced by patients suffering from misaligned
      jaws, caused by inclines of the teeth The original purpose of the
      pivot appliance was to separate the jaws so that inclines of the
      teeth would not dictate how the jaws met and thereby allow the
      bite of the patient to be adjusted to a more comfortable position.
      Use of the appliance on a temporary basis would allow the facial
      muscles to relax, resulting in the jaw and the condyle in the
      temporo mandibular joint (tmj) resting in an unrestrained
      position. This consequently would result in relief of pain
      associated with the tmj disorder.<br>
      <br>
      The pivot appliance was made from a plaster mould of the patient's
      mouth, which mould was made by taking an impression of the lower
      teeth with a dental impression material. From this impression, a
      mould was made in plaster, which was an exact duplicate of the
      patient's lower jaw. This mould was then used to make a pivot
      appliance from a rigid moulding material, which would include wire
      clips to fit the appliance in the patient's mouth. The optimal
      thickness of the moulding material of the appliance that provided
      the biting surface was determined e.g. by using the command
      swallowing technique to establish the correct biting position for
      the particular patient. The patient would wear the fitted
      appliance under the direction and supervision of a dentist for
      such time until relief of pain was achieved. The appliance was
      then removed. The problem with this temporary procedure was that
      it sometimes tended to provide only temporary relief: after the
      appliance had been removed, there was a tendency for the jaws to
      return over time back to their original, painful biting position.<br>
      <br>
      Some dentist would advocate that the bite of the patient had to be
      permanently altered to achieve permanent relief from tmj disorder.
      In such circumstances, orthodontic treatment was usually employed,
      to change the position of the teeth or by crowning the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      In 1996, Dr N. K. Mohindra published a paper, in the British
      Dental Journal, entitled "A preliminary report on determining the
      vertical height of occlusion by the position of the mandible in
      the swallowing technique". In this paper, Dr Mohindra reported
      that a pivotal appliance could be used to increase the vertical
      dimension significantly, e.g. by up to 19 mm, beyond the normal
      resting position of the mandible without patients experiencing
      problems. Prior to this report, doctors and dents had considered
      that the vertical dimension should not be increased by more than
      about 2-3 mm and definitely not beyond the resting position of the
      jaw. The appliance used in these experiments was made in a
      laboratory by a trained and approved dental technician.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, Dr Mohindra published a second paper in the British
      Dental Journal, entitled "The effect of increasing vertical
      dimension on facial aesthetics". In this paper, Dr Mohindra
      reported that 80% of patients whose vertical dimension had been
      increased permanently by the use of a pivot appliance thought they
      looked between 5 and 20 years younger, and that these views were
      backed up by an independent panel who studied before and after
      photographs of the patients and reached same conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, Dr Mohindra developed a facial rejuvenator which
      improved facial aesthetics without permanently increasing vertical
      dimension of occlusion. The rejuvenator, like the earlier dental
      appliance, required to be custom made for each patient in a
      laboratory by a trained dental technician The rejuvenator
      comprised a substantially U-shaped layer formed from a durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C.
      which was custom moulded to fit over all the teeth on the lower
      jaw and which in use provided a bite plate. Two projections
      extended from the surface of the bite plate and were positioned on
      the bite plate over at least a part of the fist molar tooth on
      both sides of the jaw. The projections were made of a durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 50[deg.] C.,
      and were custom moulded to the vertical height of occlusion for
      each patient, as determined by the command swallowing technique.<br>
      <br>
      The rejuvenator was removable and so only increases the vertical
      dimension of occlusion for the short period of time when the
      appliance is in the mouth of the patient. The rejuvenator was
      based on the original pivot appliance and is made in the same way,
      i.e. in a laboratory by a trained and approved dental technician.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,415,794 and 6,539,943 disclose a dental appliance
      for use by athletes during periods of exertion. The appliance
      consists of an occlusal posterior pad made of quadruple composite
      material comprising four layers of distinct materials, further
      comprising a first layer of a durable, resilient material, a
      second layer of non-softenable, flexible material, a third layer
      of a hard, very durable material, and a fourth layer of softenable
      material, engageable with the occlusal surfaces to space apart the
      upper and lower teeth, to absorb shock and clenching stress. An
      adjustable arch adapted to expand and contract to be moulded to
      the palate is provided connecting the posterior pads together with
      the mouth and out of the way of the tongue to maintain the
      position of the occlusal posterior pads within the mouth during
      use and to prevent loss of the pads such as by swallowing. The
      appliance may be fitted using a boil and bite technique, for
      example by a doctor or dentist, with no requirement for customized
      laboratory moulding processes.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,523 discloses an anti-snoring device having a
      dental overlay portion and a guide ramp portion slidably mounted
      in the dental portion. The device may be fitted using a boil and
      bite technique, for example by a doctor or dentist, with no
      requirement for customized laboratory moulding processes.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide an appliance for
      reducing facial aging that can be mass produced on an industrial
      basis, thereby obviating the hitherto necessity for customized
      manufacture in a laboratory of an appliance that has been
      individually designed and made for a particular patient.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is as set out in the accompanying claims.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is
      provided a mass produced universal dental appliance suitable for
      use in a method of reducing facial aging, which appliance
      comprises two parts, the parts intended in use to contact the
      posterior teeth on respective opposite sides of either the upper
      or lower jaw, each part comprising a composite structure
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      i) a first layer formed a durable, resilient, elastomeric material
      having a softening point in the range from 35 to 100[deg.] C. and
      which in use contacts and grips the occlusal biting surfaces of
      the posterior teeth; and<br>
      ii) a second layer formed from a durable, non-deformable material
      having a softening point over 100[deg.] C. and which in use
      provides a bite plate;<br>
      wherein the second layer of each part is provided with a
      protrusion, formed of durable, non-deformable material having a
      softening point over 100[deg.] C., which extends from at least 2
      mm up to 20 mm from the surface of the bite plate away from the
      first layer and which is positioned such that in use the
      protrusion extends from the surface of the bite plate above at
      least a part of the first and/or second molar teeth which are in
      contact with the first layer.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance is adapted to provide a predetermined
      vertical separation of the jaws determined by the command
      swallowing technique and, advantageously, can be either fitted by
      e.g. a doctor or dentist without requiring use of customized
      laboratory processes or a dental technician, or it may be
      purchased over-the-counter and fitted by the individual user.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance is intended to be used by a patient to
      reduce the signs of facial aging. The universal appliance
      advantageously does not have to be made individually for a
      patient, unlike the rejuvenator.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance may be worn at any time of the day, when the patient
      is awake or asleep. Preferably, the appliance is worn during
      eating or during sleeping.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the universal appliance will be generally prescribed by a
      doctor or a dentist or, in the case of an over-the-counter
      purchase, as prescribed on the accompanying instructions for use.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance is preferably worn for from about 3 to about 12
      hours in any day. It is recommended not to wear the appliance for
      24 hours of the day.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance is preferably used over a continuous period of from
      4 to 10 weeks, typically 6 weeks, with a preferred interval before
      reuse of from 3 to 6 months e.g. 4 months.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention is shaped to fit over at
      least the biting surface of the posterior teeth of the upper or
      lower jaw, preferably the lower jaw. It is preferred that the
      appliance is substantially U-shaped, so as to fit comfortably over
      both the anterior and posterior teeth. Alternatively, the
      appliance may comprise two separate portions which fit over only
      the posterior teeth on either side of the respective jaw, with a
      bridging means to connect the two portions.<br>
      <br>
      Each part of the two parts of the appliance of the present
      invention which fit over the posterior teeth on both sides of the
      upper or lower jaw consists of a composite structure comprising<br>
      <br>
      i) a first layer formed a durable, resilient, elastomeric material
      having a softening point in the range from about 35 to 100[deg.]
      C. and which in use contacts and grips the occlusal biting
      surfaces of the posterior teeth; and<br>
      ii) a second layer formed from a durable, non-deformable material
      having a softening point over 100[deg.] C. Band which in use
      provides a bite plate.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is provided with a protrusion formed of durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C.
      which extends from at least about 2 mm up to about 20 mm,
      preferably from about 5 mm up to about 15 mm, most preferably from
      about 7 mm to about 10 mm e.g. 9 mm, from the surface of the bite
      plate away from the first layer and which is positioned such that
      in use it is on the bite plate above at least a part of the first
      and/or second molar teeth which are in contact with the first
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      The protrusion is preferably formed integrally with the second
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the protrusion is centrally located above at least a
      part of the first and/or second molar teeth. More preferably, the
      width of the protrusion is less than the width of the molar(s)
      above which the protrusion is intended to be positioned.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of the protrusion is not important, provided that in use
      it is comfortable for the patient and when the appliance is fitted
      the protrusion provides a point above the first and/or second
      molars on the lower jaw about which the lower jaw may pivot, if
      forced to do so.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of
      reducing facial aging, which method comprises fitting an appliance
      as described above on either the upper or lower jaw, preferably
      the lower jaw, and exercising the lower jaw by repeatedly dropping
      the lower jaw and then lifting the lower jaw and closing it
      against the upper jaw with the appliance between the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Exercising may be undertaken when the patient is conscious or
      asleep. Exercising may take place actively, for example during
      eating or at a time when the patient deliberately exercises.
      Alternatively, exercising may take place passively, for example
      when the patient is asleep or simply performing normal daytime
      activities. In such passive exercise, the facial muscles are
      stretched by the jaw adopting a new resting position.<br>
      <br>
      Exercising is preferably achieved by wearing the appliance
      continuously for from about 3 to about 12 hours in any day (it is
      recommended not to wear the appliance for 24 hours of the day).
      Exercising is preferably undertaken on a daily basis over a period
      of from 4 to 10 weeks, typically 6 weeks. A break from exercising
      of from 3 to 6 months e.g. 4 months is preferably taken before
      commencing another period of exercising.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer of the appliance is formed from a durable,
      resilient, elastomeric material preferably having a softening
      point in the range from about 35 to 100[deg.] C., preferably about
      35 to 50[deg.] C., more preferably from about 35 to 40[deg.] C.
      Such materials are well known in the art and are commonly used in
      the manufacture of boil and bite type dental products, such as
      those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,092,253, 6,415,794 and
      6,539,943. Examples of suitable materials are styrene block
      copolymers, polyolefin rubbers, acrylate based elastomers and
      ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, and mixtures thereof
      Commercially available materials include Elvax and Engage
      available from DuPont, Kraton thermoplastic rubber available from
      Shell, Santoprene available from Advanced Elastomer Systems and
      Dynaflex available from GLS. The material used to form the first
      layer must become mouldable when placed in water at or close to
      boiling temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer is preferably from 5 to 15 mm thick, more
      preferably 8 to 12 mm thick, before fitting. After fitting, the
      thickness of the layer will vary from point to point along the
      length appliance. Preferably, after fitting, the thickness of the
      first layer does not go below 1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      It is the employment of the first layer material in the composite
      structure of the appliance that enables the appliance during
      fitting to adjust to provide a vertical separation of the jaws
      determined by the command swallow technique.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer of the appliance is formed from a durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.]
      C., e.g. 150[deg.] C. or more. Such materials are well known in
      the art and are commonly used in the manufacture of boil and bite
      type dental products, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      6,092,253, 6,415,794 and 6,539,943. Examples of suitable materials
      include polycarbonate resins, high density polyethylene and
      polypropylene and methylmethacrylate based thermoplastics.
      Commercially available materials include Escorene HD-6706
      available from Exxon and AP6112-HS available from Huntsman. The
      material used to make the second layer must not become softened in
      boiling water.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is preferably from about 1 to about 15 mm thick,
      preferably from about 3 to about 9 mm thick The thickness of the
      second layer is not affected by fitting.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is provided with a protrusion formed of durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C.
      which extends from at least about 2 mm up to about 20 mm,
      preferably from about 5 mm up to about 15 mm, most preferably from
      about 7 mm to about 10 mm e.g. 9 mm, from the surface of the bite
      plate away from the first layer and which is positioned such that
      in use it is on the bite plate above at least a part of the first
      and/or second molar teeth which are in contact with the first
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance may comprise a third layer of material located
      between the first and second layers. If present, such a third
      layer is preferably formed of a durable resilient material having
      a softening point above 100[deg.] C., preferably above 150[deg.]
      C. Such suitable materials are mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      The protrusion is preferably formed out of the same material as
      the second layer and is preferably formed integrally with the
      second layer. Together, the protrusion and second layer are
      preferably no more than 22 mm thick at their thickest point, more
      preferably no more than 15 mm thick at their thickest point.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention can be fitted to a patient
      employing a similar boil and bite procedure as disclosed in U.S.
      Pat. Nos. 6,415,794, 6,539,943 or 6,092,523. The fitting should
      include the use of the command swallow technique.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention is useful for reducing
      facial aging. The aging of the face basically involves two
      factors. These are intrinsic and extrinsic actors. The intrinsic
      factors basically involve atrophy i.e. the reduction in number of
      cells for instance by the age of 60 (typically, we only have 60%
      of the muscle cells that we had when we were in our 20's). The
      extrinsic factors involve damage done to cells by environmental
      factors e.g. sun, smoke, toxins produced by bacteria and viruses.
      The process involved is basically a form of chronic inflammation.
      Both these processes (cell death and chronic inflammation) in
      their early stages are reversible. Exercising with the appliance
      of the present invention can help reverse these processes in their
      early stages. Accordingly, all diseases, which are related to
      facial aging or inflammatory conditions, could be alleviated to
      some extent by exercising with the appliance. For example,
      exercising with the appliance could help to alleviate, to some
      extent, some of the symptoms associated with suffers of
      Alzheimer's, chronic sinusitis, age related deterioration in
      eyesight, tangelacetasis, solar damage to the skin, acne, and
      bacterial infections, such as ear infections. This list is not
      exhaustive.<br>

      </b>A U-shaped universal facial rejuvenator appliance 1, as shown
      in FIGS. 1-8, may comprise a first layer 2, about 10 mm thick
      formed of a commercially available substantially transparent
      elastomeric EVA copolymer having a softening point of about
      36[deg.] C., and a second layer 3, about 1.5 mm thick formed of a
      commercially available substantially transparent polycarbonate
      having a softening point of about 190[deg.] C. The surface 4 of
      the second layer 3 remote from the first layer 2 forms, in use, a
      bite plate. Extending from the surface of the bite plate 4 are two
      projections 5 which may be formed integrally with the second
      layer. The projections extend approximately 3 mm above the surface
      4.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer 2 and second layer 3 may be adhered together, with
      the use of an appropriate adhesive, or may be heat formed
      together. If heat forming is employed, the second layer may be
      provided with a plurality small orifices 6 or projections into
      which or around which the first layer engages to secure itself in
      position.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance 1 can be fitted to a patient by initially
      heating the appliance by submerging it in near boiling water for
      about 30 seconds, or such other time so as to render the material
      of the first layer 2 mouldable. The patient is required to open
      the mouth and the appliance is then placed over the teeth on the
      patient's lower jaw, with the first layer 2 in contact with the
      teeth and the two projections 5 positioned over both first molar
      teeth. The patient is then required to gently raise the lower jaw
      until the teeth on the upper jaw contact the top of the
      projections 5. The patient then closes their lips and swallows.
      The pressure applied to the to the appliance 1 by swallowing
      causes the material of the first layer 2 to deform and mould
      itself to the shape of the teeth on the lower jaw. The appliance
      can then be carefully removed from the mouth of the patient and
      submerged in cold water to accelerate the cooling of the appliance
      to ambient. Once the appliance has cooled, any excess of the first
      layer material can be trimmed away until it forms a comfortable
      fit.<br>
      <br>
      The fitting of the appliance can readily be performed by a doctor
      or dentist, without the services of a dental technician or having
      to resort to custom moulding practices in a laboratory, or by the
      patient without third party assistance.<br>
      <br>
      Once the appliance 1 has cooled to ambient temperatures and been
      trimmed it may be used by the patient for reducing facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      The process for reducing facial aging can commence as soon as the
      appliance has cooled to a temperature where the material used to
      form the first layer has solidified sufficiently for use of the
      appliance not to cause remoulding of that layer. The patient
      positions the appliance 1 in the mouth, preferably just before
      eating a meal The patient then exercises the lower jaw, e.g.
      during eating or sleeping, by raising the lower jaw thereby to
      bring the teeth on the upper jaw into contact with the protrusions
      and then closing the teeth on the upper and lower jaw around the
      appliance. In so doing, the lower jaw is forced to pivot slightly
      about the protections and cause the facial muscles controlling the
      lower jaw to work harder. The muscles are then permitted to relax
      and the lower jaw is dropped. The exercise is preferably repeated
      for about 6 to 7 hours a day over a period of about 6 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance may be tested on a sample of patients. The
      patients may be asked to wear the appliance at mealtimes over a
      specified period of time. 12 patients wore the appliance for 6
      weeks, 1 for 7 weeks, 4 for 8 weeks, 2 for 9 weeks, 3 for 10
      weeks, and 6 for 12 weeks. The results are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      The patients were asked:<br>
      1) How comfortable was the appliance in the mouth on a scale of 0
      to 3 (0 being very uncomfortable and 3 being very comfortable)?<br>
      4 patients thought it was 1 on the scale of 0 to 3, 15 thought 2,
      and 9 thought 3.<br>
      2) If you suffered from neckaches, headaches, shoulder pains, did
      these improve?<br>
      4 patients said they suffered from neck ache and 100% reported an
      improvement. 5 suffered from shoulder pain and 80% reported an
      improvement. 3 had headaches and 66% reported improvement.<br>
      3) Do you think the treatment enhanced your facial features? Give
      your response on a scale between 0 and 3, 0 being no improvement
      and 3 being good. The number of features listed was 11 and were as
      follows: skin above the upper eyelid, size of the eyes, crows
      feet, lateral droop of the eyes, bags under the eyes, improvement
      in skin, naso labial folds, lips, jaw line, cheeks. The results
      were as follows;<br>
      <br>
      On an average patients noted an improvement in 7.5 of the 11
      features:<br>
      <br>
      skin above the upper eyelid: 60.7% noted an improvement; size of
      the eyes: 57.1%; crows feet: 64.3%; lateral droop of the eyes: 71%
      noted an improvement; bags under the eyes: 57.1%; skin: 85.7%;
      naso labial folds: 71.4%; lips: 89.3%; jaw line: 64.3%; neck:
      64.3%; cheeks: 71.4%.<br>
      <br>
      All these improvements were from mild to very good, suggesting
      that the universal appliance could be successfully employed to
      reduce facial aging.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention is concerned with a method of reducing facial aging
      and an appliance which is intended to be worn in the mouth during
      an exercise programme which, over time, can lead to a reduction in
      facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      Pivot appliances have been used in dentistry since the 1930s to
      alleviate pain experienced by patients suffering from misaligned
      jaws, caused by inclines of the teeth. The original purpose of the
      pivot appliance was to separate the jaws so that inclines of the
      teeth would not dictate how the jaws met and thereby allow the
      bite of the patient to be adjusted to a more comfortable position.
      Use of the appliance on a temporary basis would allow the facial
      muscles to relax, resulting in the jaw and the condyle in the
      temporo mandibular joint (tmj) resting in an unrestrained
      position. This consequently would result in relief of pain
      associated with the tmj disorder.<br>
      <br>
      The pivot appliance was made from a plaster mould of the patient's
      mouth, which mould was made by taking an impression of the lower
      teeth with a dental impression material. From this impression, a
      mould was made in plaster, which was an exact duplicate of the
      patient's lower jaw. This mould was then used to make a pivot
      appliance from a rigid moulding material, which would include wire
      clips to fit the appliance in the patient's mouth. The optimal
      thickness of the moulding material of the appliance that provided
      the biting surface was determined e.g. by using the command
      swallowing technique to establish the correct biting position for
      the particular patient. The patient would wear the fitted
      appliance under the direction and supervision of a dentist for
      such time until relief of pain was achieved. The appliance was
      then removed. The problem with this temporary procedure was that
      it sometimes tended to provide only temporary relief: after the
      appliance had been removed, there was a tendency for the jaws to
      return over time back to their original, painful biting position.<br>
      <br>
      Some dentists would advocate that the bite of the patient had to
      be permanently altered to achieve permanent relief from tmj
      disorder. In such circumstances, orthodontic treatment was usually
      employed, to change the position of the teeth or by crowning the
      teeth.<br>
      <br>
      In 1996, Dr N. K. Mohindra published a paper, in the British
      Dental Journal, entitled "A preliminary report on determining the
      vertical height of occlusion by the position of the mandible in
      the swallowing technique". In this paper, Dr Mohindra reported
      that a pivotal appliance could be used to determine the increase
      of the vertical dimension and resulted in dramatic increases in
      the vertical dimension of occlusion, e.g. by up to 19 mm, beyond
      the normal resting position of the mandible without patients
      experiencing problems. Prior to this report, doctors and dentists
      had considered that the vertical dimension should not be increased
      by more than about 2-3 mm and definitely not beyond the resting
      position of the jaw. The appliance used in these experiments was
      made in a laboratory by a trained and approved dental technician.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, Dr Mohindra published a second paper in the British
      Dental Journal, entitled "The effect of increasing vertical
      dimension on facial aesthetics". In this paper, Dr Mohindra
      reported that 80% of patients whose vertical dimension had been
      increased permanently by the use of a pivot appliance thought they
      looked between 5 and 20 years younger, and that these views were
      backed up by an independent panel who studied before and after
      photographs of the patients and reached same conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, Dr Mohindra developed a facial rejuvenator which
      improved facial aesthetics without permanently increasing vertical
      dimension of occlusion. The rejuvenator, like the earlier dental
      appliance, required to be custom made for each patient in a
      laboratory by a trained dental technician. The rejuvenator
      comprised a substantially U-shaped layer formed from a durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C.
      which was custom moulded to fit over all the teeth on the lower
      jaw and which in use provided a bite plate. Two projections
      extended from the surface of the bite plate and were positioned on
      the bite plate over at least a part of the first molar tooth on
      both sides of the jaw. The projections were made of a durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.]
      C., and were custom moulded to the vertical height of occlusion
      for each patient, as determined by the command swallowing
      technique.<br>
      <br>
      The rejuvenator was removable and so only increases the vertical
      dimension of occlusion for the short period of time when the
      appliance is in the mouth of the patient. The rejuvenator was
      based on the original pivot appliance and is made in the same way,
      i.e. in a laboratory by a trained and approved dental technician.<br>

      c) exercising the lower jaw passively to allow the jaw to come to
      rest in a new resting position. Preferably, the appliance is
      adapted to provide in use a predetermined vertical separation of
      at least 3 mm up to about 24 mm, preferably at least 5 mm e.g.
      from about 5 mm up to about 15 mm, and most preferably from about
      8 mm e.g. about 8 mm to about 11 mm e.g. 10 mm.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a mass produced
      universal dental appliance suitable for use in the above method of
      reducing facial aging of a person. The appliance comprises at
      least one part, the or each part intended in use to be in
      continuous contact with the teeth on either the upper or lower
      jaw, the or each part comprising an elongate layered-composite
      structure comprising:<br>
      <br>
      i) a first layer, formed of a durable, resilient, elastomeric
      material having a softening point in the range from 35 to
      100[deg.] C., having a surface which in use is in continuous
      contact with the occlusal biting surfaces of at least two teeth on
      either the upper or lower jaw; and<br>
      <br>
      ii) a second, non-deformable layer, formed of a durable material
      having a softening point over 100[deg.] C., having a surface which
      in use provides a bite plate;<br>
      wherein the second layer of each part is provided with a
      non-deformable protrusion, formed of durable material having a
      softening point over 100[deg.] C., which protrudes at least 2 mm
      up to 20 mm from the surface of the bite plate away from the first
      layer, and<br>
      wherein the appliance has dimensions such that in use it provides
      a predetermined vertical separation of the jaws which is at least
      3 mm beyond the normal resting position of the jaws.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the mass produced universal dental appliance is
      adapted such that in use the first layer is in continuous contact
      with at least two anterior teeth on either the upper or lower jaw.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is
      provided a mass produced universal dental appliance suitable for
      use in a method of reducing facial aging, which appliance
      comprises two parts, the parts intended in use to contact the
      posterior teeth on respective opposite sides of either the upper
      or lower jaw, each part comprising an elongate layered-composite
      structure comprising:<br>
      <br>
      i) a first layer formed of a durable, resilient, elastomeric
      material having a softening point in the range from 35 to
      100[deg.] C. and which in use contacts and grips the occlusal
      biting surfaces of the posterior teeth; and<br>
      <br>
      ii) a second non-deformable layer formed of a durable material
      having a softening point over 100[deg.] C. and which in use
      provides a bite plate;<br>
      wherein the second layer of each part is provided with a
      protrusion, formed of durable, non-deformable material having a
      softening point over 100[deg.] C., which extends from at least 2
      mm up to 20 mm from the surface of the bite plate away from the
      first layer and which is positioned such that in use the
      protrusion extends from the surface of the bite plate above at
      least a part of the first and/or second molar teeth which are in
      contact with the first layer. In this embodiment, the appliance
      has dimensions such that in use it provides a predetermined
      vertical separation of the jaws which is at least 3 mm beyond the
      normal resting position of the jaws.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance is adapted to provide a predetermined
      vertical separation of the jaws which is at least 3 mm beyond the
      normal resting position of the jaws, as determined by the command
      swallowing technique and, advantageously, can be either fitted by
      e.g. a doctor or dentist without requiring use of customized
      laboratory processes or a dental technician, or it may be
      purchased over-the-counter and fitted by the individual user.
      Preferably, the appliance is adapted to provide in use a
      predetermined vertical separation of at least 3 mm up to about 24
      mm, preferably at least 5 mm e.g. from about 5 mm up to about 15
      mm, and most preferably from about 8 mm e.g. about 8 mm to about
      11 mm e.g. 10 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance is intended to be used by a patient to
      reduce the signs of facial aging. The universal appliance
      advantageously does not have to be made individually for a
      patient, unlike the rejuvenator.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance may be worn at any time of the day, when the patient
      is awake or asleep. However, at least initially, until the patient
      is used to wearing the appliance and exercising the lower jaw
      passively, the appliance is preferably worn during the day only.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the universal appliance will be generally prescribed by a
      doctor or a dentist or, in the case of an over-the-counter
      purchase, as prescribed on the accompanying instructions for use.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance is preferably worn for from about [1/2] to about 12
      hours in any day. It is recommended not to wear the appliance for
      24 hours of the day.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance is preferably used over a continuous period of from
      4 to 14 weeks, typically 6 weeks, with a preferred interval before
      reuse of from 3 to 6 months e.g. 4 months.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention is preferably shaped to fit
      over at least the biting surface of the posterior teeth of the
      upper or lower jaw, preferably the lower jaw. It is preferred that
      the appliance is substantially U-shaped, so as to fit comfortably
      over both the anterior and posterior teeth or over only the
      anterior teeth. Alternatively, the appliance may comprise two
      separate portions which fit over only the posterior teeth on
      either side of the respective jaw, with a bridging means to
      connect the two portions.<br>
      <br>
      Each part of the two parts of the appliance of the present
      invention which fit over the posterior teeth on both sides of the
      upper or lower jaw consists of an elongate layered-composite
      structure comprising<br>
      <br>
      i) a first layer formed of a durable, resilient, elastomeric
      material having a softening point in the range from about 35 to
      100[deg.] C. and which in use contacts and grips the occlusal
      biting surfaces of the posterior teeth; and<br>
      ii) a second, non-deformable layer formed of a durable material
      having a softening point over 100[deg.] C. and which in use
      provides a bite plate.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is provided with a protrusion formed of durable,
      non-deformable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C.
      which extends from at least about 2 mm up to about 20 mm,
      preferably from about 5 mm up to about 15 mm, most preferably from
      about 7 mm to about 10 mm e.g. 9 mm, from the surface of the bite
      plate away from the first layer and which is positioned such that
      in use it is on the bite plate above at least a part of the first
      and/or second molar teeth which are in contact with the first
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      The protrusion is preferably formed integrally with the second
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the protrusion is centrally located above at least a
      part of the first and/or second molar teeth. More preferably, the
      width of the protrusion is less than the width of the molar(s)
      above which the protrusion is intended to be positioned.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of the protrusion is not important, provided that in use
      it is comfortable for the patient. When the appliance is fitted
      the protrusion preferably provides a point above the first and/or
      second molars on the lower jaw about which the lower jaw may
      pivot, if forced to do so.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of
      reducing facial aging, which method comprises fitting an appliance
      as described above on either the upper or lower jaw, preferably
      the lower jaw, and exercising the lower jaw passively to allow the
      jaw to come to rest in a new resting position.<br>
      <br>
      Exercising may be undertaken when the patient is conscious or
      asleep. Exercising should take place passively, for example when
      the patient is asleep or simply performing normal daytime
      activities. In such passive exercise, the facial muscles enable
      the jaw to adopt a new resting position. Active jaw exercise, i.e.
      exercise involving clenching of the jaws on to the appliance e.g.
      eating, should preferably be avoided whilst the appliance is
      fitted in the mouth for at least such time until the facial
      muscles have substantially adjusted to enable the jaws to come to
      rest voluntarily in the new resting position.<br>
      <br>
      Exercising is preferably achieved by wearing the appliance
      continuously for from about [1/2] to about 12 hours in any day (it
      is recommended not to wear the appliance for 24 hours of the day).
      Exercising is preferably undertaken on a daily basis over a period
      of from 4 to 14 weeks, typically 6 weeks. A break from exercising
      of from 3 to 6 months e.g. 4 months is preferably taken before
      commencing another period of exercising.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer of the appliance is formed of a durable,
      resilient, elastomeric material, preferably having a softening
      point in the range from about 35 to 100[deg.] C., preferably about
      35 to 50[deg.] C., more preferably from about 35 to 40[deg.] C.
      Such materials are well known in the art and are commonly used in
      the manufacture of boil and bite type dental products, such as
      those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,253, U.S. Pat. No.
      6,415,794 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,943. Examples of suitable
      materials are styrene block copolymers, polyolefin rubbers,
      acrylate based elastomers and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers,
      and mixtures thereof. Commercially available materials include
      Elvax and Engage available from DuPont, Kraton thermoplastic
      rubber available from Shell, Santoprene available from Advanced
      Elastomer Systems and Dynaflex available from GLS. The material
      used to form the first layer must become mouldable when placed in
      water at or close to boiling temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer is preferably from 5 to 15 mm thick, more
      preferably 8 to 12 mm thick, before fitting. After fitting, the
      thickness of the layer will vary from point to point along the
      length appliance. Preferably, after fitting, the thickness of the
      first layer does not go below 1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      It is the employment of the first layer material in the composite
      structure of the appliance that enables the appliance during
      fitting to adjust to provide a vertical separation of the jaws
      determined by the command swallow technique.<br>
      <br>
      The second, non-deformable layer of the appliance is formed of a
      durable material having a softening point over 100[deg.] C., e.g.
      150[deg.] C. or more. Such materials are well known in the art and
      are commonly used in the manufacture of boil and bite type dental
      products, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,253, U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,415,794 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,943. Examples of
      suitable materials include polycarbonate resins, high density
      polyethylene and polypropylene and methylmethacrylate based
      thermoplastics. Commercially available materials include Escorene
      HD-6706 available from Exxon and AP6112-HS available from
      Huntsman. The material used to make the second layer must not
      become softened in boiling water.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is preferably from about 1 to about 15 mm thick,
      preferably from about 3 to about 9 mm thick. The thickness of the
      second layer is not affected by fitting or use.<br>
      <br>
      The second layer is provided with a non-deformable protrusion
      formed of durable material having a softening point over 100[deg.]
      C. which extends from at least about 2 mm up to about 20 mm,
      preferably from about 5 mm up to about 15 mm, most preferably from
      about 7 mm to about 10 mm e.g. 9 mm, from the surface of the bite
      plate away from the first layer and which is positioned such that
      in use it is on the bite plate above at least a part of the first
      and/or second molar teeth which are in contact with the first
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance may comprise a third layer of material located
      between the first and second layers. If present, such a third
      layer is preferably formed of a durable resilient material having
      a softening point above 100[deg.] C., preferably above 150[deg.]
      C. Such suitable materials are mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      The protrusion is preferably formed out of the same material as
      the second layer and is preferably formed integrally with the
      second layer. Together, the protrusion and second layer are
      preferably no more than 22 mm thick at their thickest point, more
      preferably no more than 15 mm thick at their thickest point.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention can be fitted to a patient
      employing a similar boil and bite procedure as disclosed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,415,794, U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,943 or U.S. Pat. No.
      6,092,523. The fitting should include the use of the command
      swallow technique.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance of the present invention is useful for reducing
      facial aging. The aging of the face basically involves two
      factors. These are intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The intrinsic
      factors basically involve atrophy i.e. the reduction in number of
      cells for instance by the age of 60 (typically, we only have 60%
      of the muscle cells that we had when we were in our 20's).<br>
      <br>
      The extrinsic factors involve damage done to cells by
      environmental factors e.g. sun, smoke, toxins produced by bacteria
      and viruses. The process involved is basically a form of chronic
      inflammation. Chronic inflammation in its early stages is
      reversible. Exercising passively with the appliance of the present
      invention can help reverse the process in its early stages.
      Accordingly, all diseases, which are related to facial aging or
      inflammatory conditions, could be alleviated to some extent by
      exercising with the appliance. For example, exercising with the
      appliance could help to alleviate, to some extent, some of the
      symptoms associated with suffers of Alzheimer's, chronic
      sinusitis, age related deterioration in eyesight, tangelacetasis,
      solar damage to the skin, acne, and bacterial infections, such as
      ear infections. This list is not exhaustive.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The invention in its various embodiments shall now be further
      described by way of exemplification with reference to the
      accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      A U-shaped universal facial rejuvenator appliance 1, as shown in
      FIGS. 1-8, may comprise a first layer 2, about 10 mm thick formed
      of a commercially available substantially transparent elastomeric
      EVA copolymer having a softening point of about 360[deg.] C., and
      a second layer 3, about 1.5 mm thick formed of a commercially
      available substantially transparent polycarbonate having a
      softening point of about 190[deg.] C. The surface 4 of the second
      layer 3 remote from the first layer 2 forms, in use, a bite plate.
      Extending from the surface of the bite plate 4 are two projections
      5 which may be formed integrally with the second layer. The
      projections extend approximately 3 mm above the surface 4.<br>
      <br>
      The first layer 2 and second layer 3 may be adhered together, with
      the use of an appropriate adhesive, or may be heat formed
      together, If heat forming is employed, the second layer may be
      provided with a plurality small orifices 6 or projections into
      which or around which the first layer engages to secure itself in
      position.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance 1 can be fitted to a patient by initially
      heating the appliance by submerging it in near boiling water for
      about 30 seconds, or such other time so as to render the material
      of the first layer 2 mouldable. The patient is required to open
      the mouth and the appliance is then placed over the teeth on the
      patient's lower jaw, with the first layer 2 in contact with the
      teeth and the two projections 5 positioned over both first molar
      teeth. The patient is then required to gently raise the lower jaw
      until the teeth on the upper jaw contact the top of the
      projections 5. The patient then closes their lips and swallows.
      The pressure applied to the to the appliance 1 by swallowing
      causes the material of the first layer 2 to deform and mould
      itself to the shape of the teeth on the lower jaw. The appliance
      can then be carefully removed from the mouth of the patient and
      submerged in cold water to accelerate the cooling of the appliance
      to ambient. Once the appliance has cooled, any excess of the first
      layer material can be trimmed away until it forms a comfortable
      fit.<br>
      <br>
      The fitting of the appliance can readily be performed by a doctor
      or dentist, without the services of a dental technician or having
      to resort to custom moulding practices in a laboratory, or by the
      patient without third party assistance.<br>
      <br>
      Once the appliance 1 has cooled to ambient temperatures and been
      trimmed, it may be used by the patient for reducing facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      The process for reducing facial aging can commence as soon as the
      appliance has cooled to a temperature where the material used to
      form the first layer has solidified sufficiently for use of the
      appliance not to cause remoulding of that layer. The patient
      positions the appliance 1 in the mouth. The patient then exercises
      the lower jaw passively to allow the jaw to come to rest in a new
      resting position. The patient should, at least initially, avoid
      exercising the lower jaw actively about the appliance.
      Accordingly, wearing of the appliance e.g. during eating or
      sleeping should preferably be avoided whilst the appliance is
      fitted in the mouth for at least such time until the facial
      muscles have substantially adjusted to enable the jaws to come to
      rest voluntarily in the new resting position Once the patient is
      used to wearing the appliance and substantially does not
      involuntarily clench the jaws around the appliance, the passive
      exercise is preferably repeated for about 6 to 7 hours a day over
      a period of about 6 weeks. Before this time, however, the patient
      will have to get used to wearing the appliance and train
      themselves not to clench their jaws whilst wearing the appliance.
      It is therefore recommended that the patient initially uses the
      appliance from about only [1/2] hour a day and builds-up the time
      of use over a period of about 2-3 weeks or more thereafter,
      depending upon the ease with which the patient gets used to
      wearing the appliance and exercising passively.<br>
      <br>
      The universal appliance may be tested on a sample of patients. The
      patients may be asked to wear the appliance at mealtimes over a
      specified period of time. 12 patients wore the appliance for 6
      weeks, 1 for 7 weeks, 4 for 8 weeks, 2 for 9 weeks, 3 for 10
      weeks, and 6 for 12 weeks. The results are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      The patients were asked:<br>
      <br>
      1) How comfortable was the appliance in the mouth on a scale of 0
      to 3 (0 being very uncomfortable and 3 being very comfortable)?<br>
      4 patients thought it was 1 on the scale of 0 to 3, 15 thought 2,
      and 9 thought 3.<br>
      <br>
      2) If you suffered from neckaches, headaches, shoulder pains, did
      these improve?<br>
      4 patients said they suffered from neck ache and 100% reported an
      improvement. 5 suffered from shoulder pain and 80% reported an
      improvement. 3 had headaches and 6% reported improvement.<br>
      <br>
      3) Do you think the treatment enhanced your facial features? Give
      your response on a scale between 0 and 3, 0 being no improvement
      and 3 being good. The number of features listed was 11 and were as
      follows: skin above the upper eyelid, size of the eyes, crows
      feet, lateral droop of the eyes, bags under the eyes, improvement
      in skin, naso labial folds, lips, jaw line, cheeks. The results
      were as follows;<br>
      <br>
      On an average patients noted an improvement in 7.5 of the 11
      features:<br>
      skin above the upper eyelid: 60.7% noted an improvement; size of
      the eyes: 57.1%; crows feet: 64.3%; lateral droop of the eyes: 71%
      noted an improvement; bags under the eyes: 57.1%; skin: 85.7%;
      naso labial folds: 71.4%; lips: 89.3%; jaw line: 64.3%; neck:
      64.3%; cheeks: 71.4%.<br>
      <br>
      All these improvements were from mild to very good, suggesting
      that the universal appliance could be successfully employed to
      reduce facial aging.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been described and illustrated in detail,
      various modifications and alternatives should become apparent to
      those skilled in this art without departing from the spirit and
      scope of the invention.<br>
