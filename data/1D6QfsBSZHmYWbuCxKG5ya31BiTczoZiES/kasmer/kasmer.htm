      <p>The Hydristor is an infinitely variable vane hydraulic
        pump/motor -- a simplified automatic transmission with no gears,
        with regenerative storage capability, offering to double or
        triple the mileage per gallon, and to cut emissions by 75%.
        Vehicle performance will improve, enabling any car to go from 0
        to 60 in three seconds using stored energy. Kasmer expects that
        the fuel-to-motion efficiency will be as high as 80%, compared
        to the low 30% range of present. The engine will last twice as
        long, because it can operate in its optimal range, and it
        doesn't have <br>
        to work as hard. Brake wear will be negligible. </p>
      <p>The hydristor unit will come in 4-6 basic sizes and will
        install inside the bell housing, replacing the transmission and
        clutch. The engine will no longer be a direct drive to the
        wheels, through the transmission, but will keep the hydristor
        unit adequately charged, and the hydristor unit will drive the
        wheels. The unit will store the energy from the engine and from
        braking and from going down hill, to be used for acceleration
        and speed maintenance. The engine could even be turned off for
        stretches of driving, while the vehicle runs on the stored
        energy. </p>
      <p>Kasmer also envisions pneumatic air pressure storage systems
        being employed that would enable up to 40 miles of travel
        without the engine running at all. A ten gallon air tank
        compressed to 5,000 psi is enough energy to propel a vehicle
        40-50 miles. The Hydristor systems are being engineered to hold
        10,000 psi. </p>
      <p>Another system Kasmer intends to include is a heat pump that
        will harvest the heat from the exhaust and radiator, to convert
        it into electricity. In another industry, this heat pump
        principle could also be used for electricity generation via the
        temperature difference between the ocean and the air. Kasmer
        thinks this could be done at a price that would compete with
        conventional energy sources. One Hydristor hydraulic unit will
        handle up to ten separate, variable demand tasks simultaneously.

          <i>Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin</i> </p>
        <p><i><font color="#000000">Vestal man travels across country to
              promote new form of auto transmission</font></i></p>
      </center>
      <p>He talks with the conviction of an evangelist on a religious
        revival. </p>
      <p>The eyes are penetrating. The conversation is focused. His
        full, 6-foot, 2-inch frame and the head of wavy, gray hair and
        youthful look belie this 65-year-old. It's hard not to notice
        Thomas E. Kasmer. And if you give him a minute, you won't soon
        forget him. </p>
      <p>"Talking to Tom is like trying to take a sip out of a fire
        hose," said Paul Robinson, an acquaintance from Modesto, Calif.
      </p>
      <p>Kasmer, of Vestal, just returned from a 7,000-mile journey --
        driving a GMC box-van with a John Deere lawn tractor tucked
        inside -- preaching the gospel of his Hydristor to anyone who
        would listen. </p>
      <p>Kasmer's odd-named Hydristor -- a combination of hydraulics and
        transistor -- is a device that, he says, will revolutionize the
        auto industry by cutting fuel costs, providing more power and
        reducing emissions. The Vestal resident boasts, with no hint of
        self-doubt, that his invention, now installed in that lawn
        tractor, will not only change the auto industry, but will also
        change the world. </p>
      <p>"It changes the entire paradigm of the way energy is handled,"
        Robinson said. </p>
      <p>That's a hard sell. And coming from an often intense Kasmer --
        a man who thought he could single-handedly transform the auto
        industry a decade ago with a sports car called the <i>Mag One</i>
        -- it's a sell that often stretches the limits of plausibility.
        But there are enough experts attesting to the feasibility of
        Kasmer's design to lend him at least a hint of credibility. </p>
      <p>The Hydristor, Kasmer says, replaces the transmission and the
        torque converter in an internal combustion engine, rendering it
        more efficient than traditional methods. </p>
      <p>"The Hydristor solves the age-old dilemma in the auto
        industry," Kasmer said. "It gives them the power they want in a
        car that lasts for more than eight years." </p>
      <p>As explained by Alan L. Hitchcock, editor of <i>Hydraulics
          &amp; Pneumatics</i>, a trade magazine, the Hydristor is a
        vane pump or motor that uses two pairs of pistons to vary the
        shape of a flexible pumping chamber. Kasmer says coupling a
        Hydristor pump back-to-back with a Hydristor motor forms a
        continuously variable transmission. </p>
      <p>"It's just like changing the sprockets on a multi-speed bike,"
        said Cliff Carlson, a former automotive engineer in Fenton,
        Mich. </p>
      <p>The device allows the engine to run at far lower revolutions
        per minute than now possible to get the power necessary to
        operate a vehicle, Kasmer said. </p>
      <p>"We have asked some experts that we know about the Hydristor,"
        said Wayne Walker of Republic Aerospace in Duncan, Okla. "The
        assessment is that it has potential and would be a substantial
        advance and innovation." </p>
      <p>Walker, chief executive of Republic, was one of the many Kasmer
        visited during his cross-country trek. Walker saw the
        Hydristor-outfitted lawn tractor and believes there may be
        potential for this device to deliver the efficiencies Kasmer
        claims. </p>
      <p>"The efficiencies have to do with the continuous nature of the
        transmission coupling," Walker said. "The savings are in energy
        and there are savings in weight." </p>
      <p><b>Big 3 snub</b> </p>
      <p>First, for Kasmer, there was the lawn tractor prototype. Now
        comes the hard work. The man who has done undergraduate and
        graduate work in physics at Binghamton University and once
        worked for IBM Corp. is outfitting a Ford Expedition with a
        Hydristor to further prove that the device delivers the kind of
        performance he promised on the open road. </p>
      <p>"The minute I get a Ford Expedition running (with a Hydristor)
        I'm going to have to run from the paparazzi," Kasmer said. </p>
      <p>Kasmer, as you can tell, is no wallflower. During his recent
        trip, he spent another five days in Las Vegas in March pushing
        his Hydristor at a construction and hydraulics trade show. The
        curious crowded around him. The well-connected industry types
        largely ignored him. </p>
      <p>There are plenty of skeptics, not least of which is the auto
        industry. He says he's had limited discussions with the Big
        Three, but interest is tepid at best. </p>
      <p>"The auto industry is very resistant to change," he said. </p>
      <p>And Kasmer acknowledges that investors too are seemingly
        reluctant to shell out cash to pay for further research on the
        device. All Kasmer offers is his vision for a bold new world
        where the Hydristor is outfitted in every virtually vehicle
        known to mankind. </p>
      <p>"Everyone out there gets 100 guys just like me a day," Kasmer
        said. "I'm fighting that. I'm kind of lost in the sea." </p>
      <p>Kasmer's battling history, which is rife with eccentric
        inventors who say their contraption will revolutionize this or
        that. Many turn out to be nothing but frauds. </p>
      <p>Hitchcock, the trade journal editor, knows the charlatans. He
        gets variations of perpetual motion machines pitched to him
        regularly. </p>
      <p>Hitchcock, an engineer by training, was at first doubtful of
        Kasmer's claims, but the more he studied the theory and the
        applications of Kasmer's Hydristor the more he became convinced
        that there may some merit in Kasmer's approach. </p>
      <p>"This is not a perpetual motion machine," said Walker of <i>Republic









          Aerospace</i>. The trade journal editor and auto industry
        engineer agree. </p>
      <p>"He hasn't broken any laws of physics," Carlson said. "In
        theory, it should work. The biggest advantage of his system is
        that it's very small and compact. I don't think I've seen a
        variable transmission as small and as simple as this." </p>
      <p><b>Unwilling to compromise</b> </p>
      <p>Getting from prototype to production, however, could be a large
        leap, especially for Kasmer, who is unwilling to compromise his
        business principles in the name of commercial success. </p>
      <p>"I want to find financing where I don't have to give up
        control," Kasmer said. And the strident tone of his voice when
        speaking about the control of his invention, the subject of
        three patents, gives you the sense that he means it. </p>
      <p>"Tom has every egalitarian, ethical goal in mind," Robinson
        said. "He wants to generate a win-win situation in all cases. He
        wants to see that the workers are honored, the shareholders are
        honored and the world gets his design." </p>
      <p>Under Kasmer's scenario, the Hydristor will be manufactured in
        the Southern Tier, giving rise to a new growth industry for the
        region. </p>
      <p>"I can have 5,000 people employed making Hydristors," Kasmer
        said, also noting its possible use for electric generation. </p>
      <p>But the inventor readily acknowledges that he would rather
        spend time tinkering with his invention than drafting business
        plans. Getting the Hydristor from the prototype into production
        could be even more difficult than coming up with the invention.
        Kasmer is an independent spirit, not one to take kindly to
        outside help. </p>
      <p>"He would benefit from a synergistic, experienced management
        team," said Walker, the experienced chief executive. </p>
      <p>The main question for Carlson is whether the Hydristor can
        deliver the performance needed in the quiet setting of a
        passenger automobile. These devices, Carlson said, have the
        propensity to be quite noisy. Carlson wonders whether the device
        could first be used in construction machinery, where noise is
        less of a factor. </p>
      <p>"He's got quite a ways to go before he can commercialize this,"
        Carlson said. </p>
      <p>No matter what advice outsiders give him, Kasmer will remain
        true to his cause. He expects the Hydristor-outfitted Ford
        Expedition to be ready in two to three months. He's confident
        that the three weeks he spent toting that John Deere lawn
        tractor from Binghamton to Tulsa to Las Vegas to Phoenix to Los
        Angeles to Bismark, N.D., to Minneapolis to Chicago to Jamestown
        will win him some much-needed financial and moral support. </p>
      <p>"I'm going to keep on going because I know what I'm doing is
        right," Kasmer said. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Gas Saver Or Tailpipe Dream?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by David Welch</b> </p>
        <p><i><font color="#cc0033">&nbsp;</font>A new kind of hybrid
            uses hydraulics instead of batteries to save fuel</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>Thanks to high fuel prices, hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles
        such as the Toyota Prius are constantly in the limelight. But
        far away from that glow, government scientists, auto parts
        engineers, and garage inventors are toiling on a distinctly less
        glamorous way to save fuel. It's a hybrid vehicle that pairs a
        gas engine with a hydraulic transmission. You may associate
        hydraulics with ancient, oily gear lifting heavy loads on farms
        and construction sites. But like everything old, this is new
        again. </p>
      <p>Whenever gas prices shoot up, inventors and tech companies come
        out of the woodwork, trumpeting the next mileage-boosting
        miracle. And certainly there is room for fresh thinking, since
        gas savings on hybrids and clean-diesel vehicles can take four
        years or more to make up for the difference in cost to the
        buyer. Maybe that's why parts makers such as Eaton Corp. and
        BorgWarner Inc. and a lonely inventor named Tom Kasmer are
        suddenly pushing hybrid hydraulic systems for everything from
        delivery trucks and garbage haulers to small cars and bicycles.
        The sales pitch: The hydraulic approach is relatively
        inexpensive. "This could be a better option than the hybrids on
        the road today," says Kasmer. </p>
      <p>Hydraulic hybrids have been ignored because they present big
        engineering challenges, noise being one. Even so, Eaton and the
        Environmental Protection Agency teamed up with United Parcel
        Service to put hydraulic delivery trucks on the road. In tests,
        the prototypes get upwards of 50% better fuel economy. Kasmer
        himself has failed to connect with a big carmaker so far, but
        his hybrid approach, known as a hydristor, has attracted
        interest from Bobcat Co., a construction equipment maker. "The
        technology will start with large commercial vehicles," says
        Sohan Uppal, vice-president for research for Eaton's fluid
        systems group. </p>
      <p>All hydraulic transmission systems have some basic features in
        common. They begin with a low-pressure tank filled with fluid,
        most often oil. When the driver hits the brakes, the liquid is
        pumped into a high-pressure tank. The pent-up fluid naturally
        wants to escape. But since it can't, pressure builds and energy
        is stored. Then, when the driver releases the brake and hits the
        accelerator, the liquid flows back to the low-pressure tank.
        Along the way, the rushing fluid turns vanes that rotate an
        axle, and the vehicle takes off. Only later does the gas engine
        take over. </p>
      <p>Gas-electric hybrids also achieve efficiency by capturing
        energy from braking. But Kasmer claims his hydristor would be
        cheaper than the computer controllers and batteries in
        Prius-like hybrids. Working independently of Kasmer, the EPA,
        Eaton, and BorgWarner reached the same conclusion. BorgWarner
        put a prototype system in a Chinese-made subcompact car, raising
        its mileage from 33 mpg to 40 in tests, says Bill Kelly,
        vice-president for drive train development. </p>
      <p><b>PEDAL POWER</b> </p>
      <p>It's in trucks, however, that the technology may really prove
        its value. Eaton's Uppal says the company has developed a system
        for garbage haulers that could reap terrific fuel savings
        because the vehicles could make up to nine stops in a row
        running on stored hydraulic power alone. EPA project manager
        John Kargul says that for a variety of trucks, the fuel savings
        from hydraulics could offset higher sticker prices in less than
        three years -- a tall order for today's pricier gas-electric
        hybrid designs. </p>
      <p>Truly exotic applications may be at hand. Stymied in Detroit,
        Kasmer is working with a major bicycle maker that hopes to adapt
        his design to replace conventional chains and gears. Such a bike
        might prove easier to build and pedal because the hydristor
        would make seamless, gear-like adjustments as the rider pumped
        up and down hills. </p>
      <p>Detroit's carmakers say that they have good reasons for keeping
        their distance. Thomas G. Stephens, group vice-president for
        power train operations at General Motors Corp., wrote in an
        e-mail that plenty of inventors have tinkered with hydraulics or
        related ideas. Yet he doesn't see how any could come close to
        doubling fuel economy, as Kasmer has claimed. And no matter how
        big their benefits, hydraulic systems are prone to leaks. </p>
      <p>Then there's the noise issue. "[They] groan like the landing
        gear on an airplane," admits Kelly of BorgWarner. Considering
        their shaky financial situation, U.S. automakers aren't likely
        to spend the research money needed to iron out these kinks.
        They're even less likely to bet the $1 billion it takes to scale
        up production of a new transmission, Kelly says. </p>
      <p>Kasmer still dreams of getting his hydristors into passenger
        cars. But he has to work on his presentation. When he spoke to a
        group of engineers at Munro &amp; Associates Inc., a Troy
        (Mich.) engineering consulting firm with clients such as
        DaimlerChrysler and Boeing Co., the demo impressed some of the
        engineers. But when they asked him for technical details, he
        balked at giving away design secrets. Instead, says Sandy Munro,
        principal of the firm and one of Kasmer's financial backers,
        Kasmer lectured listeners about cleaning up the air for
        tomorrow's children. The techies wanted more info, and when it
        wasn't forthcoming, a few headed for the door. </p>

      <p>An exclusive interview with Inventor Thomas Kasmer. By Eric
        Haase (11/11/04, updated 09/14/06) Danielle Randolph (copy
        editor); <b>United States Media Corps</b>. </p>
      <p>Inventor Thomas Kasmer may have the “killer app” for your car’s
        addiction to the Paleolithic era’s byproducts. Hydrogen fuel
        cells are delayed in becoming integrated within the automotive
        industry because of the required changes in national
        infrastructure &amp; a lingering liquid hydrogen storage tank
        problem (among other problems). </p>
      <p>Kasmer claims his Hydristor can be implemented into the basic
        design of modern automobile drive trains to cut fuel consumption
        in half and <i>increase</i>, NOT decrease performance. </p>
      <p>Perhaps equally important is the claim that most autos on the
        road today can be rather inexpensively retrofit with the
        hydristor. This would mean more immediate widespread results
        that could ease stress on the environment to a significant
        degree, while drastically reducing foreign oil dependence, &amp;
        thus discontinue lining enemy pockets with U.S. money. It might
        be a bit harder to fly airplanes into buildings halfway around
        the planet if you’re broke. </p>
      <p>There is quite a bit of technical information available about
        Kasmer’s patented Hydristor system on the web (follow the links
        at the end of the article for more information), but I wanted to
        find out what makes a guy like this tick. Kasmer developed the
        Hydristor virtually on his own with investments he solicited
        from private financiers. </p>
      <p>The Hydristor has literally been a lifetime in the making.
        Hydristor combines the words hydraulic &amp; transistor. Kasmer
        claims the automotive application is but one of the everyday
        needs this technology can revolutionize.. Or should I say
        'evolutionize'. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Thomas Kasmer was born in Binghamton, NY., and at the age of 17
        while attending high school he was awarded an apprenticeship for
        the IBM electronic training program in 1957. After two years,
        Tom enrolled at Harpers College for a curriculum of liberal arts
        in science. During this, he was hired by IBM as a consultant,
        and designed and co-patented the "Hydrapad", an automated
        hydraulic positioning drill for circuit board manufacturing. </p>
      <p>With an growing interest in high performance automobiles, Tom
        purchased 1963 Buick Rivera with a variable pitch "Dynaflow"
        transmission and a 425 cubic inch engine, which "really
        cooked....". After some adolescent tendencies for high speed,
        Tom joined the SCCA (Sports Car Club of America ), attended a
        driver's school at Wakins Glen, NY. , and went on to compete at
        the White Face Mt. Hillclimb, racing a 1962 split window
        Corvette in the summer of 1964. </p>
      <p>With an innovative idea for power and torque conversion on his
        mind, Tom decided he could do what no other could; build an
        infinitely variable hydrostatic transmission that was
        hydraulically and pressure balanced with the highest efficiency
        and horsepower on demand. </p>
      <p>After several years of prototype design work, Tom's first
        "Hydristor" proved to have a 94% efficiency for power transfer,
        as tested by Tecumseh Labs in Ann Arbor, MI. Inside the
        Hydristor you will find two independent circuits which are dual
        pressure balanced to minimize the torque shaft load. Each
        circuit can operate at various speeds, in neutral, and in
        reverse conditions. Surrounding an inner and outer impeller
        vanes are two stainless steel belts, designed to operate at high
        speed, and change shape to adjust the power band to handle an
        infinite amount of ratios for power conversion. The complete
        circuit is defined as a dual analog hydraulic transistor. Tom
        anticipates over 100 patents are involved and are currently in
        various forms of litigation. </p>
      <p>After 30 years of electronic, hydrostatic, magnetic, and
        industrial consulting, Tom Kasmer is ready to take his
        "Hydristor" to market. Currently, Tom has built a Hydristor
        specifically designed for a John Deere 200 series tractor. The
        unit's outer casing was machined out of one cubic foot of
        aluminum, and contains approx. 100 parts. The size of the unit
        dramatically increases hydraulic packaging weighing around 100
        lbs., and able to transfer up to 100 horsepower with a 94%
        efficiency. Standard torque conversion is at best 60% efficient.
      </p>
      <p>What does this mean for the consumer? Imagine a SUV with 100
        miles per gallon? Or zero to 60 in 3 seconds? If the efficiency
        for this type of hydrostatic power conversion is available, and
        the Hydristor prototype is here... so what's next? Tom's current
        plans are demonstrating the tractor, and building a Hydristor to
        replace factory torque converters for aftermarket installations.
        After that, the work will resume on the Mag One, a dual flywheel
        hydristor high performance concept car. </p>
      <p>Q: What is a Hydristor? A: It is a dual-analog hydrostatic
        transistor for mechanical energy conversion. </p>
      <p><b>From the Editor:</b> </p>
      <p>On April 27, 2001, I was very fortunate to visit with Tom
        Kasmer, inventor of the Hydrisor. It was several years since our
        last conversation, and I was invited to discuss the
        near-complete prototype he is currently designing. I was quite
        excited to visit him in the machine shop, and get a 'hands-on'
        description of the Hydristor. </p>
      <p>Tom walked me through both the assembly of the machined pieces,
        as well as a detailed item by item expanded view on the CAD
        workstation. Since this patented device is a prototype, I did
        not take any photos to respect Mr. Kasmer's intellectual
        property, but I did receive permission to post a link to a great
        technical article with images from Global Design News. </p>
      <p>Tom added that the current prototype is almost finished and
        will be installed into a John Deere Tractor. Other applications
        for the Hydristor in the works include a four-wheel drive van, a
        high-efficient torque converter for OEM and aftermarket
        suppliers, a golf cart, a heat pump for low temperature
        horsepower generation, and then it is possible the Mag One will
        be back on the drawing board. </p>
      <p>Several years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Tom Kasmer, a
        vehicle designer with an extensive background in many high-tech
        fields, and a resume' that included development of IBM hardware
        used widely around the globe. His vehicle, the "Mag One" was one
        of the most advanced concepts I have come across ever. </p>
      <p>Tom designed what he called the "Kasmer Hydristor" which was an
        infinitely variable hydrostatic transmission. This device was
        engineered to accept any amount of hydraulic force, and through
        the manipulation of 'analog' valve fluid gates, deliver the
        pressure to a dual set of Vickers hydraulic motors. Coupled to
        the "Hydristor" was a very unique flywheel, that contained a
        complex set of diode / commutators around / in the actual
        flywheel, which could 'energize' the flywheel with the smallest
        amount of electrical energy, not unlike a very advanced
        brushless DC servo motor. Attached to the flywheel was a special
        hydraulic pump that was engineered to work directly with the
        "Hydristor" manifold. There were no hydraulic hoses between the
        two devices, and the manifold was built to mount the dual
        Vickers motors, to which the drive shaft was connected. </p>
      <p>To advance this vehicle to it's full potential, the flywheel /
        manifold assembly was hydraulically actuated for yaw, pitch and
        roll. This was necessary for cornering at high speeds. ( editors
        note: this vehicle was engineered with an estimated horsepower
        around a staggering 1200 HP ) Also, Tom claimed that the Mag One
        could perform several tricks, like lift up on two side wheels (
        standing still ) and hang off a loading dock on two wheels
        without changing the horizontal position of the car.</p>
