      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This application incorporates by reference related patents U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 6,022,201; 3,153,984; and 2,589,449, and, GB Patent

      <p>Early devices to vary the displacement of vane pumps involved
        the deliberate offset of the rotational center of the vane rotor
        with respect to the geometrical center of the circular outer
        case. The amount of offset would then control the swept volume
        of the pump and thereby provide a desired volumetric output for
        each rotation of the rotor. Several problems with this design
        limited its use. </p>
      <p>First, the pressure unbalance caused by the hydraulic-based
        force on the radial cross-section of the rotor and vanes at the
        axis viewed from the radial perspective severely limited the
        power capability and power density of these pumps and resulted
        in very heavy, inefficient, and cumbersome devices. Second, the
        centrifugal force of each vane during high-speed rotation caused
        severe wear of the vane outer edge and the inner surface of the
        outer containment housing. </p>
      <p>Later fixed displacement design were conceived around the
        concept of pressure balance in which two geometrically opposed
        high pressure chambers would cause a cancellation of radial load
        due to equal and opposed cross-section pressure areas and
        opposite vector direction which resulted in a zero net force
        radially on the shaft bearing. The design is referred to as the
        pressure balanced vane pump or motor. Typical efficiency of
        these devices is 70 to 85% under rated loading and speed. Still
        later improvements include changing the chamber shape of
        pressure balanced vane style devices and involved the use of
        several types of adjustable inner surfaces of the outer housing
        for guiding and radially adjusting the vanes as they rotate. One
        improvement is a continuous band, which is flexible and subject
        to radial deformation so as to cause displacement control of the
        vanes. However, these flexible bands did not rotate. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The basic embodiment of this invention is a rotor with
        spring-biased, radially extensible vanes that are constrained in
        their outward radial movement, away from the rotor center of
        rotation, by the inner circumferential area of a continuous
        flexible band that has the same axial width as the rotor and
        vanes. It is especially important to notice in the basic
        embodiment that the flexible band is designed to rotate with the
        vanes and rotor. The spring loading of the vanes is by
        conventional means as is the practice with existing vane pumps
        and motors; namely that the spring is compressed between the
        rotor itself and the radially inward edge of the vane so as to
        drive every vane radially out from the rotor body against the
        inner area of the flexible band. The spring preload causes the
        vanes to contact the flexible band inside surface at slow speeds
        that include zero. This is especially important if this
        embodiment is to be used as a variable or fixed displacement
        hydraulic motor because hydraulic sealing of the vane's outer
        edge is assured at zero speed. Since the flexible band is
        totally free to rotate with the vanes and rotor, a very big
        source of friction, wear, and inefficiency is eliminated due to
        the teaching of this invention. The well known limitation of the
        prior art; namely the sliding edge friction associated with the
        combined outward radial force of the vanes is totally eliminated
        since there is substantially no relative motion between outside
        edges of the vanes and the interior constraining surface of the
        flexible containment band. Further, as the rotor's speed
        increases, the speed-squared radially outward combined force of
        the set of vanes is fully contained by the continuity of the
        flexible band simulating a pressure-vessel type of containment,
        as if the flexible band were a cross section of a pressure
        containment cylinder, and the individual radial outward force of
        the vanes were the pictorial radially outward arrows that are
        used in drawings to depict the action of the force which is
        contained. Since the action of the flexible band is to fully
        contain these combined radial forces of the vanes, there is
        absolutely no increase of frictional forces due to increasing
        radial vane force, and this invention solves a very severe
        limitation of the prior art in that the rotating speed of the
        fixed devices built according to the prior art is limited to
        about 4,000 revolutions per minute, while the upper speed limit
        of the subject invention is substantially higher, say to the
        range of 30,000 revolutions per minute, governed largely by the
        design strength and durability of the flexible band. In fact,
        testing showed that the efficiency of this invention utilizing
        the rotating components of a commercially available pump having
        an advertised efficiency of 88% resulted in efficiency
        measurements of 93.5 to 94.1% when used in combination with the
        rotating flexible band. The greater efficiency of the instant
        invention over the prior art will result in much smaller
        variable pumps and motors in severe applications such as
        spacecraft. The flexible band design and construction can cover
        a wide range of variables, from a single circumferentially
        continuous flexible band to concentric nesting of any practical
        number of individual circumferentially continuous flexible
        bands. The smallest circumference band is concentrically nested
        within a slightly larger second band and the second band is
        concentrically nested within a still larger inside circumference
        of a third and yet larger band, and so on, up to the largest
        outside band whose exterior surface is the exterior surface of
        the nest and the smallest inner band has its interior surface in
        contact with the exterior edge of each of the vanes. The
        construction is similar to the case of a stranded cable of a
        specific diameter having a much greater strength than a solid
        rod of the same diameter. Also, the stranded cable is more
        flexible without failure than the solid rod. The individual
        clearances between each of the bands in such a collective nest
        is chosen to allow slippage and lubrication from one band to the
        next. This nested band-to-band clearance results in a greater
        efficiency at very high operating speed by allowing a nested
        concentric set of bands to slip in speed from one concentric
        member to the next, with the inner band rotating at
        substantially the same speed as the rotor and the outer bands
        rotating increasingly slower. The material used to make the
        endless flexible band can be any appropriate metal, but other
        appropriate materials, such as plastic, fiberglass, carbon
        fiber, or KEVLAR.RTM., can be used. This construction material
        range applies whether a single thickness endless band is
        constructed, or a concentric nesting of two or more bands is
        used to make a concentric nesting of a number of bands. The
        description thus far is of a flexible circular and continuous
        containment band with the band confining all the radial
        centrifugal forces of vanes and eliminating contemporary
        problems such as sliding vane friction, the speed-squared
        frictional dependence, and the rotor speed limitation. The
        flexible band construction will also allow for the shape
        manipulation of the circumference of the band so as to permit
        varying the swept chamber volume as the rotor turns. </p>
      <p>Reshaping of the flexible band is necessary to control the
        swept chamber volume of the pump as the rotor is turning and
        comprises an array of radially moveable pistons which are at
        0.degree., 90.degree., 180.degree., and 270.degree. around a
        full circle, i.e., at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9
        o'clock of a clock face. Each of the pistons has an appropriate
        curvature to contact the flexible band external surface in the
        positions cited. If the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons are
        caused to move inward, the fixed circumference of the flexible
        band causes the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons to move outward
        by an equal amount. The inward or outward movement of the
        pistons may be driven by individual controlled hydraulic
        pressure, or the movement can be caused by mechanical means such
        as a gear and rack, or radially disposed screw drives to each
        piston. Another type of piston control means would be the
        joining of an analog type electric servo motor drive to a ball
        screw mechanism with an encoder position feedback; which
        arrangement would easily lend itself to digital control.
        Whatever the method of controlling the movement of the piston,
        the final purpose is to controllably elliptasize the flexible
        band from an axial perspective so as to cause the controlled and
        varying degrees of swept volume of fluid flow per revolution of
        the vane pump or motor. In the basic embodiment of this
        invention, opposing pairs of pistons move simultaneously towards
        or away from each other, while the remaining set of opposed
        pistons behave in simultaneous opposition to the action of the
        first pair. This behavior results in varying degrees of elliptic
        reshaping of the flexible band viewed from the axial perspective
        of the vane rotor. A novel and significant aspect of this device
        is the freedom of movement of the flexible band, which is
        impossible in the prior art. This includes a special
        manipulation of the pistons and band that allow the combination
        of this invention to simultaneously manipulate two common
        fluids, but hydraulically separate, outputs of this device as
        pump or motor. The variable pressure balanced design has two
        equal and identical pressure fluid outputs which will be merged
        so as to drive a hydraulic motor to form what is called a
        hydrostatic transmission. This is a second embodiment of the
        present invention. In addition, a second variable vane device of
        the proposed design may act as a motor in a conventional type of
        hydrostatic transmission with all of the current results, but
        with much greater efficiency and range. Another embodiment of
        the invention is a special piston manipulation that causes this
        invention to act like the early variable non-pressure balanced
        construction pumps with a single input and output. In the
        present invention, there is shown two separate hydraulic
        circuits with separate inputs and outputs where a single pump of
        the proposed design is separately connected to two fixed
        displacements hydraulic motors. Motor Number 1 will connect in
        closed hydrostatic loop with the first and second quadrant ports
        of the pump, while motor Number 2 will connect in closed
        hydrostatic loop to the third and forth quadrants with no
        interconnection. The plumbing of the motor circuits would be
        such that both motors would have the correct shaft rotation
        direction for a hypothetical example, say forward. If the 12
        o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons were directed inward, the 3
        o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons would be forced outward with equal
        hydraulic flow to both motors occurring, causing the motors to
        turn at the same controlled speed in the forward direction. Now
        assume that the original circular flexible band shape is
        modified such that the 3 o'clock piston is moved inward and the
        9 o'clock piston is moved outward, while holding the 12 o'clock
        and 6 o'clock pistons at neutral, the band remaining circular in
        shape. A first motor connected to the first and second quadrants
        will reverse shaft directions, with a speed equal to that of a
        second motor whose direction is still forward. If the 3 o'clock
        and 9 o'clock piston were both moved the other way, the second
        motor would instead reverse rotation in relation to the first
        motor. Combine this action with the original action of the basic
        embodiment as described, and one motor can be caused to rotate
        deliberately and controllably faster than the other motor, such
        as is the case for an axle set of a vehicle going around a turn.
        Another embodiment of the invention has two separate piston
        control methods which can be algebraically mixed to effect
        differential control means of axle rotation for negotiating a
        turning radius. Another embodiment comprises a fixed
        displacement motor of the prior art constructed in the manner of
        this invention, with the pistons permanently fixed. This
        arrangement will be much more efficient than conventional
        hydraulic motors. A still further embodiment is the case of
        fixed displacement motors and pumps which can greatly improve
        the efficiency of existing vane pump and motors; namely that one
        or several flexible bands-of the proposed invention construction
        can be closely fitted to be movable just inside the fixed
        elliptic or circular cam ring surface of conventional units,
        with a small clearance between the flexible ring exterior and
        the fixed cam ring interior, said clearance supporting an oil
        film which has minimal friction, while the vane outer edges are
        now supported by the innermost flexible band's inner surface.
        This construction provides some of the advantages of the subject
        invention, such as containment of vane centripetal force, and
        the replacement of vane-to-fixed cam ring friction with broad
        oil film friction that is much less, and not speed squared
        dependent. The primary invention configured as a fixed unit will
        still be most efficient due to the open chamber between each
        fixed piston pair. A smaller total oil film in this case will
        give the least loss. A significant advantage of the just
        described construction is the ability to fix existing design, or
        even retrofit field product without any mechanical change
        required. Existing vane units could compete with fixed piston
        pumps and motors in terms of efficiency, but would be less
        efficient than the basic embodiment. This is a fifth embodiment
        of the invention. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The isometric view shown in FIG. 1 has a frontal first quadrant
        cutaway that exposes some very important features of the
        invention. The rear end plate 1 is shown with the first quadrant
        kidney port 16 exposed. The front end plate 2 is partially
        cutaway with the kidney ports 17, 18, and 19 respectively in the
        second, third and fourth quadrants showing. The rear end plate 1
        has like kidney ports 20, 21, and 22 in axial alignment with
        ports 17, 18, and 19, but those ports in plate 1 are out of view
        in this drawing. This view shows like kidney ports front and
        back. However, it is only necessary to have one port per
        quadrant chamber to allow for fluid flow into and out of the
        chamber. Either the front or rear ports can be utilized, or both
        can be used to increase the flow capacity. Also, referring to
        FIG. 4, any other means of porting which allows fluids to flow
        into or out of the volume 33, 34, 35, or 36 when they rotate in
        alignment with "quadrants one, two, three, or four" may be used.
        Front kidney port 23 is in the cutaway portion of end plate 2,
        and is in axial alignment with port 16. Piston 12 is exposed and
        is itself cut away at an angle to expose the high pressure fluid
        film 13 which exists between the curved inner surface of the
        piston, and the outer circumferential area of the flexible band
        nest 14. The piston interface shape as shown is curved; however,
        any surface shape that supports the fluid film 13 can be used.
        Each of the four pistons has a fluid film 13. Several vanes 24
        are exposed by the cutaways. The outer casting 25 has four
        piston guides and four control ports 26. The ports 26 direct the
        inlet and exhaust of fluid control pressure to the four pistons
        to effect reshaping of flexible band 14. The invention is
        totally symmetric in hydraulic function and can function
        interchangeably as a hydraulic motor. The front end plate 2 has
        a hole 27 in it to permit the insertion of a drive shaft that
        will couple to the rotor 15 by means of the internal splines 28.
        The drive shaft is not shown so as to minimize the complexity of
        the figure. Seals and bearings of conventional design are also
        left out for the same reason. The shaft requires both a seal and
        bearing in plates 1 and 2 to facilitate the rotation of the
        rotor 15, the vanes 24. The four holes 29 in each of plates 1
        and 2 would allow for four bolts which would tightly hold both
        of the end plates against the outer casting 25; however, any
        appropriate number of bolts may be used, and any other means of
        construction which hydraulically contains the rotor 15, vanes
        24, band 14, and shape control means such as the pistons 12, 3,
        6, and 9 may also be used. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows an axial end view of the invention with the end
        plates removed, and with dotted outlines of end plate 2 with
        ports 17, 18, 19, and 23 outlined. The four control pistons
        numbered 12, 3, 6, and 9 are now shown. Shaded areas 31 are
        filled or exhausted by the control ports 26 to allow control
        fluid into and out of the chamber 31 behind the four pistons 12,
        3, 6 and 9. As shown in FIG. 11, the flexible band 14 had three
        concentric members 52, 53, and 54. These bands are preferably of
        stainless steel, each having a thickness in the order of 0.015
        inches. The actual number and thickness of bands to be utilized
        will be determined by the design requirements. Also, as shown in
        FIG. 11, each vane 24 has compression springs 32 mounted in
        rotor 15 that force the vane out from the center of the rotor 15
        into contact with the inner surface of the band 14. Three
        springs and bores are provided for mating with three pins 51 on
        each vane with the pins being equally spaced along the base of
        the vane. Such band and spring combinations are found in U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,325,215 which is incorporated by reference herein.
        This action assures that the vanes will seal fluid pressure at
        zero speed. It is a very important feature of this invention
        that the rotor 15, all the vanes 24, and the flexible band 14
        will rotate as a group. At very slow speeds, the band will slip
        very slightly with regards to the vane speed, much like a
        squirrel cage a.c. induction motor rotor will slip behind the
        field rotation speed. This slow drift is the result of fluid
        shear drag caused by the four fluid films 13, which act so as to
        slow down the flexible band 14 speed. This drag force is
        counteracted by the combined line contact friction of, in this
        example, nine vanes. The vane friction is much greater than the
        fluid film friction, and the vane friction increases as the
        speed squared. Thus, as the speed of rotation increases, the
        flexible band will begin to rotate as substantially the same
        speed as the rotor. Since the vane and band speed never quite
        equalize, the wear on the inner surface of the flexible band is
        evenly distributed over the entire inner band surface, and the
        maximum wear life is achieved. Since the centrifugal, speed
        squared forces are totally contained by the flexible band, the
        wear and failure mechanism of high-speed vane type pumps and
        motors is eliminated. The added friction of four fluid contact
        areas 13 is small compared to the combined vane friction, and
        does not increase significantly with higher speed. The result is
        a device which is much more efficient than any conventional
        design and which will operate efficiently at much higher speeds.
        These factors also allow for quieter operation at higher
        operating pressure. In FIG. 3, areas of the end plate 2 are
        marked 30 with identical areas axially in line therewith on end
        plate 1. A radial wedge shaped chamber 33 is shown directly
        under piston 3. Referring to FIG. 2, the front and back aligned
        areas 30 completely cover the axial ends of the chamber 33.
        Fluid pressure in quadrants one is prevented from directly
        flowing into quadrants two, and vice versa. If the rotation of
        the rotor is clockwise, the volume of chamber 33 will move from
        quadrant one to quadrant two in one ninth of a revolution. Since
        the chamber 33 is now closed on both ends by the presence of
        solid area 30, the volume of chamber 33 which was part of the
        first quadrant chamber volume is now forced into the second
        quadrant chamber. Simultaneously, 34 rotated from the fourth
        quadrant chamber into the first quadrant chamber. If the
        flexible band is formed to a circle, then volume 33 is equal to
        volume 34, and there is no gain or loss of fluid volume in any
        of the four quadrant chambers. This is true regardless of speed
        or direction. If ports 18 and 23 were connected to the inlet
        port of a separate fixed displacement hydraulic motor, and the
        motor's return port was connected to device ports 17 and 19, the
        shape of the flexible band would be called neutral because the
        pump would not move any fluid into or out of the motor, and the
        motor shaft would not turn since a fixed displacement of fluid
        must occur in order for the motor to turn. If ports 23 and 17
        were connected to one fixed displacement motor, and ports 18 and
        19 were connected to another such motor, the result would be
        exactly the same. In either case, the input shaft of the
        variable pump would continue to turn with no motion ever on a
        motor shaft. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4, control pressure is injected into the control ports
        26 for pistons 12 and 6 causing them to move radially inward.
        Any other mechanical means of control, such as rack 58 and
        pinion 60 actuable by lever 61 as shown in FIG. 11, would act in
        a similar manner to the pressure and cause pistons 12 and 6 to
        move radially inward due to external mechanical force. The
        spring action of the flexible band causes it to bulge out in
        equal measure against the pistons 3 and 9, while causing those
        pistons to move radially outward while exhausting the control
        fluids volume out through control ports 26. The use of
        mechanical control here would require that the mechanical
        controls means would retract to allow for the spring action of
        the band 14 to push pistons 3 and 9 outward. The arrows at the
        control ports 26 show the direction of fluid flow. Now for this
        discussion, a clockwise rotation is chosen. FIG. 4 also shows
        maximum deflection of the flexible band 14. Rotating vane
        chambers 34 and 35 are shown as minimized, while the chamber 33
        and 36 are maximized. Since chamber 33 is removing a much larger
        volume of fluid from the first quadrant than the chamber 34 is
        carrying in, the difference must be provided via either kidney
        ports 23 or 16. Therefore, ports 23 or 16 are suction ports that
        can be connected to an external hydraulic circuit, and fluid is
        drawn into "quadrant one" through those ports. Chamber 33 is
        very large when it rotates into the second quadrants, and
        chamber 35 now is very small in exiting. The large difference of
        the volumes must therefore be forced out kidney ports 17 or 20
        into the external hydraulic path. Ports 23 and 16, and 17 and 20
        form a hydrostatic loop when connected to an external fixed
        displacement hydraulic motor. For reference, look at schematic
        connection in FIG. 9. By varying the radial positions of the
        pistons 12, 3, 6, and 9, the fluid displaced can be fully
        controlled from zero to the maximum in any increment. Now, ports
        18 and 21, and 19 and 22 will form a second Siamese hydrostatic
        loop when they are connected to a second external hydraulic
        motor. For like displacements of the pistons 12 and 6, and
        opposite and equal motion of pistons 3 and 9, the fluid flow
        through fluid circuit A which consists of ports 23 and 16, and
        17 and 20 will exactly equal the flow through fluid circuit
        consisting of ports 18 and 21, and 19 and 22. This described the
        case of straight motion for a set of vehicle axles. The simple
        case of ports 23 and 16 paired with 18 and 21, and 17 and 30
        with 19 and 22, and then connected to a single fixed or variable
        hydraulic motor is also straight-line motion. For Reference,
        look at the fluid connection shown in FIG. 8. As the rotor,
        vane, and flexing band assembly rotate, the action of the
        elliptasized band will be to force the compression and extension
        of the vanes 24, with regard to angular position only. The
        pressure being applied to pistons 12 and 6 through ports 26
        causes the pistons to move inward. For the clockwise rotation,
        output hydraulic pressure will escalate in the second and fourth
        quadrants chambers. As the chamber pressure increases, an
        increasing radial outward force develops on the underside of
        pistons 12 and 6, thereby reducing the respective piston inward
        force. When the outward force is equal to the inward force, the
        piston inward motion ceases. As the external hydraulic motor
        circuit responds to pressure and turns, the developed pressure
        drops slightly, and allows the pistons 12 and 6 to move slightly
        more inward, and this in turn increases the volume of fluid
        passing through the variable pump, in turn causing the motor to
        turn faster, thus causing a further line drop, causing more
        piston motion in, and so on. Therefore, the pressure developed
        in the quadrant chambers is equal to, or in proportion to the
        control force, and the variable pump automatically changes its
        displacement to accommodate changing external flow, while
        holding the out pressure proportional to the control pressure.
        Thus the hydraulic motor torque is a function of control
        pressure regardless of variable pump input speed and direction
        and output motor speed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 depicts the opposite case of piston operation in that
        pistons 3 and 9 are pressurized, causing them to move radially
        inward. Pistons 12 and 6 are forced out and the ellipse flexible
        band major axis is now vertical. Swept chamber volume 34 now is
        large, as is volume 35, while volumes 33 and 36 are now small.
        There is now an excess of fluid entering the first and third
        quadrant chambers and kidney ports 23 and 16, and 18 and 21
        become pressure ports, while a shortage of fluid in the second
        and fourth quadrants results in kidney ports 17 and 20, and 19
        and 22 becoming suction ports and the hydraulic motor would now
        reverse direction. Note that in the case of FIGS. 4 and 5, if
        the shaft rotation of the pump input were reversed, the external
        fluid direction would also reverse and the manipulation of the
        opposed sets of control pistons, both the volume and direction
        of the fluid output can be fully controlled. Also note that by
        pressurizing the opposite sets of pistons to the pair shown in
        FIGS. 4 and 5, the subject pump can be used as a variable
        hydraulic motor. This is an ideal component for interface
        between an energy storage flywheel and road wheels. The device
        as a pump can also interface to a flywheel or electric motor
        including a pancake design motor and can act to use or recover
        flywheel or motor energy directly. During acceleration, the pump
        will withdraw the prestored kinetic energy from the flywheel and
        direct it to the road wheels so as to accelerate a vehicle.
        During braking, the opposite pistons try to force the flexible
        band back into a circular shape and in so doing, cause the pump
        to behave like a motor which then will act to re-accelerate the
        flywheel to near its initial speed. During the braking action,
        straight-line vehicle energy is recycled back into the flywheel
        and the vehicle is brought to a standstill. The braking action
        is the same for either a single output motor or two motors. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows control pressure being injected into port 26
        causing piston 3 to move inward. Control fluid flows from port
        26 of piston 9, and the entire flexible band moves toward piston
        9 while maintaining a circular shape. Rotating chambers 34 and
        33 behave as in FIG. 5 although with lesser amounts of fluid
        displacement per revolution. However, if a second motor is
        connected to ports 18 and 19, as shown in FIG. 9, it would
        experience a reversal of direction because chamber 36 is now
        larger than chamber 35, while at the same time, chamber 36 is
        larger than chamber 34. The third quadrant becomes suction while
        the fourth quadrant becomes the pressure. This is the behavior
        of some industrial skid-steer loaders that reverse the rotation
        of the wheels on one side of the vehicle with respect to the
        other side, causing the vehicle to spin on its vertical axis. If
        piston 9 were pressurized instead 3, both fluid circuits would
        reverse, and the two motors would now spin in opposite
        directions which are both reverse according to the original
        directions. During all of the above behavior, note that the
        control ports 26 of pistons 12 and 6 were quiescent with no
        inward or outward motion of these pistons. Also, during this
        differential action, a pressure balance within the pump is no
        longer maintained, and such differential action should be
        limited in duration and power level so as to minimize shaft
        bearing load and therefore maximize pump life. FIG. 7 combines
        the differential control action with the normal displacement
        control to achieve special unequal flow to the motors for the
        purpose of driving two wheels unequally, but correctly around a
        turn, since the outside wheel rotates faster than the inside
        wheel. Further, the amount of differential action can be
        directly related to the correct wheel track in response to a
        steering input. Thus, a very unique control mechanism is
        obtained for driving both wheels in turns and this will greatly
        enhance vehicle traction and safety. In this case, differential
        control pressure 37 is applied to ports 26 of pistons 3 and 9,
        while normal control pressure 38 now is simultaneously applied
        to those same ports. The resultant control pressure 39 and
        volume obtain at piston 9 may be different from the control
        pressure and volume obtained 31 applied to piston 3. The result
        is the combination of circular displacement of the flexible band
        14 with reshaping of the band at the same time. The result is a
        different but controlled speed of one more with respect to a
        second, as shown in FIG. 9 resulting in a differential two-wheel
        drive. The differential portion of the control can be derived
        from the steering system, while the go and stop motion can be
        derived from brake and acceleration pedals. FIG. 8 shows the
        variable pump connected to either a fixed displacement hydraulic
        motor or another variable pump that is used as the motor to form
        a hydrostatic transmission. The conventional hydraulic motor
        case is limited to the range of one-to-one and one-to-infinity,
        where the use of a second variable unit extends the range to
        infinity to one. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 shows the schematic connection of one variable device to
        two fixed hydraulic motors, utilizing the Siamese ports of the
        invention to drive two separate outputs. This connection will
        allow the differential feature of the invention to be in use to
        differentially drive the two motors so as to effect a
        differential drive to the motor outputs, which is the case in a
        vehicular axle set negotiating a turn. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 shows the installation of a flexible band 14 in a
        conventional vane pump. The vanes 24 and rotor 15 are of
        conventional construction, like the proposed invention. The
        outer housing 40 is of conventional manufacture and chamber
        design, and the oil film 41 separates the band 14 from the outer
        housing 40 which will reduce operating friction in conventional
        units. The oil film 41 in this case is the full length of the
        ground internal chamber of the conventional outer housing. The
        sliding friction of the set of vanes is eliminated, and replaced
        by a broad oil film 41 of lesser friction; and, the efficiency
        of the conventional vane pump or motor is improved. Fixing the
        piston arrangement shown in FIGS. 4 through 7 will result in a
        fixed displacement pump or motor, whose efficiency will be the
        highest of all due to a reduced oil film 41 area. </p>
      <p>For referential purposes, all radial orientation described
        hereinbelow is with respect to the axial center of a rotor in
        accordance with the present invention, unless otherwise stated.
        Stated another way, "radial" in this context means to emanate to
        and from the axial center of the cylindrical rotor, unless
        otherwise stated. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 12a-12c are views showing a crankshaft piston drive 100
        utilizing a right angle slot 102 in the piston 104 relative to
        the length and motion of the piston. As shown in FIGS. 12a-12c,
        when the crankshaft 106 is rotated counter clockwise relative to
        the crankshaft rotational center 108 shown, the piston moves
        from a neutral position to a position radially inward. Thus, the
        crankshaft exerts a radially inward movement thereby forming a
        flush communication between a contoured and curved end of the
        piston and the flexible band 110, depressing the band radially
        inward. Conversely, when the crankshaft is rotated clockwise of
        the crankshaft rotational center, the piston retracts radially
        outward from the flexible band, and the spring action of the
        band causes it to follow the piston. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 12a-12c, a
        control crankshaft operates in a right angle slot in the piston.
        The crankshaft throw is typically positioned at a right angle to
        the direction of piston travel, and is rotated plus or minus 90
        degrees to cause a sinusoidal motion of the piston thereby
        resulting in a radially reciprocal (radially inward and then
        radially outward) motion of the piston. Thus, the linear and
        radial reciprocal motion of the piston corresponds to a sine
        wave responsive to each degree of crankshaft rotation. The
        spring like nature of the band causes it to remain in intimate
        contact with the piston surface via a thin oil film, thus
        forming a hydrodynamic bearing from the oil film. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 13, yet another piston actuator is shown wherein a
        lever is externally controlled to effect respective radially
        inward and outward motions of the piston. The lever can thus be
        controlled by any connection that provides a common manipulation
        of the plurality of pistons (or shape actuators of the flexible
        band) shown in the Figures, or the lever can be individually
        controlled. For example, simple manipulation of a foot pedal (an
        accelerometer for example) can effect manual control of the
        piston through the use of the lever. </p>
      <p>FIG. 14 generally depicts the forces acting on a given piston.
        A steady state control pressure is radially inwardly applied to
        a radially outward cross-sectional area of the piston. During
        operation, as the work pressure increases below the flexible
        band, it exerts a radially outward force acting upon a radially
        inward contoured section of the piston. As the work pressure
        increases and decreases, therefore, the piston is cycled
        radially outward and radially inward. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, FIG. 14 illustrates that relative to direct
        hydraulic piston control, an area radially outward of the piston
        is subject to a controlled hydraulic pressure which causes the
        piston to move radially inward. This action causes the pump to
        develop a greater work pressure by virtue of the fact that
        radially inward movement of the piston causes increased
        displacement output of the pump. This in turn causes the working
        pressure to rise. When the work pressure has reaches a value
        which balances the net force created on the piston by the
        control pressure, the piston inward motion ceases, providing a
        servo-type of control function wherein the pump working pressure
        tracks the control pressure. Thus, this type of control system
        forms a power amplifier where the output pressure of the pump
        tracks the control pressure with the result that the control
        pressure controls the power output linearly. This same operating
        principle is exhibited by the embodiment shown in FIG. 16, as
        described below. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 15, yet another piston actuator is shown containing a
        control screw 114 threadedly received in an axial bore 116 of
        the piston 104. The control screw is thus rotatable to advance
        or retard piston position. The control is linearly related in
        that the degree of screw rotation is directly related to the
        cyclic and radial piston motion. Given the screw's inherent
        design inhibition for radially outward retraction of the piston,
        this type of piston actuator is particularly useful in
        preventing feedback (and an applied torque to an associated
        actuator) due to applied torque or work performance spikes. For
        example, the standard jarring caused during tractor operation
        may result in an associated pressure spike within the rotor that
        is then transmitted through the piston and into the actuator.
        Therefore, the resultant torque absorbed by other types of
        actuators, a rack and pinion for example, could potentially
        fracture the actuator assembly. The retraction inhibition of
        this embodiment is one solution to this problem. Nevertheless, a
        ball-screw control means may be used to reduce the friction of
        the control screw if desired. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, FIG. 16
        depicts yet another piston actuator that can be described as a
        small closed-loop servo system. A piston spool housing 118 is
        formed as an axial bore within the piston 104. A plurality of
        radially extending passages, relative to the axial bore of the
        piston, facilitate injection and exhaust of fluidic pressure
        within the piston spool housing. A spool 120 having a plurality
        of turns 122 (two as shown) is slidably received within the
        piston spool housing. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 16, the spool and piston are shown in a
        balanced position. Stated another way, the control pressure
        force exerting a radially inward force on the piston and the
        opposing working pressure exerting a radially outward force on
        the piston are substantially equivalent wherein the spool
        exhibits an equilibrium position relative thereto. In operation,
        assume the spool is forced radially inward into the piston
        housing. A fixed control pressure is then injected through
        passage 124 given that the turn blocking the passage has been
        thrust radially inward thereby opening passage 124. The control
        pressure then flows radially outward through passage 126 in
        fluid communication with the pressure chamber 125 behind the
        piston 104. As a consequence, the control pressure increases the
        radially inward force applied to the radially outward
        cross-section of the piston (within the control pressure
        chamber) thereby biasing the piston radially inward. As this
        occurs, the working pressure against the piston (pump output)
        increases, and the relative position of the spool is returned to
        a neutral balance as the physical position of the piston moves
        to realign with the new neutral spool position. </p>
      <p>If the working pressure overcomes the applied piston control
        pressure, the spool is retracted radially outward through the
        piston spool housing by virtue of the physical movement of the
        piston body relative to the existing spool position, thereby
        opening passages 128 and 130 and thus enabling exhaust of the
        control pressure and effectively reducing the associated piston
        control force. The reduction in the control pressure force
        results in the working pressure biasing the piston radially
        outward thereby reducing pump displacement and the localized
        working pressure. The reduction of working pressure continues
        until the working pressure is reduced to a point less than the
        remaining control pressure (and the spring energy exerted by a
        spring locator (not shown) on the radially outwardmost end of
        the spool) within the control pressure chamber. The piston thus
        "tracks" the piston control pressure and again seeks the
        balanced position of the spool as described above. The valving
        arrangement results in low requirements of the force applied to
        the spool compared to the piston reaction force, or, the working
        force applied against the piston. Thus, the force requirement on
        the spool for control is minimized by means of the secondary
        power servo spool system described. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, the system described in FIG. 16 is a
        hydraulic control amplifier spool means useful in applications
        where the working pressure forces exerted on the piston(s) are
        relatively very high. A secondary dedicated spool amplifier may
        be employed thus permitting a greatly reduced control force
        requirement, and thereby facilitating the control of very large
        levels of power with a small control force. A transistor
        analogue would be the Darlington amplifier. Relative thereto,
        the control means described in FIG. 16 may also be referred to
        as a "Darlington Power Amplifier". </p>
      <p>FIG. 17 shows yet another piston actuator containing an
        externally controlled cam 132 and a cam roller 134. The cam
        roller is fixed to a radially outward portion of the piston. The
        cam profile 132 is slidably engaged with the roller in linear
        motion thereto, and thus effects a radial reciprocal movement of
        the piston 104. The cam motion can be linear as shown, or the
        cam motion can be circular around the pump rotor center. Related
        thereto, FIG. 21 shows a circular cam ring 135 containing four
        cam profiles 136 each cam corresponding to a piston within the
        four-piston model shown. In motion, the cam ring thus
        facilitates common and simultaneous control of all four pistons
        wherein the cam profiles may all be the same or different, and
        may be linear and/or nonlinear. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 18-20 each also illustrate a control linkage means for
        facilitating common and simultaneous operation or control of a
        plurality of pistons. A "pump center of rotation" is defined for
        each control linkage and is merely the axial center of the rotor
        and pump (not shown). Thus, each control linkage surrounds a
        rotor/pump as shown in FIGS. 1-11 for example. </p>
      <p>FIG. 18 shows a plurality of sprockets 138 (four) corresponding
        to an equal plurality of pistons (not all shown) and associated
        crankshafts (not all shown). Each sprocket rotatably
        communicates with a respective crankshaft that upon revolution
        results in radial reciprocation of the respective piston. An
        externally driven chain 140 results in simultaneous rotary
        motion of the sprockets. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 shows an alternative control linkage means that again
        contains a plurality of gears 142, a corresponding plurality of
        crankshafts, and a corresponding plurality of pistons. In
        concert therewith, an externally driven ring gear 144, radially
        external or internal of the plurality of gears, facilitates a
        common and simultaneous control of the pistons. The ring gear is
        formed with a plurality of sets of teeth symmetrically spaced
        about the circumference of the ring, each set of teeth
        corresponding to a piston. In the embodiment shown, the teeth
        are formed at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. In
        operation, the sets of teeth of the ring gear engage the teeth
        of a respective sprocket or gear thereby throwing the crankshaft
        and facilitating radial movement of the associated piston. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of FIG. 20 operates very similarly to FIGS. 18
        and 19. However, FIG. 20 employs a plurality of crowned flat
        pulleys 146 or gears (again corresponding to an equal number of
        pistons and crankshafts) driven by a belt 148 for simultaneous
        control of the plurality of pistons. </p>
      <p>Relative to FIG. 22, a differential gear set with independent
        control inputs can be added to pistons at the 3 and 9 O'clock
        positions in the embodiment shown in FIG. 7, for example,
        thereby facilitating differential behavior of a vehicle per
        operation of a rotor as shown in FIG. 7. In certain cases
        relative to vehicle operation, for example, it is undesirable to
        allow the differential input to cause opposite wheel rotation.
        For example, if the differential gear control were connected to
        a tractor steering wheel without any relation to the forward or
        reverse speed setting, the tractor would stand still and turning
        the steering wheel would cause one wheel to back up, while the
        other would drive forward with the result that the wheels would
        chew up the surface and dig two holes for the drive wheels. This
        is of course unacceptable. A solution has been discovered
        whereby a third axial control system for the 3 O'clock and 9
        O'Clock crankshafts is introduced. In neutral position
        (stopped), the crankshafts are at 90 degrees to the piston
        direction (See FIG. 12a). The solution is to vary the actual
        stroke of the crankshaft by means of an axial ramp system which
        is able to vary the stroke in response to an axial (with respect
        to the crankshaft) control input motion. As shown in FIGS.
        22a-22c, the stroke can be changed when the piston is in the
        neutral position without causing any change in the piston
        position. If the crank were at perhaps 30 degrees of control
        rotation, increasing or decreasing the stroke would as shown
        affect the piston position. If the 3 O'Clock stroke was
        increased while the 9 O'Clock stroke was decreased by the same
        amount, the effect would be to create a shift in the flexible
        belt position, causing a differential behavior, while allowing
        the speed control portion of the control to ellipticize the
        belt, causing perhaps forward motion. The result is a
        mathematical addition of flows on one side of the rotor, and a
        mathematical subtraction of flows on the other side of the
        rotor, and a true differential drive system results. </p>
      <p>If the speed were increased, the crankshaft control angle would
        increase, but the variable crankshaft strokes would have same
        mathematical effect on the combined differential/speed behavior,
        and the drive wheels would again be mathematically corrected to
        turn at the correct, yet faster rate for the turn. The same
        principles apply for the reverse direction. A separate control
        input can be accomplished to only cause differential behavior.
        This is only applicable for a four-wheel drive unit. This can be
        accomplished by connecting a properly sized hydraulic wheel
        motor for, perhaps the left front wheel tire (sized to reflect
        the smaller tire diameter of that front tire) in hydraulic
        series with the left rear wheel (larger) motor with the result
        that the hydraulic pressure forced through the left hydraulic
        circuit is shared by the two motors, and their speeds are locked
        in synchronicity; a series non-slip system. The same system can
        be used for the right side with similar results. In normal
        four-wheel drive, the four wheels are driven at the correct rate
        in terms of the tire patches on the ground, and the effect is as
        if all axles were locked for straight-line travel, with maximum
        traction, even though the vehicle is turning. This system
        results in giving the maximum traction under all ground
        conditions, and is thought to be a form of analog hydraulic
        computer which calculates, using the laws of geometry, the
        correct hydraulic behavior in response to control inputs. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention,
        FIGS. 23a and 23b describe a spool rotor having spool ends that
        are then mated respectively to wear plates known in the art. See
        U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201 for example. Slots 107 facilitate fluid
        flow in and out of the chambers defined between the vanes. The
        spool ends eliminate the wear pattern normally caused by the
        flexible belt as the edges of the belt abrade the inner surfaces
        of the wear plates adjacent each respective spool end. The use
        of the spool thus eliminates the effective motion between the
        edges of the vanes:extending from the axis to the flexible belt
        and the stationary wear plates. The spool ends are instead in
        rotary communication with the stationary wear plates. As a
        result, the vanes can be individually sealed along their
        individual radial lengths and along the interface between an
        inner surface of the spool end and the radial lengths of the
        vanes. Additionally, a flexible o-ring or seal may be place
        between belt and the radial outer edges of the vanes in
        communication with the flexible belt that is then flexibly
        adjusted during rotation to retain a seal between the radial
        outer edges of the vanes and the inner surface of the rotational
        flexible belt. Accordingly, employment of the spool ends
        substantially improves the volumetric and overall efficiency of
        the pump. For example, in certain cases the volumetric
        efficiency is improved from 85% to 97% or greater. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, in conventional designs, the vanes and the
        rotor are axially coextensive and fit within wear plates at both
        ends with a small clearance. This small clearance causes
        substantial volumetric inefficiency, or bypass of pumped fluid.
        Also, the radially outer edges of the vanes have a leakage
        contribution in conventional designs where the vanes slide at
        speed against the inner surface of the chamber to create the
        pumping action. U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201 substantially solved the
        problem of radial leakage by providing vanes having intimate
        contact within the inner surface of the belt. Conventionally,
        the axial ends of the vanes slide at rotor speed against the
        wear plates making effective sealing impossible. The spool
        design of the present invention therefore solves several
        problems. It eliminates the high speed wear at the ends by
        containing the vanes wholly within the spool ends, so that the
        only wear on the vanes is relative to the cyclical radial motion
        of the vanes during operation. This arrangement thus permits a
        seal system at the vane ends in addition to the vane outer edge
        abutting the inside surface of the flexible band. By adding a
        seal between the vane surfaces which are sliding within the
        rotor guide slots formed within the spool ends, the whole
        vane/spool ends/belt surface/rotor outer circumference between
        two adjacent vanes can now be effectively sealed thereby
        improving the hydristor or pump efficiency to unparalleled
        levels at 97-98%. The spool ends simply mate with the end or
        wear plates shown in FIG. 1, for example. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect of the invention, FIGS. 24a and 24b
        illustrate a sealing mechanism wherein a pair of flaps 150 are
        counterbored into the wear plates if the rotor has open kidney
        ports adjacent thereto, and are spaced to flap against the
        piston edges as it moves flush with a flexible belt. Each piston
        thus has corresponding flaps that are operable upon the flush
        communication of the piston's contoured surface and the flexible
        belt. Volumetric efficiency is thereby enhanced. </p>
      <p>In still yet another aspect of the invention, an improvement in
        the sealing of the invention described in U.S. Pat. No.
        6,022,201 and in conventional designs includes an insert 152
        slidably engaged within an arcuate groove 154 formed within the
        wear plate (not shown). </p>
      <p>In conventional fixed displacement vane pumps and motors, there
        is a problem associated with equalizing the pressure at the
        radially inner and outer vane edges. Chamber pressure must be
        routed under the vane (at its radially innermost point) to
        equalize the radially inward force created by the chamber
        pressure existing between the radial outer edge of the vane and
        the inner surface of the flexible belt (or the chamber confining
        contour). Accordingly, it is well known to provide undercuts
        within the endwalls to facilitate fluid flow and pressure to the
        radially innermost ends of the vanes (e.g. the source of the
        fluid pressure in grooves 154). This is true both for
        conventional fixed designs, and the hydristor variable belt
        design rotors described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201. In
        conventional practice, satisfactory sealing has not yet been
        achieved in bidirectional designs. Either the routing grooves at
        the axial ends of two opposite chambers where pressure sealing
        is desired are extended to allow for sealing the vane for the
        full rotation across the sealing surface (see reference number
        30 in FIG. 1, for example), or a compromise is made for all four
        sealing areas (reference number 30) i.e. the chamber groove to
        route oil only extends halfway. The first case works well for
        uni-directional operation and the second case works moderately
        acceptable for bidirectional operation. During bidirectional
        operation of the rotor, the inserts 152 are alternatively forced
        against either "tab" 109 on either side of the groove 154,
        depending on the rotational direction of the rotor. Tabs 109,
        basically the interface of the grooves 154 with an adjoining
        groove, function to stop the movement of the insert 152 within
        the groove 154 and also function to seal groove 154 and one end
        of groove 158 in insert 152. Because insert 152 is recessed
        within groove 154, once insert 152 is seated against tab 109,
        channel 158 is sealed thereby forcing fluid upward through the
        slot 152 and out ports 156, rather than into an adjacent groove
        154. The underside of the vanes is therefore pressurized without
        sacrificing operational efficiency due to leakage through the
        undercut when a bidirectional application is desired. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of
        arcuate grooves are formed within the inner surface of the wear
        plate, each groove corresponding to an operable quadrant within
        the rotor. The grooves are symmetrically placed at the beginning
        of each quadrant and are formed in a sausage-link shape or in a
        shape that precludes slippage of the insert from within the
        channel or groove beyond a limited range. Therefore, each end of
        the groove comprises a narrower.opening thereby precluding
        slippage of the insert once placed therein. Additionally, each
        groove is thus formed at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 O'Clock positions
        in an embodiment containing four pistons placed symmetrically
        about the rotor periphery. </p>
      <p>The valve insert shown in FIG. 25 is slidably engaged within a
        corresponding groove having an arcuate length approximately
        equal to the radially inner arcuate length existing between two
        juxtaposed vanes. As shown in FIGS. 25b and 25c, the insert has
        a pair of annuli 156 extending through the top of the insert for
        fluid flow therethrough. Thus fluid initially flowing beneath
        the insert is channeled through a right hole and then provides
        pressure over the top surface of the insert. A groove 158 is cut
        on the underside to facilitate the flow of fluid through the
        bottom and then out through the top of the insert. The valve
        insert thus responds to chamber pressure which drives the insert
        angularly over a small range within the groove so as to extend
        the vane underpressure for proper vane operation for a given
        pressure case. This is true for both rotational directions of
        the rotor. If any other chamber sees pressure, the inserts
        "switch" to extend the sealing as required for the particular
        case. This is even true for adjacent chambers as well as
        opposite chambers. Thus bidirectional volumetric efficiency is
        improved during single/dual pump operation, or any motor
        operation. </p>
      <p>While the foregoing examples illustrate and describe the use of
        the present invention, they are not intended to limit the
        invention as disclosed in certain preferred embodiments herein.
        Therefore, variations and modifications commensurate with the
        above teachings and the skill and/or knowledge of the relevant
        art, are within the scope of the present invention. </p>
