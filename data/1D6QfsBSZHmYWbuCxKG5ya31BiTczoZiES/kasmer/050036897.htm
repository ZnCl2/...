  <p><b><font size="+1">Rotary Vane Pump Seal</font></b> </p>
  <p><b>( February 17, 2005 )</b></p>
  </center>
  <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
  <p>A rotary vane pump is provided that provides an improved fluid
replenishment
and pressure relief system within a rotary vane pump system. A system,
containing a rotary vane pump containing at least one relief cut
between
the housing and the rotor, functions to relieve fluid pressure normally
found between the housing and the rotor. The fluid leaks from areas
such
as the rotational clearance required between the rotor and an inner
wall
of the housing. The system includes a reservoir in fluid communication
with the relief cut wherein fluid leaks are then retained within the
reservoir.
A fluid distribution manifold employing a plurality of check valves,
each
corresponding to a respective chamber within the rotor, provides a
controlled
fluid feed from the reservoir to the rotor thereby balancing the
fluidic
pressure existing between the radially innermost ends of the vanes and
the radially outermost ends of the vanes. <br>

  <p><b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
  <p>[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
Application
No. 60/494,327 filed on Aug. 11, 2003 and herein incorporated by
reference
in its entirety. </p>
  <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
  <p>[0002] This application relates to rotary vane pumps and
specifically
to improvements in the sealing, fluid replenishment, and pressure
relief
of systems incorporating rotary vane pumps. Related co-owned U.S. Pat.
Nos. 6,022,201, 6,527,525, and 6,612,117 are herein incorporated by
reference
in their entirety. </p>
  <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>[0003] Early devices varying the displacement of vane pumps
involved
the deliberate offset of the rotational center of the vane rotor with
respect
to the geometrical center of the circular outer case. The amount of
offset
would then control the swept volume of the pump and thereby provide a
desired
volumetric output for each rotation of the rotor. Several problems with
this design limited its use. </p>
  <p>[0004] First, the pressure unbalance caused by the hydraulic-based
force
on the radial cross-section of the rotor and vanes at the axis viewed
from
the radial perspective severely limited the power capability and power
density of these pumps and resulted in very heavy, inefficient, and
cumbersome
devices. Second, the centrifugal force of each vane during high speed
rotation
caused severe wear of the vane outer edge and the inner surface of the
outer containment housing. </p>
  <p>[0005] Later fixed displacement designs were conceived around the
concept
of pressure balance in which two geometrically opposed high pressure
chambers
would cause a cancellation of radial load due to equal and opposed
cross-section
pressure areas and opposite vector direction which resulted in a zero
net
force radially on the shaft bearing. The design is referred to as the
pressure
balanced vane pump or motor. Typical efficiency of these devices is 70
to 85% under rated loading and speed. Still later improvements included
changing the chamber shape of pressure balanced vane style devices and
involved the use of several types of adjustable inner surfaces of the
outer
housing for guiding and radially adjusting the vanes as they rotate.
One
improvement is a continuous band which is flexible and subject to
radial
deformation so as to cause displacement control of the vanes. However,
these flexible bands did not rotate. </p>
  <p>[0006] One other concern involves the typical fluid losses that
occur
during normal operation of rotary vane pumps. The fluid generally
accumulates
in undesirable areas thereby resulting in pressure buildups that may
result
in rupture of the pump housing and disabling of the entire pump. An
improvement
targeted toward reducing the fluid loss and thereby improving the
overall
efficiency and operability of the system would therefore be welcomed. </p>
  <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>[0007] The basic embodiment of this invention is a rotor with
spring-biased,
radially extensible vanes that are constrained in their outward radial
movement, away from the rotor center of rotation, by the inner
circumferential
area of a continuous flexible band which has the same axial width as
the
rotor and vanes. It is especially important to notice in the basic
embodiment
that the flexible band is designed to rotate with the vanes and rotor.
The spring loading vanes is by conventional means as is the practice
with
existing vane pumps and motors; namely that the spring is compressed
between
the rotor itself and the radially inward edge of the vane so as to
drive
every vane radially out from the rotor body against the inner area of
the
flexible band. The spring preload causes the vanes to contact the
flexible
band inside surface at slow speeds which includes zero. This is
especially
important if this embodiment is to be used as a variable or fixed
displacement
hydraulic motor because hydraulic sealing of the vane's outer edge is
assured
at zero speed. Since the flexible band is totally free to rotate with
the
vanes and rotor, a very big source of friction, wear, and inefficiency
is eliminated due to the teaching of this invention. The well known
limitation
of the prior art; namely the sliding edge friction associated with the
combined outward radial force of the vanes is totally eliminated since
there is substantially no relative motion between outside edges of the
vanes and the interior constraining surface of the flexible containment
band. Further, as the rotor's speed increases, the speed-squared
radially
outward combined force of the set of vanes is fully contained by the
continuity
of the flexible band simulating a pressure-vessel type of containment,
as if the flexible band were a cross section of a pressure containment
cylinder, and the individual radial outward force of the vanes were the
pictorial radially outward arrows that are used in drawings to depict
the
action of the force which is contained. Since the action of the
flexible
band is to fully contain these combined radial forces of the vanes,
there
is absolutely no increase of frictional forces due to increasing radial
vane force, and this invention solves a very severe limitation of the
prior
art in that the rotating speed of the fixed devices built according to
the prior art is limited to about 4,000 revolutions per minute, while
the
upper speed limit of the subject invention is substantially higher, say
to the range of 30,000 revolutions per minute, governed largely by the
design strength and durability of the flexible band. In fact, testing
showed
that the efficiency of this invention utilizing the rotating components
of a commercially available pump having an advertised efficiency of 88%
resulted in efficiency measurements of 94.7% when used in combination
with
the rotating flexible band. The grater efficiency of the instant
invention
over the prior art will result in much smaller variable pumps and
motors
in severe applications such as spacecraft. The flexible band design and
construction can cover a wide range of variables, from a single
circumferentially
continuous flexible band to concentric nestings of any practical number
of individual circumferentially continuous flexible bands. The smallest
circumference band is concentrically nested within a slightly larger
second
band and the second band is concentrically nested within a still larger
inside circumference of a third and yet larger band, and so on, up to
the
largest outside band whose exterior surface is the exterior surface of
the nest and the smaller inner band has its interior surface in contact
with the exterior edge of each of the vanes. This construction is
similar
to the case of a stranded cable of a specific diameter having a much
greater
strength than a solid rod of the same diameter. Also, the stranded
cable
is more flexible without failure than the solid rod. The individual
clearances
between each of the bands in such a collective nest is chosen to allow
slippage and lubrication from one band to the next. This nested
band-to-band
clearance results in a greater efficiency at very high operating speed
by allowing a nested concentric set of bands to slip in speed from one
concentric member to the next, with the inner band rotating at
substantially
the same speed as the rotor and the outer bands rotating increasingly
slower.
The material used to make the endless flexible band can be any
appropriate
metal, but other appropriate materials, such as plastic, fiberglass,
carbon
fiber, or KEVLAR.RTM., can be used. This construction material range
applies
whether a single thickness endless band is constructed, or a concentric
nesting of two or more bands is used to make a concentric nesting of a
number of bands. The description thus far is of a flexible circular and
continuous containment band with the band confining all the radial
centrifugal
forces of the vanes and eliminating contemporary problems such as
sliding
vane friction, the speed-squared frictional dependence, and the rotor
speed
limitation. The flexible band construction will also allow for the
shape
manipulation of the circumference of the band so as to permit varying
the
swept chamber volume as the rotor turns. </p>
  <p>[0008] Reshaping of the flexible band is necessary to control the
swept
chamber volume of the pump as the rotor is turning and comprises an
array
of radially movable pistons which are at 0.degree., 90.degree.,
180.degree,
and 270.degree. around a full circle, i.e. at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6
o'clock, and also 9 o'clock of a clock face. Each of the pistons has an
appropriate curvature to contact the flexible band external surface in
the positions cited. If the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons are caused
to move inward, the fixed circumference of the flexible band causes the
3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons to move outward by an equal amount. The
inward or outward movement of the pistons may be driven by individual
controlled
hydraulic pressures, or the movement can be caused by mechanical means
such as a gear and rack, or radially disposed screw drives to each
piston.
Another type of piston control means would be the joining of an analog
type electric servo motor drive to a ball screw mechanism with an
encoder
position feedback; which arrangement would easily lend itself to
digital
control. Whatever the method of controlling the movement of the piston,
the final purpose is to controllably elliptasize the flexible band from
an axial perspective so as to cause the controlled and varying degrees
of swept volume of fluid flow per revolution of the vane pump or motor.
In the basic embodiment of this invention, opposing pairs of pistons
move
simultaneously toward or away from each other, while the remaining set
of opposed pistons behave in simultaneous opposition to the action of
the
first pair. This behavior results in varying degrees of elliptic
reshaping
of the flexible band viewed from the axial perspective of the vane
rotor.
A novel and significant aspect of this device is the freedom of
movement
of the flexible band, which is impossible in the prior art. This
includes
special manipulation of the pistons and band that allow the combination
of this invention to simultaneously manipulate two common fluid, but
hydraulically
separate, outputs of this device as pump or motor. The variable
pressure
balanced design has two equal and identical pressure fluid outputs
which
will be merged so as to drive a hydraulic motor to form what is called
a hydrostatic transmission. This is a second embodiment of the present
invention. In addition, a second variable vane device of the proposed
design
may act as a motor in a conventional type of hydrostatic transmission
with
all of the current results, but with much greater efficiency and range.
Another embodiment of the invention is a special piston manipulation
which
causes this invention to act like the earlier variable non-pressure
balanced
construction pumps with a single input and output. In the present
invention,
there is shown two separate hydraulic circuits with separate inputs and
outputs where a single pump of the proposed design is separately
connected
to two fixed displacement hydraulic motors. Motor Number 1 will connect
in closed hydrostatic loop with the first and second quadrant ports of
the pump, while motor Number 2 will connect in closed hydrostatic loop
to the third and fourth quadrants with no interconnection. The plumbing
of the motor circuits would be such that both motors would have the
correct
shaft rotation direction for a anticlockwise example, say forward. If
the
12 o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons were directed inward, the 3 o'clock
and
9 o'clock pistons would be forced outward with equal hydraulic flow to
both motors occurring, causing the motors to turn at the same
controlled
speed in the forward direction. Now assume that the original circular
flexible
band shape is modified such that the 3 o'clock piston is moved inward
and
the 9 o'clock piston is moved outward, while holding the 12 o'clock and
6 o'clock pistons at neutral, the band remaining circular in shape. A
first
motor connected to the first and second quadrants will reverse shaft
direction,
with a speed equal to that of a second motor whose direction is still
forward.
If the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons were both moved the other way,
the
second motor would instead reverse rotation in relation to the first
motor.
Combine this action with the original action of the basic embodiment as
described, and one motor can be caused to rotate deliberately and
controllably
faster than the other motor, such as the case for an axle set of a
vehicle
going around a turn. Another embodiment of the invention has two
separate
piston control methods which can be algebraically mixed to effect
differential
control means of axle rotation for negotiating a turning radius.
Another
embodiment comprises a fixed displacement motor of the prior art
constructed
in the manner of this invention, with the piston positions permanently
fixed. This arrangement will be much more efficient than conventional
hydraulic
motors. A still further embodiment is the case of fixed displacement
motors
and pumps which can greatly improve the efficiency of existing vane
pump
and motors; namely that one or several flexible bands of the proposed
invention
construction can be closely fitted to be moveable just inside the fixed
elliptic or circular cam ring surface of conventional units, with a
small
clearance between the flexible ring exterior and the fixed cam ring
interior,
said clearance supporting an oil film which has minimal friction, while
the vane outer edges are now supported by the innermost flexible band's
inner surface. This construction provides some of the advantages of the
subject invention, such as containment of vane centripetal force, and
the
replacement of vane-to-fixed cam ring friction with broad oil film
friction
that is much less, and not speed squared dependent. The primary
invention
configured as a fixed unit will still be most efficient due to the open
chamber between each fixed piston pair. A smaller total oil film in
this
case will give the least loss. A significant advantage of the just
described
construction is the ability to fit existing designs, or even retrofit
field
product without any mechanical change required. Existing vane units
could
complete with fixed piston pumps and motors in terms of efficiency, but
would be less efficient than the basic embodiment. This is a fifth
embodiment
of the invention. </p>

  <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
  <p>[0020] The isometric view shown in FIG. 1 has a frontal first
quadrant
cutaway which exposes some very important features of the invention.
The
rear end plate 1 is shown with the first quadrant kidney port 16
exposed.
The front end plate 2 is partially cutaway with the kidney ports 17,
18,
and 19 respectively in the second, third, and fourth quadrants showing.
The rear end plate 1 has like kidney ports 20, 21, and 22 in axial
alignment
with ports 17, 18, and 19, but those ports in plate 1 are out of view
in
this drawing. This view shows like kidney ports front and back.
However,
it is only necessary to have one port per quadrant chamber to allow for
fluid flow into and out of the chamber. Either the front or rear ports
can be utilized, or both can be used to increase the flow capacity.
Also,
referring to FIG. 4, any other means of porting which allows fluid to
flow
into or out of the volume 33, 34, 35, or 36 when they rotate in
alignment
with "quadrants one, two, two, three, or four" may be used. Front
kidney
port 23 is in the cutaway portion of end plate 2, and is in axial
alignment
with port 16. Piston 12 is exposed and is itself cut away at an angle
to
expose the high pressure fluid film 13 which exists between the curved
inner surface of the piston, and the outer circumferential area of the
flexible band nest 14. The piston interface shape as shown is curved;
however,
any surface shape that supports the fluid film 13 can be used. Each of
the four pistons has a fluid film 13. Several vanes 24 are exposed by
the
cutaway. The outer casting 25 has four piston guides and four control
ports
26. The ports 26 direct the inlet and exhaust of fluid control pressure
to the four pistons to effect reshaping of flexible band 14. The
invention
is totally symmetric in hydraulic function and can function
interchangeably
as a hydraulic motor. The front end plate 2 has a hole 27 in it to
permit
the insertion of a drive shaft that will couple to the rotor 15 by
means
of the internal splines 28. The drive shaft is not shown so as to
minimize
the complexity of the figure. Seals and bearings of conventional design
are also left out for the same reason. The shaft requires both a seal
and
bearing in plates 1 and 2 to facilitate the rotation of the rotor 15,
the
vanes 24. The four holes 29 in each of plates 1 and 2 would allow for
four
bolts which would tightly hold both of the end plates against the outer
casting 25; however, any appropriate number of bolts may be used, and
any
other means of construction which hydraulically contains the rotor 15,
vanes 24, band 14, and shape control means such as the pistons 12, 3,
6,
and 9 may also be used. </p>
  <p>[0021] FIG. 2 shows an axial end view of the invention with the
end
plates removed, and with dotted outlines of end plate 2 with ports 17,
18, 19, and 23 outlined. The four control pistons numbered 12, 3, 6,
and
9 are now shown. Shaded areas 31 are filled or exhausted by the control
ports 26 to allow control fluid into and out of the chamber 31 behind
the
four pistons 12, 3, 6 and 9. As shown in FIG. 11, the flexible band 14
had three concentric members 52, 53, and 54. These bands are preferably
of stainless steel, each having a thickness in the order of 0.015
inches.
The actual number and thickness of bands to be utilized will be
determined
by the design requirements. Also, as shown in FIG. 11, each vane 24 has
compression springs 32 mounted in rotor 15 that force the vane out from
the center of the rotor 15 into contact with the inner surface of the
band
14. Three springs and bores are provided for mating with three pins 51
on each vane with the pins being equally spaced along the base of the
vane.
Such band and spring combinations are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,215
which is incorporated by reference herein. This action assures that the
vanes will seal fluid pressure at zero speed. It is a very important
feature
of this invention that the rotor 15, all the vanes 24, and the flexible
band 14 will rotate as a group. At very slow speeds, the band will slip
very slightly with regards to the vane speed, much like a squirrel cage
a.c. induction motor rotor will slip behind the field rotation speed.
This
slow drift is the result of fluid shear drag caused by the four fluid
films
13, which act so as to slow down the flexible band 14 speed. This drag
force is counteracted by the combined line contact friction of, in this
example, nine vanes. The vane friction is much greater than the fluid
film
friction, and the vane friction increases as the speed squared. Thus,
as
the speed of rotation increases, the flexible band will begin to rotate
as substantially the same speed as the rotor. Since the vane and band
speed
never quite equalize, the wear on the inner surface of the flexible
band
is evenly distributed over the entire inner band surface, and the
maximum
wear life is achieved. Since the centrifugal, speed squared forces are
totally contained by the flexible band, the wear and failure mechanism
of high-speed vane type pumps and motors is eliminated. The added
friction
of four fluid contact areas 13 is small compared to the combined vane
friction,
and does not increase significantly with higher speed. The result is a
device which is much more efficient than any conventional design and
which
will operate efficiently at much higher speeds. These factors also
allow
for quieter operation at higher operating pressure. In FIG. 3, areas of
the end plate 2 are marked 30 with identical areas axially in line
therewith
on end plate 1. A radial wedge shaped chamber 33 is shown directly
under
piston 3. Referring to FIG. 2, the front and back aligned areas 30
completely
cover the axial ends of the chamber 33. Fluid pressure in quadrants one
is prevented from directly flowing into quadrants two, and vice versa.
If the rotation of the rotor is clockwise, the volume of chamber 33
will
move from quadrant one to quadrant two in one ninth of a revolution.
Since
the chamber 33 is now closed on both ends by the presence of solid area
30, the volume of chamber 33 which was part of the first quadrant
chamber
volume is now forced into the second quadrant chamber. Simultaneously,
34 rotated from the fourth quadrant chamber into the first quadrant
chamber.
If the flexible band is formed to a circle, then volume 33 is equal to
volume 34, and there is no gain or loss of fluid volume in any of the
four
quadrant chambers. This is true regardless of speed or direction. If
ports
18 and 23 were connected to the inlet port of a separate fixed
displacement
hydraulic motor, and the motor's return port was connected to device
ports
17 and 19, the shape of the flexible band would be called neutral
because
the pump would not move any fluid into or out of the motor, and the
motor
shaft would not turn since a fixed displacement of fluid must occur in
order for the motor to turn. If ports 23 and 17 were connected to one
fixed
displacement motor, and ports 18 and 19 were connected to another such
motor, the result would be exactly the same. In either case, the input
shaft of the variable pump would continue to turn with no motion ever
on
a motor shaft. </p>
  <p>[0022] In FIG. 4, control pressure is injected into the control
ports
26 for pistons 12 and 6 causing them to move radially inward. Any other
mechanical means of control, such as rack 58 and pinion 60 actuable by
lever 61 as shown in FIG. 11, would act in a similar manner to the
pressure
and cause pistons 12 and 6 to move radially inward due to external
mechanical
force. The spring action of the flexible band causes it to bulge out in
equal measure against the pistons 3 and 9, while causing those pistons
to move radially outward while exhausting the control fluids volume out
through control ports 26. The use of mechanical control here would
require
that the mechanical controls means would retract to allow for the
spring
action of the band 14 to push pistons 3 and 9 outward. The arrows at
the
control ports 26 show the direction of fluid flow. Now for this
discussion,
a clockwise rotation is chosen. FIG. 4 also shows maximum deflection of
the flexible band 14. Rotating vane chambers 34 and 35 are shown as
minimized,
while the chamber 33 and 36 are maximized. Since chamber 33 is removing
a much larger volume of fluid from the first quadrant than the chamber
34 is carrying in, the difference must be provided via either kidney
ports
23 or 16. Therefore, ports 23 or 16 are suction ports that can be
connected
to an external hydraulic circuit, and fluid is drawn into "quadrant
one"
through those ports. Chamber 33 is very large when it rotates into the
second quadrants, and chamber 35 now is very small in exiting. The
large
difference of the volumes must therefore be forced out kidney ports 17
or 20 into the external hydraulic path. Ports 23 and 16, and 17 and 20
form a hydrostatic loop when connected to an external fixed
displacement
hydraulic motor. For reference, look at schematic connection in FIG. 9.
By varying the radial positions of the pistons 12, 3, 6, and 9, the
fluid
displaced can be fully controlled from zero to the maximum in any
increment.
Now, ports 18 and 21, and 19 and 22 will form a second Siamese
hydrostatic
loop when they are connected to a second external hydraulic motor. For
like displacements of the pistons 12 and 6, and opposite and equal
motion
of pistons 3 and 9, the fluid flow through fluid circuit A which
consists
of ports 23 and 16, and 17 and 20 will exactly equal the flow through
fluid
circuit consisting of ports 18 and 21, and 19 and 22. This described
the
case of straight motion for a set of vehicle axles. The simple case of
ports 23 and 16 paired with 18 and 21, and 17 and 30 with 19 and 22,
and
then connected to a single fixed or variable hydraulic motor is also
straight-line
motion. For Reference, look at the fluid connection shown in FIG. 8. As
the rotor, vane, and flexing band assembly rotate, the action of the
elliptasized
band will be to force the compression and extension of the vanes 24,
with
regard to angular position only. The pressure being applied to pistons
12 and 6 through ports 26 causes the pistons to move inward. For the
clockwise
rotation, output hydraulic pressure will escalate in the second and
fourth
quadrants chambers. As the chamber pressure increases, an increasing
radial
outward force develops on the underside of pistons 12 and 6, thereby
reducing
the respective piston inward force. When the outward force is equal to
the inward force, the piston inward motion ceases. As the external
hydraulic
motor circuit responds to pressure and turns, the developed pressure
drops
slightly, and allows the pistons 12 and 6 to move slightly more inward,
and this in turn increases the volume of fluid passing through the
variable
pump, in turn causing the motor to turn faster, thus causing a further
line drop, causing more piston motion in, and so on. Therefore, the
pressure
developed in the quadrant chambers is equal to, or in proportion to the
control force, and the variable pump automatically changes its
displacement
to accommodate changing external flow, while holding the out pressure
proportional
to the control pressure. Thus the hydraulic motor torque is a function
of control pressure regardless of variable pump input speed and
direction
and output motor speed. </p>
  <p>[0023] FIG. 5 depicts the opposite case of piston operation in
that
pistons 3 and 9 are pressurized, causing them to move radially inward.
Pistons 12 and 6 are forced out and the ellipse flexible band major
axis
is now vertical. Swept chamber volume 34 now is large, as is volume 35,
while volumes 33 and 36 are now small. There is now an excess of fluid
entering the first and third quadrant chambers and kidney ports 23 and
16, and 18 and 21 become pressure ports, while a shortage of fluid in
the
second and fourth quadrants results in kidney ports 17 and 20, and 19
and
22 becoming suction ports and the hydraulic motor would now reverse
direction.
Note that in the case of FIGS. 4 and 5, if the shaft rotation of the
pump
input were reversed, the external fluid direction would also reverse
and
the manipulation of the opposed sets of control pistons, both the
volume
and direction of the fluid output can be fully controlled. Also note
that
by pressurizing the opposite sets of pistons to the pair shown in FIGS.
4 and 5, the subject pump can be used as a variable hydraulic motor.
This
is an ideal component for interface between an energy storage flywheel
and road wheels. The device as a pump can also interface to a flywheel
or electric motor including a pancake design motor and can act to use
or
recover flywheel or motor energy directly. During acceleration, the
pump
will withdraw the pre-stored kinetic energy from the flywheel and
direct
it to the road wheels so as to accelerate a vehicle. During braking,
the
opposite pistons try to force the flexible band back into a circular
shape
and in so doing, cause the pump to behave like a motor which then will
act to re-accelerate the flywheel to near its initial speed. During the
braking action, straight-line vehicle energy is recycled back into the
flywheel and the vehicle is brought to a standstill. The braking action
is the same for either a single output motor or two motors. </p>
  <p>[0024] FIG. 6 shows control pressure being injected into port 26
causing
piston 3 to move inward. Control fluid flows from port 26 of piston 9,
and the entire flexible band moves toward piston 9 while maintaining a
circular shape. Rotating chambers 34 and 33 behave as in FIG. 5
although
with lesser amounts of fluid displacement per revolution. However, if a
second motor is connected to ports 18 and 19, as shown in FIG. 9, it
would
experience a reversal of direction because chamber 36 is now larger
than
chamber 35, while at the same time, chamber 36 is larger than chamber
34.
The third quadrant becomes suction while the fourth quadrant becomes
the
pressure. This is the behavior of some industrial skid-steer loaders
that
reverse the rotation of the wheels on one side of the vehicle with
respect
to the other side, causing the vehicle to spin on its vertical axis. If
piston 9 were pressurized instead 3, both fluid circuits would reverse,
and the two motors would now spin in opposite directions which are both
reverse according to the original directions. During all of the above
behavior,
note that the control ports 26 of pistons 12 and 6 were quiescent with
no inward or outward motion of these pistons. Also, during this
differential
action, a pressure balance within the pump is no longer maintained, and
such differential action should be limited in duration and power level
so as to minimize shaft bearing load and therefore maximize pump life.
FIG. 7 combines the differential control action with the normal
displacement
control to achieve special unequal flow to the motors for the purpose
of
driving two wheels unequally, but correctly around a turn, since the
outside
wheel rotates faster than the inside wheel. Further, the amount of
differential
action can be directly related to the correct wheel track in response
to
a steering input. Thus, a very unique control mechanism is obtained for
driving both wheels in turns and this will greatly enhance vehicle
traction
and safety. In this case, differential control pressure 37 is applied
to
ports 26 of pistons 3 and 9, while normal control pressure 38 now is
simultaneously
applied to those same ports. The resultant control pressure 39 and
volume
obtain at piston 9 may be different from the control pressure and
volume
obtained 31 applied to piston 3. The result is the combination of
circular
displacement of the flexible band 14 with reshaping of the band at the
same time. The result is a different but controlled speed of one more
with
respect to a second, as shown in FIG. 9 resulting in a differential
two-wheel
drive. The differential portion of the control can be derived from the
steering system, while the go and stop motion can be derived from brake
and acceleration pedals. FIG. 8 shows the variable pump connected to
either
a fixed displacement hydraulic motor or another variable pump that is
used
as the motor to form a hydrostatic transmission. The conventional
hydraulic
motor case is limited to the range of one-to-one and one-to-infinity,
where
the use of a second variable unit extends the range to infinity to one.
  </p>
  <p>[0025] FIG. 9 shows the schematic connection of one variable
device
to two fixed hydraulic motors, utilizing the Siamese ports of the
invention
to drive two separate outputs. This connection will allow the
differential
feature of the invention to be in use to differentially drive the two
motors
so as to affect a differential drive to the motor outputs, which is the
case in a vehicular axle set negotiating a turn. </p>
  <p>[0026] FIG. 10 shows the installation of a flexible band 14 in a
conventional
vane pump. The vanes 24 and rotor 15 are of conventional construction,
like the proposed invention. The outer housing 40 is of conventional
manufacture
and chamber design, and the oil film 41 separates the band 14 from the
outer housing 40 which will reduce operating friction in conventional
units.
The oil film 41 in this case is the full length of the ground internal
chamber of the conventional outer housing. The sliding friction of the
set of vanes is eliminated, and replaced by a broad oil film 41 of
lesser
friction; and, the efficiency of the conventional vane pump or motor is
improved. Fixing the piston arrangement shown in FIGS. 4 through 7 will
result in a fixed displacement pump or motor, whose efficiency will be
the highest of all due to a reduced oil film 41 area. </p>
  <p>[0027] For referential purposes, all radial orientation described
herein
is with respect to the axial center of a rotor in accordance with the
present
invention, unless otherwise stated. Stated another way, "radial" in
this
context means to emanate to and from the axial center of the
cylindrical
rotor, unless otherwise stated. </p>
  <p>[0028] Typically, a rotary vane pump is preferably sealed within
an
associated housing to provide a sealed system. However, there is a
rotational
clearance established between the spool of the present invention and
the
housing that permits leaking of fluid axially outwardly about the
flanged
peripheries of the spool ends. The fluid then occupies the interface
between
the housing recesses and the outer surfaces of the spool ends. Without
proper relief, the buildup of fluid between the rotor and the inner
wall
of the housing can lead to rupture of the housing and attendant pump
failure. </p>
  <p>[0029] Accordingly, in yet another aspect of the present invention
shown
in FIG. 17, a fluid replenishment and pressure relief system 62 is
constructed
within and/or about the hydristor or rotary vane pump housing 64.
Although
a preferred embodiment includes the hydristor rotary vane pump, it
should
be emphasized that any rotary vane pump may benefit from the following
structural design. As described above, a rotary vane pump or hydristor
contains a spool 66 for rotation about a central axis thereby
facilitating
pumping or fluid transfer. Additionally, the pump contains a housing 64
surrounding the spool 66 for containment of the fluids and rotary
spool.
A first spool end 68 and a second spool end 70 define the ends of the
spool
66 and are each preferably configured with flanged portions 72 about
the
periphery of each respective spool end. The first spool end 68 has a
first
inner surface 74 facing axially inwardly toward the second spool end
70.
The first spool end 68 also has a first outer surface 76 facing axially
outwardly, opposite the first inner surface 74. The second spool end 70
has a second inner surface 78 facing axially inwardly toward the first
spool end 68. The second spool end 70 also has a second outer surface
80
facing axially outwardly, opposite the second inner surface 78. </p>
  <p>[0030] Both spool ends are surrounded by the housing 64 wherein
the
housing 64 contains an inner wall 82 that interfaces with the first and
second outer surfaces 76 and 80, respectively, of the first and second
spool ends 68 and 70, respectively. In a preferred embodiment, the
inner
wall 82 of the housing 64 is provided with a first recess 84 that is
machined
to minimize the rotational clearance of the first spool end 68. Stated
another way, the first outer surface 76 is oriented within the first
recess
84 while still providing operational rotational clearance. In the same
way, the inner wall 82 of the housing 64 is also provided with a second
recess 86 on the opposite side of the spool 66, wherein the second
recess
86 is also machined to minimize the rotational clearance of the second
spool end 70. As such, the second outer surface 80 is oriented within
the
second recess 86 while still providing operational rotational
clearance. </p>
  <p>[0031] A first relief cut is 88 formed within the inner wall 82 of
the
housing 64 or within the first outer surface 76 of the first spool end
68, thereby providing a pressure relief cavity between the housing 64
and
the first spool end 68. A second relief cut 90 is preferably formed
within
the inner wall 82 of the housing 64, opposite the first relief cut 88,
or within the second outer surface 80 of the second spool end 70,
thereby
providing a second pressure relief cavity between the housing 64 and
the
second spool end 70. As shown in the Figures, the relief cuts are
preferably
formed as circular cuts 360 degrees about the flanged periphery 72 of
each
spool end. </p>
  <p>[0032] In further accordance with the present invention, a
reservoir
92 is formed within the closed rotary vane pump system 62 whereby the
reservoir
fluidly communicates with the first and/or second relief cuts 88 and
90,
respectively. The Figures show a schematic representation of the
reservoir
92 as remote from the rotary vane pump 63. Nevertheless, the reservoir
92 could in fact be formed within the rotor itself or wherever
spatially
convenient so long as the reservoir 92 is contained within the sealed
rotary
vane system 63 or more preferably, the hydristor system and does not
adversely
affect the operability of the rotary vane pump 63. To establish
exemplary
fluid communication from the relief cut(s) to the reservoir 92, one or
more conduits 94 could be formed within the housing 64 to permit
drainage
of the leaked fluid to the reservoir 92. A fluid distribution manifold
96 contains one or more fluid distribution conduits 98 and fluidly
communicates
with the reservoir 92, whereby the reservoir 92 is plumbed to the
manifold
96 for distribution to the rotary vane chambers as described herein.
One
or more check valves 100, corresponding in number to the number of
fluid
distribution conduits 98, are installed within each respective conduit
98 thereby providing a controlled distribution as operating pressures
within
each respective chamber permit. Stated another way, the operating
pressure
of each chamber within the rotary vane pump may be constant or may be
varied
to greater or lesser pressures over a given operating cycle, as
described
herein. As the pressure in a given chamber decreases, the associated
check
valve 100 opens thereby facilitating a draw of fluid from the reservoir
92, and thus replenishing the bulk fluid within the system 62. As the
pressure
in a given chamber increases, the associated check valve 100 closes
thereby
prohibiting flow into the chamber. In this way, fluid replenishment may
be controlled as a parallel function to the pressure differential of
the
various chambers. In the embodiments shown, four check valves 100
correspond
to four chambers thereby providing potential fluid flow to all four
chambers
as the pressure conditions permit. </p>
  <p>[0033] As shown in FIG. 12, an entirely separate manifold 96 and
ball
check system 102 wherein each ball check valve 100 fluidly communicates
with one of the four chambers will have effect of selecting the highest
pressure of the four chambers and presenting that to the manifold 96 as
shown. That highest pressure is then routed to four selective
under-vane
recesses 30 at each of the four sealing areas 30 under 12, 3, 6, and 9
o' clock. The result is that all of the vanes that are passing through
the four sealing areas 30 have the highest chamber pressure directed
under
forcing the vanes radially outwardly to effectively force the o-ring
seal
against the underside of the belt, the topside of which is supported by
the four respective piston curvatures and the resultant hydrodynamic
bearings. </p>
  <p>[0034] As shown in FIG. 12, another aspect of the invention
includes
vanes equipped with rubber tips 104 at the radially outermost ends of
the
vanes. Each vane is equipped with a first rubber tip or edge 104
thereby
improving pressure sealing and also increasing friction between the
vane
and the inside surface of the belt. The rubber may be provided as bulk
cord
stock. To provide a vane with a rubber tip or edge 104, a vane conduit
or channel 106 is machined into the vane that extends from the first
spool
end 68 to the second spool end 70, and thereby provides a seat for the
o-ring or rubber material 104. Or, stated another way, the vane conduit
or vane recess 106 is machined to be coextensive in length with the
vane.
The vane recess 106 is preferably machined with serrations 108 along
the
length of the hole or conduit 106. This may be done in any known
manner.
For example, the serrations 108 may be formed by electro discharge
machining
(EDM) with a wave cut, or, a broach may be employed that zips down the
radially outermost edge of the vane and peels metal off. The serrations
108 provide points of friction thereby facilitating a stronger
attachment
of the rubber therein. </p>
  <p>[0035] In yet another aspect of the invention, the spool ends may
contain
grooves that provide a female seat for each respective axial end of
each
respective vane. U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,525 describes the spool ends of
the
present invention. FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate how each vane of the
rotary
vane pump fits within a slot 110 in the rotor and extends radially
outwardly
toward the belt. The orientation of each vane results in a force biased
against the sides of the vane depending on fluid pressure, thereby
establishing
a cantilevered force on the vane with regard to the vane tips.
Accordingly,
the first plurality of grooves 112 within the first spool end 68 and
the
second plurality of grooves 114 within the second spool end 70 provide
added mechanical strength and support of the vanes thereby countering
the
pressures internal to the rotary vane system 62 at each axial end of
the
vanes. This design also permits a lengthening of the axial length of
each
vane whereby the extended portions seat within the spool end grooves
112
and 114 with a minimum of sliding clearance. As a result, the vanes can
move radially inward and outward with a minimum of fluid bypass loss.
Furthermore,
the spool end grooves facilitate the use of radially shorter and
lighter
vanes thereby permitting greater vane extensions and higher operating
speeds,
or an increase in efficiency and power packaging density. Also,
additional
o-ring sealing 104 may be incorporated into the vane/spool groove
interface
as discussed above to further improve sealing. </p>
  <p>[0036] In still another aspect of the invention, a belt 116 may be
perforated
across the surface thereof with an array of holes 118 arranged in a
random
manner so as to maintain the strength of the belt and also to minimize
the number of holes aligned with any respective vane tip. The size of
the
holes are preferably smaller than the thickness of the vane, or, if the
size of the holes is designed to be relatively larger, a double o-ring
vane tip 120 may be used to facilitate a larger hole size in the belt.
FIG. 15 illustrates a relatively larger hole in the belt as it
interfaces
with a double o-ring vane tip. As shown, each vane tip 120a and 120b is
preferably oriented to reside along the periphery of the hole rather
than
across it thereby providing localized strength at each hole while still
facilitating fluid flow therethrough. FIG. 16 illustrates a perforated
belt 116, in accordance with the present invention. </p>
  <p>[0037] For referential purposes, all radial orientation described
herein
below is with respect to the axial center of a rotor in accordance with
the present invention, unless otherwise stated. Stated another way,
"radial"
in this context means to emanate to and from the axial center of the
cylindrical
rotor, unless otherwise stated. </p>
  <p>[0038] In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of
relieving
fluidic pressure due to system leaks is provided. At the same time, a
method
of system fluidic replenishment is provided. The housing or rotor is
machined
to contain at least one relief cut, and if desired more than one, in
either
the housing or rotor thereby providing a pressure relief region within
the housing. A reservoir is then provided that fluidly communicates
with
the relief cut(s) for containment of fluid leaked from the
rotor/system.
A manifold is provided that fluidly communicates with the reservoir
whereby
the manifold provides controlled bulk fluid replenishment to the rotor
thereby maintaining the internal fluid pressure balance existing about
the rotor and the vanes. In particular, the fluid is preferably fed to
the underside of the vanes thereby maintaining a vane under-pressure
that
prevents bypass of fluid above the vanes. The control may be
established
by providing a plurality of control check valves corresponding in
number
to a plurality of chambers within the rotor, the valves responsive to
rotor/system
pressure within various chambers therein. </p>
  <p>[0039] In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of
enhancing
the seal of the chambers and also increasing the friction of the vanes
against the belt, rubber tips are inserted along upper longitudinal
edges
of the vanes. First, the vane has a channel or conduit formed along the
upper radial edge of the vane thereby providing a seat for a rubber or
o-ring seal. In a preferred embodiment, each vane channel is formed
with
serrations along its length thereby enhancing the hold of the rubber
inserted
therein. Then the rubber is inserted within the length. </p>
  <p>[0040] In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of
enhancing
fluid transfer from the radially outermost part of the rotor to the
outermost
part of the belt is provided. First, the belt is perforated with holes
having a diameter less than the thickness of the vanes. If desired, the
holes may be formed relatively larger in diameter than the thickness of
the vanes. If so, then each vane longitudinal edge is preferably formed
with two longitudinally and radially extending channels as described
immediately
above whereby each channel is preferably established along the
periphery
of the relatively larger hole thereby providing support on each
opposing
side of the diameter of the hole. Rubber is then inserted therein. </p>
  <p>[0041] In yet another aspect of the invention, an improved seal of
the
spool end/vane interface and a stronger vane support are provided.
First,
a plurality of grooves is formed in the inner wall of each end plate,
wherein
each groove constitutes a female mating of an axial end of a respective
vane. Stated another way, the groove is formed to facilitate a flush
fit
of the axial end of a respective vane associated therewith, wherein the
axial fit extends across the radial length of the vane. The strength of
the vanes is enhanced by support at each axial end of the vanes. To
improve
the seal along the interface between the axial ends of the vanes and
the
spool ends, o-rings or rubber are assembled along the axial ends of the
vanes in the same way that they may optionally be assembled along the
radial
longitudinal length of the vanes. </p>
  <p>[0042] As used in the present invention, the term "hydristor" is
defined
as given above through FIGS. 1-11, and as given in U.S. Pat. No.
6,022,201,
incorporated herein by reference. A hydristor is a preferred rotary
vane
pump to be used in association with the present invention, although the
present invention is not thereby limited. </p>
  <p>[0043] While the foregoing illustrates and describes preferred
embodiments
of the present invention, it should not be taken to limit the invention
as disclosed in certain preferred embodiments herein. Therefore,
variations
and modifications commensurate with the above teachings and the skill
and/or
knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present
invention
as defined in the appended claims. </p>
