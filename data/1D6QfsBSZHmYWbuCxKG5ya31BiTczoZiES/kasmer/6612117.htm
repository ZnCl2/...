      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This application incorporates by reference related patents U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 6,022,201; 3,153,984; and 2,589,449, and, GB Patent
        No. 1,000,591 each in their entirety. </p>
      <p>Early devices to vary the displacement of vane pumps involved
        the deliberate offset of the rotational center of the vane rotor
        with respect to the geometrical center of the circular outer
        case. The amount of offset would then control the swept volume
        of the pump and thereby provide a desired volumetric output for
        each rotation of the rotor. Several problems with this design
        limited its use. </p>
      <p>First, the pressure unbalance caused by the hydraulic-based
        force on the radial cross-section of the rotor and vanes at the
        axis viewed from the radial perspective severely limited the
        power capability and power density of these pumps and resulted
        in very heavy, inefficient, and cumbersome devices. Second, the
        centrifugal force of each vane during high-speed rotation caused
        severe wear of the vane outer edge and the inner surface of the
        outer containment housing. </p>
      <p>Later fixed displacement design were conceived around the
        concept of pressure balance in which two geometrically opposed
        high pressure chambers would cause a cancellation of radial load
        due to equal and opposed cross-section pressure areas and
        opposite vector direction which resulted in a zero net force
        radially on the shaft bearing. The design is referred to as the
        pressure balanced vane pump or motor. Typical efficiency of
        these devices is 70 to 85% under rated loading and speed. Still
        later improvements include changing the chamber shape of
        pressure balanced vane style devices and involved the use of
        several types of adjustable inner surfaces of the outer housing
        for guiding and radially adjusting the vanes as they rotate. One
        improvement is a continuous band, which is flexible and subject
        to radial deformation so as to cause displacement control of the
        vanes. However, these flexible bands did not rotate. </p>
      <p>Classical freon heat pumps utilize an expansion valve to rarify
        the freon and drop its temperature to -40.degree. F. The
        expansion valve represents a large loss of mechanical energy
        relative to the overall system performance due to shear heating
        effects as the fluid is discharged through the valve. In spite
        of that, common recoveries or amplifications of the electrical
        energy input to drive the system is achieved by as high as 300%.
        Nevertheless, improvements reducing the mechanical loss would
        certainly result in greater efficiency. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The basic embodiment of this invention is a rotor with
        spring-biased, radially extensible vanes that are constrained in
        their outward radial movement, away from the rotor center of
        rotation, by the inner circumferential area of a continuous
        flexible band that has the same axial width as the rotor and
        vanes. It is especially important to notice in the basic
        embodiment that the flexible band is designed to rotate with the
        vanes and rotor. The spring loading of the vanes is by
        conventional means as is the practice with existing vane pumps
        and motors; namely that the spring is compressed between the
        rotor itself and the radially inward edge of the vane so as to
        drive every vane radially out from the rotor body against the
        inner area of the flexible band. Other spring assemblies that
        accomplish the same function are also contemplated. The spring
        preload causes the vanes to contact the flexible band inside
        surface at slow speeds that include zero. This is especially
        important if this embodiment is to be used as a variable or
        fixed displacement hydraulic motor because hydraulic sealing of
        the vane's outer edge is assured at zero speed. Since the
        flexible band is totally free to rotate with the vanes and
        rotor, a very big source of friction, wear, and inefficiency is
        eliminated due to the teaching of this invention. The well known
        limitation of the prior art; namely the sliding edge friction
        associated with the combined outward radial force of the vanes
        is totally eliminated since there is substantially no relative
        motion between outside edges of the vanes and the interior
        constraining surface of the flexible containment band. Further,
        as the rotor's speed increases, the speed-squared radially
        outward combined force of the set of vanes is fully contained by
        the continuity of the flexible band simulating a pressure-vessel
        type of containment, as if the flexible band were a cross
        section of a pressure containment cylinder, and the individual
        radial outward force of the vanes were the pictorial radially
        outward arrows that are used in drawings to depict the action of
        the force which is contained. Since the action of the flexible
        band is to fully contain these combined radial forces of the
        vanes, there is absolutely no increase of frictional forces due
        to increasing radial vane force, and this invention solves a
        very severe limitation of the prior art in that the rotating
        speed of the fixed devices built according to the prior art is
        limited to about 4,000 revolutions per minute, while the upper
        speed limit of the subject invention is substantially higher,
        say to the range of 30,000 revolutions per minute, governed
        largely by the design strength and durability of the flexible
        band. In fact, testing showed that the efficiency of this
        invention utilizing the rotating components of a commercially
        available pump having an advertised efficiency of 88% resulted
        in efficiency measurements of 93.5 to 94.7% when used in
        combination with the rotating flexible band. The greater
        efficiency of the instant invention over the prior art will
        result in much smaller variable pumps and motors in severe
        applications such as spacecraft. The flexible band design and
        construction can cover a wide range of variables, from a single
        circumferentially continuous flexible band to concentric nesting
        of any practical number of individual circumferentially
        continuous flexible bands. The smallest circumference band is
        concentrically nested within a slightly larger second band and
        the second band is concentrically nested within a still larger
        inside circumference of a third and yet larger band, and so on,
        up to the largest outside band whose exterior surface is the
        exterior surface of the nest and the smallest inner band has its
        interior surface in contact with the exterior edge of each of
        the vanes. The construction is similar to the case of a stranded
        cable of a specific diameter having a much greater strength than
        a solid rod of the same diameter. Also, the stranded cable is
        more flexible without failure than the solid rod. The individual
        clearances between each of the bands in such a collective nest
        can be chosen to allow slippage and lubrication from one band to
        the next. This nested band-to-band clearance results in a
        greater efficiency at very high operating speed by allowing a
        nested concentric set of bands to slip in speed from one
        concentric member to the next, with the inner band rotating at
        substantially the same speed as the rotor and the outer bands
        rotating increasingly slower. The material used to make the
        endless flexible band can be any appropriate metal, but other
        appropriate materials, such as plastic, fiberglass, carbon
        fiber, or KEVLAR.RTM., can be used. This construction material
        range applies whether a single thickness endless band is
        constructed, or a concentric nesting of two or more bands is
        used to make a concentric nesting of a number of bands. The
        description thus far is of a flexible circular and continuous
        containment band with the band confining all the radial
        centrifugal forces of vanes and eliminating contemporary
        problems such as sliding vane friction, the speed-squared
        frictional dependence, and the rotor speed limitation. The
        flexible band construction will also allow for the shape
        manipulation of the circumference of the band so as to permit
        varying the swept chamber volume as the rotor turns. </p>
      <p>Reshaping of the flexible band is necessary to control the
        swept chamber volume of the pump as the rotor is turning and
        comprises an array of radially moveable pistons which are at
        0.degree., 90.degree., 180.degree., and 270.degree. around a
        full circle, i.e., at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9
        o'clock of a clock face. Each of the pistons has an appropriate
        curvature to contact the flexible band external surface in the
        positions cited. If the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons are
        caused to move inward, the fixed circumference of the flexible
        band tends to cause the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons to move
        outward by an equal amount, but the flexible nature of the
        containment band permits unequal piston motion. The inward or
        outward movement of the pistons may be driven by individual
        controlled hydraulic pressure, or the movement can be caused by
        mechanical means such as a gear and rack, or radially disposed
        screw drives to each piston. Another type of piston control
        means would be the joining of an analog type electric servo
        motor drive to a ball screw mechanism with an encoder position
        feedback; which arrangement would easily lend itself to digital
        control. Whatever the method of controlling the movement of the
        piston, the final purpose is to controllably elliptasize the
        flexible band from an axial perspective so as to cause the
        controlled and varying degrees of swept volume of fluid flow per
        revolution of the vane pump or motor. In the basic embodiment of
        this invention, opposing pairs of pistons move simultaneously
        towards or away from each other, while the remaining set of
        opposed pistons behave in simultaneous opposition to the action
        of the first pair. This behavior results in varying degrees of
        elliptic reshaping of the flexible band viewed from the axial
        perspective of the vane rotor. A novel and significant aspect of
        this device is the freedom of movement of the flexible band,
        which is impossible in the prior art. This includes a special
        manipulation of the pistons and band that allow the combination
        of this invention to simultaneously manipulate two common
        fluids, but hydraulically separate, outputs of this device as
        pump or motor. The variable pressure balanced design has two
        equal and identical pressure fluid outputs which will be merged
        so as to drive a hydraulic motor to form what is called a
        hydrostatic transmission. This is a second embodiment of the
        present invention. In addition, a second variable vane device of
        the proposed design may act as a motor in a conventional type of
        hydrostatic transmission with all of the current results, but
        with much greater efficiency and range. Another embodiment of
        the invention is a special piston manipulation that causes this
        invention to act like the early variable non-pressure balanced
        construction pumps with a single input and output. In the
        present invention, there is shown two separate hydraulic
        circuits with separate inputs and outputs where a single pump of
        the proposed design is separately connected to two fixed
        displacements hydraulic motors. Motor Number 1 will connect in
        closed hydrostatic loop with the first and second quadrant ports
        of the pump, while motor Number 2 will connect in closed
        hydrostatic loop to the third and forth quadrants with no
        interconnection. The plumbing of the motor circuits would be
        such that both motors would have the correct shaft rotation
        direction for a hypothetical example, say forward. If the 12
        o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons were directed inward, the 3
        o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons would be forced outward with equal
        hydraulic flow to both motors occurring, causing the motors to
        turn at the same controlled speed in the forward direction. Now
        assume that the original circular flexible band shape is
        modified such that the 3 o'clock piston is moved inward and the
        9 o'clock piston is moved outward, while holding the 12 o'clock
        and 6 o'clock pistons at neutral, the band remaining circular in
        shape. A first motor connected to the first and second quadrants
        will reverse shaft directions, with a speed equal to that of a
        second motor whose direction is still forward. If the 3 o'clock
        and 9 o'clock piston were both moved the other way, the second
        motor would instead reverse rotation in relation to the first
        motor. Combine this action with the original action of the basic
        embodiment as described, and one motor can be caused to rotate
        deliberately and controllably faster than the other motor, such
        as is the case for an axle set of a vehicle going around a turn.
        Another embodiment of the invention has two separate piston
        control methods which can be algebraically mixed to effect
        differential control means of axle rotation for negotiating a
        turning radius. Another embodiment comprises a fixed
        displacement motor of the prior art constructed in the manner of
        this invention, with the pistons permanently fixed. This
        arrangement will be much more efficient than conventional
        hydraulic motors. A still further embodiment is the case of
        fixed displacement motors and pumps which can greatly improve
        the efficiency of existing vane pump and motors; namely that one
        or several flexible bands of the proposed invention construction
        can be closely fitted to be movable just inside the fixed
        elliptic or circular cam ring surface of conventional units,
        with a small clearance between the flexible ring exterior and
        the fixed cam ring interior, said clearance supporting an oil
        film which has minimal friction, while the vane outer edges are
        now supported by the innermost flexible band's inner surface.
        This construction provides some of the advantages of the subject
        invention, such as containment of vane centripetal force, and
        the replacement of vane-to-fixed cam ring friction with broad
        oil film friction that is much less, and not speed squared
        dependent. The primary invention configured as a fixed unit will
        still be most efficient due to the open chamber between each
        fixed piston pair. A smaller total oil film in this case will
        give the least loss. A significant advantage of the just
        described construction is the ability to fix existing design, or
        even retrofit field product without any mechanical change
        required. Existing vane units could compete with fixed piston
        pumps and motors in terms of efficiency, but would be less
        efficient than the basic embodiment. This is a fifth embodiment
        of the invention. </p>
      <p>Finally, in yet another aspect of the invention, the hydraulic
        vane pump with a flexible band control described in U.S. Pat.
        No. 6,022,201, also known as an hydristor, may be employed in a
        heat pump system characterized as a hydristor heat pump. The
        hydristor heat pump preferably contains a closed freon loop
        containing a first and a second closed half loop, the hydristor
        being integral to the closed freon loop and in fluid
        communication therewith. A first half of the hydristor contains
        at least one kidney port forming a first inlet (e.g., in the
        fourth quadrant as shown in FIG. 4) and at least one kidney port
        forming a first outlet (e.g., in the first quadrant as shown in
        FIG. 4). The first half of the hydristor functions as a
        pump/compressor as a chamber rotatably communicating with the
        rotor is volumetrically reduced as it rotates from the fourth
        quadrant to the first quadrant. The volumetric compression of
        the chamber in turn compresses the compressible fluid or freon
        contained therein through the first inlet chamber, and as such
        results in a heated liquid stream exiting the first outlet into
        the second closed half loop. </p>
      <p>The heated liquid freon stream then enters a second heat
        exchanger connected inline to the second closed half loop and
        thereby transfers heat to a cold reservoir such as a home
        heating system or a Stirling engine. The cooler freon stream
        exiting the second heat exchanger then continues in the second
        closed half loop back to a second half of the hydristor. </p>
      <p>The second half of the hydristor contains at least one kidney
        port forming a second inlet (e.g. in the second quadrant as
        shown in FIG. 4) and at least one kidney port forming a second
        outlet (e.g. in the third quadrant as shown in FIG. 4). The
        cooler freon stream enters the second inlet and exits the second
        half of the hydristor through the second outlet as a cooled and
        expanded gas freon stream. The second half of the hydristor
        functions as a motor/expander as the chamber rotatably
        communicating with the rotor is volumetrically increased as it
        rotates from the second quadrant to the third quadrant, and to
        the fourth quadrant as well. The volumetric expansion of the
        chamber in turn expands the compressible fluid or freon
        contained therein through the first inlet chamber, and as such
        results in a rarified gas freon stream exiting the second outlet
        into the first closed half loop at low pressure and temperature.
      </p>
      <p>The rarified gas freon stream then enters a first heat
        exchanger connected inline to or integral with the first closed
        half loop and thereby absorbs heat provided from a relatively
        warm reservoir such as the ambient air. The warmer rarified gas
        freon stream then exits the first heat exchanger and continues
        in the first closed half loop back to the first inlet for
        completion of a pump cycle. Note that quadrant four also
        increases volume and therefore creates additional motor torque
        thereby further reducing power input to the motor. The increased
        efficiency of the hydristor results in a reduction in the torque
        required by a startup motor associated with the hydristor heat
        pump. Furthermore, the increased efficiency of the hydristor
        actually enables the economic use of a Stirling engine thereby
        providing the benefits described hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, a heat pump system in accordance with the
        present invention contains a hydristor pump/motor in fluid and
        thermodynamic communication with a first heat exchanger
        communicating with a relatively warm reservoir, and a second
        heat exchanger communicating with a relatively cold reservoir.
        The hydristor and the first and second heat exchangers are
        integral to and in fluid communication with a closed
        compressible fluid loop. A Stirling engine or a home heating
        system may, for example, utilize heat transferred from the
        second heat exchanger thereby providing a reduction in energy
        usage and costs heretofore unrealized </p>
      <p>Another advantage is that the freon compressor oil circulates
        in the entire system and will tend to collect at the contact
        surfaces between the flexible band outer surface and the curved
        contact areas of the control pistons to form large hydrodynamic
        bearings that are self-actualizing hydraulic seals and low
        friction bearings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201 describes an hydraulic vane
        pump with a flexible band control. For definitional purposes,
        the entire description (incorporated herein) refers to a pump
        and/or motor that may also be referred to as a "hydristor". That
        description is included in the following discussion. The
        development of the hydristor has in turn resulted in the
        development of a super heat pump shown in FIGS. 26 and 27 that
        before now could not have been operated with the operational
        efficiencies described below. </p>
      <p>The isometric view shown in FIG. 1 has a frontal first quadrant
        cutaway that exposes some very important features of the
        invention. The rear end plate 1 is shown with the first quadrant
        kidney port 16 exposed. The front end plate 2 is partially
        cutaway with the kidney ports 17, 18, and 19 respectively in the
        second, third and fourth quadrants showing. The rear end plate 1
        has like kidney ports 20, 21, and 22 in axial alignment with
        ports 17, 18, and 19, but those ports in plate 1 are out of view
        in this drawing. This view shows like kidney ports front and
        back. However, it is only necessary to have one port per
        quadrant chamber to allow for fluid flow into and out of the
        chamber. Either the front or rear ports can be utilized, or both
        can be used to increase the flow capacity. Also, referring to
        FIG. 4, any other means of porting which allows fluids to flow
        into or out of the volume 33, 34, 35, or 36 when they rotate in
        alignment with "quadrants one, two, three, or four" may be used.
        Front kidney port 23 is in the cutaway portion of end plate 2,
        and is in axial alignment with port 16. Piston 12 is exposed and
        is itself cut away at an angle to expose the high pressure fluid
        film 13 which exists between the curved inner surface of the
        piston, and the outer circumferential area of the flexible band
        nest 14. The piston interface shape as shown is curved; however,
        any surface shape that supports the fluid film 13 can be used.
        Each of the four pistons has a fluid film 13. Several vanes 24
        are exposed by the cutaways. The outer casting 25 has four
        piston guides and four control ports 26. The ports 26 direct the
        inlet and exhaust of fluid control pressure to the four pistons
        to effect reshaping of flexible band 14. The invention is
        totally symmetric in hydraulic function and can function
        interchangeably as a hydraulic motor. The front end plate 2 has
        a hole 27 in it to permit the insertion of a drive shaft that
        will couple to the rotor 15 by means of the internal splines 28.
        The drive shaft is not shown so as to minimize the complexity of
        the figure. Seals and bearings of conventional design are also
        left out for the same reason. The shaft requires both a seal and
        bearing in plates 1 and 2 to facilitate the rotation of the
        rotor 15, the vanes 24. The four holes 29 in each of plates 1
        and 2 would allow for four bolts which would tightly hold both
        of the end plates against the outer casting 25; however, any
        appropriate number of bolts may be used, and any other means of
        construction which hydraulically contains the rotor 15, vanes
        24, band 14, and shape control means such as the pistons 12, 3,
        6, and 9 may also be used. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows an axial end view of the invention with the end
        plates removed, and with dotted outlines of end plate 2 with
        ports 17, 18, 19, and 23 outlined. The four control pistons
        numbered 12, 3, 6, and 9 are now shown. Shaded areas 31 are
        filled or exhausted by the control ports 26 to allow control
        fluid into and out of the chamber 31 behind the four pistons 12,
        3, 6 and 9. As shown in FIG. 11, the flexible band 14 may have
        three concentric members 52, 53, and 54. These bands are
        preferably of stainless steel, each having a thickness in the
        order of 0.015 inches. The actual number and thickness of bands
        to be utilized will be determined by the design requirements.
        Also, as shown in FIG. 11, each vane 24 has compression springs
        32 mounted in rotor 15 that force the vane out from the center
        of the rotor 15 into contact with the inner surface of the band
        14. Three springs and bores are provided for mating with three
        pins 51 on each vane with the pins being equally spaced along
        the base of the vane. Such band and spring combinations are
        found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,215 which is incorporated by
        reference herein. This action assures that the vanes will seal
        fluid pressure at zero speed. It is a very important feature of
        this invention that the rotor 15, all the vanes 24, and the
        flexible band 14 will rotate as a group. At very slow speeds,
        the band will slip very slightly with regards to the vane speed,
        much like a squirrel cage a/c induction motor rotor will slip
        behind the field rotation speed. This slow drift is the result
        of fluid shear drag caused by the four fluid films 13, which act
        so as to slow down the flexible band 14 speed. This drag force
        is counteracted by the combined line contact friction of, in
        this example, nine vanes. The vane friction is much greater than
        the fluid film friction, and the vane friction increases as the
        speed squared. Thus, as the speed of rotation increases, the
        flexible band will begin to rotate as substantially the same
        speed as the rotor. Since the vane and band speed never quite
        equalize, the wear on the inner surface of the flexible band is
        evenly distributed over the entire inner band surface, and the
        maximum wear life is achieved. Since the centrifugal, speed
        squared forces are totally contained by the flexible band, the
        wear and failure mechanism of high-speed vane type pumps and
        motors is eliminated. The added friction of four fluid contact
        areas 13 is small compared to the combined vane friction, and
        does not increase significantly with higher speed. The result is
        a device which is much more efficient than any conventional
        design and which will operate efficiently at much higher speeds.
        These factors also allow for quieter operation at higher
        operating pressure. In FIG. 3, areas of the end plate 2 are
        marked 30 with identical areas axially in line therewith on end
        plate 1. A radial wedge shaped chamber 33 is shown directly
        under piston 3. Referring to FIG. 2, the front and back aligned
        areas 30 completely cover the axial ends of the chamber 33.
        Fluid pressure in quadrants one is prevented from directly
        flowing into quadrants two, and vice versa. If the rotation of
        the rotor is clockwise, the volume of chamber 33 will move from
        quadrant one to quadrant two in one ninth of a revolution. Since
        the chamber 33 is now closed on both ends by the presence of
        solid area 30, the volume of chamber 33 which was part of the
        first quadrant chamber volume is now forced into the second
        quadrant chamber. Simultaneously, 34 rotated from the fourth
        quadrant chamber into the first quadrant chamber. If the
        flexible band is formed to a circle, then volume 33 is equal to
        volume 34, and there is no gain or loss of fluid volume in any
        of the four quadrant chambers. This is true regardless of speed
        or direction. If ports 18 and 23 were connected to the inlet
        port of a separate fixed displacement hydraulic motor, and the
        motor's return port was connected to device ports 17 and 19, the
        shape of the flexible band would be called neutral because the
        pump would not move any fluid into or out of the motor, and the
        motor shaft would not turn since a fixed displacement of fluid
        must occur in order for the motor to turn. If ports 23 and 17
        were connected to one fixed displacement motor, and ports 18 and
        19 were connected to another such motor, the result would be
        exactly the same. In either case, the input shaft of the
        variable pump would continue to turn with no motion ever on a
        motor shaft. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4, control pressure is injected into the control ports
        26 for pistons 12 and 6 causing them to move radially inward.
        Any other mechanical means of control, such as rack 58 and
        pinion 60 activated by lever 61 as shown in FIG. 11, would act
        in a similar manner to the pressure and cause pistons 12 and 6
        to move radially inward due to external mechanical force. The
        spring action of the flexible band causes it to bulge out in
        equal measure against the pistons 3 and 9, while causing those
        pistons to move radially outward while exhausting the control
        fluids volume out through control ports 26. The use of
        mechanical control here would require that the mechanical
        controls means would retract to allow for the spring action of
        the band 14 to push pistons 3 and 9 outward. The arrows at the
        control ports 26 show the direction of fluid flow. Now for this
        discussion, a clockwise rotation is chosen. FIG. 4 also shows
        maximum deflection of the flexible band 14. Rotating vane
        chambers 34 and 35 are shown as minimized, while the chamber 33
        and 36 are maximized. Since chamber 33 is removing a much larger
        volume of fluid from the first quadrant than the chamber 34 is
        carrying in, the difference must be provided via either kidney
        ports 23 or 16. Therefore, ports 23 or 16 are suction ports that
        can be connected to an external hydraulic circuit, and fluid is
        drawn into "quadrant one" through those ports. Chamber 33 is
        very large when it rotates into the second quadrants, and
        chamber 35 now is very small in exiting. The large difference of
        the volumes must therefore be forced out kidney ports 17 or 20
        into the external hydraulic path. Ports 23 and 16, and 17 and 20
        form a hydrostatic loop when connected to an external fixed
        displacement hydraulic motor. For reference, look at schematic
        connection in FIG. 9. By varying the radial positions of the
        pistons 12, 3, 6, and 9, the fluid displaced can be fully
        controlled from zero to the maximum in any increment. Now, ports
        18 and 21, and 19 and 22 will form a second Siamese hydrostatic
        loop when they are connected to a second external hydraulic
        motor. For like displacements of the pistons 12 and 6, and
        opposite and equal motion of pistons 3 and 9, the fluid flow
        through fluid circuit A which consists of ports 23 and 16, and
        17 and 20 will exactly equal the flow through fluid circuit
        consisting of ports 18 and 21, and 19 and 22. This described the
        case of straight motion for a set of vehicle axles. The simple
        case of ports 23 and 16 paired with 18 and 21, and 17 and 30
        with 19 and 22, and then connected to a single fixed or variable
        hydraulic motor is also straight-line motion. For Reference,
        look at the fluid connection shown in FIG. 8. As the rotor,
        vane, and flexing band assembly rotate, the action of the
        elliptasized band will be to force the compression and extension
        of the vanes 24, with regard to angular position only. The
        pressure being applied to pistons 12 and 6 through ports 26
        causes the pistons to move inward. For the clockwise rotation,
        output hydraulic pressure will escalate in the second and fourth
        quadrant chambers. As the chamber pressure increases, an
        increasing radial outward force develops on the underside of
        pistons 12 and 6, thereby reducing the respective piston inward
        force. When the outward force is equal to the inward force, the
        piston inward motion ceases. As the external hydraulic motor
        circuit responds to pressure and turns, the developed pressure
        drops slightly, and allows the pistons 12 and 6 to move slightly
        more inward, and this in turn increases the volume of fluid
        passing through the variable pump, in turn causing the motor to
        turn faster, thus causing a further line drop, causing more
        piston motion in, and so on. Therefore, the pressure developed
        in the quadrant chambers is equal to, or in proportion to the
        control force, and the variable pump automatically changes its
        displacement to accommodate changing external flow, while
        holding the out pressure proportional to the control pressure.
        Thus the hydraulic motor torque is a function of control
        pressure regardless of variable pump input speed and direction
        and output motor speed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 depicts the opposite case of piston operation in that
        pistons 3 and 9 are pressurized, causing them to move radially
        inward. Pistons 12 and 6 are forced out and the ellipse flexible
        band major axis is now vertical. Swept chamber volume 34 now is
        large, as is volume 35, while volumes 33 and 36 are now small.
        There is now an excess of fluid entering the first and third
        quadrant chambers and kidney ports 23 and 16, and 18 and 21
        become pressure ports, while a shortage of fluid in the second
        and fourth quadrants results in kidney ports 17 and 20, and 19
        and 22 becoming suction ports and the hydraulic motor would now
        reverse direction. Note that in the case of FIGS. 4 and 5, if
        the shaft rotation of the pump input were reversed, the external
        fluid direction would also reverse and the manipulation of the
        opposed sets of control pistons, both the volume and direction
        of the fluid output can be fully controlled. Also note that by
        pressurizing the opposite sets of pistons to the pair shown in
        FIGS. 4 and 5, the subject pump can be used as a variable
        hydraulic motor. This is an ideal component for interface
        between an energy storage flywheel and road wheels. The device
        as a pump can also interface to a flywheel or electric motor
        including a pancake design motor and can act to use or recover
        flywheel or motor energy directly. During acceleration, the pump
        will withdraw the pre-stored kinetic energy from the flywheel
        and direct it to the road wheels so as to accelerate a vehicle.
        During braking, the opposite pistons try to force the flexible
        band back into a circular shape and in so doing, cause the pump
        to behave like a motor which then will act to re-accelerate the
        flywheel to near its initial speed. During the braking action,
        straight-line vehicle energy is recycled back into the flywheel
        and the vehicle is brought to a standstill. The braking action
        is the same for either a single output motor or two motors. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows control pressure being injected into port 26
        causing piston 3 to move inward. Control fluid flows from port
        26 of piston 9, and the entire flexible band moves toward piston
        9 while maintaining a circular shape. Rotating chambers 34 and
        33 behave as in FIG. 5 although with lesser amounts of fluid
        displacement per revolution. However, if a second motor is
        connected to ports 18 and 19, as shown in FIG. 9, it would
        experience a reversal of direction because chamber 36 is now
        larger than chamber 35, while at the same time, chamber 36 is
        larger than chamber 34. The third quadrant becomes suction while
        the fourth quadrant becomes the pressure. This is the behavior
        of some industrial skid-steer loaders that reverse the rotation
        of the wheels on one side of the vehicle with respect to the
        other side, causing the vehicle to spin on its vertical axis. If
        piston 9 were pressurized instead 3, both fluid circuits would
        reverse, and the two motors would now spin in opposite
        directions which are both reverse according to the original
        directions. During all of the above behavior, note that the
        control ports 26 of pistons 12 and 6 were quiescent with no
        inward or outward motion of these pistons. Also, during this
        differential action, a pressure balance within the pump is no
        longer maintained, and such differential action should be
        limited in duration and power level so as to minimize shaft
        bearing load and therefore maximize pump life. FIG. 7 combines
        the differential control action with the normal displacement
        control to achieve special unequal flow to the motors for the
        purpose of driving two wheels unequally, but correctly around a
        turn, since the outside wheel rotates faster than the inside
        wheel. Further, the amount of differential action can be
        directly related to the correct wheel track in response to a
        steering input. Thus, a very unique control mechanism is
        obtained for driving both wheels in turns and this will greatly
        enhance vehicle traction and safety. In this case, differential
        control pressure 37 is applied to ports 26 of pistons 3 and 9,
        while normal control pressure 38 now is simultaneously applied
        to those same ports. The resultant control pressure 39 and
        volume obtain at piston 9 may be different from the control
        pressure and volume obtained 31 applied to piston 3. The result
        is the combination of circular displacement of the flexible band
        14 with reshaping of the band at the same time. The result is a
        different but controlled speed of one more with respect to a
        second, as shown in FIG. 9 resulting in a differential two-wheel
        drive. The differential portion of the control can be derived
        from the steering system, while the go and stop motion can be
        derived from brake and acceleration pedals. FIG. 8 shows the
        variable pump connected to either a fixed displacement hydraulic
        motor or another variable pump that is used as the motor to form
        a hydrostatic transmission. The conventional hydraulic motor
        case is limited to the range of one-to-one and one-to-infinity,
        where the use of a second variable unit extends the range to
        infinity to one. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 shows the schematic connection of one variable device to
        two fixed hydraulic motors, utilizing the Siamese ports of the
        invention to drive two separate outputs. This connection will
        allow the differential feature of the invention to be in use to
        differentially drive the two motors so as to effect a
        differential drive to the motor outputs, which is the case in a
        vehicular axle set negotiating a turn. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 shows the installation of a flexible band 14 in a
        conventional vane pump. The vanes 24 and rotor 15 are of
        conventional construction, like the proposed invention. The
        outer housing 40 is of conventional manufacture and chamber
        design, and the oil film 41 separates the band 14 from the outer
        housing 40 which will reduce operating friction in conventional
        units. The oil film 41 in this case is the full length of the
        ground internal chamber of the conventional outer housing. The
        sliding friction of the set of vanes is eliminated, and replaced
        by a broad oil film 41 of lesser friction; and, the efficiency
        of the conventional vane pump or motor is improved. Fixing the
        piston arrangement shown in FIGS. 4 through 7 will result in a
        fixed displacement pump or motor, whose efficiency will be the
        highest of all due to a reduced oil film 41 area. </p>
      <p>For referential purposes, all radial orientation described
        hereinbelow is with respect to the axial center of a rotor in
        accordance with the present invention, unless otherwise stated.
        Stated another way, "radial" in this context means to emanate to
        and from the axial center of the cylindrical rotor, unless
        otherwise stated. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 12a-12c are views showing a crankshaft piston drive 100
        utilizing a right angle slot 102 in the piston 104 relative to
        the length and motion of the piston. As shown in FIGS. 12a-12c,
        when the crankshaft 106 is rotated counter clockwise relative to
        the crankshaft rotational center 108 shown, the piston moves
        from a neutral position to a position radially inward. Thus, the
        crankshaft exerts a radially inward movement thereby forming a
        flush communication between a contoured and curved end of the
        piston and the flexible band 110, depressing the band radially
        inward. Conversely, when the crankshaft is rotated clockwise of
        the crankshaft rotational center, the piston retracts radially
        outward from the flexible band, and the spring action of the
        band causes it to follow the piston. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 12a-12c, a
        control crankshaft operates in a right angle slot in the piston.
        The crankshaft throw is typically positioned at a right angle to
        the direction of piston travel, and is rotated plus or minus 90
        degrees to cause a sinusoidal motion of the piston thereby
        resulting in a radially reciprocal (radially inward and then
        radially outward) motion of the piston. Thus, the linear and
        radial reciprocal motion of the piston corresponds to a sine
        wave responsive to each degree of crankshaft rotation. The
        spring like nature of the band causes it to remain in intimate
        contact with the piston surface via a thin oil film, thus
        forming a hydrodynamic bearing from the oil film. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 13, yet another piston actuator is shown wherein a
        lever is externally controlled to effect respective radially
        inward and outward motions of the piston. The lever can thus be
        controlled by any connection that provides a common manipulation
        of the plurality of pistons (or shape actuators of the flexible
        band) shown in the Figures, or the lever can be individually
        controlled. For example, simple manipulation of a foot pedal (an
        accelerometer for example) can effect manual control of the
        piston through the use of the lever. </p>
      <p>FIG. 14 generally depicts the forces acting on a given piston.
        A steady state control pressure is radially inwardly applied to
        a radially outward cross-sectional area of the piston. During
        operation, as the work pressure increases below the flexible
        band, it exerts a radially outward force acting upon a radially
        inward contoured section of the piston. As the work pressure
        increases and decreases, therefore, the piston is cycled
        radially outward and radially inward. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, FIG. 14 illustrates that relative to direct
        hydraulic piston control, an area radially outward of the piston
        is subject to a controlled hydraulic pressure which causes the
        piston to move radially inward. This action causes the pump to
        develop a greater work pressure by virtue of the fact that
        radially inward movement of the piston causes increased
        displacement output of the pump. This in turn causes the working
        pressure to rise. When the work pressure has reaches a value
        which balances the net force created on the piston by the
        control pressure, the piston inward motion ceases, providing a
        servo-type of control function wherein the pump working pressure
        tracks the control pressure. Thus, this type of control system
        forms a power amplifier where the output pressure of the pump
        tracks the control pressure with the result that the control
        pressure controls the power output linearly. This same operating
        principle is exhibited by the embodiment shown in FIG. 16, as
        described below. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 15, yet another piston actuator is shown containing a
        control screw 114 threadedly received in an axial bore 116 of
        the piston 104. The control screw is thus rotatable to advance
        or retard piston position. The control is linearly related in
        that the degree of screw rotation is directly related to the
        cyclic and radial piston motion. Given the screw's inherent
        design inhibition for radially outward retraction of the piston,
        this type of piston actuator is particularly useful in
        preventing feedback (and an applied torque to an associated
        actuator) due to applied torque or work performance spikes. For
        example, the standard jarring caused during tractor operation
        may result in an associated pressure spike within the rotor that
        is then transmitted through the piston and into the actuator.
        Therefore, the resultant torque absorbed by other types of
        actuators, a rack and pinion for example, could potentially
        fracture the actuator assembly. The retraction inhibition of
        this embodiment is one solution to this problem. Nevertheless, a
        ball-screw control means may be used to reduce the friction of
        the control screw if desired. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, FIG. 16
        depicts yet another piston actuator that can be described as a
        small closed-loop servo system. A piston spool housing 118 is
        formed as an axial bore within the piston 104. A plurality of
        radially extending passages, relative to the axial bore of the
        piston, facilitate injection and exhaust of fluidic pressure
        within the piston spool housing. A spool 120 having a plurality
        of turns 122 (two as shown) is slidably received within the
        piston spool housing. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 16, the spool and piston are shown in a
        balanced position. Stated another way, the control pressure
        force exerting a radially inward force on the piston and the
        opposing working pressure exerting a radially outward force on
        the piston are substantially equivalent wherein the spool
        exhibits an equilibrium position relative thereto. In operation,
        assume the spool is forced radially inward into the piston
        housing. A fixed control pressure is then injected through
        passage 124 given that the turn blocking the passage has been
        thrust radially inward thereby opening passage 124. The control
        pressure then flows radially outward through passage 126 in
        fluid communication with the pressure chamber 125 behind the
        piston 104. As a consequence, the control pressure increases the
        radially inward force applied to the radially outward
        cross-section of the piston (within the control pressure
        chamber) thereby biasing the piston radially inward. As this
        occurs, the working pressure against the piston (pump output)
        increases, and the relative position of the spool is returned to
        a neutral balance as the physical position of the piston moves
        to realign with the new neutral spool position. </p>
      <p>If the working pressure overcomes the applied piston control
        pressure, the spool is retracted radially outward through the
        piston spool housing by virtue of the physical movement of the
        piston body relative to the existing spool position, thereby
        opening passages 128 and 130 and thus enabling exhaust of the
        control pressure and effectively reducing the associated piston
        control force. The reduction in the control pressure force
        results in the working pressure biasing the piston radially
        outward thereby reducing pump displacement and the localized
        working pressure. The reduction of working pressure continues
        until the working pressure is reduced to a point less than the
        remaining control pressure (and the spring energy exerted by a
        spring locator (not shown) on the radially outwardmost end of
        the spool) within the control pressure chamber. The piston thus
        "tracks" the piston control pressure and again seeks the
        balanced position of the spool as described above. The valving
        arrangement results in low requirements of the force applied to
        the spool compared to the piston reaction force, or, the working
        force applied against the piston. Thus, the force requirement on
        the spool for control is minimized by means of the secondary
        power servo spool system described. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, the system described in FIG. 16 is a
        hydraulic control amplifier spool means useful in applications
        where the working pressure forces exerted on the piston(s) are
        relatively very high. A secondary dedicated spool amplifier may
        be employed thus permitting a greatly reduced control force
        requirement, and thereby facilitating the control of very large
        levels of power with a small control force. A transistor
        analogue would be the Darlington amplifier. Relative thereto,
        the control means described in FIG. 16 may also be referred to
        as a "Darlington Power Amplifier". </p>
      <p>FIG. 17 shows yet another piston actuator containing an
        externally controlled cam 132 and a cam roller 134. The cam
        roller is fixed to a radially outward portion of the piston. The
        cam profile 132 is slidably engaged with the roller in linear
        motion thereto, and thus effects a radial reciprocal movement of
        the piston 104. The cam motion can be linear as shown, or the
        cam motion can be circular around the pump rotor center. Related
        thereto, FIG. 21 shows a circular cam ring 135 containing four
        cam profiles 136 each cam corresponding to a piston within the
        four-piston model shown. In motion, the cam ring thus
        facilitates common and simultaneous control of all four pistons
        wherein the cam profiles may all be the same or different, and
        may be linear and/or nonlinear. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 18-20 each also illustrate a control linkage means for
        facilitating common and simultaneous operation or control of a
        plurality of pistons. A "pump center of rotation" is defined for
        each control linkage and is merely the axial center of the rotor
        and pump (not shown). Thus, each control linkage surrounds a
        rotor/pump as shown in FIGS. 1-11 for example. </p>
      <p>FIG. 18 shows a plurality of sprockets 138 (four) corresponding
        to an equal plurality of pistons (not all shown) and associated
        crankshafts (not all shown). Each sprocket rotatably
        communicates with a respective crankshaft that upon revolution
        results in radial reciprocation of the respective piston. An
        externally driven chain 140 results in simultaneous rotary
        motion of the sprockets. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 shows an alternative control linkage means that again
        contains a plurality of gears 142, a corresponding plurality of
        crankshafts, and a corresponding plurality of pistons. In
        concert therewith, an externally driven ring gear 144, radially
        external or internal of the plurality of gears, facilitates a
        common and simultaneous control of the pistons. The ring gear is
        formed with a plurality of sets of teeth symmetrically spaced
        about the circumference of the ring, each set of teeth
        corresponding to a piston. In the embodiment shown, the teeth
        are formed at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 O'clock positions. In
        operation, the sets of teeth of the ring gear engage the teeth
        of a respective sprocket or gear thereby throwing the crankshaft
        and facilitating radial movement of the associated piston. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of FIG. 20 operates very similarly to FIGS. 18
        and 19. However, FIG. 20 employs a plurality of crowned flat
        pulleys 146 or gears (again corresponding to an equal number of
        pistons and crankshafts) driven by a belt 148 for simultaneous
        control of the plurality of pistons. </p>
      <p>Relative to FIG. 22, a differential gear set with independent
        control inputs can be added to pistons at the 3 and 9 O'Clock
        positions in the embodiment shown in FIG. 7, for example,
        thereby facilitating differential behavior of a vehicle per
        operation of a rotor as shown in FIG. 7. In certain cases
        relative to vehicle operation, for example, it is undesirable to
        allow the differential input to cause opposite wheel rotation.
        For example, if the differential gear control were connected to
        a tractor steering wheel without any relation to the forward or
        reverse speed setting, the tractor would stand still and turning
        the steering wheel would cause one wheel to back up, while the
        other would drive forward with the result that the wheels would
        chew up the surface and dig two holes for the drive wheels. This
        is of course unacceptable. A solution has been discovered
        whereby a third axial control system for the 3 O'clock and 9
        O'clock crankshafts is introduced. In neutral position
        (stopped), the crankshafts are at 90 degrees to the piston
        direction (See FIG. 12a). The solution is to vary the actual
        stroke of the crankshaft by means of an axial ramp system which
        is able to vary the stroke in response to an axial (with respect
        to the crankshaft) control input motion. As shown in FIGS.
        22a-22c, the stroke can be changed when the piston is in the
        neutral position without causing any change in the piston
        position. If the crank were at perhaps 30 degrees of control
        rotation, increasing or decreasing the stroke would as shown
        affect the piston position. If the 3 O'clock stroke was
        increased while the 9 O'clock stroke was decreased by the same
        amount, the effect would be to create a shift in the flexible
        belt position, causing a differential behavior, while allowing
        the speed control portion of the control to ellipticize the
        belt, causing perhaps forward motion. The result is a
        mathematical addition of flows on one side of the rotor, and a
        mathematical subtraction of flows on the other side of the
        rotor, and a true differential drive system results. </p>
      <p>If the speed were increased, the crankshaft control angle would
        increase, but the variable crankshaft strokes would have same
        mathematical effect on the combined differential/speed behavior,
        and the drive wheels would again be mathematically corrected to
        turn at the correct, yet faster rate for the turn. The same
        principles apply for the reverse direction. A separate control
        input can be accomplished to only cause differential behavior.
        This is only applicable for a four-wheel drive unit. This can be
        accomplished by connecting a properly sized hydraulic wheel
        motor for, perhaps the left front wheel tire (sized to reflect
        the smaller tire diameter of that front tire) in hydraulic
        series with the left rear wheel (larger) motor with the result
        that the hydraulic pressure forced through the left hydraulic
        circuit is shared by the two motors, and their speeds are locked
        in synchronicity; a series non-slip system. The same system can
        be used for the right side with similar results. In normal
        four-wheel drive, the four wheels are driven at the correct rate
        in terms of the tire patches on the ground, and the effect is as
        if all axles were locked for straight-line travel, with maximum
        traction, even though the vehicle is turning. This system
        results in giving the maximum traction under all ground
        conditions, and is thought to be a form of analog hydraulic
        computer which calculates, using the laws of geometry, the
        correct hydraulic behavior in response to control inputs. </p>
      <p>In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention,
        FIGS. 23a and 23b describe a spool rotor having spool ends that
        are then mated respectively to wear plates known in the art. See
        U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201 for example. The spool ends eliminate
        the wear pattern normally caused by the flexible belt as the
        edges of the belt abrade the inner surfaces of the wear plates
        adjacent each respective spool end. The use of the spool thus
        eliminates the effective motion between the edges of the vanes
        extending from the axis to the flexible belt and the stationary
        wear plates. The spool ends are instead in rotary communication
        with the stationary wear plates. As a result, the vanes can be
        individually sealed along their individual radial lengths and
        along the interface between an inner surface of the spool end
        and the radial lengths of the vanes. Additionally, a flexible
        o-ring or seal may be place between belt and the radial outer
        edges of the vanes in communication with the flexible belt that
        is then flexibly adjusted during rotation to retain a seal
        between the radial outer edges of the vanes and the inner
        surface of the rotational flexible belt, along the radial edges,
        and even at the interface where the vanes enter the rotor slots
        (i.e. all four vane edge interfaces). Accordingly, employment of
        the spool ends substantially improves the volumetric and overall
        efficiency of the pump. For example, in certain cases the
        volumetric efficiency is improved from 85% to 97% or greater. </p>
      <p>Stated another way, in conventional designs, the vanes and the
        rotor are axially coextensive and fit within wear plates at both
        ends with a small clearance. This small clearance causes
        substantial volumetric inefficiency, or bypass of pumped fluid.
        Also, the radially outer edges of the vanes have a leakage
        contribution in conventional designs where the vanes slide at
        speed against the inner surface of the chamber to create the
        pumping action. U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,201 substantially solved the
        problem of radial leakage by providing vanes having intimate
        contact within the inner surface of the belt. Conventionally,
        the axial ends of the vanes slide at rotor speed against the
        wear plates making effective sealing impossible. The spool
        design of the present invention therefore solves several
        problems. It eliminates the high speed wear at the ends by
        containing the vanes wholly within the spool ends, so that the
        only wear on the vanes is relative to the cyclical radial motion
        of the vanes during operation. This arrangement thus permits a
        seal system at the vane ends in addition to the vane outer edge
        abutting the inside surface of the flexible band. By adding a
        seal between the vane surfaces which are sliding within the
        rotor guide slots formed within the spool ends, the whole
        vane/spool ends/belt surface/rotor outer circumference between
        two adjacent vanes can now be effectively sealed thereby
        improving the hydristor or pump efficiency to unparalleled
        levels at 97-98%. The spool ends simply mate with the end or
        wear plates shown in FIG. 1, for example. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect of the invention, FIG. 24 illustrates a
        sealing mechanism wherein a pair of flaps are counterbored into
        the wear plates if the rotor has open kidney ports adjacent
        thereto, and are spaced to flap against the piston edges as it
        moves flush with a flexible belt. Each piston thus has
        corresponding flaps that are operable upon the flush
        communication of the piston's contoured surface and the flexible
        belt. Volumetric efficiency is thereby enhanced. </p>
      <p>In still yet another aspect of the invention, an improvement in
        the sealing of the invention described in U.S. Pat. No.
        6,022,201 and in conventional designs includes an insert 152
        slidably engaged within an arcuate groove 154 formed within the
        wear plate 155. See FIG. 25. </p>
      <p>In conventional fixed displacement vane pumps and motors, there
        is a problem associated with equalizing the pressure at the
        radially inner and outer vane edges. Chamber pressure must be
        routed under the vane (at its radially innermost point) to
        equalize the radially inward force created by the chamber
        pressure existing between the radial outer edge of the vane and
        the inner surface of the flexible belt (or the chamber confining
        contour). This is true both for conventional fixed designs, and
        the hydristor variable belt design rotors described in U.S. Pat.
        No. 6,022,201. In conventional practice, satisfactory sealing
        has not yet been achieved in bidirectional designs. Either the
        routing grooves at the axial ends of two opposite chambers where
        pressure sealing is desired are extended to allow for sealing
        the vane for the full rotation across the sealing surface (see
        reference number 30 in FIG. 1, for example), or a compromise is
        made for all four sealing areas (reference number 30) i.e. the
        chamber groove to route oil only extends halfway. The first case
        works well for uni-directional operation and the second case
        works moderately acceptable for bi-directional operation. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of
        arcuate grooves are formed within the inner surface of the wear
        plate, each groove corresponding to an operable quadrant within
        the rotor. The grooves are symmetrically placed at the beginning
        of each quadrant and are formed in a sausage-link shape or in a
        shape that precludes slippage of the insert from within the
        channel or groove beyond a limited range. Therefore, each end of
        the groove comprises a narrower opening thereby precluding
        slippage of the insert once place therein. Additionally, each
        groove is thus formed at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 O'clock positions
        in an embodiment containing four pistons placed symmetrically
        about the rotor periphery. </p>
      <p>The valve insert shown in FIGS. 25a-c is slidably engaged
        within a corresponding groove having an arcuate length
        approximately equal to the radially inner arcuate length
        existing between two juxtaposed vanes. As shown in FIGS. 25b and
        25c, the insert has a pair of annuli 156 extending through the
        top of the insert for fluid flow therethrough. Thus fluid
        initially flowing beneath the insert is channeled through a
        right hole and then provides pressure over the top surface of
        the insert. A groove 158 is cut on the underside to facilitate
        the flow of fluid through the bottom and then out through the
        top of the insert. The valve insert thus responds to chamber
        fluidic pressure which drives the insert angularly over a small
        range within the groove so as to extend the vane underpressure
        for proper vane operation for a given pressure case. This is
        true for both rotational directions of the rotor. If any other
        chamber sees pressure, the inserts "switch" to extend the
        sealing as required for the particular case. This is even true
        for adjacent chambers as well as opposite chambers. Thus
        bi-directional volumetric efficiency is improved during
        single/dual pump operation, or any motor operation. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect of the invention, the hydristor pump
        described above may be employed in a classical freon (or freon
        oil) heat pump system, in accordance with the present invention.
        As shown in FIGS. 26 and 27, a hydristor super heat pump system
        160 contains a hydristor heat pump/motor or hydristor
        compressor/expander 162. A closed compressible fluid (or
        refrigerant) loop 164 contains a closed first half loop 166 and
        a closed second half loop 168 and provides fluid communication
        throughout the system as the hydristor 162 pumps the
        compressible fluid 170 (or refrigerant) contained therein. A
        first heat exchanger 172 is connected integral to and in fluid
        communication with the first half loop 166 and provides heat
        transfer from a warm reservoir 174 such as the air or ambient
        environment to the refrigerant 170 traversing within the first
        half loop 166. A second heat exchanger 176 is connected in line
        to the second half loop 168 and provides heat transfer from a
        compressed stream of fluid 170 (such as liquid freon at about
        300.degree. F.) to a relatively cold reservoir 178 such as a
        home heating system or a Stirling Engine, for example. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the first half loop 166 is connected
        to at least one respective kidney port 180, 182 in each of the
        third and fourth quadrants 181 and 183, respectively, of the
        hydristor 160 (e.g. the first inlet and the second outlet,
        respectively), whereby the connections are sealed using gaskets
        or other seals to ensure a closed system. Additionally, the
        second half loop 168 is connected to at least one respective
        kidney port 184, 186 in each of the first and second quadrants
        185 and 187, respectively, of the hydristor 162 (e.g. the first
        outlet and the second outlet, respectively), whereby the
        connections are also sealed to ensure a closed system 160. </p>
      <p>In operation of a preferred embodiment, a startup motor 188 is
        operably connected to the hydristor 162 and is started to begin
        hydristor operation. The freon or refrigerant 170 sealed within
        the closed loop 164 then begins to flow based on hydristor
        operation. The refrigerant 170a, rarified freon at about
        -10.degree. F. for example, flows into the inlet port 182 of the
        fourth quadrant 183 of the hydristor 162 and is compressed as it
        is transferred by the rotor 192 from its chamber 194 in the
        fourth quadrant 183 to the same compressed chamber in the first
        quadrant 185. The freon is thereby compressed to a liquid 170b
        at about 300.degree. F. and then exits from the kidney port 184
        in the first quadrant 185 and into the closed second half loop
        168. Control pressure exerted on piston 3 alone thus pushes
        piston 3 and band 14 radially inward and reduces the volumetric
        capacity of the chamber 194 rotating from quadrant four 183 into
        quadrant one 185 and thereby compresses the cold rarified freon
        gas 170 into a hot freon liquid 170b. Pistons 6, 9, and 12
        remain extended radially outward in their respective cylinders.
        Other piston control permutations are possible, so long as the
        general compression and expansion functions are retained as
        described above. </p>
      <p>For example, in a preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 28, the
        fluidic pressure applied to piston 3 is the greatest and
        therefore biases the piston 3 to the most radially inward point
        in the piston chamber. The volume in chamber 194a is therefore
        minimized in quadrant 185a providing a maximum pressure at the
        outlet 186a. The fluidic pressure applied to piston 6 is reduced
        such that the band 14 exerts a radially outward pressure, and
        the piston 6 thus extends radially inward only about half to
        three/quarters of the length of the piston chamber. The fluidic
        pressure applied to piston 9 is reduced such that the band 14
        exerts a radially outward pressure, and the piston 9 thus
        extends radially inward only about one quarter to one half of
        the length of the piston chamber. Finally, no fluidic pressure
        is applied to piston 12 and as such piston 12 does not at all
        extend radially inward but is in fact maintained at a radially
        outward most point in its respective piston chamber. The
        stepwise reduction in the fluidic pressure applied to the
        pistons in clockwise orientation results in the gradual increase
        in volume in chamber 194a as it rotates clockwise from quadrant
        one 185a through quadrant four 183a. As a result, the shear
        heating effect normally exhibited by known expansion valves is
        avoided reducing the resultant heat and also effecting a
        stepwise increase in motor torque as the chamber rotates from
        quadrant one 185a through quadrant four 183a. An increase in
        motor torque directly translates to a reduction in energy usage.
      </p>
      <p>Again referring to FIG. 26, as the freon liquid 170b at
        300.degree. F. passes through the second heat exchanger 176, the
        temperature preferably drops to about 140.degree. F. The cooler
        freon stream 170c then enters at least one kidney port inlet 186
        of the second quadrant 187 and is expanded as it travels from
        the second quadrant 187 to the third quadrant 181 via rotation
        of the rotor 192. In contrast to the compressor half 200 (i.e.
        quadrants four and one) of the hydristor 162 described above,
        the respective control pressure exerted on piston 3, but not on
        the other pistons, results in an increased volumetric capacity
        of the chamber 194 rotating from quadrant two 183 into quadrant
        three 181 (quadrants 181 and 183 forming expander half 201) and
        thereby expands the freon stream 170c at 140.degree. F. to a
        rarified supercooled freon gas stream 170d at about -40.degree.
        F. The supercooled freon 170d exits the third quadrant 181
        through at least one kidney port 180 and enters the closed first
        half loop 166. From there, the supercooled stream 170d enters
        the first heat exchanger 172 and absorbs heat provided by the
        relatively warm reservoir such as the air. Upon exiting the
        first heat exchanger 172, the freon gas stream 170a is warmed to
        -10.degree. F. for example. The rarified freon gas 170a or the
        compressible fluid then once again enters the fourth quadrant
        183 to repeat the cycle. </p>
      <p>The first and second heat exchangers 172 and 176 are preferably
        any nondirect heat conductor type such as a shell and tube heat
        exchanger, for example. Exemplary heat exchangers include those
        described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,340,052, 6,340,055, 6,341,650,
        6,336,501, 6,019,168, and 6,325,140, each herein incorporated by
        reference. </p>
      <p>The startup motor 188 may be any motor rated to supply the
        requisite power needed to activate the hydristor rotor. As the
        system design criteria such as piston control pressures and heat
        exchanger surface areas are tailored based on design factors
        such as the average temperatures of the warm and cool reservoirs
        and the heat transfer and pressure/vapor properties of the
        compressible fluid, the motor power rating will vary
        accordingly. Exemplary startup motors include those described in
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,346,810, 6,342,739, 6,340,856, 6,343,877, and
        6,345,600, each herein incorporated by reference. </p>
      <p>Since the hydristor 162 is actually a dual pump/motor or
        compressor/expander, the first half functions as a compressor
        and the second half functions as an expansion valve which acts
        as a motor to relax the freon pressure. The motor torque is
        subtracted from the external drive torque supplied by the system
        electric startup motor. Thus the system amplification will be
        much higher than the 300% exhibited by the state of the art heat
        pump, and more on the order of about 1000% or 10 times. In
        simple terms, the heat generated from this system when applied
        to home heating systems could therefore reduce the required
        power to 10% of the original amount as compared to conventional
        heating systems. Thermal considerations may arise due to the use
        of a single hydristor 162. For example, the high heat applied to
        the vanes and the rotor surface rotated to the very cold
        expansion area cause a loss of overall efficiency. Two
        hydristors on a common shaft connected to the startup motor may
        be used to overcome this concern. This would enable better
        thermal isolation if required, and thereby better efficiency and
        amplication (also called coefficient of performance of COP).
        Another factor concerning COP is that the individual hydristor
        control pistons may be individually controlled if desired
        resulting in variable performance to match the overall system
        conditions. The current practice of turning the drive or startup
        motor 188 on and off in a cyclical manner to drive a fixed or
        non-variable pump is inherently inefficient and thereby
        contributes to lesser COP ratings. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect of the invention, the hydristor super
        heat pump 162 described above may be utilized in conjunction
        with a Stirling Engine 178a (cold reservoir) and an electrical
        generator 196 as shown in FIG. 27. The addition of a Stirling
        Engine 178a results in the generation of electrical power as a
        result of the sun's daytime energy heating the air, which in
        turn is latent in the night air, even in winter, during rain,
        and during snow. The result in solar energy during day and
        night, summer and winter, and rain and snow. With such a
        relatively high COP for the hydristor super heat pump, the
        typical conversion efficiency for a Stirling Engine of 35% when
        combined with the hydristor super heat pump COP of 1000% or
        10.times. results in a net conversion efficiency of 350%! As a
        result, when the Stirling engine 178a is combined with the
        hydristor super heat pump 162, the startup motor 188 may
        eventually be switched off completely to run the hydristor 162
        on internal power with a net power balance left over to power a
        desired external electrical load 197 directly. Thus, power can
        be generated by the sun's energy with true zero emissions and no
        fuel required since the solar nuclear power plant, or the sun,
        supplies the fuel. This type of system would find application in
        home heating systems, solar cars, prop airplanes, ships and
        submarines whether night or day, thereby providing a continuous
        power source based on thermodynamic principles. </p>
      <p>Exemplary Stirling engines are described in U.S. Pat. Nos.
        6,019,168, 5,924,305, 6,195,992, 6,263,671, 5,934,076, 6,161,381
        and 6,338,248, each herein incorporated by reference. </p>
      <p>While the foregoing examples illustrate and describe the use of
        the present invention, they are not intended to limit the
        invention as disclosed in certain preferred embodiments herein.
        Therefore, variations and modifications commensurate with the
        above teachings and the skill and/or knowledge of the relevant
        art, are within the scope of the present invention. </p>
