      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Early devices to vary the displacement of vane pumps involved
        the deliberate offset of the rotational center of the vane rotor
        with respect to the geometrical center of the circular outer
        case. The amount of offset would then control the swept volume
        of the pump and thereby provide a desired volumetric output for
        each rotation of the rotor. Several problems with this design
        limited its use. </p>
      <p>First, the pressure unbalance caused by the hydraulic-based
        force on the radial cross-section of the rotor and vanes at the
        axis viewed from the radial perspective severely limited the
        power capability and power density of these pumps and resulted
        in very heavy, inefficient, and cumbersome devices. Second, the
        centrifugal force of each vane during high speed rotation caused
        severe wear of the vane outer edge and the inner surface of the
        outer containment housing. </p>
      <p>Later fixed displacement designs were conceived around the
        concept of pressure balance in which two geometrically opposed
        high pressure chambers would cause a cancellation of radial load
        due to equal and opposed cross-section pressure areas and
        opposite vector direction which resulted in a zero net force
        radially on the shaft bearing. The design is referred to as the
        pressure balanced vane pump or motor. Typical efficiency of
        these devices is 70 to 85% under rated loading and speed. Still
        later improvements included changing the chamber shape of
        pressure balanced vane style devices and involved the use of
        several types of adjustable inner surfaces of the outer housing
        for guiding and radially adjusting the vanes as they rotate. One
        improvement is a continuous band which is flexible and subject
        to radial deformation so as to cause displacement control of the
        vanes. However, these flexible bands did not rotate. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The basic embodiment of this invention is a rotor with
        spring-biased, radially extensible vanes that are constrained in
        their outward radial movement, away from the rotor center of
        rotation, by the inner circumferential area of a continuous
        flexible band which has the same axial width as the rotor and
        vanes. It is especially important to notice in the basic
        embodiment that the flexible band is designed to rotate with the
        vanes and rotor. The spring loading of the vanes is by
        conventional means as is the practice with existing vane pumps
        and motors; namely that the spring is compressed between the
        rotor itself and the radially inward edge of the vane so as to
        drive every vane radially out from the rotor body against the
        inner area of the flexible band. The spring preload causes the
        vanes to contact the flexible band inside surface at slow speeds
        which includes zero. This is especially important if this
        embodiment is to be used as a variable or fixed displacement
        hydraulic motor because hydraulic sealing of the vane's outer
        edge is assured at zero speed. Since the flexible band is
        totally free to rotate with the vanes and rotor, a very big
        source of friction, wear, and inefficiency is eliminated due to
        the teaching of this invention. The well known limitation of the
        prior art; namely the sliding edge friction associated with the
        combined outward radial force of the vanes is totally eliminated
        since there is substantially no relative motion between outside
        edges of the vanes and the interior constraining surface of the
        flexible containment band. Further, as the rotor's speed
        increases, the speed-squared radially outward combined force of
        the set of vanes is fully contained by the continuity of the
        flexible band simulating a pressure-vessel type of containment,
        as if the flexible band were a cross section of a pressure
        containment cylinder, and the individual radial outward force of
        the vanes were the pictorial radially outward arrows that are
        used in drawings to depict the action of the force which is
        contained. Since the action of the flexible band is to fully
        contain these combined radial forces of the vanes, there is
        absolutely no increase of frictional forces due to increasing
        radial vane force, and this invention solves a very severe
        limitation of the prior art in that the rotating speed of the
        fixed devices built according to the prior art is limited to
        about 4,000 revolutions per minute, while the upper speed limit
        of the subject invention is substantially higher, say to the
        range of 30,000 revolutions per minute, governed largely by the
        design strength and durability of the flexible band. In fact,
        testing showed that the efficiency of this invention utilizing
        the rotating components of a commercially available pump having
        an advertised efficiency of 88% resulted in efficiency
        measurements of 93.5 to 94.1% when used in combination with the
        rotating flexible band. The greater efficiency of the instant
        invention over the prior art will result in much smaller
        variable pumps and motors in severe applications such as
        spacecraft. The flexible band design and construction can cover
        a wide range of variables, from a single circumferentially
        continuous flexible band to concentric nestings of any practical
        number of individual circumferentially continuous flexible
        bands. The smallest circumference band is concentrically nested
        within a slightly larger second band and the second band is
        concentrically nested within a still larger inside circumference
        of a third and yet larger band, and so on, up to the largest
        outside band whose exterior surface is the exterior surface of
        the nest and the smallest inner band has its interior surface in
        contact with the exterior edge of each of the vanes. This
        construction is similar to the case of a stranded cable of a
        specific diameter having a much greater strength than a solid
        rod of the same diameter. Also, the stranded cable is more
        flexible without failure than the solid rod. The individual
        clearances between each of the bands in such a collective nest
        is chosen to allow slippage and lubrication from one band to the
        next. This nested band-to-band clearance results in a greater
        efficiency at very high operating speed by allowing a nested
        concentric set of bands to slip in speed from one concentric
        member to the next, with the inner band rotating at
        substantially the same speed as the rotor and the outer bands
        rotating increasingly slower. The material used to make the
        endless flexible band can be any appropriate metal, but other
        appropriate materials, such as plastic, fiberglass, carbon
        fibre, or KEVLAR.RTM., can be used. This construction material
        range applies whether a single thickness endless band is
        constructed, or a concentric nesting of two or more bands is
        used to make a concentric nesting of a number of bands. The
        description thus far is of a flexible circular and continuous
        containment band with the band confining all the radial
        centrifugal forces of vanes and eliminating contemporary
        problems such as sliding vane friction, the speed-squared
        frictional dependence, and the rotor speed limitation. The
        flexible band construction will also allow for the shape
        manipulation of the circumference of the band so as to permit
        varying the swept chamber volume as the rotor turns. </p>
      <p>Reshaping of the flexible band is necessary to control the
        swept chamber volume of the pump as the rotor is turning and
        comprises an array of radially movable pistons which are at
        0.degree., 90.degree., 180.degree., and 270.degree. around a
        full circle, i.e., at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and also
        9 o'clock of a clock face. Each of the pistons has an
        appropriate curvature to contact the flexible band external
        surface in the positions cited. If the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock
        pistons are caused to move inward, the fixed circumference of
        the flexible band causes the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons to
        move outward by an equal amount. The inward or outward movement
        of the pistons may be driven by individual controlled hydraulic
        pressures, or the movement can be caused by mechanical means
        such as a gear and rack, or radially disposed screw drives to
        each piston. Another type of piston control means would be the
        joining of an analog type electric servo motor drive to a ball
        screw mechanism with an encoder position feedback; which
        arrangement would easily lend itself to digital control.
        Whatever the method of controlling the movement of the piston,
        the final purpose is to controllably elliptasize the flexible
        band from an axial perspective so as to cause the controlled and
        varying degrees of swept volume of fluid flow per revolution of
        the vane pump or motor. In the basic embodiment of this
        invention, opposing pairs of pistons move simultaneously toward
        or away from each other, while the remaining set of opposed
        pistons behave in simultaneous opposition to the action of the
        first pair. This behavior results in varying degrees of elliptic
        reshaping of the flexible band viewed from the axial perspective
        of the vane rotor. A novel and significant aspect of this device
        is the freedom of movement of the flexible band, which is
        impossible in the prior art. This includes a special
        manipulation of the pistons and band that allow the combination
        of this invention to simultaneously manipulate two common fluid,
        but hydraulically separate, outputs of this device as pump or
        motor. The variable pressure balanced design has two equal and
        identical pressure fluid outputs which will be merged so as to
        drive a hydraulic motor to form what is called a hydrostatic
        transmission. This is a second embodiment of the present
        invention. In addition, a second variable vane device of the
        proposed design may act as a motor in a conventional type of
        hydrostatic transmission with all of the current results, but
        with much greater efficiency and range. Another embodiment of
        the invention is a special piston manipulation which causes this
        invention to act like the early variable non-pressure balanced
        construction pumps with a single input and output. In the
        present invention, there is shown two separate hydraulic
        circuits with separate inputs and outputs where a single pump of
        the proposed design is separately connected to two fixed
        displacement hydraulic motors. Motor Number 1 will connect in
        closed hydrostatic loop with the first and second quadrant ports
        of the pump, while motor Number 2 will connect in closed
        hydrostatic loop to the third and fourth quadrants with no
        interconnection. The plumbing of the motor circuits would be
        such that both motors would have the correct shaft rotation
        direction for a hypothetical example, say forward. If the 12
        o'clock and 6 o'clock pistons were directed inward, the 3
        o'clock and 9 o'clock pistons would be forced outward with equal
        hydraulic flow to both motors occurring, causing the motors to
        turn at the same controlled speed in the forward direction. Now
        assume that the original circular flexible band shape is
        modified such that the 3 o'clock piston is moved inward and the
        9 o'clock piston is moved outward, while holding the 12 o'clock
        and 6 o'clock pistons at neutral, the band remaining circular in
        shape. A first motor connected to the first and second quadrants
        will reverse shaft direction, with a speed equal to that of a
        second motor whose direction is still forward. If the 3 o'clock
        and 9 o'clock pistons were both moved the other way, the second
        motor would instead reverse rotation in relation to the first
        motor. Combine this action with the original action of the basic
        embodiment as described, and one motor can be caused to rotate
        deliberately and controllably faster than the other motor, such
        as is the case for an axle set of a vehicle going around a turn.
        Another embodiment of the invention has two separate piston
        control methods which can be algebraically mixed to effect
        differential control means of axle rotation for negotiating a
        turning radius. Another embodiment comprises a fixed
        displacement motor of the prior art constructed in the manner of
        this invention, with the piston positions permanently fixed.
        This arrangement will be much more efficient than conventional
        hydraulic motors. A still further embodiment is the case of
        fixed displacement motors and pumps which can greatly improve
        the efficiency of existing vane pump and motors; namely that one
        or several flexible bands of the proposed invention construction
        can be closely fitted to be movable just inside the fixed
        elliptic or circular cam ring surface of conventional units,
        with a small clearance between the flexible ring exterior and
        the fixed cam ring interior, said clearance supporting an oil
        film which has minimal friction, while the vane outer edges are
        now supported by the innermost flexible band's inner surface.
        This construction provides some of the advantages of the subject
        invention, such as containment of vane centripetal force, and
        the replacement of vane-to-fixed cam ring friction with broad
        oil film friction that is much less, and not speed squared
        dependent. The primary invention configured as a fixed unit will
        still be most efficient due to the open chamber between each
        fixed piston pair. A smaller total oil film in this case will
        give the least loss. A significant advantage of the just
        described construction is the ability to fit existing designs,
        or even retrofit field product without any mechanical change
        required. Existing vane units could compete with fixed piston
        pumps and motors in terms of efficiency, but would be less
        efficient than the basic embodiment. This is a fifth embodiment
        of the invention. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The isometric view shown in FIG. 1 has a frontal first quadrant
        cutaway which exposes some very important features of the
        invention. The rear end plate 1 is shown with the first quadrant
        kidney port 16 exposed. The front end plate 2 is partially
        cutaway with the kidney ports 17, 18, and 19 respectively in the
        second, third, and fourth quadrants showing. The rear end plate
        1 has like kidney ports 20, 21, and 22 in axial alignment with
        ports 17, 18, and 19, but those ports in plate 1 are out of view
        in this drawing. This view shows like kidney ports front and
        back. However, it is only necessary to have one port per
        quadrant chamber to allow for fluid flow into and out of the
        chamber. Either the front or rear ports can be utilized, or both
        can be used to increase the flow capacity. Also, referring to
        FIG. 4, any other means of porting which allows fluid to flow
        into or out of the volume 33, 34, 35, or 36 when they rotate in
        alignment with "quadrants one, two, three, or four" may be used.
        Front kidney port 23 is in the cutaway portion of end plate 2,
        and is in axial alignment with port 16. Piston 12 is exposed and
        is itself cut away at an angle to expose the high pressure fluid
        film 13 which exists between the curved inner surface of the
        piston, and the outer circumferential area of the flexible band
        nest 14. The piston interface shape as shown is curved; however,
        any surface shape that supports the fluid film 13 can be used.
        Each of the four pistons has a fluid film 13. Several vanes 24
        are exposed by the cutaway. The outer casing 25 has four piston
        guides and four control ports 26. The ports 26 direct the inlet
        and exhaust of fluid control pressure to the four pistons to
        effect reshaping of flexible band 14. The invention is totally
        symmetric in hydraulic function and can function interchangeably
        as a hydraulic motor. The front end plate 2 has a hole 27 in it
        to permit the insertion of a drive shaft which will couple to
        the rotor 15 by means of the internal splines 28. The drive
        shaft is not shown so as to minimize the complexity of the
        figure. Seals and bearings of conventional design are also left
        out for the same reason. The shaft requires both a seal and
        bearing in plates 1 and 2 to facilitate the rotation of the
        rotor 15, the vanes 24. The four holes 29 in each of plates 1
        and 2 would allow for four bolts which would tightly hold both
        of the end plates against the outer casing 25; however, any
        appropriate number of bolts may be used, and any other means of
        construction which hydraulically contains the rotor 15, vanes
        24, band 14, and shape control means such as the pistons 12, 3,
        6, and 9 may also be used. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows an axial end view of the invention with the end
        plates removed, and with dotted outlines of end plate 2 with
        ports 17, 18, 19, and 23 outlined. The four control pistons
        numbered 12, 3, 6, and 9 are now shown. Shaded areas 31 are
        filled or exhausted by the control ports 26 to allow control
        fluid into and out of the chambers 31 behind the four pistons
        12, 3, 6 and 9. As shown in FIG. 11, the flexible band 14 has
        three concentric members 52, 53, and 54. These bands are
        preferably of stainless steel, each having a thickness in the
        order of 0.015 inches. The actual number and thickness of bands
        to be utilized will be determined by the design requirements.
        Also, as shown in FIG. 11, each vane 24 has compression springs
        32 mounted in rotor 15 that force the vane out from the center
        of the rotor 15 into contact with the inner surface of the band
        14. Three springs and bores are provided for mating with three
        pins 51 on each vane with the pins being equally spaced along
        the base of the vane. Such band and spring combinations are
        found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,215 which is incorporated by
        reference herein. This action assures that the vanes will seal
        fluid pressure at zero speed. It is a very important feature of
        this invention that the rotor 15, all the vanes 24, and the
        flexible band 14 will rotate as a group. At very slow speeds,
        the band will slip very slightly with regard to the vane speed,
        much like a squirrel cage a.c. induction motor rotor will slip
        behind the field rotation speed. This slow drift is the result
        of fluid shear drag caused by the four fluid films 13 which act
        so as to slow down the flexible band 14 speed. This drag force
        is counteracted by the combined line contact friction of, in
        this example, nine vanes. The vane friction is much greater than
        the fluid film friction, and the vane friction increases as the
        speed squared. Thus, as the speed of rotation increases, the
        flexible band will begin to rotate at substantially the same
        speed as the rotor. Since the vane and band speed never quite
        equalize, the wear on the inner surface of the flexible band is
        evenly distributed over the entire inner band surface, and the
        maximum wear life is achieved. Since the radial centrifugal,
        speed squared forces are totally contained by the flexible band,
        the wear and failure mechanism of high speed vane type pumps and
        motors is eliminated. The added friction of four fluid contact
        areas 13 is small compared to the combined vane friction, and
        does not increase significantly with higher speed. The result is
        a device which is much more efficient than any conventional
        design and which will operate efficiently at much higher speeds.
        These factors also allow for quieter operation at higher
        operating pressure. In FIG. 3, areas of the end plate 2 are
        marked 30 with identical areas axially in line therewith on end
        plate 1. A radial wedge shaped chamber 33 is shown directly
        under piston 3. Referring to FIG. 2, the front and back aligned
        areas 30 completely cover the axial ends of the chamber 33.
        Fluid pressure in quadrant one is prevented from directly
        flowing into quadrant two, and vice versa. If the rotation of
        the rotor is clockwise, the volume of chamber 33 will move from
        quadrant one to quadrant two in one ninth of a revolution. Since
        the chamber 33 is now closed on both ends by the presence of
        solid areas 30, the volume of chamber 33 which was part of the
        first quadrant chamber volume is now forced into the second
        quadrant chamber. Simultaneously, 34 rotated from the fourth
        quadrant chamber into the first quadrant chamber. If the
        flexible band is formed to a circle, then volume 33 is equal to
        volume 34, and there is no gain or loss of fluid volume in any
        of the four quadrant chambers. This is true regardless of speed
        or direction. If ports 18 and 23 were connected to the inlet
        port of a separate fixed displacement hydraulic motor, and the
        motor's return port was connected to device ports 17 and 19, the
        shape of the flexible band would be called neutral because the
        pump would not move any fluid into or out of the motor, and the
        motor shaft would not turn since a fixed displacement of fluid
        must occur in order for the motor to turn. If ports 23 and 17
        were connected to one fixed displacement motor, and ports 18 and
        19 were connected to another such motor, the result would be
        exactly the same. In either case, The input shaft of the
        variable pump would continue to turn with no motion ever on a
        motor shaft. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4, control pressure is injected into the control ports
        26 for pistons 12 and 6 causing them to move radially inward.
        Any other mechanical means of control, such as rack 58 and
        pinion 60 actuable by lever 61 as shown in FIG. 11, would act in
        a similar manner to the pressure and cause pistons 12 and 6 to
        move radially inward due to external mechanical force. The
        spring action of the flexible band causes it to bulge out in
        equal measure against the pistons 3 and 9; while causing those
        pistons to move radially outward while exhausting the control
        fluid volume out through control ports 26. The use of mechanical
        control here would require that the mechanical control means
        would retract to allow for the spring action of the band 14 to
        push pistons 3 and 9 outward. The arrows at the control ports 26
        show the direction of fluid flow. Now for this discussion, a
        clockwise rotation is chosen. FIG. 4 also shows maximum
        deflection of the flexible band 14. Rotating vane chambers 34
        and 35 are shown as minimized, while the chambers 33 and 36 are
        maximized. Since chamber 33 is removing a much larger volume of
        fluid from the first quadrant than the chamber 34 is carrying
        in, the difference must be provided via either kidney ports 23
        or 16. Therefore, ports 23 or 16 are suction ports which can be
        connected to an external hydraulic circuit, and fluid is drawn
        into "quadrant one" through those ports. Chamber 33 is very
        large when it rotates into the second quadrant, and chamber 35
        now is very small in exiting. The large difference of the
        volumes must therefore be forced out kidney ports 17 or 20 into
        the external hydraulic path. Ports 23 and 16, and 17 and 20 form
        a hydrostatic loop when connected to an external fixed
        displacement hydraulic motor. For reference, look at the
        schematic connection in FIG. 9. By varying the radial positions
        of the pistons 12, 3, 6, and 9, the fluid displaced can be fully
        controlled from zero to the maximum in any increment. Now, ports
        18 and 21, and 19 and 22 will form a second Siamese hydrostatic
        loop when they are connected to a second external hydraulic
        motor. For like displacements of the pistons 12 and 6, and
        opposite and equal motion of pistons 3 and 9, the fluid flow
        through fluid circuit A which consists of ports 23 and 16, and
        17 and 20 will exactly equal the flow through fluid circuit
        consisting of ports 18 and 21, and 19 and 22. This describes the
        case of straight motion for a set of vehicle axles. The simple
        case of ports 23 and 16 paired with 18 and 21, and 17 and 20
        with 19 and 22, and then connected to a single fixed or variable
        hydraulic motor is also straight line motion. For reference,
        look at the fluid connection shown in FIG. 8. As the rotor,
        vane, and flexing band assembly rotate, the action of the
        elliptasized band will be to force the compression and extension
        of the vanes 24, with regard to angular position only. The
        pressure being applied to pistons 12 and 6 through ports 26
        causes the pistons to move inward. For the clockwise rotation,
        output hydraulic pressure will escalate in the second and fourth
        quadrant chambers. As the chamber pressure increases, an
        increasing radial outward force develops on the underside of
        pistons 12 and 6, thereby reducing the respective piston inward
        force. When the outward force is equal to the inward force, the
        piston inward motion ceases. As the external hydraulic motor
        circuit responds to pressure and turns, the developed pressure
        drops slightly, and allows the pistons 12 and 6 to move slightly
        more inward, and this in turn increases the volume of fluid
        passing through the variable pump, in turn causing the motor to
        turn faster, thus causing a further line drop, causing more
        piston motion in, and so on. Therefore, the pressure developed
        in the quadrant chambers is equal to, or in proportion to the
        control force, and the variable pump automatically changes its
        displacement to accommodate changing external flow, while
        holding the out pressure proportional to the control pressure.
        Thus the hydraulic motor torque is a function of control
        pressure regardless of variable pump input speed and direction
        and output motor speed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 depicts the opposite case of piston operation in that
        pistons 3 and 9 are pressurized, causing them to move radially
        inward. Pistons 12 and 6 are forced out and the ellipse flexible
        band major axis is now vertical. Swept chamber volume 34 now is
        large, as is volume 35, while volumes 33 and 36 are now small.
        There is now an excess of fluid entering the first and third
        quadrant chambers and kidney ports 23 and 16, and 18 and 21
        become pressure ports, while a shortage of fluid in the second
        and fourth quadrants results in kidney ports 17 and 20, and 19
        and 22 becoming suction ports and the hydraulic motor would now
        reverse direction. Note that in the case of FIGS. 4 and 5, if
        the shaft rotation of the pump input were reversed, the external
        fluid direction would also reverse and the manipulation of the
        opposed sets of control pistons, both the volume and direction
        of the fluid output can be fully controlled. Also note that by
        pressurizing the opposite sets of pistons to the pair shown in
        FIGS. 4 and 5, the subject pump can be used as a variable
        hydraulic motor. This is an ideal component for interface
        between an energy storage flywheel and road wheels. The device
        as a pump can also interface to a flywheel or electric motor
        including a pancake design motor and can act to use or recover
        flywheel or motor energy directly. During acceleration, the pump
        will withdraw the prestored kinetic energy from the flywheel and
        direct it to the road wheels so as to accelerate a vehicle.
        During braking, the opposite control pistons try to force the
        flexible band back into a circular shape and in so doing, cause
        the pump to behave like a motor which then will act to
        re-accelerate the flywheel to near its initial speed. During the
        braking action, straight line vehicle energy is recycled back
        into the flywheel and the vehicle is brought to a standstill.
        The braking action is the same for either a single output motor
        or two motors. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows control pressure being injected into port 26
        causing piston 3 to move inward. Control fluid flows from port
        26 of piston 9, and the entire flexible band moves toward piston
        9 while maintaining a circular shape. Rotating chambers 34 and
        33 behave as in FIG. 5 although with lesser amounts of fluid
        displacement per revolution. However, if a second motor is
        connected to ports 18 and 19, as shown in FIG. 9, it would
        experience a reversal of direction because chamber 36 is now
        larger than chamber 35, while at the same time, chamber 36 is
        larger than chamber 34. The third quadrant becomes suction while
        the fourth quadrant becomes the pressure. This is the behavior
        of some industrial skid-steer loaders which reverse the rotation
        of the wheels on one side of the vehicle with respect to the
        other side, causing the vehicle to spin on its vertical axis. If
        piston 9 were pressurized instead 3, both fluid circuits would
        reverse, and the two motors would now spin in opposite
        directions which are both reverse according to the original
        directions. During all of the above behavior, note that the
        control ports 26 of pistons 12 and 6 were quiescent with no
        inward or outward motion of these pistons. Also, during this
        differential action, a pressure balance within the pump is no
        longer maintained, and such differential action should be
        limited in duration and power level so as to minimize shaft
        bearing load and therefore maximize pump life. FIG. 7 combines
        the differential control action with the normal displacement
        control to achieve special unequal flow to the motors for the
        purpose of driving two wheels unequally, but correctly around a
        turn, since the outside wheel rotates faster than the inside
        wheel. Further, the amount of differential action can be
        directly related to the correct wheel track in response to a
        steering input. Thus, a very unique control mechanism is
        obtained for driving both wheels in turns and this will greatly
        enhance vehicle traction and safety. In this case, differential
        control pressure 37 is applied to ports 26 of pistons 3 and 9,
        while normal control pressure 38 now is simultaneously applied
        to those same ports. The resultant control pressure 39 and
        volume obtain at piston 9 may be different from the control
        pressure and volume obtained 31 applied to piston 3. The result
        is the combination of circular displacement of the flexible band
        14 with reshaping of the band at the same time. The result is a
        different but controlled speed of one motor with respect to a
        second; as shown in FIG. 9 resulting in a differential two-wheel
        drive. The differential portion of the control can be derived
        from the steering system, while the go and stop motion can be
        derived from brake and acceleration pedals. FIG. 8 shows the
        variable pump connected to either a fixed displacement hydraulic
        motor or another variable pump which is used as the motor to
        form a hydrostatic transmission. The conventional hydraulic
        motor case is limited to the range of one-to-one and
        one-to-infinity, where the use of a second variable unit extends
        the range to infinity to-one. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 shows the schematic connection of one variable device to
        two fixed hydraulic motors, utilizing the Siamese ports of the
        invention to drive two separate outputs. This connection will
        allow the differential feature of the invention to be in use to
        differentially drive the two motors so as to effect a
        differential drive to the motor outputs, which is the case in a
        vehicular axle set negotiating a turn. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 shows the installation of a flexible band 14 in a
        conventional vane pump. The vanes 24 and rotor 15 are of
        conventional construction, like the proposed invention. The
        outer housing 40 is of conventional manufacture and chamber
        design, and the oil film 41 separates the band 14 from the outer
        housing 40 which will reduce operating friction in conventional
        units. The oil film 41 in this case is the full length of the
        ground internal chamber of the conventional outer housing. The
        sliding friction of the set of vanes is eliminated, and replaced
        by a broad oil film 41 of lesser friction; and, the efficiency
        of the conventional vane pump or motor is improved. Fixing the
        piston arrangement shown in FIGS. 4 through 7 will result in a
        fixed displacement pump or motor, whose efficiency will be the
        highest of all due to a reduced oil film 41 area. </p>
