      <p>Until now, thermodynamic engines that use compressible working
        fluids have generally been mechanical devices. These devices
        have inherent difficulties in achieving high compression ratios
        and in achieving the near constant temperature compression and
        expansion processes needed to approximate Carnot equivalent
        cycles. Solid-state thermoelectric converters that utilize
        semiconductor materials have only been able to achieve single
        digit conversion efficiency. Extensive resources have been
        applied toward Alkali Metal Thermoelectric Converters (AMTEC),
        which operate on a modified Rankine cycle and on the Stirling
        engine. However, because of inherent limitations, these systems
        have not achieved envisioned performance levels. </p>
      <p>The JTEC is an all solid-state engine that operates on the
        Ericsson cycle. Equivalent to Carnot, the Ericsson cycle offers
        the maximum theoretical efficiency available from an engine
        operating between two temperatures. The JTEC system utilizes the
        electro-chemical potential of hydrogen pressure applied across a
        proton conductive membrane (PCM). The membrane and a pair of
        electrodes form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) similar to
        those used in fuel cells. On the high-pressure side of the MEA,
        hydrogen gas is oxidized resulting in the creation of protons
        and electrons. The pressure differential forces protons through
        the membrane causing the electrodes to conduct electrons through
        an external load. On the low-pressure side, the protons are
        reduced with the electrons to reform hydrogen gas. This process
        can also operate in reverse. If current is passed through the
        MEA a low-pressure gas can be "pumped" to a higher pressure. </p>
      <p>The JTEC uses two membrane electrode assembly (MEA) stacks. One
        stack is coupled to a high temperature heat source and the other
        to a low temperature heat sink. Hydrogen circulates within the
        engine between the two MEA stacks via a counter flow
        regenerative heat exchanger. The engine does not require oxygen
        or a continuous fuel supply, only heat. Like a gas turbine
        engine, the low temperature MEA stack is the compressor stage
        and the high temperature MEA is the power stage. The MEA stacks
        will be designed for sufficient heat transfer with the heat
        source and sink to allow near constant temperature expansion and
        compression processes. This feature coupled with the use of a
        regenerative counter flow heat exchanger will allow the engine
        to approximate the Ericsson cycle. </p>
      <p>The engine is scaleable and has applications ranging from
        supplying power for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to
        power for large-scale applications such as fixed power plants.
        The technology is applicable to skid mounted, field generators,
        land vehicles, air vehicles and spacecraft. The JTEC could
        utilize heat from fuel combustion, solar, low grade industrial
        waste heat or waste heat from other power generation systems
        including fuel cells, internal combustion engines and combustion
        turbines. As a heat pump, the JTEC system could be used as a
        drop in replacement for existing HVAC equipment in residential,
        commercial, or industrial settings. </p>

      <p>Nuclear Engineer Lonnie Johnson, best known for his invention
        of the super soaker squirt gun, has recently designed a new type
        of solar energy technology that he says can achieve a conversion
        efficiency rate of more than 60 percent. Considering that the
        best solar energy systems today have an efficiency of 30-40
        percent, Johnson´s method could cut the cost of solar energy
        nearly in half. </p>
      <p>A recent article in Popular Mechanics describes how Johnson´s
        system would work. Rather than use photovoltaic cells, where
        silicon converts light into electricity, the new system works
        like a heat engine. But instead of using heat to turn an axle,
        it uses heat to force hydrogen ions through a
        membrane-electrode, and create electricity. </p>
      <p>The system, called the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converting
        System (JTEC) consists of two stacks of electrodes --- a
        high-temperature stack heated by the sun (and by concentrated
        mirrors) and a low-temperature stack. </p>
      <p>An electrical jolt triggers a voltage across the electrode
        stacks, with the low-temperature stack pumping out hydrogen from
        low to high pressure in order to maintain the pressure
        differential. As the hydrogen passes through the
        high-temperature stack of electrodes, it generates power. In a
        sense, the system works similar to a fuel cell. </p>
      <p>Johnson plans to build a system whose high temperature reaches
        600 degrees centrigrade, within the current solar concentration
        ability of parabolic mirrors, which can produce temperatures of
        more than 800 degrees centigrade. At 600 degrees, the system
        would have an efficiency of close to 60 percent. At higher
        temperatures, the efficiency would increase even more. </p>
      <p>The system should be able to produce several megawatts of
        power, according to Johnson. It could also harvest waste heat
        from internal combustion engines, turbines, and even the human
        body. </p>
      <p>Johnson, a former NASA employee, funds his work with the
        millions of dollars he made from inventing the super soaker. </p>

      <p>Solar energy technology is enjoying its day in the sun with the
        advent of innovations from flexible photovoltaic (PV) materials
        to thermal power plants that concentrate the sun’s heat to drive
        turbines. But even the best system converts only about 30
        percent of received solar energy into electricity—making solar
        more expensive than burning coal or oil. That will change if
        Lonnie Johnson’s invention works. The Atlanta-based independent
        inventor of the Super Soaker squirt gun (a true technological
        milestone) says he can achieve a conversion efficiency rate that
        tops 60 percent with a new solid-state heat engine. It
        represents a breakthrough new way to turn heat into power. </p>
      <p>Johnson, a nuclear engineer who holds more than 100 patents,
        calls his invention the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Conversion
        System, or JTEC for short. This is not PV technology, in which
        semiconducting silicon converts light into electricity. And
        unlike a Stirling engine, in which pistons are powered by the
        expansion and compression of a contained gas, there are no
        moving parts in the JTEC. It’s sort of like a fuel cell: JTEC
        circulates hydrogen between two membrane-electrode assemblies
        (MEA). Unlike a fuel cell, however, JTEC is a closed system. No
        external hydrogen source. No oxygen input. No wastewater output.
        Other than a jolt of electricity that acts like the ignition
        spark in an internal-combustion engine, the only input is heat.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s how it works: One MEA stack is coupled to a high-
        temperature heat source (such as solar heat concentrated by
        mirrors), and the other to a low-temperature heat sink (ambient
        air). The low-temperature stack acts as the compressor stage
        while the high-temperature stack functions as the power stage.
        Once the cycle is started by the electrical jolt, the resulting
        pressure differential produces voltage across each of the MEA
        stacks. The higher voltage at the high-temperature stack forces
        the low-temperature stack to pump hydrogen from low pressure to
        high pressure, maintaining the pressure differential. Meanwhile
        hydrogen passing through the high-temperature stack generates
        power. </p>
      <p>“It’s like a conventional heat engine,” explains Paul Werbos,
        program director at the National Science Foundation, which has
        provided funding for JTEC. “It still uses temperature
        differences to create pressure gradients. Only instead of using
        those pressure gradients to move an axle or wheel, he’s using
        them to force ions through a membrane. It’s a totally new way of
        generating electricity from heat.” </p>
      <p>The bigger the temperature differential, the higher the
        efficiency. With the help of Heshmat Aglan, a professor of
        mechanical engineering at Alabama’s Tuskegee University, Johnson
        hopes to have a low-temperature prototype (200-degree
        centigrade) completed within a year’s time. The pair is
        experimenting with high-temperature membranes made of a novel
        ceramic material of micron-scale thickness. Johnson envisions a
        first-generation system capable of handling temperatures up to
        600 degrees. (Currently, solar concentration using parabolic
        mirrors tops 800 degrees centigrade.) Based on the theoretical
        Carnot thermodynamic cycle, at 600 degrees efficiency rates
        approach 60 percent, twice those of today’s solar Stirling
        engines. </p>
      <p>This engine, Johnson says, can operate on tiny scales, or
        generate megawatts of power. If it proves feasible, drastically
        reducing the cost of solar power would only be a start. JTEC
        could potentially harvest waste heat from internal combustion
        engines and combustion turbines, perhaps even the human body.
        And no moving parts means no friction and fewer mechanical
        failures. </p>
      <p>As an engineer, Johnson says he has always been interested in
        energy conversion. In fact, it was while working on an idea for
        an environmentally friendly heat pump (one that would not
        require Freon) that he came up with the Super Soaker, which
        earned him millions of dollars in royalties. That money allowed
        Johnson to quit NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (where he worked on
        the Galileo Mission, among other projects) and go independent.
        His toy profits have funded his research in advanced battery
        technology, specifically thin-film lithium-ion conductive
        membranes. And that work sparked the idea for JTEC. Besides, he
        jokes, “All inventors have to have an engine. It’s like a rite
        of passage.” </p>

      <p><b>ABSTRACT --- JTEC SOLAR POWERED CELL TOWER GENERATOR</b> </p>
      <p>This project will attempt to resolve the key technical issues
        and uncertainties regarding a breakthrough concept for low-cost
        high-efficiency solar power. The proposed approach is based on a
        conceptual system for providing independent power for cell
        towers that will allow them to function even after emergencies
        like hurricane Katrina. The solar engine is based on the Johnson
        <br>
        ThermoElectrochemical Converter (JTEC) concept for converting
        heat to electricity invented by (Lonnie) Johnson, who will be
        available to assist Tuskegee University in carrying out this
        work. Except for the working fluid, JTEC is an all solid state
        engine that does not have mechanical moving parts. Different
        from conventional solid state thermoelectric devices, it does
        not have inherent parasitic heat loss paths. JTEC uses Membrane
        Electrode Assemblies (MEA) similar to those used in fuel cells;
        however, it does not require oxygen or a special fuel, only
        heat. The availability of a range of proton conductive membrane
        materials that operate from room temperature up to and exceeding
        1200 C suggests that JTEC could generate electricity from
        practically any heat source, from very small, just a few
        degrees, to very large temperature differences. JTEC
        approximates the Ericsson thermodynamic cycle which is Carnot
        equivalent. Research on this technology offers the potential for
        achieving solar power efficiency of 50% in the short-term and
        80% in the long-term, far beyond what is expected from
        photovoltaics both in efficiency and in cost. </p>
      <p>(1) Intellectual merit of the proposed activity </p>
      <p>JTEC is a fundamentally new solid state engine concept.
        Critical research is needed to enable a credible analysis of its
        potential. Research is needed into the properties of proton
        conductive materials needed to make a working system. The
        materials are similar those being studied in fuel cell research,
        but new material properties must be investigated in order to
        optimize the choices for this application. Research is needed to
        model, simulate and optimize an integrated systems design for
        cost-effective recharge power for cell towers. </p>
      <p>(2) Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: </p>
      <p>Cell towers running out of battery power were a crucial problem
        in the wake of Katrina and resulted unnecessary deaths and
        destruction. This project, with follow-on research, could
        provide un-interruptible, cost effective power for
        communications in areas threatened by hurricanes and other
        disasters that is not limited by battery life. The proposed
        engine technology will have major impacts on the international
        energy economy particularly with respect to the need for
        economical, green, renewable energy. This research is consistent
        with NSF goals for minority education and outreach. Tuskegee
        University is a HBCU institution and Johnson Research is a
        minority owned small business. </p>

      <center> </center>
      <p>The Ericsson Cycle is named after inventor John Ericsson. John
        Ericsson designed and built many unique heat engines based on
        various thermodynamic <br>
        cycles. He is credited with inventing two unique heat engine
        cycles and developing practical engines based on these cycles.
        His first cycle is very similar to what we now call the "Brayton
        Cycle" except that it was external combustion. His second cycle
        we now call the "Ericsson Cycle". </p>
      <p><b>Ideal Ericsson Cycle</b> </p>
      <p>The following is a list of the four processes that occur
        between the four stages of the ideal Ericsson cycle: </p>
      <p>Process 1 -&gt; 2: Isothermal Compression. The compression
        space is assumed to be intercooled, so the gas undergoes
        isothermal compression. The compressed air flows into a storage
        tank at constant pressure. In the ideal cycle, there is no heat
        transfer across the tank walls. </p>
      <p>Process 2 -&gt; 3: Isobaric Heat-addition. From the tank, the
        compressed air flows through the regenerator and picks-up heat
        at a high constant-pressure <br>
        on the way to the heated power-cylinder. </p>
      <p>Process 3 -&gt; 4: Isothermal Expansion. The power-cylinder
        expansion-space is heated externally, and the gas undergoes
        isothermal expansion. </p>
      <p>Process 4 -&gt; 1: Isobaric Heat removal. Before the air is
        released as exhaust, it is passed back through the regenerator,
        thus cooling the gas at a low constant pressure, and heating the
        regenerator for the next cycle. </p>
      <p><b>Comparison with Stirling, Carnot and Brayton cycles</b> </p>
      <p>The Ericsson Cycle is often compared to the Stirling cycle,
        since the engine designs based on these respective cycles are
        both external combustion <br>
        engines with regenerators. The Ericsson is perhaps most similar
        to the so called "double-acting" type of Stirling engine, in
        which the displacer piston also acts as the power piston.
        Theoretically, both of these cycles have so called "ideal"
        efficiency, which is the highest allowed by the Second law of
        thermodynamics. The most well known ideal cycle is the Carnot
        cycle, although ironically, a real Carnot Engine is not known to
        have been invented. </p>
      <p><b>Comparison with the Brayton Cycle</b> </p>
      <p>The first cycle Ericsson developed, is now called the "Brayton
        Cycle", commonly applied to the rotary jet engines for
        airplanes. </p>
      <p>The second Ericsson cycle is the cycle most commonly referred
        to as simply the "Ericsson cycle". The (second) Ericsson cycle
        is also the limit of ideal gas-turbine Brayton cycle, operating
        with multistage intercooled compression, and multistage
        expansion with reheat and regeneration. Compared to the Brayton
        cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the second
        Ericsson cycle uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus
        producing more net work per stroke. Also the use of regeneration
        in the Ericsson cycle increases efficiency by reducing the
        required heat input. For further comparisons of thermodynamic
        cycles, see Heat engine. </p>
      <p><b>Ericsson Engine</b> </p>
      <p>The Ericsson engine, (see figure), is based on the Ericsson
        cycle, and is known as an "external combustion engine", because
        it is externally heated. To improve efficiency, the engine has a
        regenerator or recuperator between the compressor and the
        expander. The engine can be run open-cycle or closed-cycle.
        Expansion occurs simultaneously with compression, on opposite
        sides of the piston. </p>
      <p><b>The Regenerator</b> </p>
      <p>Ericsson coined the term "regenerator" for his independent
        invention of the mixed-flow counter-current heat-exchanger.
        However, Rev. Robert Stirling had invented the same device,
        prior to Ericsson, so the invention is credited to Stirling.
        Stirling called it an "economiser" or "economizer", because it
        increased the fuel economy of various types of heat processes.
        The invention was found to be useful, in many other devices and
        systems, where it became more widely used, since other types of
        engines became favored over the Stirling engine. Interestingly,
        the term "regenerator" is now the name given to the component in
        the Stirling Engine! </p>
      <p>The term "recuperator" refers to a separated-flow,
        counter-current heat exchanger. As if this weren't confusing
        enough, a mixed-flow regenerator is sometimes used as a
        quasi-separated-flow recuperator. This can be done through the
        use of moving valves, or by a rotating regenerator with fixed
        baffles, or by the use of other moving parts. When heat is
        recovered from exhaust gases and used to preheat combustion air,
        typically the term recuperator is used, because the two flows
        are separate. </p>
      <p><b>History</b> </p>
      <p>In 1791, before Ericsson, Barber proposed a similar engine. The
        Barber engine used a bellows compressor and a turbine expander,
        but it lacked a regenerator/recuperator. There are no records of
        a working Barber engine. Ericsson invented and patented his
        first engine using an external version of the Brayton Cycle in
        1833 (number 6409/1833 British). This was 18 years before Joule
        and 43 years before Brayton. Brayton engines were all piston
        engines and for the most part, internal combustion versions of
        the un-recuperated Ericsson engine. The "Brayton Cycle" is now
        known as the gas turbine cycle, which differs from the original
        "Brayton Cycle" in the use of a turbine compressor and expander.
        The gas turbine cycle is used for all modern gas turbine and
        turbojet engines, however simple cycle turbines are often
        recuperated to improve efficiency and these recuperated turbines
        more closely resemble Ericsson's work. </p>
      <p>Ericsson eventually abandoned the open cycle in favor of the
        traditional closed Stirling cycle. </p>
      <p>The Ericsson Cycle Engine (The second of the two discussed
        here) was used to power a 2000 ton ship, The Caloric Ship
        Ericsson and the engine ran flawlessly for 73 hours. The
        combination engine produced about 300 horsepower. It had a
        combination of 4 dual-piston engines; the larger expansion
        piston/cylinder, at 4.267 meters or 14 feet in diameter, was
        perhaps the largest piston ever built. Rumor has it that tables
        were placed on top of those pistons and dinner was served and
        eaten, while the engine was running at full power. At 6.5 RPM
        the pressure was limited to 8 psi. The one sea trial proved that
        even though the engine ran well it was underpowered. ometime
        after the trials the Ericsson sank. When it was raised the
        Ericsson cycle engine was removed and a steam engine took its
        place. </p>
      <p>Ericsson designed and built a very great number of engines
        running on various cycles including steam, Stirling, Brayton,
        externally heated diesel air fluid cycle. He ran his engines on
        a great variety of fuels including coal and solar heat. </p>
      <p>Ericsson also was the inventor of the screw propeller for ship
        propulsion, in the USS Princeton. </p>

      <p><b>Inventor breaks through again -- Beyond Super Soaker</b> : <br>
        <i>Atlantan's energy game-changer earns honors.</i> </p>
      <p>Lonnie Johnson has some impressive hard science credentials. </p>
      <p>He's worked for the Strategic Air Command and for NASA's Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory, outfitting missions to Mars, Jupiter and
        Saturn. He holds about 100 patents, many of them in that arcane
        spot where chemistry, electricity and physics cross into the
        marketplace. And his latest invention appears to do the
        impossible: generating electricity with no fuel and no moving
        parts. </p>
      <p>But he's still known as Mr. Squirt Gun. </p>
      <p>Even among the geniuses who gathered to honor him and his new
        thermo-electrochemical converter at a&nbsp; Breakthrough
        Awards&nbsp; banquet in Manhattan this month, the Atlanta
        scientist's new invention was ignored when his most famous
        device was revealed. </p>
      <p>"What?" they cried. "You invented the Super Soaker?" </p>
      <p>Johnson, 59, doesn't mind if he's better known for watery
        mayhem than rocket science. Perhaps that's because $1 billion
        worth of Super Soakers have sold since 1990. A billion dollars
        could buy most of a Galileo mission. </p>
      <p>Johnson's share (he licensed the Soaker's design to Larami,
        later bought by Hasbro) won him the financial independence to
        pursue his own ideas, which is how the Johnson
        Thermo-electrochemical Converter system -- JTEC for short ---
        was born. </p>
      <p>Using heat to force ions out of a hydrogen cell, the JTEC "is
        just a stunning insight," said Jerry Beilinson, deputy editor of
        <i>Popular Mechanic</i>s magazine, which honors innovators in
        its current issue and sponsors the Breakthrough Awards. "I kind
        of thought we were finished; I didn't think there was a new
        way." </p>
      <p>Beilinson groups Johnson with other great synthesists of
        science, including Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. He also points
        out that Johnson, a native of Mobile, flourished in a somewhat
        hostile environment. </p>
      <p><b>˜A whole new technology"</b> </p>
      <p>In 1963 his governor stood up for segregation in Alabama,
        standing in the schoolhouse door. Five years later, Johnson, a
        high school senior, finished building a remote-controlled robot
        with a reel-to-reel tape player for a brain and jukebox
        solenoids controlling its pneumatic limbs. As a representative
        of Williamson High School, Johnson took his robot (nicknamed
        Linex) to a science fair at the University of Alabama. </p>
      <p>The door wasn't exactly blocked, but no other black high
        schools participated in the event. On the strength of Linex,
        Williamson won. Teachers predicted Johnson would go far. </p>
      <p>His robots went even farther. After graduating from Tuskegee
        University, Johnson joined the Air Force, worked at the Air
        Force Weapons Laboratory at Sandia, worked for NASA's Jet
        Propulsion Lab on the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Mars
        Observer project, among others. He also helped design the
        Cassini robot probe that flew 740 million miles to Saturn. </p>
      <p>In 1990, just before the Super Soaker made him wealthy, Johnson
        moved to Atlanta. In 2000, he began working in earnest on the
        JTEC. In 2006 that work came to the attention of Paul Werbos at
        the National Science Foundation, who recommended Johnson to
        Popular Mechanics. </p>
      <p>"This is a whole new family of technology," said the NSF's
        Werbos. "It's like discovering a new continent. You don't know
        what's there, but you sure want to explore it to find out." </p>
      <p>Johnson's device can potentially work with even modest
        temperature differentials -- say, between body heat and ambient
        air -- to power implanted medical devices such as pacemakers. If
        successful, at high heat it would generate Con Edison-scale
        output. It also would run backward for refrigeration purposes:
        put in electricity to generate heat loss for, say, wearable air
        conditioning. </p>
      <p>Paired with a parabolic solar array to generate heat, it would
        create virtually limitless emission-free power. </p>
      <p>Johnson, who projects earnings of $10 billion by 2013, claims a
        potential 60 percent efficiency rating, which doubles the
        efficiency of the current leader, the Stirling engine. </p>
      <p>"It has a darn good chance," said Werbos, "of being the best
        thing on Earth." </p>
      <p><b>˜Always an adventure"</b> </p>
      <p>This energy game-changer comes from unlikely quarters: a
        renovated factory on a formerly bleak stretch of Decatur Street.
      </p>
      <p>With the help of a $3.9 million empowerment-zone loan from the
        city, Johnson's company bought, renovated and outfitted three
        adjacent buildings on the street. In addition to his workshop,
        he hosts a high school robotics team sponsored by the 100 Black
        Men of Atlanta and donates office space for the Georgia Alliance
        for Children, of which he is the chairman. </p>
      <p>On a recent weekday, Johnson, impeccable in head-to-toe khaki,
        conducts a tour of the workshop, moving among shiny stainless
        steel deposition chambers and glove boxes where scientists can
        manipulate delicate materials isolated in a pure argon
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Here the two dozen employees of his privately owned concern
        work on several projects at once, developing solid-state
        batteries and lithium-air batteries. </p>
      <p>At one station Bill Rauch is working on solid-state batteries.
        "He's full of ideas,"&nbsp; says Rauch, a Ph.D. in material
        science from Georgia Tech. "It's always an adventure." </p>
      <p>Rauch says every now and then Johnson has a get-together at his
        Ansley Park home for the employees; they swim in the pool and
        squirt each other with off-the-shelf Super Soakers. Then Johnson
        comes out with a prototype water weapon not available to the
        public. He crushes the opposition. </p>
      <p>Johnson's interest in thermal engines and heat pumps led to
        experiments using water vapor instead of Freon as a compressible
        liquid, which led, oddly enough, to the birth of the Super
        Soaker. </p>
      <p>His work with batteries led to an interest in generating
        electricity electrochemically, instead of mechanically, which
        led to the JTEC. The JTEC completes the loop between heat pumps
        and batteries. </p>
      <p>It;s freshman chemistry, said Karl Littau, a material scientist
        at Palo Alto Research Center, a California nursery for high-tech
        innovation. "Millions of people learn about that every year, yet
        he was the guy who put two and two together." </p>
      <p>Most of his ideas are connected, said Johnson. </p>
      <p>"Sometimes I think I'm still working on everything I ever
        invented." </p>
      <p><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b> </p>
      <p>Most electricity is generated using heat to power a mechanical
        device, such as a piston or a turbine. The JTEC uses heat to
        force ions through a special membrane. "It's a totally new way
        of generating electricity from heat," Paul Werbos told Popular
        Mechanics. The JTEC includes two closed hydrogen cells or
        "stacks" attached to pairs of electrodes. One is a
        low-temperature stack, the other is high-temperature. Current
        compresses hydrogen in the low-temperature stack, ionizing the
        hydrogen and forcing its protons through the membrane to the
        high-temperature stack, where the hydrogen expands. Current is
        generated as electrons are freed. The high-temperature end
        generates more power than the low-temperature end uses --
        creating an excess that can cool beer or run TVs and washing
        machines. Hydrogen is neither burned nor added, and emissions
        are zero. </p>

      Until now, thermodynamic engines that use compressible working
      fluids have generally been mechanical devices. These devices have
      inherent difficulties in achieving high compression ratios and in
      achieving the near constant temperature compression and expansion
      processes needed to approximate Carnot equivalent cycles.
      Solid-state thermoelectric converters that utilize semiconductor
      materials have only been able to achieve single digit conversion
      efficiency. Extensive resources have been applied toward Alkali
      Metal Thermoelectric Converters (AMTEC), which operate on a
      modified Rankine cycle and on the Stirling engine. However,
      because of inherent limitations, these systems have not achieved
      envisioned performance levels.<br>
      <br>
      The JTEC is an all solid-state engine that operates on the
      Ericsson cycle. Equivalent to Carnot, the Ericsson cycle offers
      the maximum theoretical efficiency available from an engine
      operating between two temperatures. The JTEC system utilizes the
      electro-chemical potential of hydrogen pressure applied across a
      proton conductive membrane (PCM). The membrane and a pair of
      electrodes form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) similar to
      those used in fuel cells. On the high-pressure side of the MEA,
      hydrogen gas is oxidized resulting in the creation of protons and
      electrons. The pressure differential forces protons through the
      membrane causing the electrodes to conduct electrons through an
      external load. On the low-pressure side, the protons are reduced
      with the electrons to reform hydrogen gas. This process can also
      operate in reverse. If current is passed through the MEA a
      low-pressure gas can be "pumped" to a higher pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The JTEC uses two membrane electrode assembly (MEA) stacks. One
      stack is coupled to a high temperature heat source and the other
      to a low temperature heat sink. Hydrogen circulates within the
      engine between the two MEA stacks via a counter flow regenerative
      heat exchanger. The engine does not require oxygen or a continuous
      fuel supply, only heat. Like a gas turbine engine, the low
      temperature MEA stack is the compressor stage and the high
      temperature MEA is the power stage. The MEA stacks will be
      designed for sufficient heat transfer with the heat source and
      sink to allow near constant temperature expansion and compression
      processes. This feature coupled with the use of a regenerative
      counter flow heat exchanger will allow the engine to approximate
      the Ericsson cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The engine is scaleable and has applications ranging from
      supplying power for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to
      power for large-scale applications such as fixed power plants. The
      technology is applicable to skid mounted, field generators, land
      vehicles, air vehicles and spacecraft. The JTEC could utilize heat
      from fuel combustion, solar, low grade industrial waste heat or
      waste heat from other power generation systems including fuel
      cells, internal combustion engines and combustion turbines. As a
      heat pump, the JTEC system could be used as a drop in replacement
      for existing HVAC equipment in residential, commercial, or
      industrial settings.<br>

      Solar energy technology is enjoying its day in the sun with the
      advent of innovations from flexible photovoltaic (PV) materials to
      thermal power plants that concentrate the sun's heat to drive
      turbines. But even the best system converts only about 30 percent
      of received solar energy into electricity—making solar more
      expensive than burning coal or oil. That will change if Lonnie
      Johnson's invention works. The Atlanta-based independent inventor
      of the Super Soaker squirt gun (a true technological milestone)
      says he can achieve a conversion efficiency rate that tops 60
      percent with a new solid-state heat engine. It represents a
      breakthrough new way to turn heat into power.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson, a nuclear engineer who holds more than 100 patents, calls
      his invention the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Conversion System,
      or JTEC for short. This is not PV technology, in which
      semiconducting silicon converts light into electricity. And unlike
      a Stirling engine, in which pistons are powered by the expansion
      and compression of a contained gas, there are no moving parts in
      the JTEC. It's sort of like a fuel cell: JTEC circulates hydrogen
      between two membrane-electrode assemblies (MEA). Unlike a fuel
      cell, however, JTEC is a closed system. No external hydrogen
      source. No oxygen input. No wastewater output. Other than a jolt
      of electricity that acts like the ignition spark in an
      internal-combustion engine, the only input is heat.<br>
      <br>
      Here's how it works: One MEA stack is coupled to a high-
      temperature heat source (such as solar heat concentrated by
      mirrors), and the other to a low-temperature heat sink (ambient
      air). The low-temperature stack acts as the compressor stage while
      the high-temperature stack functions as the power stage. Once the
      cycle is started by the electrical jolt, the resulting pressure
      differential produces voltage across each of the MEA stacks. The
      higher voltage at the high-temperature stack forces the
      low-temperature stack to pump hydrogen from low pressure to high
      pressure, maintaining the pressure differential. Meanwhile
      hydrogen passing through the high-temperature stack generates
      power.<br>
      <br>
      "It's like a conventional heat engine," explains Paul Werbos,
      program director at the National Science Foundation, which has
      provided funding for JTEC. "It still uses temperature differences
      to create pressure gradients. Only instead of using those pressure
      gradients to move an axle or wheel, he's using them to force ions
      through a membrane. It's a totally new way of generating
      electricity from heat."<br>
      <br>
      The bigger the temperature differential, the higher the
      efficiency. With the help of Heshmat Aglan, a professor of
      mechanical engineering at Alabama's Tuskegee University, Johnson
      hopes to have a low-temperature prototype (200-degree centigrade)
      completed within a year's time. The pair is experimenting with
      high-temperature membranes made of a novel ceramic material of
      micron-scale thickness. Johnson envisions a first-generation
      system capable of handling temperatures up to 600 degrees.
      (Currently, solar concentration using parabolic mirrors tops 800
      degrees centigrade.) Based on the theoretical Carnot thermodynamic
      cycle, at 600 degrees efficiency rates approach 60 percent, twice
      those of today's solar Stirling engines.<br>
      <br>
      This engine, Johnson says, can operate on tiny scales, or generate
      megawatts of power. If it proves feasible, drastically reducing
      the cost of solar power would only be a start. JTEC could
      potentially harvest waste heat from internal combustion engines
      and combustion turbines, perhaps even the human body. And no
      moving parts means no friction and fewer mechanical failures.<br>
      <br>
      As an engineer, Johnson says he has always been interested in
      energy conversion. In fact, it was while working on an idea for an
      environmentally friendly heat pump (one that would not require
      Freon) that he came up with the Super Soaker, which earned him
      millions of dollars in royalties. That money allowed Johnson to
      quit NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (where he worked on the Galileo
      Mission, among other projects) and go independent. His toy profits
      have funded his research in advanced battery technology,
      specifically thin-film lithium-ion conductive membranes. And that
      work sparked the idea for JTEC. Besides, he jokes, "All inventors
      have to have an engine. It's like a rite of passage."<br>

      From his childhood in segregated Mobile, Alabama, to his run-ins
      with a nay-saying scientific establishment, the engineer Lonnie
      Johnson has never paid much heed to those who told him what he
      could and couldn’t accomplish. Best known for creating the
      state-of-the-art Super Soaker squirt gun, Johnson believes he now
      holds the key to affordable solar power.<br>
      <br>
      In March 2003, the independent inventor Lonnie Johnson faced a
      roomful of high-level military scientists at the Office of Naval
      Research in Arlington, Virginia. Johnson had traveled there from
      his home in Atlanta, seeking research funding for an advanced heat
      engine he calls the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converter, or
      JTEC (pronounced “jay-tek”). At the time, the JTEC was only a set
      of mathematical equations and the beginnings of a prototype, but
      Johnson had made the tantalizing claim that his device would be
      able to turn solar heat into electricity with twice the efficiency
      of a photovoltaic cell, and the Office of Naval Research wanted to
      hear more.<br>
      <br>
      Projected onto the wall was a PowerPoint collage summing up some
      highlights of Johnson’s career: risk assessment he’d done for the
      space shuttle Atlantis; work on the nuclear power source for
      NASA’s Galileo spacecraft; engineering help on the tests that led
      to the first flight of the B-2 stealth bomber; the development of
      an energy-dense ceramic battery; and the invention of a
      remarkable, game-changing weapon that had made him millions of
      dollars—a weapon that at least one of the men in the room, the
      father of two small children, recognized immediately as the Super
      Soaker squirt gun.<br>
      <br>
      Mild-mannered and bespectacled, Johnson opened his presentation by
      describing the idea behind the JTEC. The device, he explained,
      would split hydrogen atoms into protons and electrons, and in so
      doing would convert heat into electricity. Most radically, it
      would do so without the help of any moving parts. Johnson planned
      to tell his audience that the JTEC could produce electricity so
      efficiently that it might make solar power competitive with coal,
      and perhaps at last fulfill the promise of renewable solar energy.
      But before he reached that part of his presentation, Richard
      Carlin, then the head of the Office of Naval Research’s mechanics
      and energy conversion division, rose from his chair and dismissed
      Johnson’s brainchild outright. The whole premise for the device
      relied on a concept that had proven impractical, Carlin claimed,
      citing a 1981 report co-written by his mentor, the highly regarded
      electrochemist Robert Osteryoung. Go read the Osteryoung report,
      Carlin said, and you will see.<br>
      <br>
      End of meeting.<br>
      <br>
      Concerned about what he might have missed in the literature,
      Johnson returned home and read the inch-thick report, concluding
      that it addressed an approach quite different from his own.
      Carlin, it seems, had rejected the concept before fully
      comprehending it. (When I reached Carlin by phone recently, he
      said he did not remember the meeting, but he is familiar with the
      JTEC concept and now thinks that the “principles are fine.”) Nor
      was Carlin alone at the time. Wherever Johnson pitched the JTEC,
      the reaction seemed to be the same: no engine could convert heat
      to electricity at such high efficiency rates without the use of
      moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson believed otherwise. He felt that what had doomed his
      presentation to the Office of Naval Research—and others as
      well—was a collective failure of imagination. It didn’t help that
      he was best known as a toy inventor, nor that he was working
      outside the usual channels of the scientific establishment.
      Johnson was stuck in a Catch-22: to prove his idea would work, he
      needed a more robust prototype, one able to withstand the extreme
      heat of concentrated sunlight. But he couldn’t build such a
      prototype without research funding. What he needed was a new
      pitch. Instead of presenting the JTEC as an engine, he would frame
      it as a high-temperature hydrogen fuel cell, a device that
      produces electricity chemically rather than mechanically, by
      stripping hydrogen atoms of their electrons. The description was
      only partially apt: though both devices use similar components,
      fuel cells require a constant supply of hydrogen; the JTEC, by
      contrast, contains a fixed amount of hydrogen sealed in a chamber,
      and needs only heat to operate. Still, in the fuel-cell context,
      the device’s lack of moving parts would no longer be a conceptual
      stumbling block.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, Johnson had begun trying out this new pitch two months
      before his naval presentation, in a written proposal he submitted
      to the Air Force Research Laboratory’s peer-review panel. The
      reaction, when it came that May, couldn’t have been more
      different. “Funded just like that,” he told me, snapping his
      fingers, “because they understood fuel cells—the technology, the
      references, the literature. The others couldn’t get past this new
      engine concept.” The Air Force gave Johnson $100,000 for membrane
      research, and in August 2003 sent a program manager to Johnson’s
      Atlanta laboratory. “We make a presentation about the JTEC, and he
      says”—here Johnson, who is black, puts on a
      Bill-Cosby-doing-a-white-guy voice—“‘Wow, this is exciting!’” A
      year later, after Johnson had proved he could make a ceramic
      membrane capable of withstanding temperatures above 400 degrees
      Celsius, the Air Force gave him an additional $750,000 in funding.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the JTEC is the second law of thermodynamics. Simply
      put, the law says that temperature differences tend to even
      out—for instance, when a hot mug of coffee disperses its heat into
      the cool air of a room. As the heat levels of the mug and the room
      come into balance, there is a transfer of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Work can be extracted from that transfer. The most common way of
      doing this is with some form of heat engine. A steam engine, for
      example, converts heat into electricity by using steam to spin a
      turbine. Steam engines—powered predominantly by coal, but also by
      natural gas, nuclear materials, and other fuels—generate 90
      percent of all U.S. electricity. But though they have been refined
      over the centuries, most are still clanking, hissing,
      exhaust-spewing machines that rely on moving parts, and so are
      relatively inefficient and prone to mechanical breakdown.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson’s latest JTEC prototype, which looks like a desktop model
      for a next-generation moonshine still, features two fuel-cell-like
      stacks, or chambers, filled with hydrogen gas and connected by
      steel tubes with round pressure gauges. Where a steam engine uses
      the heat generated by burning coal to create steam pressure and
      move mechanical elements, the JTEC uses heat (from the sun, for
      instance) to expand hydrogen atoms in one stack. The expanding
      atoms, each made up of a proton and an electron, split apart, and
      the freed electrons travel through an external circuit as electric
      current, charging a battery or performing some other useful work.
      Meanwhile the positively charged protons, also known as ions,
      squeeze through a specially designed proton-exchange membrane (one
      of the JTEC elements borrowed from fuel cells) and combine with
      the electrons on the other side, reconstituting the hydrogen,
      which is compressed and pumped back into the hot stack. As long as
      heat is supplied, the cycle continues indefinitely.<br>
      <br>
      “Lonnie’s using temperature differences to create pressure
      gradients,” says Paul Werbos, an energy expert and program
      director of the National Science Foundation. “Only instead of
      using those pressure gradients to move an axle or a wheel, he’s
      forcing ions through a membrane.” Werbos, who spent months vetting
      the JTEC and eventually awarded Johnson’s team a $75,000 research
      grant in 2006, describes the JTEC as “a fundamentally new way, a
      fundamentally well-grounded way, to convert heat to electricity.”
      Regarding its potential to revolutionize energy production on a
      global scale, he says, “It has a darn good chance of being the
      best thing on Earth.”<br>
      <br>
      Johnson is a member of what seems to be a vanishing breed: the
      self-invented inventor. Born the third of six children in Mobile,
      Alabama, in 1949, he came into the world a black male in the Deep
      South during the days of lawful segregation. His father, David,
      who died in 1984, was a World War II veteran and a civilian driver
      for nearby Air Force bases. According to his mother, Arline, who
      is 86 and still lives in Mobile (in a house remodeled with Super
      Soaker profits), the family was poor but happy. All eight lived in
      a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house near Mobile Bay, in a
      neighborhood then being bisected by the construction of Interstate
      10.<br>
      <br>
      As a boy, Johnson was quiet and curious, and early on, he
      developed a fascination with how things worked. “Lonnie tore up
      his sister’s baby doll to see what made the eyes close,” his
      mother recalls. As he grew older, he began making things,
      including rockets powered by fuel cooked up in his mother’s
      saucepans. At 13, he bolted a discarded lawn-mower engine onto a
      homemade go-cart and took it atop the I-10 construction site—only
      to have a bemused policeman escort him back down. It was around
      then that Johnson learned that “engineers were the people who did
      the kind of things that I wanted to do.”<br>
      <br>
      It was hardly an obvious career path: then, as now, the profession
      was dominated by whites. (As recently as 2004, only 1.6 percent of
      the engineering doctorates awarded in the United States went to
      blacks.) In high school, a standardized test from the Junior
      Engineering Technical Society informed Johnson that he had little
      aptitude for engineering; but he persevered and, as a senior,
      became the first student from his all-black high school ever to
      enter the society’s regional engineering fair. The fair was held
      at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, just five years after
      then-Governor George Wallace had tried, in 1963, to physically
      block two black students from enrolling there. Johnson’s entry in
      the competition was a creation he called Linex: a
      compressed-air-powered robot assembled from electromagnetic
      switches he’d salvaged from an old jukebox, and solenoid valves
      he’d fashioned out of copper tubing and rubber stoppers. The
      finished product wowed the judges, who awarded him first prize:
      $250 and a plaque. Unsurprisingly, university officials didn’t
      trumpet the news that a black boy had won top honors. “The only
      thing anybody from the university said to us during the entire
      competition,” Johnson remembers, “was ‘Goodbye, and y’all drive
      safe, now.’”<br>
      <br>
      Johnson went on to win math and Air Force ROTC scholarships to
      Tuskegee University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in
      mechanical engineering and a master’s in nuclear engineering. He
      joined the Air Force in 1975 and subsequently held jobs at the Air
      Force Weapons Laboratory, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and
      the Strategic Air Command—solid, respectable positions that made
      him a part of the scientific establishment. But at each stop, he
      felt that his creativity was stifled, and in 1987, at the age of
      38, he could take it no longer. He would go into business for
      himself, he decided, focusing on his own projects, which included
      a thermodynamic heat pump, a centrifugal-force engine, and a
      pressure-action water gun. “All I needed was one to hit,” he says,
      “and I’d be fine.”<br>
      <br>
      The idea for the water gun had come to him one weekend afternoon
      in 1982, while he was tinkering with an idea for an
      environmentally friendly heat pump that would use water instead of
      Freon. He’d built a prototype pump, attached some rubber tubing,
      and brought it into a bathroom. Aiming the nozzle at the tub, he
      turned it on, and produced a blast of water so powerful that the
      mere wind from the spray ruffled the curtains. This, he thought,
      would make a great water gun. It took Johnson seven uncertain and
      stressful years, but he acquired the patents and eventually found
      a company interested in manufacturing his Super Soaker: the Larami
      Corporation, which licensed the rights to the gun in a deal that
      would ultimately make Johnson rich.<br>
      <br>
      Hoping to offer society something more significant than enhanced
      squirt-gun firepower, Johnson began plowing his Super Soaker
      profits into energy-related R&amp;D. While continuing to work on
      mechanical devices such as his heat pump, he also studied battery
      technology. When what he taught himself about electrochemistry
      collided with his longtime obsession with the second law of
      thermodynamics, Johnson had his eureka moment: why not use
      temperature differences rather than a chemical reaction to force
      the flow of ions through a cell? The JTEC concept was born.<br>
      <br>
      Today, Johnson and his family live in Atlanta’s upscale Ansley
      Park neighborhood. The business he launched more than two decades
      ago, Johnson Research and Development Company, now employs two
      dozen people, including designers, marketers, and research
      scientists. Once again, however, Johnson faces financial worries.
      “There was a time in my life,” he says, “when I was independently
      wealthy.” But that time has passed: Super Soaker profits have
      eroded thanks to a host of knockoffs, and now bring in only about
      a third of his company’s operating budget. For the rest, he relies
      on grants and commissions—and in the aftermath of the dot-com bust
      and the recent economic crisis, they’ve been drying up. He’s begun
      borrowing money to keep his research going—and he’s betting much
      of it, millions of dollars in all, on the JTEC.<br>
      <br>
      In the winter of 2008, Johnson received a promising call from Karl
      Littau, a materials scientist with the Palo Alto Research Center
      (known as PARC), a subsidiary of Xerox. PARC, which gave the world
      the laser printer, Ethernet, and many other groundbreaking
      technologies, had expanded into alternative-energy research, and
      this had led Littau to the JTEC. Like Paul Werbos, Littau
      initially feared that the device sounded too good to be true, but
      he and several other PARC scientists set up elaborate
      three-dimensional computer models to analyze fluidics and
      heat-flow behavior in the JTEC under various conditions, and they
      came away from those experiments, he says, “really impressed.”
      Littau, like Werbos, is now a convert. The JTEC, he says, is “a
      very clever way to extract energy from a heat engine … It’s
      incredibly elegant.”<br>
      <br>
      When I spoke to Littau, he ticked off the potential advantages of
      the JTEC over typical heat engines: no moving parts, which means
      the engine is more reliable and virtually silent; the safety of
      hydrogen, which is essentially benign (unlike, say, Freon); and
      the lack of waste produced (the JTEC gives off no carbon or—unlike
      a fuel cell—even water, which, although environmentally harmless,
      can corrode equipment). All of these advantages mean
      longer-lasting performance and potentially higher
      energy-conversion efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial photovoltaic solar cells convert approximately 20
      percent of received solar energy into electricity. The best
      solar-energy systems today—thermal-power plants that concentrate
      the sun’s heat to drive turbines—operate at a rate of about 30
      percent efficiency. The JTEC, Johnson claims, could double that
      figure, cutting the cost of producing solar power in half from its
      current average of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, and making it
      competitive with coal.<br>
      <br>
      “There’s a lot of debate in Washington about carbon emissions and
      energy,” Paul Werbos says—“about coal, nuclear power, and oil,
      what I call the three horsemen of the apocalypse. If we can cut
      the cost of solar energy in half, it becomes possible to escape
      from the three horsemen. The importance of this is just
      unbelievable.”<br>
      <br>
      But having wowed PARC, Johnson is now wrestling once again with
      the difficulties of working within the confines of the scientific
      establishment. PARC wants to publish a paper about the JTEC in a
      peer-reviewed scientific journal, both to provide legitimacy and
      to encourage members of the scientific community to advance the
      technologies involved. But Johnson is unconvinced. “Peer review is
      fine,” he says, “as long as you’re making incremental improvements
      to a technology.” But Johnson dreams of advancing by leaps and
      bounds.<br>
      <br>
      Adding to Johnson’s worries is tension with PARC over
      intellectual-property rights. Only recently did Johnson, with much
      reluctance, give PARC permission to file for patent protection for
      the problems solved in its lab. After more than two decades as his
      own boss, Johnson isn’t sure how much ownership interest—and
      potential profit—he is willing to give up. “All of a sudden, I
      have other people inventing stuff that I don’t have control over
      anymore,” Johnson says. “They could put patents in place for
      things I would need to implement in my engine. I’d have to pay
      them for my own idea!”<br>
      <br>
      Last year, I visited the four-acre commercial property that
      Johnson owns on the south side of downtown Atlanta. Wearing
      pleated khakis and a long-sleeved polo shirt with a turtleneck
      underneath, Johnson took me on a tour of a meticulously
      refurbished three-story brick loft space featuring soaring
      ceilings and antique wood floors. Johnson intends to transform the
      building into a high-tech manufacturing center that will train and
      employ workers from the area; however, because of research delays
      and the recent economic downturn, those plans are on hold.<br>
      <br>
      Until he can scale up, Johnson is instead leasing his beautiful
      loft space to a city agency, while he and his employees—including
      a handful of scientists with doctorates in chemistry, materials
      science, and engineering—hunker down in a low-slung, windowless
      warehouse across the parking lot. It’s a no-frills space, with
      galvanized electrical conduit descending from the ceiling through
      gaps where acoustic tiles are missing. On one wall of his office
      is a promotional poster created by the retail chain Target that
      features Johnson’s face amid a pantheon of 19th- and 20th-century
      African American inventors. Along another wall is a row of plaques
      commemorating a dozen of Johnson’s 100-odd patents, including
      those for his water-pressure heat pump, his ceramic battery, hair
      rollers that dry and set without heat, a diaper that plays a
      musical nursery-rhyme alarm when the baby is wet, and the
      electrochemical conversion system at the heart of the JTEC. And
      hanging crooked above his desk is a cheap black frame that
      contains an inspirational quote that has been attributed to Calvin
      Coolidge. Under the heading Press On, it reads:<br>
      <br>
      Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent
      will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with
      talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
      Education alone will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
      Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. <br>
      <br>
      After we toured the office cubicles, Johnson swiped a card to
      unlock a door, and we entered a cavernous laboratory abuzz with
      fluorescent fixtures and thrumming with high-tech equipment. We
      stepped across a sticky mat, meant to grab dust from our shoes,
      and followed a yellow-paint path across the warehouse floor, past
      shelves of chemicals, airtight glove boxes, and banks of machines
      bristling with wires, charging and discharging batteries.
      Technicians in long blue lab coats and protective goggles milled
      about. Some of the equipment stations were housed beneath plastic
      clean-room tents topped with large fans and aluminum ductwork that
      snaked off toward the ceiling. The lab looked like a disheveled,
      family-garage version of a computer-microchip factory, and the
      resemblance wasn’t coincidental: to develop his proton-exchange
      membrane and ceramic batteries, Johnson has borrowed processes
      developed by the semiconductor industry for depositing materials,
      often atom by atom, onto various substrates. Beaming as he showed
      me his latest acquisition—a pricey-looking X-ray photoelectron
      spectrometer that lets him analyze a material’s atomic
      makeup—Johnson was clearly in his element. <br>

      <br>
      [0003] This invention relates to energy harvesting mechanisms for
      generating electrical power, and more particularly, the invention
      relates to a thermo-electrochemical device that utilizes hydrogen
      to convert heat energy from an environment in which the device is
      located into electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] It has long been a goal to develop an engine that operates
      on thermal energy that is freely available in the ambient
      environment. Consistent with the second law of thermodynamics,
      prior attempts at such thermal-energy-harvesting devices required
      two distinct sources of thermal energy, namely, a heat source and
      a heat sink for supplying and removing heat, respectively, at
      different temperatures simultaneously. A heat-source and heat-sink
      pair having two distinct, spaced-apart temperatures typically does
      not occur naturally and/or plentifully, and thus are generally
      difficult to access. Therefore, because ambient heat at a single
      atmospheric temperature is more abundant and available than a
      simultaneous dual-heat source, a device for harnessing
      single-source ambient heat is more desirable than a device that
      requires a dual-heat source.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The present inventor disclosed a device in U.S. Pat. No.
      6,899,967. That device relies on cyclic temperature changes in the
      environment to produce the needed simultaneous dual-heat source.
      The needed temperature difference was provided through the use of
      a mass of material that has significant heat capacity. The prior
      device is a thermo-electrochemical converter that operates on a
      pressure difference between two metal-hydride chambers separated
      by a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). In the prior invention,
      one metal-hydride chamber is exposed to the ambient environment
      while the other is insulated and thermally stabilized. A thermal
      mass is coupled to the stabilized chamber to act as a heat
      source/sink material. Insulation may be used to thermally isolate
      the thermal-mass material from the environment in order to enhance
      the temperature difference produced. It absorbs heat and stores it
      during periods of elevated ambient temperature and releases that
      heat to function as an elevated-temperature heat source during
      periods of reduced ambient temperatures. As such, changes in the
      temperature of the thermal mass will always lag temperature
      changes in its environment. Thus a converter coupled between the
      thermal mass and the environment will be subjected to a
      simultaneous temperature differential needed for the device to
      operate.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The open-circuit electrical potential due to a hydrogen
      pressure differential across a proton-conductive membrane
      electrode assembly (MEA) is a linear function of temperature and
      proportional to the natural logarithm of the hydrogen pressure
      ratio and can be calculated using the Nernst equation (Fuel Cell
      Handbook, Fourth Edition, 1999, by J. H. Hirschenhofer, D. B.
      Stauffer, R. R. Engleman, and M. G. Klett, at pp. 2-5:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      VOC= RT/2F ln(PHi/PLow) Equation 1<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where VOC is open circuit voltage, R is the universal gas
      constant, T is the cell absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, F
      is Faraday's constant, PHi is the hydrogen pressure on the
      high-pressure side and PLow is the hydrogen pressure on the
      low-pressure side.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The hydrogen pressure produced by a metal-hydride bed
      depends on temperature. When the ambient metal-hydride chamber is
      at a higher temperature, H2 gas is desorbed from its metal hydride
      content and flows through the MEA into the thermally stabilized
      chamber, thus generating power. During the next half cycle, when
      the temperature of the ambient chamber falls below the temperature
      of the insulated chamber, the opposite takes place, hydrogen flows
      through the MEA back to the ambient temperature chamber. Hydrogen
      thus cycles back and forth under a pressure differential across
      the proton-conductive membrane generating power in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A major limitation encountered with the prior invention is
      associated with the need to have a device that is capable of
      scavenging power in a relatively efficient manner. A major
      limitation in achieving efficient operation is associated with the
      difficulty of creating a significant temperature difference
      between components. This is particularly true for a small device.
      The close proximity of the components in a small device allows
      parasitic heat transfer losses between the two metal-hydride beds
      that are too high whenever a significant temperature gradient is
      present. In larger devices, the need for insulation and heat
      sink/source material can result in a large, bulky device that is
      difficult to implement. Thus it can be appreciated that a need
      remains for a device for producing electrical power using heat
      from its ambient environment that overcomes the disadvantages and
      shortcomings of previous chemical and thermal converters that need
      a simultaneous temperature difference in order to operate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] According to an embodiment of the present invention, an
      electrochemical conversion system has a thermally-conductive
      housing. The interior of the housing is divided into a
      high-pressure chamber and a low-pressure chamber by a
      substantially gas-impermeable membrane. An ionically-conductive,
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism forms at least a portion of
      the substantially gas-impermeable membrane. A first
      hydrogen-storage medium is disposed within the high-pressure
      chamber. A second hydrogen-storage medium is disposed within the
      low-pressure chamber. The characteristics of the hydrogen-storage
      mediums are such that at any given temperature, the first
      hydrogen-storage medium stores hydrogen at a first average storage
      pressure that is higher than a second average storage pressure at
      which the second hydrogen-storage medium stores hydrogen. The
      housing contains an initial quantity of hydrogen. An
      electrical-energy storage device connected to the
      ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating mechanism is
      selectively operable between a charge condition and a discharge
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The Johnson Ambient-Heat Engine (JANE) (an electrochemical
      conversion system) uses thermal transients that naturally occur in
      its ambient environment to generate electrical power. During
      selected periods of high temperature, the electrochemical
      conversion system naturally produces a high voltage output for a
      given pressure ratio between the high-pressure and low-pressure
      chambers. The electrical-energy storage device is charged by
      allowing hydrogen to expand from the high-pressure chamber into
      the low-pressure chamber during periods of high temperature and
      thereby high voltage. Conversely, the electrochemical conversion
      system produces low voltage during periods of low temperature. The
      electrical-energy storage device is discharged during selected low
      voltage periods to compress hydrogen from the low-pressure chamber
      back into the high-pressure chamber. Given two electrons per
      hydrogen molecule, returning the hydrogen to the high-pressure
      chamber requires the same amount of current as that generated when
      it transitioned to the low-pressure chamber. However, less energy
      is required since the hydrogen is returned during periods when the
      voltage of the electrochemical conversion system is low. The
      difference in energy produced during high-temperature expansion
      versus low temperature-compression is retained within the
      electrical-energy storage device and is available for supply to an
      external load.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0021] Embodiments of the present invention are described herein.
      The disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention
      that may be embodied in various and alternative forms, and

      but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis
      for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] As an overview, the invention teaches a system and
      methodology for generating electrical energy, which electrical
      energy can be applied to devices requiring electric power. The
      concept and overall embodiments of the invention are referred to
      herein generally as the Johnson Ambient-Heat Engine. The Johnson
      Ambient-Heat Engine is an apparatus that is powered by thermal
      transients in its environment. It utilizes thermodynamic
      principles of heat engines and electrochemical-cell principles in
      combination to generate electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The apparatus performs through a combination of a
      thermodynamic processes and complementary electrochemical
      reactions. The phrase electrochemical conversion system will be
      used throughout this description and claims to generally refer to
      the invention. The invention also may be considered an "energy
      harvester," and more particularly may be considered a "thermal
      energy harvester." Thus the invention as described and claimed
      herein may be referred to alternatively as the Johnson
      Ambient-Heat Engine, an electrochemical conversion system and an
      energy harvester.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">INVENTION DESCRIBED IN DETAIL</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0024] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals
      indicate like elements throughout the several views, the drawings
      illustrate certain of the various aspects of exemplary
      embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring first to FIG. 1, therein is illustrated a
      schematic representation of an electrochemical conversion system
      10 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A
      thermally-conductive housing 20 encloses a high-pressure chamber
      22 and a low-pressure chamber 24 that are separated from one
      another by a substantially gas-impermeable barrier 26. An
      ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating mechanism forms
      at least a portion of the substantially gas-impermeable barrier
      26. In the basic embodiment of FIG. 1, the entire barrier 26 is
      formed of an ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating
      mechanism. The central component of the ionically-conductive,
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism is an electrochemical cell
      30 formed of electrodes 32, 34 that sandwich an electrolyte medium
      36. The electrolyte medium is substantially impermeable. The key
      elements of the electrochemical cell, namely, electrodes 32, 34
      and an electrolyte medium 36, may be referred to as a
      Membrane-Electrode Assembly (MEA) 30. There may be more than one
      cell, or MEA, however, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, a
      single cell (or MEA) forms the substantially impermeable barrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] When the electrolyte medium 36 is a proton-conductive
      membrane, a first hydrogen-storage medium 42 is disposed within
      the high-pressure chamber 22. A second hydrogen-storage medium 44
      is disposed within the low-pressure chamber 24. In a closed
      volume, as in the chambers of the invention, the hydrogen gas will
      attain an equilibrium pressure in each chamber which depends on
      the temperature and the amount of hydrogen contained within the
      metal-hydride of that respective chamber. The equilibrium pressure
      of a given metal hydride will vary in accordance with the
      temperature to which it is subjected. The equilibrium pressure
      will increase with increases in temperature and decrease with
      decreases in temperature. Although there is hysteresis, the
      equilibrium pressure may be considered a tipping point for
      absorption and desorption of hydrogen. At a given equilibrium
      pressure, the pressure of hydrogen gas above the equilibrium
      pressure will cause hydrogen to be absorbed by the hydride and,
      conversely, hydrogen pressure below the given equilibrium pressure
      will cause hydrogen to be released (desorbed) by the hydride.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The characteristics of the hydrogen-storage mediums 42, 44
      are such that at any given temperature, the first hydrogen-storage
      medium 42 stores hydrogen at a first average storage pressure that
      is higher than a second average storage pressure at which the
      second hydrogen-storage medium 44 stores hydrogen. Effective
      hydrogen-storage mediums 42, 44 are metal-hydrides (also referred
      to herein as metal-hydride materials). Thus effective
      hydrogen-storage mediums are a high-pressure metal-hydride
      material and a low-pressure metal-hydride material, respectively.
      The housing 20 contains an initial quantity of hydrogen. A
      sufficient quantity will have to be aggregated under pressure in
      the high-pressure chamber 22 to begin the process of generating
      electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Electrical conductors 46, 48 extend from respective
      electrodes 32, 34 of the MEA 30 (or other electrochemical cell
      configuration) to complete the electrical circuit that is
      necessary for operation of the invention. The circuit may be
      completed by components such as a simple electronic load or a
      controller system, or a combination of components 50. The
      invention teaches connection of the MEA 30 (or other cell) to an
      electrical-energy storage device, such as a capacitor or battery.
      The electrical-energy storage device is selectively operable
      between a charge condition and a discharge condition. More
      particularly, the invention teaches connection of conductors 46,
      48 to a rechargeable battery. The load 50 may be a combination of
      a rechargeable battery and controller system that selectively
      places the battery component in a charge condition when certain
      parameters are met and in a discharge condition when other
      parameters are met.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The chemical reactions that take place in the high-pressure
      chamber 22 and low-pressure chamber 24, respectively, are written
      out in the chambers 22, 24 in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Ideally, the various components comprising the
      thermo-electrochemical converter, particularly the environment,
      the housing, high-temperature metal-hydride bed, the MEA and the
      low-temperature metal-hydride bed are tightly coupled thermally
      such that all of the components are maintained at or near a single
      uniform temperature. Ideally, the uniform temperature is the
      temperature of the environment existing at the time when an
      expansion or compression event occurs. As a given metal-hydride
      bed undergoes the endothermic process of releasing hydrogen or
      exothermic process of absorbing hydrogen, heat is conducted
      between it and other components so as to maintain the relatively
      uniform temperature. As hydrogen is compressed or expanded through
      the MEA heat is removed or supplied respectively so as to maintain
      the uniform temperature. The thermal energy needed or removed to
      maintain the temperature of the system (including MEA, cells,
      hydrides and hydrogen) as hydrogen expands or undergoes
      compression respectively is thermal energy supplied to or from the
      environment. It is energy that is conducted through the housing 20
      to or from the MEA 36, the high-pressure chamber 22 and
      low-pressure chamber 24. This thermal energy from the environment
      is considered "ambient" thermal energy. "Ambient" in this context
      is considered to mean heat from the environment where the housing
      is located. In a "local sense," the ambient environment is any
      enclosure wherein the housing 20 is subjected to the temperature
      level and temperature transients occurring in the enclosure.
      Applicable enclosures include but are not limited to a building, a
      room in a building structure, or a compartment or enclosure in
      close proximity to a combustion engine. A local ambient
      environment also encompasses a combustion engine (or other
      heat-producing instrumentality) itself. The housing 20 may be
      mounted upon such ambient environment. In a more general sense,
      the ambient environment may be the atmosphere of the great
      outdoors wherein thermal energy and temperature transients are
      provided by the sun.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The materials of the high-pressure and low-pressure beds
      have been selected such that at any given temperature the storage
      pressure of the high-pressure storage medium 42 is greater than
      that of the low-pressure storage medium 44. And, further, because
      hydrogen is aggregated under pressure in the high-pressure chamber
      22, a greater hydrogen pressure will be exerted in the
      high-pressure chamber 42 than in the low-pressure chamber 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The "Load/Controller system" 50 includes a battery or other
      electrical-energy storage device. When the circuit with the MEA 30
      (or other electrical-energy-generating mechanism) is closed
      electrical power is produced as hydrogen, under pressure and as
      ions, migrates from the high-pressure chamber to the low-pressure
      chamber. In the case where the electrical-energy-generating
      mechanism is a hydrogen conductive MEA, hydrogen undergoes
      oxidation at the high-pressure electrode 32-electrolyte membrane
      36 interface. Electrons are conducted through the circuit as the
      hydrogen ions (protons) are conducted through electrolyte membrane
      36. In the MEA electrode 34 in the low-pressure chamber 24, the
      hydrogen ions being conducted through the membrane combine with
      the electrons conducted through the closed circuit to
      "reconstitute" hydrogen molecules. The hydrogen reconstituted in
      the low-pressure electrode exits the electrode and becomes
      substantially absorbed within the second hydrogen-storage medium
      44 that is disposed within the low-pressure chamber 24 as the
      second hydrogen storage medium functions to maintain a
      low-pressure within the chamber 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Hydrogen is returned to the high-pressure chamber 22 from
      the low-pressure chamber 24 by applying a voltage of sufficient
      magnitude to reverse the current across the MEA 30 or other
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism. In this case, hydrogen is
      conducted from the low-pressure chamber 24 to high-pressure
      chamber 22. Under the reverse current, electrons are striped from
      protons in the low-pressure chamber at the low-pressure electrode
      34-electrolyte 36 interface and combined with protons in the
      high-pressure chamber at high pressure electrode 32-electrolyte 36
      interface as the protons are conducted through membrane 36. The
      current and voltage are provided by the capacitor, battery or
      other electrical-energy storage device.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 2 shows the voltage across a proton conductive
      Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) as a function of temperature as
      calculated using the Nernst equation for selected hydrogen
      pressure ratios. For a given pressure ratio, the MEA voltage is
      high when the temperature is high and low when the MEA temperature
      is low. The controller 50 operates to select charge and discharge
      events under temperature conditions such that less electrical
      energy is required to return hydrogen to the high-pressure chamber
      than is produced to charge the battery. The difference between
      voltage generated during high-temperature migration and voltage
      required to facilitate low-temperature migration is useable
      electrical energy that is retained in the electrical-energy
      storage device.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Referring now to FIG. 3, a data plot shows the pressure and
      temperature relationship versus hydrogen content for an example
      metal hydride. This particular chart is for a metal hydride
      commercially marketed as Hy-Stor(R) 207 that has a chemical
      formula LaNi4.7Al0.3. The product is believed to be sold and
      distributed by Hera USA Inc., a Delaware Corporation, having a
      contact address at C/O Corporation Svc. Company, 2711 Centerville,
      Road Suite 400 Wilmington Del. 19808. OMEGA, the quantity along
      the x-axis, is the amount of hydrogen in the metal hydride as a
      ratio to the maximum amount of hydrogen that the hydride can
      absorb. As can be seen from the data plot, metal hydrides exhibit
      pressure plateaus that are a function of temperature whereby, at a
      given temperature, the majority of the hydrogen is stored with
      minimal increase in pressure. The pressure level of the plateau
      increases with increasing temperature. The "midpoint pressure" for
      a given temperature is defined as the pressure at which the
      hydride contains 50% (0.50) of its storage capacity. The midpoint
      pressure may be used as a representative value for comparison of
      pressures of different hydrogen-ladened metal-hydride materials at
      a given temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Referring now to FIG. 4, therein is shown a plot of the
      variation of the midpoint pressure versus temperature for several
      selected commercially available metal hydrides. The name
      Hydralloy(R)C5 is a trademark for the metal hydride having
      chemical formula: Ti0.98Zr0.02V0.43Fe0.09Cr0.05Mn1.5. The product
      is believed to be sold and distributed by GfE Gesellschaft fur
      Elektrometallurgie mbH Ltd Liab Co, Fed Rep Germany, Hofener
      Strasse 45, 8500 Nurnberg 1 Fed Rep Germany, a subsidiary of AMG
      Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V., Netherlands. FIG. 3 highlights
      the fact that metal hydrides can be selectively paired with each
      other based on how their midpoint pressures change with
      temperature. The data provided by the metal hydride suppliers
      indicate that the midpoint pressures of some of the metal hydrides
      converge toward each other with increasing temperature (that is,
      increasing temperature transients) whereas others diverge. Thus
      selected metal hydrides can be paired together as high-pressure
      and low-pressure beds for optimum performance in the ambient-heat
      engine application. The power produced as hydrogen passes from the
      high-pressure bed to the low-pressure bed through the MEA
      increases as the pressure ratios between the two beds increase.
      Similarly, the power required to recompress hydrogen from the
      low-pressure hydride bed to the high-pressure hydride bed
      decreases as the pressure ratio decreases. Therefore, higher
      performance is achieved by the ambient-heat engine for the case
      where the average pressures of the high- and low-pressure
      metal-hydride beds diverge with increasing temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Referring now to FIG. 5, therein is shown a plot of an
      increase in Nernst voltage versus increase in temperature above a
      starting temperature of 300 degrees K for three example
      metal-hydride pairs at their midpoint pressure ratios. The pairs
      include MnNi3Co2 paired with Hy-Stor(R) 207, MnNi3Co2 paired with
      Pd0.7Ag0.3, and TiCo paired with Pd0.7Ag0.3. The change in voltage
      with change in temperature is greatest for the TiCo and Pd0.7Ag0.3
      pair.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Referring now simultaneously to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, these
      figures illustrate ideal operation of an ambient-heat engine
      (electrochemical conversion system) 12 in accordance with an
      embodiment of the present invention. The term ambient-heat engine
      as used herein refers to that electrochemical conversion system
      that has a thermal-heat component as described herein. The
      engine/system 12 described operates under the same combined
      thermal and electrochemical principles as the system 10
      illustrated in FIG. 1 and discussed above. Like elements operate
      in the same manner as previously described herein. Referring now
      particularly to FIGS. 6 and 7, the engine includes a housing 60,
      heat-conductive baffle 66 and MEA array or stack 68. The baffle 66
      and MEA array 68 form a substantially gas-impermeable barrier that
      separates the housing 60 into a high-pressure chamber 62 and a
      low-pressure chamber 64. The MEA array 68 is an
      ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating mechanism.
      Although the ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating
      mechanism 68 could comprise a single electrochemical cell as
      illustrated and described with respect to FIG. 1, the embodiment
      of FIGS. 6 and 7 teaches a multiple-cell array or stack in which
      each cell 70 is a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) comprised of a
      pair of electrodes 72, 74 and a proton-conductive electrolyte
      medium 76. The electrodes 72 and 74 are configured on opposite
      sides of the proton-conductive electrolyte medium 76 such that the
      medium is sandwiched between the two electrodes. The electrolyte
      medium 76 may be a single, contiguous, elongated structure or it
      may be a series of smaller structures placed end-to-end or
      stacked. Each approach effectively forms a set of multiple
      membrane electrode assemblies each having an electrolyte layer
      sandwiched between a pair of opposing electrodes 72, 74. The
      high-pressure chamber 62 contains first hydrogen-storage medium in
      the form of a high-pressure metal hydride 82. The electrodes 72,
      74 of the multiple cells 70 are connected in series
      (anode/negative electrode to cathode/positive electrode) to
      respective conductors 92, 94. The low-pressure chamber 64 contains
      a second storage medium in the form of low-pressure metal hydride
      84. A controller system 90 that includes a combined controller and
      electrical-energy storage device is electrically coupled to the
      MEA array 68 through conductors 92, 94. Controller system 90
      contains an electrical-energy storage device such as a battery or
      capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Referring now also to FIG. 8, the Temperature-Entropy (T-S)
      diagram of FIG. 8 represents operation of the AHE device
      illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7. The indicators QHT and QLT denote
      the high-temperature and low-temperature heat quantities described
      with respect to the engines/systems illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7.
      Beginning at high-temperature, high-pressure State 1, represented
      in FIG. 6 as "DAY" operation, hydrogen expands to low-pressure
      state 2 under, ideally, constant-temperature conditions as the
      engine extracts the needed heat of expansion as heat QHT from the
      engine's environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] When high-temperature heat, denoted as QHT with direction
      arrow 80 in FIG. 6, from the engine environment (ambient thermal
      energy or ambient heat) is available to the engine, the controller
      system 90 applies a load to the MEA array 68. Electrical current
      is produced as hydrogen passes from the high-pressure,
      metal-hydride bed 82 and high-pressure chamber 62 (as H2) through
      the proton-conductive membrane 76 (as H&lt;+&gt;) to the
      low-pressure chamber 64 and low-pressure, metal-hydride bed 84 (as
      H2) as illustrated by direction arrows 78. Freed electrons flow
      through the conductor 92 to the electrical-energy storage device
      (battery) that is part of the controller system 90 in the
      direction shown by direction arrow 96. Useful electrical energy
      generated by the engine is stored within an
      electrical-energy-storage device (battery) that is a part of the
      combined battery and controller system 90. Hydrogen released from
      the high-pressure metal-hydride bed, after passing through the MEA
      by becoming ions H&lt;+&gt; and then being reconstituted as
      hydrogen molecules H2, is absorbed by the low-pressure
      metal-hydride bed on the low-pressure side of the MEA stack 68.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Referring again to the temperature entropy diagram shown in
      FIG. 8, once high-temperature, low-pressure State 2 is achieved,
      operation stops and the engine transitions from State 2 to State 3
      (from the elevated temperature conditions depicted in FIG. 6 to
      the low-temperature state represented in FIG. 7). This temperature
      change takes place over an interval of time and represents a
      decrease in ambient temperature. This transition from State 2 to
      State 3 is essentially a constant volume process with no movement
      of the hydrogen or change in state during the transition. Ideally,
      the absorbed hydrogen substantially remains absorbed in the
      metal-hydride bed on the low-pressure side of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As depicted in FIG. 7, when the environment reaches a
      predetermined low temperature as detected and registered by
      controller system 90, controller system 90 supplies power by means
      of charged battery to MEA array 68 as illustrated by direction
      arrow 98 to electronically "pump" hydrogen from the low-pressure
      side of the engine back to the high-pressure side as illustrated
      by direction arrows 87. The compression process transitions the
      engine from State 3 to State 4 of the T-S diagram of FIG. 8. This
      is, ideally, a constant-temperature compression process as heat of
      compression QLT is dissipated to the engine's environment as
      illustrated by direction arrow 89. The transition from state 4
      back to state 1 to complete the cycle is a constant-volume process
      as the hydrogen remains substantially absorbed in the
      high-pressure, metal-hydride bed, thus the cycle continues with
      changes in the temperature of the engine's environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As an example, consider a daily thermal environment cycle
      of 10[deg.] C., that is, during a 24-hour period the difference
      between a high and a low ambient temperature is 10[deg.] C. During
      long thermal transitions such as day-night cycles, even a
      relatively large engine could have time to come into thermal
      equilibrium with its environment. Assume an engine, as taught by
      the invention, that uses the Pd0.7Ag0.3 and TiCo metal-hydride
      pair. Referring back momentarily to FIG. 5, the voltage change for
      this pair over a temperature change of 10[deg.] C. is about 1.6
      mV. This value is derived under the condition that the midpoint
      pressure ratios represent an average of the pressure ratio
      maintained during transition of the hydrogen between hydride beds.
      A reasonable hydrogen capacity per unit volume of an average metal
      hydride is equivalent to about 1.86 Ah/cc in electrons. Assume
      that the high-pressure and low-pressure chambers each contain 1 cc
      of metal hydride. Given these conditions, the expansion process
      occurs at 1.6 mV higher voltage than the compression process thus
      a difference in energy of 2.98 mWh/cc (that is, 1.86 Ah/cc*1.6
      mV). This amount of energy is available for powering an external
      load. If averaged over a period of 24 hours, the average level of
      continuous available power would be about 0.124 mW per cubic
      centimeter (that is, 2.98 mWh/cc/24 h=0.124 mW/cc) of metal
      hydride.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Given practical implementation constraints, assume an
      average power output of 0.1 mW/cm&lt;3 &gt;for this system.
      Additional thermal cycles result in the generation of additional
      power. Multiple daily cycles are possible and the controller
      system may be programmed to anticipate and respond to thermal
      transients that may be greater than or less than the 10[deg.] C.
      example transient disclosed herein. Consider one possible
      application wherein a portable electronic device that may be
      carried on one's person into and out of buildings or other
      situations that change the engine's thermal environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] To achieve useful output voltage levels, the MEA may be
      configured as an array or stack of MEA cells with electrical
      interconnects connecting the cells in series. A single common
      membrane for the cells in the array or multiple membranes may be
      aligned to achieve a desired number of cells and voltage level.
      The amount of hydrogen cycled back and forth across the MEA stack
      remains constant on average during operation of the engine.
      Therefore, the difference in energy is extracted based on a
      difference in cell voltage between the expansion and compression
      half cycles of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Referring now to FIG. 9, therein is illustrated
      schematically an electrochemical conversion system 14 in
      accordance with another embodiment of the invention. A
      thermally-conductive housing 100 is separated into a high-pressure
      chamber 102 and a low-pressure chamber 104 by a substantially
      gas-impermeable barrier. Ambient heat of the environment QE and
      heat from within the housing 100 are interchanged through the
      housing 100, as denoted by the bi-directional arrow 120. As with
      the systems 10, 12 illustrated and previously described herein, at
      least a portion of the substantially gas-impermeable barrier
      comprises an ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating
      mechanism. A particularly suitable ionically-conductive,
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism is at least one
      membrane-electrode assembly type of electrochemical cell. The MEA
      and constituent elements described previously herein are also
      suitable for use in the embodiment of FIG. 9. As before, the
      membrane of the MEA provides the substantially gas-impermeable
      barrier. Somewhat similar to the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7, the
      present embodiment uses multiple MEA's connected in series. For
      convenience, the illustration of FIG. 9 uses a graphic icon to
      represent MEA cells. The icon is denoted by the numeral 112 and
      consists of the symbol for a cell (positive and negative
      electrode) inscribed within a circle as a symbol for at least one
      MEA. The icon is also used to represent one or a grouping of more
      than one MEA. Further, the groupings of the graphic MEA icon 112
      are used herein to represent an array, or stack, 110 of individual
      MEA cells 112. The array, or stack, 110 is comprised of two MEA
      sub-arrays or stacks 116, 118 with all the individual cells
      connected in series. One sub-array contains more MEA's than the
      other. In an example, the array, or stack, 110, comprises 142 MEA
      cells all connected in series and segmented into a first sub-array
      116 of 138 cells and a second sub-array 118 of 4 cells. A first
      hydrogen-storage medium, in the form of a high-pressure,
      metal-hydride bed 122 is disposed in the high-pressure chamber
      102. A second hydrogen-storage medium, in the form of a
      low-pressure, metal-hydride bed 124, is disposed in the
      low-pressure chamber 104. Operation of the arrays is such that the
      hydrogen passes across the cells uniformly. Since all the cells
      are connected in series, the current through each and therefore
      the hydrogen flow across each must be the same. Assuming operation
      over a 10[deg.] C. temperature swing between 20[deg.] C. and
      30[deg.] C. and the Pd0.7Ag0.3 and TiCo metal-hydride pair, the
      Nernst voltage at 20[deg.] C. is 0.02762V and at 30[deg.] C. is
      0.02926V at the midpoint pressures for these materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The system 14 further includes controller system 130,
      battery 132, normally-open charge control switch 140 and
      normally-open regeneration control switch 142. Operation of the
      system 14 is such that when the temperature is high, say 30[deg.]
      C., the 138 cells in group 116 produce a voltage of 4.03V (that
      is, 138 cells*0.02926 V/cell). Output power from MEA array group
      116 is supplied at this voltage and controller system 130 closes
      switch 140 to charge battery 132. The resulting current flow
      allows hydrogen to expand from high-pressure bed 102 to
      low-pressure bed 104. Assume that each bed is sized to supply and
      absorb an amount of hydrogen equivalent to 1.86 Ah of current
      capacity. The geometry of the system (that is, cells, chambers,
      etc.) is such that the hydrogen transfer is divided over the
      number of MEA cells in the stack or array. This alignment results
      in each cell transferring an amount of hydrogen equivalent to an
      electrical charge of 13.5 mAh (that is, 1.86 Ah/138 cells).
      Therefore, 13.5 mAh of charge is supplied to battery 132 at a
      voltage of 4.03 Volts.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Switch 140 is returned to an open state after charging
      stops. For battery-charging condition, electric current is
      dissipated from the larger MEA sub-array 116 through a connector
      134 and the closed switch 140 in the direction of the direction
      arrow 144. When the system is in a discharge-battery
      configuration, current flows from the battery 132 through closed
      switch 142 and connector 136 into the full MEA array 110 in the
      direction shown by direction arrow 146.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Optimally, battery discharge to "recharge" hydrogen in the
      high-pressure chamber will be effected when the temperature is
      low, say 20[deg.] C. At that temperature, the voltage of the
      individual cells is reduced to 0.02762V, as given by the Nernst
      equation. Under this condition, controller system 130 closes
      switch 142 and thereby connects rechargeable battery 132 in series
      with the four cells that are in group, or sub-array, 118 and the
      138 cells of group, or sub-array, 116. At 20[deg.] C., the 142 MEA
      cells connected in series produce a voltage of only 3.92V (that
      is, 142 cells*0.02762 V/cell). Conversely, this is the amount of
      voltage that is necessary to return (or pump) the same quantity of
      hydrogen back across the membrane(s) at the lower temperature and
      associated pressure ratio. The battery, having been previously
      charged to 4.03 volts, now supplies power to the full MEA array
      110 to pump hydrogen back from low-pressure bed 124 to
      high-pressure bed 122. Return of the equivalent of 1.86 Ah of
      hydrogen to the high-pressure chamber is now divided over 142
      cells requiring an application of electrical energy from the
      battery of only 10.3 mAh (that is, 1.86 Ah/142 cells). In this
      simple example, 3.1 mAh (that is, 13.5 mAh-10.3 mAh) of residual
      capacity of electrical energy charge remains available in the
      battery 132 after the hydrogen has been pumped back to the
      high-pressure side of the engine. This residual, thus harvested,
      energy can be used for external applications and the ambient-heat
      engine is now ready for the follow-on power half cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Charging is initiated after an increasing temperature
      transient has occurred in the ambient environment. Such charge
      initiation can be facilitated through use of a sensing system and
      detector that work in conjunction with the controller system 130
      to recognize when charging may be conducted effectively. For
      example, a temperature sensor may detect the ending, stabilization
      or leveling off of an increasing temperature transient. If the
      controller 130 determines that the configuration of the engine and
      the magnitude of the temperature change are suitable for a charge
      or discharge event, then it will initiate such an event.
      Similarly, the event may be initiated upon the detection of a
      temperature change at the housing or in the ambient environment of
      a predetermined magnitude over a predetermined period of time. As
      another example, a pressure sensor may detect that a predetermined
      pressure in the high-pressure chamber 102 has been reached or that
      a predetermined pressure differential between the high-pressure
      chamber 102 and the low-pressure chamber 104 has been reached.
      Charging may be stopped when the battery 132 has been charged to a
      predetermined level. For example, a voltage sensor and detecting
      system may be used in conjunction with the controller system 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The battery 132 may be placed in a discharge condition for
      at least two purposes. One purpose is to provide electrical energy
      to an external load. The battery 132 may also be placed in a
      discharge condition for the purpose of providing current through
      and a voltage potential across the MEA so as to cause hydrogen to
      migrate from the low-pressure chamber 104 to the high-pressure
      chamber 102. This is in effect a "recharging" of the high-pressure
      chamber 102 with hydrogen. Discharge of battery 132 to recharge
      the hydrogen may be facilitated through use of sensor and
      detection systems in conjunction with the controller system 130.
      Battery discharge is terminated when a sufficient amount of
      hydrogen has been placed in or returned to the high-pressure
      chamber 102 and hydride bed 122. The "recharged" hydrogen
      condition in the high-pressure chamber 102 and associated hydride
      bed may be detected by a sensing mechanism that works in
      conjunction with the controller system 130 to recognize that
      sufficient hydrogen is now in the high-pressure chamber. For
      example, and not by way of limitation, a pressure sensor may
      detect that a predetermined hydrogen pressure has been achieved.
      As a further example, and also not by way of limitation, a charge
      sensor to integrate current during the charge period as a part of
      the controller system may detect and determine that that at least
      as many hydrogen ions as migrated from the high-pressure chamber
      to the low-pressure chamber during the battery 132 charging have
      been returned to the high-pressure chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Referring now to FIG. 10, an electrochemical conversion
      system 16 has several elements similar to the systems 10, 12, 14
      previously illustrated and described herein. A
      thermally-conductive housing 160 defines an interior that is
      divided into a high-pressure chamber 162 and a low-pressure
      chamber 164 by a substantially gas-impermeable barrier that is
      formed at least in-part by an ionically-conductive,
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism. Ambient heat of the
      environment QE and heat from within the housing 160 are
      interchangeable through the housing 160, as denoted by the
      bi-directional arrow 180. A particularly suitable
      ionically-conductive, electrical-energy-generating mechanism is at
      least one membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) type of
      electrochemical cell. The MEA and constituent elements described
      previously herein are also suitable for use in the embodiment of
      FIG. 10. As before, the membrane of the MEA provides the
      substantially gas-impermeable barrier. The ionically-conductive,
      electrical-energy-generating mechanism comprises an MEA array, or
      stack 170. The array/stack 170 comprises individual MEA's
      electrically connected in series. As in the case of the embodiment
      of FIG. 14, for convenience, the illustration of FIG. 10 uses a
      graphic icon to represent MEA cells. The icon is denoted by the
      numeral 172 and consists of the symbol for a cell (positive and
      negative electrode) inscribed within a circle as a symbol for at
      least one MEA. The icon is used to represent one or a grouping of
      more than one MEA. Further, the grouping of the graphic MEA icons
      172 is used herein to represent an array, or stack, 170 of
      individual MEA cells 172. A first hydrogen-storage medium, in the
      form of a high-pressure, metal-hydride bed 182 is disposed in the
      high-pressure chamber 162. A second hydrogen-storage medium, in
      the form of a low-pressure, metal-hydride bed 184, is disposed in
      the low-pressure chamber 164. Operation of the array, or stack,
      170 is such that the hydrogen passes across all of the cells
      uniformly.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A charge controller system 190 includes a rechargeable
      battery, electrical circuit components, sensing components,
      switching components, battery and discharge charge circuitry, and
      software components including but not limited to pattern
      recognition software. Internal logic of the charge controller
      system 190 enables it to selectively extract power from the MEA
      array/stack 170 to charge the battery and/or to direct electrical
      power elsewhere or to supply power to the MEA array/stack 170 to
      regenerate the metal-hydride beds 182, 184. The pattern
      recognition software allows the charge controller system 190 to
      recognize patterns in temperature transients and hydrogen pressure
      transients and thereby anticipate peaks and ebbs in temperature so
      as to identify optimum times at which to initiate a battery charge
      or metal-hydride regeneration event. The battery charge circuitry
      allows the charge controller system 190 to operate efficiently
      over a wide range of MEA array open circuit voltages. As such it
      can perform a battery charge or hydride-bed regeneration event
      independent of the mean environmental temperature or associated
      mean operating voltage of the MEA array. This feature gives the
      engine the versatility to operate about a mean environmental
      temperature of 10[deg.] C., 40[deg.] C. or other mean that the
      environmental temperature may dictate.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Metal Hydrides' Role in Operation
        of Ambient-Heat Engine</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0054] Metal hydrides are metallic substances that are capable of
      absorbing hydrogen gas when exposed to the hydrogen gas at certain
      pressures and temperatures. The terminology used in discussing
      metal hydrides is sometimes confusing. A primary reason for the
      confusion is that the term metal hydride can be used to refer to
      the hydrogen-absorptive material both before and after it has
      absorbed hydrogen. Therefore, for purposes of explanation herein,
      the pre-absorption material generally will be referred to as
      "metal hydride" or "metal-hydride material," or, simply,
      "hydride." After the metal hydride, or metal-hydride material, has
      absorbed hydrogen gas, for clarity, the resulting product
      sometimes is referred to herein as a hydrogen-ladened
      metal-hydride." The "hydrogen-ladened" adjective is not used where
      from the context the state or condition of hydrogen absorption is
      clear. In the hydrogen-ladened metal hydride, hydrogen is
      distributed throughout the metal-lattice structure of the metal
      hydride. The metal-hydride material is typically provided in a
      crushed or other configuration that maximizes the surface area to
      be contacted by hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Ideally, if the pressure of the hydrogen gas rises above
      the equilibrium pressure, then hydrogen will be absorbed into the
      metal hydride. Absorption is exothermic since heat will be
      released during the process. If sufficient heat is not transferred
      away from the metal hydride to support continued hydrogen
      absorption at a stable temperature, then the temperature will
      increase to a point where a new, higher equilibrium pressure state
      is attained. On the other hand, if the pressure of hydrogen gas
      drops below the equilibrium pressure, hydrogen gas will be
      released from the hydrogen-ladened metal-hydride material. The
      hydrogen-release process is endothermic since heat input is
      required to maintain the desorption process. If sufficient heat is
      not available to support continued hydrogen evolution at a stable
      temperature, then the temperature will drop to a point where a new
      lower equilibrium pressure is attained. In practice, for a given
      material, the equilibrium pressures and temperatures for
      absorption are different from the equilibrium pressures and
      temperatures for desorption by finite amounts. This difference is
      generally referred to as the hysteresis property of the material
      and must be accounted for by appropriately selecting metal
      hydrides for use in the JAHE.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The ambient-heat engine 10, 12, 14, 16 operates cyclically
      and, as such, any point or region in the cycle that is illustrated
      in the temperature-entropy diagram of FIG. 8 can be chosen as a
      starting point. Certain conditions will exist in the engine at any
      one of the four points of the diagram. For example, consider the
      condition of an increasing environment temperature when the
      hydrogen gas that is used in the engine is predominantly contained
      in the high-pressure chamber. The temperature transient of the
      high-pressure hydrogen terminates at point "1" on the diagram. As
      previously discussed herein, the metal-hydride materials are
      chosen such that at any given temperature, the midpoint
      equilibrium pressure in the high-pressure chamber 22, 62, 102, 162
      will be greater than the midpoint equilibrium pressure in the
      low-pressure chamber 24, 64, 104, 164. As the ambient temperature
      increases, the equilibrium pressures of both metal-hydride beds
      42/44, 82/84, 122/124, 182/184 of each engine 10, 12, 14, 16
      respectively increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Phase 1-2: The portion of the cycle of FIG. 8 from point 1
      to point 2 represents, the expansion of hydrogen from the
      high-pressure chamber 22, 62, 102, 162 and passage of the hydrogen
      from the high-pressure chamber to the low-pressure chamber 44, 64,
      104, 164. Electrical energy is generated during this portion of
      the cycle. Several things occur simultaneously, in Phase 1-2. Heat
      is absorbed in the high-pressure chamber as hydrogen is released
      and heat is released by the low-pressure chamber as the metal
      hydride contained therein absorbs hydrogen. The engine may be
      configured to facilitate heat transfer between the two chambers so
      as to minimize the amount of heat that must be extracted from or
      transferred to the environment. However, the overall effect of
      expansion of hydrogen from the high-pressure bed to the
      low-pressure bed is endothermic due to the net decrease in energy
      state of the hydrogen and heat is absorbed by the engine from the
      elevated temperature ambient environment. The transition of the
      hydrogen from state 1 to state 2 is associated with the closing of
      a circuit that includes the ionically-conductive membrane and the
      electrical-energy storage device. With closing of the circuit
      hydrogen ions H&lt;+&gt; are conducted across the membrane and
      electrons freed from the hydrogen flow through the circuit into
      the electrical-energy storage device. During Phase 1-2, hydrogen
      (that has been reconstituted from migrated hydrogen ions H+ and
      received electrons) is received in the opposing low-pressure
      chamber 24, 64, 104, 164 where it is ready to be absorbed into the
      associated metal-hydride beds 44, 84, 124, 184.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Phase 2-3: With the hydrogen now substantially contained by
      the low-pressure metal-hydride chamber 24, 64, 104, 164, the
      portion of the cycle of FIG. 8 from point 2 to point 3 represents
      a decreasing temperature transient (which may be a succession of
      decreasing temperature transients) associated with the engine's
      environment. Note that at point 2, the temperature of each
      metal-hydride bed has been substantially stabilized to the high
      temperature (THT) of the ambient environment. Between points 2 and
      3, as ambient environment temperature decreases, heat is
      transferred through the housing 20, 60, 100, 160 of the engine 10,
      12, 14, 16 to what is now a low-temperature ambient environment
      (QLT, QE) causing both the temperature and the equilibrium
      pressures of the metal-hydride beds 42/44, 82/84, 122/124, 182/184
      of each engine 10, 12, 14, 16 respectively to decrease. Phase 2-3
      may be considered to be carried out under the constant volume of
      the low-pressure chamber 24, 64, 104, 164.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] At point 3, the predominance of hydrogen in the engine
      system is in the low-pressure chamber 24, 64, 104, 164 and in
      equilibrium with the low-temperature point of the ambient
      environment, TLT.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Phase 3-4: During this phase of the cycle of FIG. 8
      represented by point 3 to point 4, the high-pressure chamber 22,
      62, 102, 162 of the engine system is "recharged" with hydrogen.
      The electrical-energy storage device is energized to complete a
      circuit (that includes the MEA 30, 70, 116, 170) and thereby cause
      hydrogen (H2) to be conducted through the MEA as hydrogen ions
      (H&lt;+&gt;) from low-pressure chambers 24, 64, 104, 164 to
      high-pressure chambers 22, 62, 102, 162 respectively. The MEA
      performs a pumping process to recompress the hydrogen. At point 4
      of the diagram of FIG. 8, hydrogen predominantly has been
      aggregated in the high-pressure chamber under some pressure.
      Electrical energy is consumed during this portion of the cycle.
      Heat is absorbed in the low-pressure chamber as hydrogen is
      released and heat is released by the high-pressure chamber as the
      metal hydride contained therein absorbs hydrogen. The overall
      effect of compression of hydrogen from the low-pressure bed to the
      high-pressure bed is exothermic due to the net increase in energy
      state of the hydrogen and heat is released by the engine to the
      now lower temperature ambient environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Phase 4-1: The portion of the cycle of FIG. 8 from point 4
      to point 1 represents an increasing temperature transient (which
      may include a succession of lesser increasing temperature
      transients). Note that at point 4 hydrogen has been aggregated in
      the high-pressure chamber 22, 62, 102, 162. As ambient environment
      temperature increases, heat is transferred through the housing 20,
      60, 100, 160 of the engine 10, 12, 14, 16 causing both the
      temperature and equilibrium pressures of the metal-hydride beds to
      increase, with the high-pressure bed maintaining a higher
      equilibrium pressure than that of the low pressure bed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Features of the
        Invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0062] In a broad embodiment, the invention is practiced without
      first and second hydrogen-storage mediums, and more particularly,
      without metal-hydride materials. In this embodiment, at least a
      first portion of the hydrogen that is placed in the housing is
      initially placed in the high-pressure chamber at a higher pressure
      than a second quantity of hydrogen that is initially placed in the
      low-pressure chamber. The invention still operates by the
      previously-described mechanism of selecting between a charge
      condition and a discharge condition. The addition of
      hydrogen-storage mediums such as metal hydrides increases the
      amount of hydrogen that can be stored at a given pressure in a
      given volume and therefore the amount of electronic charge that
      can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A capacitor may be used instead of a battery as an
      electrical-energy-storage device that can be successively charged
      and discharged.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Each electrode may include a porous current collector to
      help facilitate the flow of hydrogen and hydrogen ions while still
      conducting a flow of electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Each electrode may include a catalyst such as platinum to
      help facilitate the hydrogen reaction at each respective
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Many variations and modifications may be made to the
      above-described embodiments without departing from the scope of
      the claims. All such modifications, combinations, and variations

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to the conversion of heat energy to
      electrical energy or electrical energy to heat energy utilizing
      multiple electrochemical cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The conversion of heat energy or chemical energy to electrical
      energy, or visa-versa, may be accomplished in a variety of ways.
      It is known that electrochemical cells or batteries rely on redox
      reactions wherein electrons from a reactant being oxidized are
      transferred to a reactant being reduced. With the separation of
      the reactants from each other, it is possible to cause the
      electrons to flow through an external circuit where they can be
      used to perform work.<br>
      <br>
      Electrochemical cells however have had a problem of exhausting the
      reactants. Although cells can be designed to be recharged by
      applying a reverse polarity voltage across the electrodes, such
      recharging requires a separate electrical source. During the
      recharging of the cell the cell typically is not usable.<br>
      Fuel cells have been developed in an effort to overcome problems
      associated with electrochemical cells. Typically, fuel cells
      operate by passing an ionized species across a selective
      electrolyte which blocks the passage of the non-ionized species.
      By placing porous electrodes on either side of the electrolyte, a
      current may be induced in an external circuit connecting the
      electrodes. The most common type of fuel cell is a hydrogen-oxygen
      fuel cell which passes hydrogen through one of the electrodes
      while oxygen is passed through the other electrode. The hydrogen
      and oxygen combine at the electrolyte-electrode interface to
      produce water. By continuously removing the water, a concentration
      gradient is maintained to induce the flow of hydrogen and oxygen
      to the cell.<br>
      These types of fuel cells however suffer from a number of
      disadvantages. These cells must be continuously supplied with a
      reactant in order to produce electricity continuously.
      Additionally, these cells produce a continuous product stream
      which must be removed, the removal of which may pose a problem.
      The porous electrodes of these fuel cells must allow the passage
      of the reactant entering the cell. However, over time these porous
      electrodes can become fouled or plugged so as to slow or even
      prevent the passage of the reactant. Such slowing of the reactant
      flow reduces the production of electricity. Lastly, the selection
      of an appropriate electrolyte is not always easy. The electrolyte
      must rapidly transport the ionized species in order to increase
      the current production. Frequently, the limited migration of the
      ionized species through the electrolyte is a limiting factor on
      the amount of current produced.<br>
      <br>
      In an effort to avoid the problems inherent with the previously
      described fuel cells, thermoelectric conversion cells have been
      designed. These thermoelectric conversion cells utilize heat to
      produce a pressure gradient to induce the flow of a reactant, such
      as molten sodium, across a solid electrolyte. A current is
      generated as sodium atoms lose electrons upon entering the
      electrolyte and gain electrons upon leaving the electrolyte. These
      cells however also suffer from the plugging of the porous
      electrodes required to pass the sodium ions. Furthermore, the
      diffusion of the sodium ions through the solid electrolytes has
      proven to be slow, thereby limiting the amount of current produced
      by the cell. These cells also utilize alkali metals which is
      difficult to use in these types of applications because of they
      are highly corrosive. Lastly, these types of fuel cells operate at
      extremely high temperatures, typically in a range between
      1,200-1,500 degrees Kelvin, thus making them impractical for many
      uses.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is seen that a need remains for an electrochemical
      conversion system that does not require a continuous source of
      reactant, which does not require an electrolyte which may be
      plugged over time and which may be operated at relatively low
      temperatures. It is the provision of such therefore that the
      present invention is primarily directed.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      With reference next to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1 a
      reversible engine 10 in a preferred form of the invention of a
      heat engine. The engine 10 has a conduit system 11, a first
      electrochemical cells 12, and a second electrochemical cell 13.
      The conduit system 11 is made of a non-reactive material such as
      stainless steel. The conduit system 11 includes a first conduit 15
      extending from the first electrochemical cell 12 to the second
      electrochemical cell 13, and a second conduit 16 extending from
      the second electrochemical cell 13 to the first electrochemical
      cell 12.<br>
      <br>
      The heat engine 10 also includes a heater 18 mounted in thermal
      communication with the conduit system 11 adjacent the second
      electrochemical cell 13, a cooler 19 mounted in thermal
      communication with the conduit system 11 adjacent the first
      electrochemical cell 12, and a heat regenerator or exchanger 20
      thermally coupled to the first and second conduits 15 and 16 for
      the transfer of heat therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      The first electrochemical cell 12 has a first gas diffusion
      electrode 22, a second gas diffusion electrode 23 and a first
      proton conductive membrane 24, such as Nafion made by E.I. du Pont
      de Nemours, mounted between the first and second gas diffusion
      electrodes 22 and 23. This type of electrochemical cell is
      available from E-Tek, Inc. of Somerset, N.J. The electrochemical
      cell electrodes 22 and 23 are electrically coupled to an external
      power supply 25.<br>
      Similarly, the second electrochemical cell 13 has a third gas
      diffusion electrode 28, a fourth gas diffusion electrode 29 and a
      second proton conductive membrane 30 mounted between the third and
      fourth gas diffusion electrodes 28 and 29. The electrochemical
      cell electrodes 28 and 29 are electrically coupled to an external
      load 31.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the conduit system 11 is filled with an ionizable gas,
      such as hydrogen, oxygen or sodium hereinafter referred to simply
      as hydrogen H. With the operation of the heater 18 (QH) to
      transfer heat energy to the second electrochemical cell 13, or
      adjacent thereto, to maintain a constant temperature of the
      hydrogen gas ionized and passed therethrough, the operation of
      cooler 19 (QL) to transfer heat energy from, or from adjacent
      thereto, the first electrochemical cell 12, and the operation of
      the heat exchanger 20 to transfer heat energy from the hydrogen
      gas within the second conduit 16 to the hydrogen gas within the
      first conduit 15, and the passage of an electric current from the
      external power supply 25 to the first electrochemical cell 12,
      hydrogen gas H passes through the first electrochemical cell 12.
      The hydrogen gas H passes through the first electrochemical cell
      12 as a result of the electric potential from the external power
      supply 25 between the first electrode 22 and the second electrode
      23. The electric potential causes the hydrogen gas at the first
      electrode 22 to oxidize into hydrogen protons. The oxidation of
      the hydrogen gas causes the release of electrons which are passed
      to the second electrode 23. The hydrogen protons are drawn through
      the first proton conductive membrane 24 to the second electrode 23
      by the negative charge at the second electrode 23. At the second
      electrode 23 the hydrogen protons are reduced into hydrogen gas.
      As such, the electric current through the first electrochemical
      cell 12 forces the passage of hydrogen gas from the second conduit
      16 to the first conduit 15, thereby increasing the hydrogen gas
      pressure within the first conduit 15 while decreasing the hydrogen
      gas pressure within the second conduit 16, i.e., creating a
      hydrogen gas pressure differential between the second conduit 16
      and the first conduit 15.<br>
      <br>
      The passage of hydrogen gas H from the second conduit 16 to the
      first conduit 15 causes a pressure differential across the second
      electrochemical cell 13. As the hydrogen pressure differential
      between the first and second conduits 15 and 16 increases an
      electrical potential across the second electrochemical cell 13 is
      created and progressively increased. Hydrogen gas H at the higher
      pressure first conduit 15 adjacent the second electrochemical cell
      third electrode 28 is oxidized into hydrogen protons. These
      hydrogen protons are forced by the hydrogen pressure differential
      through the second proton conductive membrane 30 to the fourth
      electrode 29 at the lower pressure second conduit 16. At the
      fourth electrode 29 the hydrogen protons are reduced into hydrogen
      gas. As such, the oxidation of the hydrogen gas causes the release
      of electrons which are passed to the third electrode 28 while the
      reduction of protons into hydrogen gas causes the acceptance or
      receiving of electrons from the fourth electrode 29, thereby
      inducing an electric current through load 31 coupled to the second
      electrochemical cell 13.<br>
      <br>
      The passage of hydrogen gas through the first and second
      electrochemical cells 12 and 13 creates a fluid stream or flow
      through the conduit system 11 as illustrated by the direction
      arrows in the drawings. The flow of hydrogen gas through the first
      conduit 15 from adjacent the first electrochemical cell 12 to
      adjacent the second electrochemical cell 13 is done so under
      constant pressure while the temperature of the gas increases.
      Similarly, the flow of hydrogen gas through the second conduit 16
      from adjacent the second electrochemical cell 13 to adjacent the
      first electrochemical cell 12 is done so under constant pressure
      while the temperature decreases.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that it takes less work to transfer the
      hydrogen gas across the first electrochemical cell from the low
      pressure region to the high pressure region at a low temperature
      than the work required to transfer the hydrogen gas across the
      second electrochemical cell from the high pressure region to the
      low pressure region at a high temperature. As such, the work input
      at the first electrochemical cell is less than the work output at
      the second electrochemical cell, with the additional work output
      energy being obtained from the conversion of the heat energy input
      (QH). The transfer of heat through the heat exchanger 20 aids in
      maintaining a temperature differential between the regions of the
      conduit system surrounding the two electrochemical cells 12 and 13
      and thereby aid in maintaining a constant pressure during the
      process, and in improving the efficiency by conserving the heat
      energy within the system by transferring it from the high
      temperature gas leaving the high temperature region adjacent the
      second electrochemical cell to the lower temperature gas flowing
      to the first electrochemical cell.<br>
      <br>
      The entropy diagram shown in FIG. 2 illustrates the theoretical
      change in entropy of the just described system during its
      operation in an ideal or perfect situation wherein the heat
      exchange is ideal or 100 percent efficient, i.e., wherein outside
      influences on the system are not considered. Obviously, the true
      entropy diagram of the system will be different once these outside
      influences are taken into consideration.<br>
      <br>
      The system may also be operated in a reverse cycle as a heat pump,
      as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Here, the second electrochemical cell
      13 is coupled to an external power supply 25 while the first
      electrochemical cell 12 is coupled to an external load 31. Also,
      the region adjacent the first electrochemical cell 12 is provided
      with heat energy (QL) by while heat energy is extracted (QH) from
      the region adjacent the second electrochemical cell 13. The
      operation of the device in this configuration is the extraction of
      heat energy (QL) from a low temperature source and supply it as
      heat energy (QH) to a higher temperature source, as illustrated in
      FIG. 3. The principles of the invention however remain the same as
      those previously described, with the system here providing a
      change in the heat energy.<br>
      <br>
      The system may be operated at relatively small temperatures
      differences. As such, this system is both safe and manageable.
      Furthermore, this system converts energy without any mechanically
      moving parts, and as such is practically free of mechanical
      failure.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that the previously described systems may
      utilize any form of heat source such as electric heaters, gas
      burning heaters, heated air, radiation heat sources, radiant
      heaters or other conventionally known means of producing heat. The
      system may also utilize any form of cooling means such as cooling
      water jackets, heat sinks, cooling radiators, heat dissipaters or
      another other conventionally known means of removing heat.<br>
      <br>
      With reference next to FIG. 5, there is shown an electrochemical
      conversion system 40 for energy management which includes
      multi-node (three or more stacks) or electrochemical cells. The
      three-node system 40 (a thermally driven heat pump) is described
      in detail to provide a stepping-stone for multi-node (&gt;3 nodes)
      operation. Principles for the thermally driven heat pump apply
      equally to all multi-node electrochemical conversion systems.<br>
      <br>
      The system 40 is an innovative, solid-state heat engine which can
      operate on any thermal source, such as combustible fuels,
      concentrated solar energy, waste heat, or geothermal. In addition
      to power generation, the electrochemical conversion systems can be
      configured as a heat pump or as a combination heat pump/heat
      engine to provide thermal management for heating, cooling and
      electrical energy. Operating on the Ericsson cycle and using
      hydrogen as a working fluid, the electrochemical conversion system
      can efficiently transport heat to or from a desired location to
      effectively maintain a desired elevated or reduced temperature.
      The Ericsson cycle is Carnot equivalent, and therefore, offers the
      maximum theoretical efficiency available from an engine operating
      between two temperatures. The electrochemical conversion system
      uses electrochemical cells, also referred to as Membrane Electrode
      Assemblies (MEA), similar to those used in fuel cells; however, it
      does not require oxygen or a fuel supply, only heat.<br>
      <br>
      The three-node system 40 is a thermally driven heat pump and is
      shown in FIG. 5 along with a Temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram of
      the cycle shown in FIG. 6. The thermodynamic states on the T-s
      diagram correspond to the same locations in the thermally driven
      heat pump schematic.<br>
      <br>
      The system 40 includes a conduit system 41, an electrical system
      42, first electrochemical cell 43, a second electrochemical cell
      44, a third electrochemical cell 45, a first recuperative heat
      exchanger (RHX) 46, and a second recuperative heat exchanger 47.
      The conduit system 41, electrical system 42, heat exchangers, and
      electrochemical cells are all constructed and function in the same
      manner as previously described.<br>
      <br>
      This version of the system 40 includes an additional, second
      recuperative heat exchanger 47 (RHX) (the two node system of FIGS.
      1 and 3 include a single RHX) to thermally isolate the third
      electrochemical cell 45 or node from the other two, and an
      interface with the ambient environment for heat exchange (labeled
      as QC at temperature TA), a high temperature interface for heat
      exchange (labeled as Qs, at temperature TH&gt;TA), and an
      interface to the refrigerated space for heat exchange (labeled as
      QR at TR&lt;TA). As shown, the electrochemical cells 43, 44 and 45
      are electrically and pneumatically connected in series so that the
      electrical current flow and the proton flow through the
      electrochemical cells are balanced.<br>
      <br>
      Beginning at high temperature intermediate pressure state 1,
      electrical energy EO is generated at the high temperature MEA as
      hydrogen expands from state 1 to high temperature low-pressure
      state 2. The temperature of the hydrogen is maintained nearly
      constant by supplying heat QS from the source during the expansion
      process. The thin membrane (less than 10 [mu]m thick) within the
      electrochemical cell will not support a significant temperature
      gradient, so the near isothermal assumption for the process is
      valid, provided adequate heat is transferred from the membrane
      through its substrate. From state 2 to state 3, the hydrogen
      passes through the first recuperative heat exchanger (RHX) 46
      under approximately constant pressure and is cooled by
      transferring heat to hydrogen flowing in the opposite direction to
      ambient temperature. From ambient temperature, low-pressure state
      3, electrical energy (labeled as EC) is consumed as hydrogen is
      compressed nearly isothermally across the ambient temperature,
      third electrochemical cell 45 to high pressure, ambient
      temperature state 4. Heat QC generated during the compression
      process is rejected to the ambient environment to maintain the
      isothermal process. From ambient temperature, high-pressure state
      4 the hydrogen passes through the second recuperative heat
      exchanger to low temperature, high-pressure state 5. The hydrogen
      flowing from state 4 to 5 is cooled by transferring heat to the
      hydrogen flowing in the opposite direction through the second
      recuperative heat exchanger flowing from the low temperature,
      first electrochemical cell 43 (state 6 to 7). Refrigeration is
      accomplished at the low temperature, first electrochemical cell 43
      by extracting heat QR from the low temperature environment as
      hydrogen expands from low temperature, high-pressure state 5 to
      low temperature, low-pressure state 6 thereby generating energy
      ER. From state 6 to state 7, hydrogen flows through the second
      recuperative heat exchanger 47 wherein its temperature is
      increased by heat transfer from the hydrogen passing from state 4
      to 5. The hydrogen continues through the first recuperative heat
      exchanger 46, where it is heated by hydrogen leaving the high
      temperature, second electrochemical cell 44 to return to high
      temperature, high-pressure state 1 completing the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      With reference next to FIG. 7, there is shown a four-node
      electrochemical conversion system 60 in another preferred form of
      the invention. It should be noted that the electrochemical
      convention system of the present invention can be configured with
      N total nodes, where M (which must be less than N) of the nodes
      are connected to sources or sinks at non-ambient temperatures and
      at least one node interfaces with the ambient environment to
      satisfy thermodynamic requirements for a heat engine. The
      multi-node system can be designed for nearly any thermal
      management issues, and overall operation will of course depend on
      the number of nodes and the amount of heat available.<br>
      <br>
      The four node system 60, is similar to the three-node system of
      FIGS. 5 and 6 except for the addition of a fourth electrochemical
      cell, the details of which will follow, and a third recuperative
      heat exchanger 63. Here, the system 60 includes a high temperature
      power generation electrochemical cell 64, a waste heat power
      generation electrochemical cell 65, a heat pump electrochemical
      cell 66, and an ambient interface electrochemical cell 67.
      Electrochemical cell 64 may operate on combustion or some other
      high quality heat source (concentrated solar, high quality waste
      heat, etc.), while electrochemical cell 65 may operate on a lower
      quality waste heat source, e.g. electronics. Electrochemical cell
      66 can be used to provide space heating, while the electrochemical
      cell 67 rejects heat to the ambient as required for a heat engine
      or heat pump. All nodes or electrochemical cells do not need to
      operate simultaneously or at the same voltage and current, which
      is why the schematic shows a control processor and load leveling
      battery. The control processor ensures that proper voltages and
      currents are maintained at proper values, while the load leveling
      battery is used (as the name implies) to level the system loads
      for any combination of operating electrochemical cells.<br>
      <br>
      It thus is seen that an electrochemical conversion system for heat
      management is now provided which is efficient. It should of course
      be understood that many modifications, in addition to those
      specifically recited herein, may be made to the specific
      embodiments described herein without departure from the spirit and
      scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.<br>
