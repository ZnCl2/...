          <br>
          In laboratory experiments the researchers the Dr. Guido Ebner
          and Heinz Schürch exposed cereal seeds and fish eggs to an
          "electrostatic field" – in other words, to a high voltage
          field, in which no current flows. Unexpectedly primeval
          organisms grew out of these seeds and eggs: a fern that no
          botanist was able to identify; primeval corn with up to twelve
          ears per stalk; wheat that was ready to be harvested in just
          four to six weeks. And giant trout, extinct in Europe for 130
          years, with so-called salmon hooks. It was as if these
          organisms accessed their own genetic memories on command in
          the electric field,<br>
          <br>
          The Swiss pharmaceutical group patented the process – and then
          stopped the research in 1992. Why? The discovery was soon
          forgotten, without the global scientific community taking any
          notice. But this changed: In collaboration with the
          researchers involved – or rather their sons - author Luc
          Bürgin has for the first time now disclosed in detail how the
          principle of this revolutionary bio-experiment works.<br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless many scientists who think along conventional
          lines may remain sceptical about this inexplicable biological
          effect. But now for the first time, renowned German expert
          botanists such as Professor Edgar Wagner of the University of
          Freiburg and Professor Gunter Rothe from the University of
          Mainz make positive statements about it in the book. Rothe
          even had replicated the Ciba experiments in detail at his
          university in 2001 – and was successful. And also for the
          first time, even a Nobel laureate – the world-famous Swiss
          microbiologist Werner Arber – is taking up the cudgels for
          this controversial discovery. Back then, Arber had given an
          expert opinion on the Ciba experiments in person in the
          laboratory. The professor said to the author: "I was
          impressed!"<br>
          <br>
          After Guido Ebner and Heinz Schürch both passed away
          unexpectedly in 2001, their experiments were continued by
          Guido Ebner's son, Daniel – himself a biologist – on a private
          basis. Daniel M. Ebner (studies of biology, chemistry and
          biostatics at the Universities of Basel and Montreal) works as
          Management Consultant at the Swiss Arcondis company ("Art of
          Consulting and Development for Information System",
          CH-Reinach) in the fields of pharmaceutical validation
          processes&nbsp; and information technology. At the WMF 2008 he
          will present facts, reasonings and perspectives of the
          discovery of his father. Ebner’s involvement belongs
          especially in the practical usage of the discovery for food
          production of countries in the Third World.<br>

          <br>
          Can the global food problem at last be solved without using
          genetic engineering? This new book by Swiss journalist Luc
          Bürgin unveils the secret of a sensational biological
          discovery at the pharmaceutical giant Ciba (now Novartis),
          which unfortunately has been ignored by the experts up to the
          present day. In laboratory experiments the researchers there
          Dr. Guido Ebner and Heinz Schürch exposed cereal seeds and
          fish eggs to an "electrostatic field" in other words, to a
          high voltage field, in which no current flows.<br>
          <br>
          Unexpectedly primeval organisms grew out of these seeds and
          eggs: a fern that no botanist was able to identify; primeval
          corn with up to twelve ears per stalk; wheat that was ready to
          be harvested in just four to six weeks. And giant trout,
          extinct in Europe for 130 years, with so-called salmon hooks.
          It was as if these organisms accessed their own genetic
          memories on command in the electric field, a phenomenon, which
          the English biochemist, Rupert Sheldrake, for instance
          believes is possible.<br>
          <br>
          The Swiss pharmaceutical group patented the process and then
          stopped the research in 1992. Why? Because "primeval cereals"
          generated by an electric field, in contrast to modern strains
          of seeds, require hardly any fertilisers or pesticides i.e.
          crop protection agents, sold as priority products by Ciba at
          that time. The discovery was soon forgotten, without the
          global scientific community taking any notice.<br>
          <br>
          In collaboration with the researchers involved or rather their
          sons, in this book, the author has for the first time now
          disclosed in detail how the principle of this revolutionary
          bio-experiment works. Previously unpublished research reports,
          64 exclusive photos, English-language patent specifications
          and interviews document the "Primeval Code" in all its
          aspects.<br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless many scientists who think along conventional
          lines may remain sceptical about this inexplicable biological
          effect. But now for the first time, renowned German expert
          botanists such as Professor Edgar Wagner of the University of
          Freiburg and Professor Gunter Rothe from the University of
          Mainz make positive statements about it in the book. Rothe
          even had replicated the Ciba experiments in detail at his
          university in 2001 and was successful. And also for the first
          time, even a Nobel laureate the world-famous Swiss
          microbiologist Werner Arber is taking up the cudgels for this
          controversial discovery. Back then, Arber had given an expert
          opinion on the Ciba experiments in person in the laboratory.
          The professor said to the author: "I was impressed!"<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, Guido Ebner and Heinz Schürch appear to have
          discovered a biological method of effectively creating
          antecedents from progeny without using genetic engineering. Or
          as both researchers put it: "Our experiments do not involve a
          mutation of the organism in question, which in the case of
          genetic engineering involves channelling an additional gene
          into the organism. No entirely new organism is created. In the
          electrostatic field, only the gene expression is altered the
          retrieval of the existing gene. That is something different."<br>
          <br>
          In addition to corn and trout experiments, the results of
          experiments with wheat were also amazing: thus the cereal
          exposed to the electrostatic field developed new proteins,
          which people looked for in the original wheat to no avail.
          Furthermore, it surprisingly produced much larger roots than
          the control group. This had the advantage of allowing the
          crops to grow far more rapidly. And occasionally in these
          experiments, a variant emerged which resembled the genetic
          antecedents of the wheat. Thus, a meadow grass-like
          arrangement of ear shoots and small narrow leaves was
          observed, for example.<br>
          <br>
          "In the case of our 'manipulated' wheat, growth was so rapid
          that it was ripe in four weeks instead of the usual seven
          months", Heinz Schürch recalled. "However one has to say that
          although the ears and stalks were somewhat smaller, there were
          more ears per plant. The actual benefit is that we could
          cultivate this wheat in regions where spring and summer are
          short where conventional wheat cannot be grown at all." In
          this case, one can also cheerfully refrain from using
          pesticides and herbicides: "The pests that have adapted to the
          growth process of normal wheat have not yet developed when we
          harvest our wheat as early as four to eight weeks after
          planting."<br>
          <br>
          The Third World in particular could benefit from this method
          of cultivation that is both environmentally friendly and
          inexpensive. For "primeval cereals" from an electric field
          yield more than modern genetically engineered varieties and do
          not require fertilisers. Furthermore, it is completely natural
          and thus healthier. It can be grown by anybody at minimal
          cost.<br>
          <br>
          After Guido Ebner and Heinz Schürch both passed away
          unexpectedly in 2001, their experiments were continued by
          Guido Ebner's son, Daniel himself a biologist – on a private
          basis. He now wants to export this electric field technology
          to Africa as soon as possible, as part of an aid project, with
          the assistance of the former assistant to the UN Food
          Representative, Professor Jean Ziegler, in order to make it
          available to local farmers free of charge, as an ecological
          alternative to the controversial genetically engineered seeds
          of the international agro-multinationals.<br>

          It seems a fantastic world in which we were introduced to our
          children through stories, pictures and story books. It seems
          no less fantastic, as we see today is foreign to us drawings
          or engravings of plants or animals of prehistoric times.
          Living creatures on our planet thousands of years ago, or even
          millions of years existed. Oversized trees and animals that
          are long gone. I would not have believed it possible that
          animals from a bygone era in our reality is to get today. It
          can be done! This report shows how and where this has happened
          and what peculiarities connected with it.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">A scientific sensation</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          With an entertainment program of the Swiss television (super
          hit on 17/12/1988) it was made public. Million spectators have
          witnessed, as Showmaster Kurt Felix introduced two

          Guido Ebner and Heinz Schürch, two scientists in the research
          and development at one of the 10 largest chemical companies in
          the world - Ciba-Geigy. The Swiss company sells chemical
          products and services in three markets. Health, agriculture
          and industry.<br>
          <br>
          Research results were presented which were to remain under
          wraps at the moment. Plants can be changed by an electrostatic
          field in such a way that they grow as millions of years ago.
          So a step backwards in their evolutionary history experienced.
          From a traditional male fern with its feathery leaves had
          turned around a Hirschzungenfarn tapering, tongue-like leaves.
          Some scientists call this Ciba-Geigy also Urfarn fern.<br>

          Plants from prehistoric times, perhaps, could do from the time
          of the dinosaurs, perhaps even from the time before ... The
          scientists conjecture. Anyway, it's a time warp back in
          evolutionary history with the help of our common fern spores,
          reproductive cells, ie from the time now treated in an
          electric field. Performed in the research laboratories of the

          What the public has been presented is just one part of the
          experiments. They also experimented with other crops (mainly
          wheat), even with fish. For example, experiments with corn.<br>

          In Petri dishes artificial soil and water was tested together
          with maize kernels, which were then placed in an electrostatic
          field. Static electric fields, stress fields in which no
          current flows. There exists a DC voltage up to several
          thousand volts, depending on the experimental arrangement.
          What alchemists dreamed before several hundreds of years,
          actually, the general doctrine is to spite. A Nobel

          The present invention relates to a novel method which, based
          on the brief application of electrostatic fields, induces
          lasting useful and desirable properties in fish, which
          properties cannot otherwise be induced at all or can only be
          induced by dint of substantial additional investment in time
          and material resources. The simplicity of the method of this
          invention and the significant results obtained make it
          possible to improve very substantially the breeding of
          freshwater and saltwater fish, especially of edible fish and
          also of ornamental fish.<br>
          <br>
          The method of the present invention essentially comprises
          exposing early development stages of fish, such as juvenile
          fish or preferably eggs, before, during or after
          fertilisation, especially eggs in early phases of cell
          division, for a short time to electrostatic fields, without
          the flow of electric currents. It is particularly preferred to
          use eggs during or immediately after fertilisation.<br>
          <br>
          Specifically, in the practice of this invention, tanks
          (aquaria) filled with freshwater or saltwater and containing
          the fish or eggs, and consisting preferably of electrically
          non-conductive material (insulator), are placed between the
          electrodes of a capacitor. A directcurrent voltage of one to
          tens of thousands of volts is then applied to said electrodes.
          Instead of using the non-conductive aquarium material, it is
          of course also possible to use electrodes which are provided
          with an insulating layer and to immerse these electrically
          insulated capacitor plates direct in the tanks. Of sole
          importance is that the electrodes of the capacitor are
          insulated against the freshwater or saltwater acting as
          dielectric medium. As no currents flow in this apparatus, no
          perceptible loss of energy is observed. Hence energy is not a
          cost factor in this invention.<br>
          <br>
          A further essential feature of this invention is that, because
          no electric current flows, the chemical identity of the system
          "fish" does not undergo change.<br>
          <br>
          Interest in the investigation of parameters which exert a
          direct or indirect activity on physico-chemical interactions
          in living organisms has so far centered almost exclusively on
          the influence of temperature, pressure, electromagnetic
          radiation and electrodynamic fields (alternating fields). In
          contrast, far less attention has been paid, for example, to
          the investigation into possible interactions of electrostatic
          fields on the development of higher organisms, especially
          fish.<br>
          <br>
          Only recently have reports become more frequent on the
          possible effects of gravitation and magnetic fields on
          biological systems. Thus, for example, Goodman and Henderson
          [Bioelectromagnetics, 7: 23-29, 1986] have found indications
          that a correlation exists between electromagnetic fields and
          the rate of transcription in biological material, the rate
          being influenced favourably by the applied electromagnetic
          field so that enhanced transcription results.<br>
          <br>
          In contrast, it would appear that the possibility that
          electrostatic fields might also have an influence on the
          course of physico-chemical interactions in organisms,
          especially also in early development phases, has so far been
          ruled out from the start. Hence there have to date been no
          reports on the possible effect of electrostatic fields on the
          development of fish.<br>
          <br>
          Experiments have, however, been described (C.A. 95: 165 987b;
          Vosyliene et al.), in which trout (Salmo iridens) and carp
          (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed over long periods to field
          strengths of 0.03-0.08 V/cm and 0.06-0.10 V/cm. These
          experiments dealt principally with the influence of the
          voltage applied on brain development and the excretion of
          noradrenalin, depending additionally on the season.<br>
          <br>
          The reason why there has been so little investigation into the
          effects of electrostatic fields may primarily be that, in the
          light of conventional teaching, it has been assumed that an
          electrostatic field in a medium filled with charge carriers is
          shielded by the spontaneous formation of an electric double
          layer and consequently remains inert in its effect.<br>
          <br>
          This teaching is based essentially on the equation formulated
          by C. Gouy and D. L. Chapman, according to which the actual
          thickness of a diffuse double layer for an electrolyte is
          ##EQU1## wherein d=the thickness of the double layer<br>
          F=the Faraday constant<br>
          .epsilon.=the dielectric constant<br>
          R=the universal gas constant<br>
          T=the absolute temperature, and<br>
          i=the nature of the ions of concentrations ci and valences zi.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, this prejudice has now been overcome with
          respect to fish in the practice of this invention by the
          application of simple measures.<br>
          <br>
          In contradistinction to the conventional teaching elaborated
          above, the aim has now for the first time been successfully
          achieved, within the scope of this invention, of providing a
          method by which it is possible to induce in fish lasting
          desirable and useful changes, which method is based on a
          modification of physico-chemical interactions induced by the
          effect of an electrostatic field.<br>
          <br>
          As previously stated, this aim can be achieved most simply by
          exposing juvenile fish or fertilised fish eggs to an
          electrostatic field, such that the physico-chemical
          interactions which take place during cell division and
          differentiation, and which it is desired to modify with the
          aid of the method of this invention, take place under the
          influence of a defined electrostatic field under controlled
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of
          inducing desirable and useful properties in fish, which
          comprises a) exposing early development stages of fish to an
          electrostatic field, such that the physico-chemical reactions
          which it is desired to modify take place under the influence
          of a defined electrostatic field under controlled conditions,
          but without thereby changing the chemical identity of the
          system itself, and<br>
          <br>
          b) keeping said early development stages of fish in said
          electrostatic field for a period of time necessary for a
          stable development of the desired modification.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout this specification, the expression "early
          development stages of fish" shall be understood as meaning all
          stages starting from the egg (egg cell), preferably the
          fertilised egg, through the different embryonic stages right
          up to the hatchable or hatched juvenile fish. These are the
          stages of frequent cell division and differentiation in which
          the electrostatic fields produce favourable and lasting
          results.<br>
          <br>
          Especially preferred in this connection are fish eggs which
          are actually fertilised in the static field or which are
          exposed to the influence of an electrostatic field only after
          fertilisation -- most preferably directly after.<br>
          <br>
          A favourable, and therefore within the scope of this invention
          preferred, period of time during which these early development
          stages remain in the electrostatic field, is the time until
          the eggs ripen, especially until they hatch. This period of
          time will normally depend on external conditions, for example
          water temperature, the oxygen concentration and the like, but
          most especially on the species of fish.<br>
          <br>
          Afterwards, the juvenile fish are transferred to larger tanks,
          as is usual in fish breeding, where they mature to a desired
          growth stage.<br>
          <br>
          The really surprising feature is that these juvenile fish
          which have been pretreated in the described manner and
          transferred to normal breeding tanks differ significantly from
          untreated control groups.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly, a substantially higher hatching rate of the treated
          fish eggs is observed, with frequently an increase of 100 to
          300% and even higher values being achieved. Secondly, these
          juvenile fish make a far more agile and more vital impression
          than the untreated comparison fish. Very significant is their
          markedly higher survival rate which extends not only to their
          first few days, but virtually to their entire life cycle. This
          feature becomes all the more marked if all medication is
          dispensed with. For it is then observed that, in the first few
          days and weeks, the untreated control group (not exposed to an
          electrostatic field) is at least twice as heavily reduced by
          the non-artifically inhibited and naturally occurring
          population of pathogens as the fish that have been exposed to
          treatment with an electric field. In addition, the treated
          fish, while receiving identical feeding, grow in weight and
          size far faster and reach adulthood significantly earlier, and
          hence can be transferred to natural waters or are available
          for marketing as edible or ornamental fish. Further, no
          deleterious changes in the progeny of these treated fish are
          observed. On the contrary, a certain element of the vitality
          seems to be transferable to the progeny.<br>
          <br>
          All in all, the fish treated by the method of this invention
          are substantially more vital than the untreated comparison
          fish and reach adulthood earlier. For the fish breeder this
          means a reduction in the consumption of medicaments and
          antibacterial agents, even to the extent of dispensing with
          such substances completely, a perceptibly more efficient
          utilisation of the fish feed employed, and a shortened rearing
          phase. These are advantages which no other expedient at
          present known is able to afford.<br>
          <br>
          The mechanism on which the method of this invention is based
          is at present not known and will require elucidation in the
          future.<br>
          <br>
          On the whole, the application of the method of this invention
          results surprisingly, for example, in a favourable change in
          the development and growth efficiency, in the morphogenesis,
          possibly in the gene expression patterns, in proneness to
          stress, resistance to pathogens, and many other
          characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          A primary object of this invention is accordingly the
          provision of a method of enhancing the efficiency of the
          development and breeding of freshwater and saltwater fish.
          Especially preferred is a method of enhancing the efficiency
          of the development and growth of edible fish.<br>
          <br>
          Also falling within the scope of this invention are the fish
          themselves in which change has been induced by the application
          of the method of this invention, which fish have an enhanced
          development of growth efficiency, and the progeny thereof,
          provided these latter still have a novel and characteristic
          property of at least one of the parents in which change has
          been induced by the method of this invention.<br>
          <br>
          Within the scope of this invention, an enhanced development
          and growth will be understood as meaning, for example, an
          increase in the hatching rate and an enhancement of the growth
          rate.<br>
          <br>
          A further object of the present invention is the provision of
          a method which modifies the specific stress reactions of fish
          in desirable and useful manner, especially such that the
          treated fish are more robust and reach adulthood faster.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, for example, it is possible to reduce very substantially
          the susceptibility of fish to diseases by the application of
          the method of this invention, and so to breed the fish under
          conditions which would normally be critical to their health
          and which would not permit a normal and controlled
          development.<br>
          <br>
          Hence the present invention also relates to fish whose
          specific reactions to specific stress parameters are modified
          in a desirable and useful manner by the application of the
          method of this invention, especially those fish which exhibit
          increased resistance to pathogens.<br>
          <br>
          More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to
          provide a method of vitalising fish, which comprises<br>
          <br>
          a) exposing fertilised fish eggs to an electrostatic field,
          without flow of current, or fertilising eggs in said field,<br>
          <br>
          b) adjusting the field strength to values in the range from 1
          V/cm to 10@5 V/cm, and<br>
          <br>
          c) maintaining the electrostatic field until the juvenile fish
          hatch or mature.<br>
          <br>
          The fertilisation step can, of course, also be carried out in
          apparatus of this invention (aquarium with electrodes) with
          the voltage already applied.<br>
          <br>
          In the practice of this invention, the electrostatic field is
          preferably produced between the electrically insulated plates
          of a capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          The field strength of the electrostatic field is determined by
          the following equation:<br>
          E=U/d<br>
          <br>
          where U is the potential difference between the capacitor
          plates, and d is the distance between the plates.<br>
          <br>
          The potential difference U is produced by a high-tension
          generator. Any kind of high-tension generator may be used in
          the method of this invention. Preferred high-tension
          generators are those based on the transformer principle with
          rectifier.<br>
          <br>
          The preferred potential difference within the scope of this
          invention is from 1.0 V (volt) to 10@5 (V) volt.<br>
          <br>
          For the application of the method of this invention to fish
          eggs, potential differences of 1 V to 20 000 V, preferably of
          100 V to 10 000 V, are used. Most preferred is a potential
          difference of 500 V to 3 000 V.<br>
          <br>
          The distance between the plates of the capacitor depends on
          the dimensions of the aquarium, and is, for example, from 0.01
          mm to 1 mm, but is preferably from 1 cm to 10 cm.<br>
          <br>
          In practice, the field strength of the electrostatic field at
          the given distance between the plates of the capacitor is
          regulated by the strength of the voltage produced by a
          high-tension generator.<br>
          <br>
          In the practice of this invention, the field strengths are
          preferably from 1 V/cm to 10 000 V/cm, more preferably from 50
          V/cm to 5 000 V/cm but, most preferably, from 500 V/cm to 1
          000 V/cm.<br>
          <br>
          For the application of the method of this invention, it is
          most preferred to use biological material which has a high
          rate of division and/or still exhibits little differentiation,
          for example cells capable of division. Specifically, suitable
          biological material in the context of this invention comprises
          fertilised of unfertilised eggs as well as early embryonic
          stages right up to hatchable juvenile fish.<br>
          <br>
          The rate of fertilisation and hatching of fish eggs can be
          significantly enhanced under the influence of an electrostatic
          field.<br>
          <br>
          All these foregoing particulars cited by way of
          exemplification are solely intended to illustrate the
          invention and in no way restrict the subject matter thereof.<br>
          <br>
          Most particularly, it is an object of the present invention to
          provide a method wherein the development of the fertilised
          eggs to juvenile fish takes place in an electrostatic field in
          which the field strengths may vary preferably from 10 V/cm to
          3 000 V/cm. Field strengths of 500 V/cm to 1500 V/cm, more
          particularly of 500 V/cm to 1 000 V/cm, are especially
          preferred.<br>
          <br>
          First and foremost, the invention provides a method of
          enhancing the growth and development efficiency of fish, which
          method comprises enhancing the fertilisation, hatching and
          survival rate as well as the growth of fish by<br>
          <br>
          a) treating fish eggs with male sperm,<br>
          <br>
          b) placing the treated eggs in incubators in which an
          electrostatic field is produced,<br>
          <br>
          c) providing field strengths for the electrostatic field of 10
          V/cm to 3 000 V/cm,<br>
          <br>
          d) removing the juvenile fish, after hatching, from the sphere
          of influence of the electrostatic field, and<br>
          <br>
          e) rearing said juvenile fish by methods which are known per
          se.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment of the fish in the electrostatic field in the
          practice of this invention is preferably effected in special
          incubators which, in the bottom and in the cover, contain
          built-in electrodes which are water-tight and insulated and
          are connected to a source for producing a high direct-current
          voltage, and with the aid of which an electrostatic field can
          be produced inside the incubators. It is, of course, possible
          to use any other experimental apparatus for treating the fish,
          provided it meets the basic conditions as set forth above.<br>
          <br>
          After the juvenile fish have hatched, the electric field is
          removed and the further rearing of the juvenile fish is
          continued by conventional methods free from the influence of
          an electric field.<br>
          <br>
          Contrary to all theory, and hence extremely surprisingly, it
          has been found that, compared with the controls, the juvenile
          fish which have hatched in the electric field have, in
          addition to a substantially enhanced fertilisation and
          hatching rate, further advantageous properties which then also
          develop after removal of the electric field and influence the
          further development of the fish.<br>
          <br>
          These further advantageous properties comprise, for example,
          an enhanced rate of growth compared with the controls.
          Furthermore, the treated fish, compared with the controls,
          have a markedly enhanced vitality.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention further relates to the use of the method
          of this invention for modifying specific stress reactions of
          fish.<br>
          <br>
          Particularly preferred fields of use relate to the enhancement
          of resistance to stress, for example to specific environmental
          factors such as increased salt concentrations in the culture
          medium, limitation of specific nutrients, limitation of light
          and/or oxygen, acceptance of pollution and the like.<br>
          <br>
          One of the most frequent stress factors in the living
          environment is deficiency stress, where one or more factors
          can simultaneously have a limiting effect.<br>
          <br>
          Deficiency stress occurs as soon as one or more of the factors
          essential for optimum growth or development, for example
          light, supply of oxygen/carbon dioxide, supply of nutrients,
          vitamins and the like, attain suboptimum values. The
          consequence is that the affected organism is no longer able to
          maintain to the full its ability to generate the syntheses
          essential for optimum development and growth, resulting
          initially in a retardation of growth. If this deficiency
          stress continues for a prolonged period of time, it results in
          an impairment of essential functions, leading then as a rule
          to early onset of senescence and hence ultimately to the death
          of the affected organism.<br>
          <br>
          Not only a deficiency, but also a superfluity, of specific
          crucial factors is able to trigger stress reactions. Increased
          salt concentrations in the nutrient medium leads, for example,
          to a rise in the osmotic value in the medium and,
          consequently, to a loss of fluid in the cells present therein,
          owing to the onset of osmosis and hence to cell shrinkage. The
          loss of fluid can usually be compensated for to a certain
          extent by self-regulatory steps taken by the affected
          organisms. But if a critical threshold is exceeded, then this
          will result in the death of the cells.<br>
          <br>
          The method of this invention can, in principle, be applied to
          all species of fish, but preferably to species that are bred
          on a commercial scale. In this connection, the treatment of
          edible fish is of particular importance, as it is expected
          that production costs can be reduced very considerably with
          the aid of the method of this invention.<br>
          <br>
          To illustrate the somewhat general nature of the foregoing
          description and to contribute to a better understanding of the
          invention, reference will now be made to specific working
          Examples which are non-limitative in character, unless special
          attention is drawn to them. The same applies to all
          particulars of an exemplary nature which are contained in the
          foregoing description.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRODUCING THE ELECTROSTATIC
            FIELD -- EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS</span><br>
          <br>
          All experiments hereinafter described are carried out in
          electrostatic fields which are produced between the plates of
          a capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          The electric field strength is given by the equation<br>
          E=U/d<br>
          <br>
          where<br>
          U is the potential difference (voltage) between the capacitor
          plates, and<br>
          d is the distance between the capacitor plates.<br>
          <br>
          The voltage is generated by means of a high-tension generator
          which operates on the principle of a transformer with
          rectifier, normally using voltage differences from 500 volt to
          12 000 volt.<br>
          <br>
          The distance between the plates will depend on the dimensions
          of the test tanks used in the individual experiments. Normally
          the variable parameters U and d will be chosen such that the
          field strengths of the electrostatic field are from 250 V/cm
          to 1500 V/cm.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention also relates to an apparatus for the
          treatment of early development stages of fish with electric
          fields, said apparatus comprising<br>
          <br>
          a) a tank suitable for holding the early development stages of
          fish in aqueous medium, and<br>
          <br>
          b) a source for producing a voltage and, connected therewith,
          an arrangement of electrodes suitable for producing an
          electrostatic field in at least a part of the volume
          surrounded by the tank, which process is characterized in that
          the arrangement of electrodes is electrically insulated
          against the medium contained in the tank and is preferably
          arranged in form of capacitor plates, and that the source of
          voltage is a source of a direct-current voltage.<br>

          <br>
          It is possible to influence favourably the development of
          animal organisms with the aid of an electrostatic field, as
          will be demonstrated in the following experiment carried out
          with rainbow trout.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.1 Experimental Apparatus

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
            DRAWING</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          FIG. 1 is a diagram of a preferred form of the invention,
          being an incubator with a source for an electrostatic field.<br>
          <br>
          Trout eggs (1) in batches of 1000 are treated in tanks with
          male sperm and immediately placed in incubators. The
          incubators consist of 1 liter plexiglass tanks (2) measuring
          31.5.times.28.5.times.4.5 cm. Aluminium electrodes (3) which
          are sealed air- and water-tight are built into the cover and
          bottom of the containers (see FIG. 1).<br>
          <br>
          The incubators are connected to a spring water (4) system of
          10 DEG-12 DEG C. and the electrodes are connected to a
          high-tension generator (5) (FUG HCN 14-12500, available from
          Weter, Schaffhausen, Switzerland). The voltage applied is 215
          volt and the space between the plates is 3 cm, so as to
          provide a field strength of 716 V/cm between the electrodes.
          The fertilisation and ripening of the eggs takes place in this
          apparatus. The eye stage is reached after ca. 4 weeks, and the
          brood hatches after ca. 8 weeks.<br>
          <br>
          After hatching, the brood is transferred to tanks measuring
          50.times.50.times.15 cm with laminar flow and the electric
          field is removed, so that the further development of the
          juvenile fish may take place free from the influence of the
          field.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.2 Results</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Table 4 shows that the number of juvenile fish which have
          hatched under the influence of the electrostatic field is
          markedly greater than that of the controls.<br>

          Compared with the controls, the number of fish which perished
          after hatching and after 5 weeks was reduced by about half
          with aid of the field.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, a growth increase effect of the field can also be
          detected. The size of the juvenile fish hatched under the
          influence of the electrostatic field, 10 weeks after hatching,
          is from 30 to 40% higher than that of the control fish (q.v.

          The invention relates to transparent sheets containing a
          fluorescent substance, characterised in that the fluorescent
          substance absorbs light of the wavelength 300 to 400 nm and
          fluoresces a wavelength range from 430 to 470 nm and in that
          the sheet contains the fluorescent substance in such an amount
          that, in daylight, the transmission in the wavelength range
          from 430 to 470 nm is amplified by more than 10%, and to a
          process for improving the photosynthesis rate of
          chlorophyll-containing cells and plants, to processes for
          preparing the sheet of the invention, and to an arrangement
          for improving the photosensitive rate.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The invention relates to transparent film containing a
          fluorescent substance with a fluorescence maximum of about 450
          nm, their use for increasing the rate of photosynthesis and
          for influencing plant growth as well as methods for their
          preparation.<br>
          <br>
          There are already partially transparent films become known
          containing dyes or fluorescent dyes for influencing plant
          growth.<br>
          <br>
          The Swiss patent CH 515 957 relates to transparent foils or
          sheets, which in addition to the usual auxiliaries, a dye up
          with a minimum permeability in the range of 380 590 nm and a
          maximum permeability of 660 to 750 nm.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, it is suggested in the Austrian Patent AT-270 288,
          to improve plant growth through the field of red light
          (600-700 nm) fluorescent dyes that are applied to suitable
          carriers.<br>
          <br>
          This is followed by the on off of EP-A-00 77 496 known method
          in which light of wavelength 470 to 600 nm is absorbed by
          means of fluorescent dyes and emits in the range of 600-700
          nm.<br>
          <br>
          These, from the prior art devices and methods, is based on the
          principle of action to stimulate the rate of photosynthesis
          chlorophyll plants by an extra supply of light of wavelength
          600-700 nm.<br>
          <br>
          In contrast, the invention proposes to stimulate the rate of
          photosynthesis plant chlorophyll by light starting from
          fluorescent substances having an absorption in the range of
          300-400 nm (near UV) and an emission in the range of 430 to
          470 nm.<br>
          As carrier material for the fluorescent substances, a
          transparent film is proposed.<br>
          <br>
          The invention thus relates to transparent film containing a
          fluorescent substance, characterized in that the fluorescent
          material absorbs light of wavelength of 300 to 400 nm and a
          wavelength range fluorescing from 430 to 470 nm and that the
          film the fluorescent substance in an amount such nm that is
          enhanced with natural light transmittance in the wavelength
          range of 430 to 470 to more than 10%.<br>
          <br>
          Fluorescent substances of the aforementioned type are known
          per se (described, for<br>
          , In "Fluorescent Whitening Agents", A. Müller, eds.<br>
          , Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1975) and used in numerous
          industrial areas for improving the color properties using.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention, those fluorescent substances are
          used, in the near UV range (300 to 400 nm) absorption and thus
          received excitation energy in the range of 430 to 470 nm,
          preferably 430 to 450 or 450-470, especially 440-460,
          especially in the range 445-460 nm emit.<br>
          <br>
          By applying the fluorescent substance on a transparent film,
          the transmission of daylight in the aforementioned areas by at
          least 10%, depending on the optical quality of the film, the
          amount of fluorescent material and its quantum yield, the
          relation and the light amount of UV light of wavelength
          300-400 nm and the light quantity of the incident light onto
          the film in the aforementioned intervals within 430 to 470 nm,
          a gain by fluorescence of more than 20, 50 or even 100% is
          achieved.<br>
          <br>
          As a reinforcement of the transmission through the
          fluorescence is understood with simultaneous irradiation with
          UV light in the range of 300 to 400 nm measured increase in
          the amount of light in each specified area on the fluorescence
          of the light source side facing away from the film.<br>
          <br>
          Daylight source is the overcast sky or the radiation matched
          the overcast sky artificial light source.<br>
          <br>
          Routinely, the spectral composition of daylight in the
          measuring apparatus by means of a standardized simulated
          daylight source D65 (A. Brocker in "Fluorescent Whitening
          Agents", Thieme 1975, p 23).<br>
          <br>
          Transparent films are films with a light transmission of over
          70%, preferably over 90% in the range of 400 to 700 nm<br>
          In an especially advantageous manner are suitable transparent
          film with a light transmission maximum in the range of 400-500
          nm and 600-700 nm<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention can in principle each slide using
          the aforementioned criteria to find the light transmittances
          met.<br>
          In particular, films made from the following classes of
          polymers are suitable: polyester, polyvinyl chloride,
          polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamides,
          polystyrene, polyacrylates, regenerated cellulose, such as
          cellophane ™ or polyacetates.<br>
          <br>
          As fluorescent substances are in principle all substances
          which absorb at 300-400 nm and whose emission maximum in the
          range of 430-470 nm, suitable.<br>
          In addition, preferred are those substances which are in the
          respective selected polymer material molecularly dispersible.<br>

          According to the invention usable fluorescent substances may
          be applied by known methods to the serving as a carrier
          transparent film.<br>
          <br>
          Must be ensured in the selection of appropriate procedures,
          that the fluorescent material primarily on the transparent
          substrate in a molecular dispersed distribution (dissolved) is
          present.<br>
          <br>
          A particularly suitable method may be mentioned, for small and
          medium-sized batches: the transfer printing, dipping and
          coating processes for medium and large batches: the
          incorporation of the fluorescent substance in the polymer as
          well as diving and painting activities.<br>
          <br>
          When transferring pressure from the fluorescent material is a
          first - given support material - usually made of cotton or
          tissue paper existing one.<br>
          <br>
          The printable transparent film is then brought into close
          contact with the carrier material.<br>
          <br>
          The excretion of the fluorescent substance in the film is
          then, as usual, at transfer pressure, effected by heating
          under contact.<br>
          <br>
          Many polymers swell under the action of suitable solvents and
          can take up dissolved in the solvent substances that remain
          then distributed by removing the solvent in the polymer
          molecularly.<br>
          <br>
          By means of this effect can be the fluorescent materials by
          dip-coating process and solvent baths with solvents or with
          molecularly incorporated into the film transparende.<br>
          <br>
          In a particularly advantageous manner, the fluorescent
          substance to be incorporated before the film production and as
          an additive in the polymer material.<br>
          In this case, both the fluorescent agent may be incorporated
          by melting or mixing in the production of film serving
          granules or it is added during film extrusion in a
          conventional manner as other additives and thus dissolved in
          the melt of the polymer.<br>
          <br>
          Also, the fluorescent substances are added at the stage of
          polymerization or polycondensation.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the polymeric support material in which they are
          contained, the emission maxima of the fluorescent substances
          vary within certain limits.<br>
          <br>
          Are particularly suitable for polyester compounds 1, 2, 6, 7
          and 9 to 14<br>
          Polyamides are particularly suitable for compounds 8 and 10<br>
          The compounds 3, 4 and 6 are preferably polyvinyl chloride or
          polyolefins.<br>
          Compound 5 is particularly suitable for regenerated cellulose.<br>
          <br>
          The transparent sheets can contain not only the registration
          according to still another fluorescent materials commonly used
          in film production assistants and additives such as
          plasticizers, stabilizers, supporting tissue, hardeners, etc.
          to a limited extent, UV-absorbers.<br>
          <br>
          The concentration of fluorescent substances in the film is
          determined by the respective desired reinforcing effect and
          can be determined by simple preliminary tests.<br>
          <br>
          In general, the fluorescent agent is present in concentrations
          of 0.01 to 1% distributed in molecularly disperse before
          serving as carrier material film.<br>
          <br>
          The principle underlying the invention can be used as a light
          amplification in the range of 430 nm understood to 470.<br>
          <br>
          In this range the short-wavelength absorption maximum of
          chlorophyll.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the inventive films can be found to stimulate the
          rate of photosynthesis chlorophyll cell systems used.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to land-based plants can especially in aqueous
          medium living cell systems, such as algae, are advantageously
          affected by the application according to transparent film in
          its growth.<br>
          <br>
          The inventive films are particularly suitable for use in
          agriculture, horticulture or fruit.<br>
          <br>
          The application according to the foils are attached in a known
          manner between the plants and the light source, usually
          daylight so that the largest part of the incident on the plant
          light passes through the film and into the type described
          above by means of fluorescence in the 430 470 nm is amplified.<br>
          <br>
          In practical application, the films can therefore over the
          seed-containing soil or on the plant or placed by means of
          suitable constructions in a conventional manner used as plant
          tunnel or greenhouse covers are.<br>
          <br>
          The inventive films are particularly suitable for the limited
          light availability, especially on cloudy days to improve by
          fluorescence light: depending on the particular plant variety,
          a certain amount of light are assumed to be the lowest
          threshold, below which the rate of photosynthesis of the plant
          or the chlorophyll-containing cell is no longer sufficient to
          the plant or the cell alive.<br>
          <br>
          Due to an orienting test (Example 2b), this value in the range
          of about 1000 mu W cm &lt;-2&gt; for watercress are accepted
          as a test plant.<br>
          <br>
          Measurements of the intensity of daylight under overcast skies
          (Example 2c) show that under the conditions occurring in
          temperate latitudes often a covered sky the limit is already
          reached.<br>
          <br>
          By fluorescence light can offer for the plant usable in the
          range of 430-470 nm can be increased to such a degree that the
          light intensity does not drop below the critical level for
          plant growth.<br>

          Example 2a: Normalization of daylight lamp<br>
          <br>
          As a daily source of light a 100-W light bulb-type plants
          Ormalight is used.<br>
          Which is in the range 25 to 150 cm measured light energy in
          Table II:<br>

          Example 2b: Determination of the limiting light offer<br>
          <br>
          In a darkened chamber in pots sown seeds of watercress
          illuminated with a daylight lamp in accordance with Example 2
          in 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 cm from the top.<br>
          After 4 weeks the condition of the plants is evaluated.<br>
          The illuminated from 25 to 50 cm from plants develop normally,
          while the dead are from 75, 100, 125 and 150 cm illuminated
          plants.<br>
          <br>
          Example 2c: Determination of the amount of daylight in heavily
          overcast sky<br>
          <br>
          On 4<br>
          June 1984 at 9.00 shall be measured with a UDT Radiometer 140
          X in Basel / Switzerland, the amount of light, such as: total
          light (300-700 nm): 1200 mu W cm &lt;-2&gt; UV portion
          (300-400 nm): 120 mu W cm &lt;-2&gt; proportion of visible
          (400-700 nm): about 1080 mu W cm &lt;-2&gt;<br>
          <br>
          Example 2d: Plant growth with insufficient daylight and
          additional fluorescent light<br>
          Daylight source: lamp according to Example 2a UV light source:
          UV lamps from Camag (Catalog No. 29 230) with an emission
          maximum at 366 nm<br>
          <br>
          UV filter: To ensure that no visible light is guided by the UV
          sources of the experimental arrangement, the outlet openings
          with UV filters type UV-11 (transmission range 250-400 nm) and
          the Schott Schleifer covered.<br>
          Investigated films: film A Melinex polyester film type = 0,
          manufacturer ICI, film thickness 75 mu.<br>
          Film B = film according to Example 1, containing 0.1% of
          compound 2 foil C = film according to Example 1, containing
          0.1% of compound 12 film D = Film according to Example 1,
          containing 0.1% of compound 13<br>
          <br>
          The seeds sown in pots of watercress in a dark room between
          two sides established UV light sources, which are coated with
          transparent fluorescent films prepared, and their growth with
          a blank sample (film A) were compared.<br>
          The entire experimental arrangement is from the top of the
          distance 75 cm irradiated with a daylight lamp in Example 2a.<br>
          The growth of test plants will be evaluated weekly.<br>
          <br>
          The irradiated through the films B, C and D watercress
          developing normally, with a strong preference for the lateral
          growth direction to the UV light sources is observed for.<br>
          Apart from the plants develop up to the 9th<br>
          Week in which the experiment was terminated normally.<br>
          The irradiated film A by water cress sprouts initially grow
          normally and straight up.<br>
          In the second week, shows a strong "fear growth."<br>
          In the third week the plants begin to wither and die off in
          the fourth week.<br>
