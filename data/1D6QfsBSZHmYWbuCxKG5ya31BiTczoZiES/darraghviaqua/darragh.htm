      &nbsp;Using a radio frequency wave of 27 MHz Vi-Aqua transmits a
      safe electrical energy into water which enhances the performance
      of nutrient uptake.<br>
      <br>
      In most cases it stimulates photosynthesis converting those
      essential nutrients into energy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Vi-Aqua works by altering the configuration of hydrogen in water.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It influences the critical structure of hydrogen in suspension by
      producing greater availability of Oxides, Peroxides, and
      Super-oxides.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Further to this process Vi-Aqua reduces the surface tension&nbsp;
      of water producing more available solute in solution which in turn
      makes nutrients more presentable to plant life...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Vi-Aqua system works by altering the natural surface charge of
      suspended particles and acts to modify the Zeta Potential. The
      negative charge, induced by the applied signal, enhances the
      stability of the suspension by means of increases electrostatic
      repulsion between particles. This is due to the resultant double
      layer of ions that surround particles and vessel/pipe surfaces
      which are in contact with water.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The modified Zeta Potential facilitates improved hydration of
      solids and reduced surface tension, thus creating the benefits
      that will be seen in your crop.<br>

            Electromagnetic Energy Into A Solution</b><br>
          <b>US2011268614 </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a delivery apparatus for
      delivering electromagnetic energy into a solution. The delivery
      apparatus comprises a coil means arranged within an outer housing
      for delivering a magnetic field into the solution, a voltage
      assembly means coupled to the coil means for delivering an
      electric field into the solution, and connection means for
      delivering an electromagnetic signal to the coil from
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry contained within the
      housing. The arrangement of the present invention confers
      significant physical stability on the delivery apparatus and
      ensures that heat generated by heat generating components of the
      apparatus is conducted away from the electromagnetic signal
      generation circuitry so that the apparatus can be operated
      continuously.<br>
      <br>
      001] The present invention relates to an apparatus for delivering
      electromagnetic energy into a solution to modify characteristics
      of the solution, particularly, the Zeta potential of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] It is known that the delivery of electromagnetic energy
      (such as radio frequency (RF) modulated energy) into a solution
      can be used to modify characteristics of the solution, such as the
      Zeta potential. The delivery of RF modulated energy into a
      solution is typically carried out by placing a delivery apparatus,
      which is driven by an RF energy source to generate magnetic and
      electric field energy, suitably near or in the solution. The
      characteristics of the solution are altered according to the
      amplitude of and the length of time that the RF modulated energy
      is delivered into the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] WO-A-9622831 discloses one such apparatus for delivering
      electromagnetic energy into a solution. Preferred embodiments of
      delivery apparatus disclosed in this document comprise a tubular
      housing having closed ends forming a water tight chamber, a coil
      contained within the chamber delivering a magnetic field into a
      solution, at least one electric field probe coupled to the coil
      for delivering an electric field into the solution and coupling
      means for coupling an electromagnetic signal to the coil. Although
      this apparatus is useful, it suffers from a number of drawbacks,
      including that the arrangement disclosed generates significant
      heat which interferes with the frequency and amplitude of the
      signal generated and causes it to fluctuate about the preferred
      optimal radio frequency energy level. In an attempt to control the
      level of undesirable heat dissipation the unit operates
      intermittently and thereby defines a duty cycle. Furthermore,
      on-off control of the delivery apparatus disclosed in WO-A-9622831
      requires a user to be physically present at the apparatus so as to
      manually operate a switch, which is disadvantageous. Additionally,
      the tubular housing is permanently sealed so that the internal
      components, such as the coil, the probes and the like, are unable
      to be accessed without first breaking the sealed tubular housing.
      Accordingly, should the unit breakdown and/or require maintenance
      it is necessary to break the outer housing in order to access the
      internal components and then apply a new outer housing to the
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      delivery apparatus which goes at least some way toward overcoming
      the above problems and/or which will provide the public and/or
      industry with a useful alternative.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] It is acknowledged that the term 'comprise' may, under
      varying jurisdictions be provided with either an exclusive or
      inclusive meaning. For the purpose of this specification, and
      unless otherwise noted explicitly, the term comprise shall have an
      inclusive meaning-i.e. that it may be taken to mean an inclusion
      of not only the listed components it directly references, but also
      other non-specified components. Accordingly, the term 'comprise'
      is to be attributed with as broader interpretation as possible
      within any given jurisdiction and this rationale should also be
      used when the terms 'comprised' and/or 'comprising' are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Further aspects of the present invention will become
      apparent form the ensuing description which is given by way of
      example only.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to the invention, there is provided a delivery
      apparatus for delivering electromagnetic energy into a solution,
      the delivery apparatus comprising:<br>
      <br>
      an outer housing;<br>
      a coil means arranged within the housing for delivering a magnetic
      field into the solution;<br>
      voltage assembly means coupled to the coil means for delivering an
      electric field into the solution;<br>
      connection means for delivering an electromagnetic signal to the
      coil from electromagnetic signal generation circuitry contained
      within the housing;<br>
      characterised in that the delivery apparatus further comprises
      heat conducting means arranged within the housing to conduct heat
      generated by heat generating components of the electromagnetic
      signal generation circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention encapsulates all of the components of
      the apparatus within the housing and this arrangement confers
      significant physical stability on the delivery apparatus. The
      provision of heat conducting means within the housing will ensure
      that heat generated by heat generating components of the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry, such as one or more
      FET transistors, will be conducted away to thereby significantly
      reduce overheating of the apparatus and minimise the level of
      undesirable heat dissipation. As a result, the present invention
      does not need to be operated intermittently in order to control
      the level of heat dissipation to maintain a constant frequency and
      amplitude of the signal generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another embodiment of the invention, the heat conducting
      means at least partially encloses the electromagnetic signal
      generation circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Preferably, the heat generating components of the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry are in contact with
      the heat conducting means.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus
      further comprises shielding means arranged within the housing to
      at least partially enclose the coil means so as to shield the coil
      means from electrostatic fields. The provision of such shielding
      means within the housing provides the desired electrostatic
      shielding whilst still allowing the electromagnetic field
      generated by the coil means to be delivered into the solution in
      order to affect the zeta potential of the solution in the desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In another embodiment of the invention, the shielding means
      and heat conducting means are integrally formed. In another
      embodiment of the invention, the shielding means and heat
      conducting means are fully enclosed within the housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In another embodiment of the invention, the heat conducting
      means and shielding means are integrally formed as a sleeve.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In another embodiment of the invention, the sleeve is
      fabricated from copper or aluminium or a metal alloy. It is of
      course understood that the metal sleeve can be made from any
      suitable metallic material or alloy known to the person skilled in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In another embodiment of the invention, a mounting plate is
      arranged within the sleeve.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate
      is integral with the sleeve and fabricated from the same material
      as the sleeve.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In another embodiment of the invention, the coil means is
      arranged on a heat resistant plate located on one side of the
      mounting plate, and the electromagnetic signal generation
      circuitry is arranged on a spacer plate on another side of the
      mounting plate so that the heat generating components of the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry are maintained in
      contact with the mounting plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In this embodiment, the sleeve thus acts as a heat sink,
      drawing heat away from the circuitry. Use of the spacer plate
      ensures the circuitry, which is provided as a PCB board, is
      prevented from shorting against the mounting plate. In such an
      embodiment the PCB board is fully contained, isolated and
      insulated from the copper plate and coil with the exception of the
      heat generating components which are connected to the copper plate
      to provide heat sink for these components and the PCB which is
      connected to the coil via hexagonal standoffs for delivery of the
      signal generated by the circuitry of a frequency of 27.225 MHz to
      the coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In another embodiment of the invention, the housing
      comprises a releasable closure or lid. Accordingly, the internal
      components in the housing, such as the coil, the circuitry and the
      like, are able to be accessed by simply removing the closure. If
      the unit breaks down and/or requires maintenance access can be
      easily gained. In the event that the internal components are
      damaged, then the housing and closure can also be recycled for use
      again.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In another embodiment of the invention, the housing and
      closure are fabricated from a non-conductive material, such as
      polyvinylchloride (PVC).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In another embodiment of the invention, the coil means is a
      conductive helical coil having a plurality of rungs, whereby the
      helical coil extends around a central support core which extends
      from the heat resistant plate. Optionally, the coil is fabricated
      from silver coated refrigeration tubing.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In another embodiment of the invention, the central support
      core is a tube mounting a plurality of coil support fins, each fin
      having a plurality of slots or grooves profiled to hold
      substantially rigidly at least some of the rungs of the coil. This
      ensures that the delivery apparatus has the required level of
      shock resistance necessary to ensure that the apparatus is not
      damaged as a result of solution turbulence, such as when the
      apparatus is positioned at or near a water inlet or bubbling area
      in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Preferably, each fin extends radially from the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Advantageously, the electromagnetic signal delivered from
      the electromagnetic signal generation means is delivered as a
      constant un-pulsed signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Preferably, the frequency of the electromagnetic signal
      delivered from the electromagnetic signal generation means is
      27.225 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In another embodiment of the invention, the voltage
      assembly means comprises a central voltage probe, a fluid chamber
      surrounding the probe and a non-conductive hollow outer housing.
      Preferably, the fluid in the probe is de-ionised water.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In another embodiment of the invention, the voltage
      assembly means is mounted via a conductive stand-off on a support
      rod which extends through the central support core.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In another embodiment of the invention, the conductive
      stand-off is screw threaded for engaging with a complimentary
      screw thread on the voltage probe. In this way the voltage
      assembly means is able to be securely mounted onto the stand-off
      so as to eliminate fluid leakage from the fluid filled probe.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In another embodiment of the invention, the delivery
      apparatus further comprises a feedback voltage aerial adapted to
      pick up a signal at the voltage assembly means and covert it to a
      feedback voltage which is transmitted to control circuitry of the
      delivery apparatus. Preferably, the control circuit is housed in a
      control panel unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Preferably, the feedback voltage aerial extends from the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry through the mounting
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In another embodiment of the invention, the control
      circuitry comprises a plurality of alarms which signal audibly
      and/or visibly when the feedback voltage is not within a
      predefined range.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In another embodiment of the invention, the control
      circuitry is coupled to telemetry means for transmitting data
      relating to operating parameters associated with the delivery
      apparatus, such as a malfunction of the delivery apparatus and/or
      whether the delivery apparatus is powered on and off.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In another embodiment of the invention, the data is
      transmitted to a mobile transceiver device as a text message. Such
      text messages serve to alert an operative to various operating
      parameters associated with the delivery apparatus and/or a
      malfunction of the delivery apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In another embodiment of the invention, the telemetry means
      is operative to control switching means in the control circuitry
      to control the on and off functioning of the delivery apparatus,
      whereby the delivery apparatus is adapted to be switched on and
      off by transmitting an electronic signal, such as a text message,
      to the telemetry means. In such an embodiment, an operative is
      able to switch the delivery apparatus on or off by sending a text
      message or other electronic signal to the telemetry means.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The control circuit also includes a plurality of LED's
      which are positioned on a control panel unit for visually
      displaying various operating parameters associated with the
      delivery apparatus, including a malfunction and/or whether the
      apparatus is on or off.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus
      further comprises means enabling the location of the delivery
      apparatus to be determined. Preferably, the control means further
      comprises GSM technology to enable the location of the delivery
      apparatus to be determined by a remote monitoring means.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus is at
      least partially submerged in the solution to deliver the magnetic
      field and the electric field into the solution. Alternatively, the
      apparatus may be fully submerged in the solution to deliver the
      magnetic field and the electric field into the solution.
      Preferably, the solution is water.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Preferably, the telemetry means is coupled with battery
      powered back up.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In another embodiment of the invention, electrical mains
      power powers the control circuit.<br>
      <br>

      [0055] With reference to the diagrams, and initially to FIG. 1,
      there is shown a system 100 for delivering electromagnetic energy
      into a solution 102 using a delivery apparatus 104. The system 100
      comprises transmission means in the form of cable 106 for
      delivering an electrical signal from a control circuit (see FIG.
      7) housed in a control panel 108 to electromagnetic signal
      generation circuitry (see FIG. 4d) contained in the delivery
      apparatus 104. Electrical mains power is supplied from mains
      socket 110 via power cable 107 to the control circuit. The
      delivery apparatus 104 is driven by 24V DC power. The
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry in the delivery
      apparatus 104 is configured to use electrical power transmitted
      from the control circuit to generate an electromagnetic signal
      able to be used by the delivery apparatus 104 for generating an
      magnetic field and an electric field for delivery into the
      solution 102. Characteristics of the solution 102, such as its
      zeta potential, may thus be modified by exposing the solution to
      the magnetic field and electric field generated. The frequency of
      the electromagnetic signal delivered from the electromagnetic
      signal generation means is approximately 27.225 MHz, and the
      electromagnetic signal delivered is a constant signal (that is, it
      is an un-pulsed signal).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIGS. 2a to 2d show a housing 112 configured for the
      delivery apparatus 104 of FIG. 1. The housing 112 comprises a base
      114 and a side wall 116 upstanding on the base 114. Also shown is
      a closure or lid 118 which is adapted to engage with the side wall
      116 to close the housing 112. The housing 112 is fabricated from a
      non-conductive material, such as polyvinylchloride (PVC). The
      closure 118 is manufactured from conductive material (for example,
      stainless steel), but it may alternatively be fabricated from a
      non-conductive material, such as PVC. In the instance shown, the
      cable 106 (see FIG. 1) for delivering electrical power from the
      control circuit (not shown) in the control panel 108 passes
      through holes 117 in the closure 118 and is coupled to the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry (see FIG. 4d) in the
      delivery apparatus 104. The cable 106 is secured in the holes 117
      by means of grommets or other suitable fasteners to provide a
      water tight seal. The internal components in the housing 112 are
      therefore able to be accessed by removing the closure 118. If the
      delivery apparatus 104 breaks down and/or requires maintenance
      access can thus be easily gained once the closure 118 has been
      removed. In the event that the internal components in the delivery
      apparatus 104 are damaged, then the housing 112 and closure 118
      can be reused.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIGS. 3a to 3c show the coil means 120, which in use, is
      arranged within the housing 112 for delivering a magnetic field
      into the solution 102. In the instance shown, the coil means 120
      is a helical resonator coil 124 having a plurality of rungs 125.
      The coil 124 may be fabricated from a variety of suitable
      materials, such as silver coated refrigeration tubing. Also shown
      is a connection means 122 for coupling the coil 124 to
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry so that an
      electromagnetic signal generated by the electromagnetic signal
      generation circuitry can delivered to the coil 124. Also shown is
      a voltage assembly means 126 (water module) which is arranged
      within the housing 112. The voltage assembly means 126 is mounted
      via a conductive stand-off 127 on a support core which is coupled
      to and extends through the coil 124 to provide a conductive path
      from the coil 124 to the voltage assembly means 126.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] With reference to FIGS. 4a to 4c, the voltage assembly
      means 126 (water module) comprises a central voltage probe 150,
      which in the instance shown is provided as a gold plated brass
      ball, a fluid chamber 152 surrounding the probe 150 and a
      non-conductive hollow outer housing 154. The fluid in the chamber
      152 is preferably de-ionised water. The conductive stand-off 127
      is screw threaded for engaging with a complimentary screw thread
      on coupling means of the voltage assembly means 126. In this way,
      the voltage assembly means 126 is able to be securely mounted onto
      the stand-off 127 so as to eliminate fluid leakage from the fluid
      containing voltage assembly means 126.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] With reference to FIGS. 4d to 4e and FIG. 5, the delivery
      apparatus further comprises electromagnetic signal generation
      circuitry, provided on a PCB circuit board 170 for generating an
      electromagnetic signal suitable for onward transmission to the
      coil 124 for generating a magnetic field and an electric field for
      delivery into the solution. It will be understood that mounted on
      the PCB board will be various heat generating components, such as
      FET transistors. The frequency of the electromagnetic signal
      delivered to the coil means 124 is 27.225 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As shown, the delivery apparatus 104 comprises a heat
      conducting means 130, 138 arranged within the housing 112 to
      conduct heat generated by those heat generating components, such
      as FET transistor 171, of the electromagnetic signal generation
      circuitry. The heat conducting means 130, 138 at least partially
      encloses the electromagnetic signal generation circuitry 170. The
      heat generating components of the electromagnetic signal
      generation circuitry 170, such as FET transistor 171, are placed
      in contact with the heat conducting means 138. This arrangement
      ensures that the heat conducting means 138 will act as a heat sink
      so that heat generated by the apparatus will be conducted away
      from the PCB board to thereby significantly reduce overheating of
      the apparatus and minimise the level of undesirable heat
      dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The heat conducting means 130 also acts as a shielding
      means, which is also indicated by the reference numeral 130,
      arranged within the housing to at least partially enclose the coil
      means 124 so as to shield the coil means 124 from electrostatic
      fields. The shielding means 130 contains the electric field along
      the full length of the coil 124.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In the instance shown, the heat conducting means and
      shielding means are integrally configured as a tubular metal
      sleeve which is fully enclosed within the housing 112. The metal
      sleeve 130 may be fabricated from copper or alternatively, from
      aluminium. It is of course understood that the metal sleeve 130
      may be made from any suitable metallic material or alloy known to
      a person skilled in the art. A mounting plate 138 of the heat
      conducting means is included in the sleeve 130 intermediate the
      sleeves' ends. The mounting plate 138 is fabricated from the same
      material as the sleeve 130. The mounting plate 138 is also
      optionally formed integrally with the sleeve 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The coil means 124 is arranged on a heat resistant plate
      132 which is positioned on one side of the mounting plate 138, and
      the electromagnetic signal generation circuitry 170 is arranged on
      a spacer plate 172 on the other side of the mounting plate 138. In
      the instance shown, the heat generating components 171 of the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry 170 extend through
      holes 173 of the spacer plate 172 so as to be placed in contact
      with the mounting plate 138 which thus acts as a heat sink,
      drawing heat away from the circuitry 170. Use of the spacer plate
      172 prevents the circuitry 170 shorting against the mounting plate
      138. The mounting plate 138 together with the sleeve 130 act as
      heat conducting means and together with the coil 124 are removable
      from the housing 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As shown, connection means 122 extends from the coil 124
      through the heat resistant plate 132 and the spacer plate 172 to
      couple the coil 124 to electromagnetic signal generation circuitry
      170. In this way an electromagnetic signal of a desired frequency,
      specifically 27.225 MHz, can be generated by the electromagnetic
      signal generation circuitry 170 and delivered to the coil 124. In
      such an embodiment the PCB board 170 is fully contained, isolated
      and insulated from the copper plate 138 and coil 124 with the
      exception of the heat generating components 171 which are
      connected to the copper plate 138 to provide heat sink for these
      components and the PCB 170 which is connected to the coil 124 via
      hexagonal standoffs (See FIG. 3c labelled as 122) for delivery of
      the signal generated by the circuitry 170 of a frequency of 27.225
      MHz to the coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The helical coil 124 winds around a central support core,
      indicated generally by the reference numeral 140 which extends
      through the heat resistant plate 132 and sits on the mounting
      plate 138. The central support core 140 comprises a tube 142
      having a plurality of slits, each slit for locating a radially
      extending coil support fin 144 (see FIG. 6). Each fin 144
      comprises a plurality of slots or grooves 146 which are profiled
      to hold substantially rigidly at least some or all of the rungs of
      the coil 124. An end 147 of the fin 144 is thus adapted to
      securely fit and engage with the tube 142. In the instance shown,
      the central support core 140 comprises three fins 144, although it
      will be understood that the core 140 may be adapted to include any
      number of fins 144 as desired or as required.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The delivery apparatus also comprises a feedback voltage
      aerial 180 which extends from the circuit board 170 mounting the
      electromagnetic signal generation circuitry. The aerial 180
      extends through the spacer plate 172 and the mounting plate 138
      and is arranged to pick up the signal at the voltage assembly
      means (water module) 126 and covert it to a feedback voltage which
      is transmitted to control circuitry (see FIG. 7) in the control
      panel 108. The board 170 and spacer plate 172 are assembled in the
      direction of the arrows marked A.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] With reference to FIG. 7, there is shown control circuitry
      200 for driving electromagnetic signal generation circuitry
      mounted in the delivery apparatus Transmission means in the form
      of cable 106 for delivering an electrical signal from the control
      circuit 200 to the electromagnetic signal generation circuitry
      (not shown) contained in the delivery apparatus 104 is also shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The control circuit 200 comprises a plurality of alarms, in
      the form of LED's 202, 204, 206, 208, 210 which illuminate on the
      control panel 108 to signal various operational aspects and
      warnings concerning the delivery apparatus. For example, when the
      feedback voltage is outside a predefined range, such as below a
      pre-determined value (1V), this is indicative of a fault or
      malfunction of the delivery apparatus. In response to this the
      control circuit 200 activates the LED 206. The control circuit 200
      is coupled with telemetry means, the connections of which are
      indicated generally in FIG. 7 by the reference numeral 211. When
      LED 206 is on, then LED 208 is switched off and this is picked up
      on channel 212 and transmitted to connection A1 on the telemetry
      unit which is operative to transmit a text message to a mobile
      device to alert an operative to the malfunction. LED 210 is
      operative to indicate whether the control circuit is powered on or
      is switched off. The control circuit 200 may also be switched on
      and off remotely in order to thereby switch the delivery apparatus
      104 on and off. By turning off R1 on telemetry means the delivery
      apparatus 104 may be switched off. When the delivery apparatus 104
      is switched off, the LED 202 (orange light) is illuminated and LED
      204 is off. When the delivery apparatus 104 is switched on, LED
      204 (green light) is illuminated and LED 202 is off. R1 is thus a
      switch on the telemetry means that can optionally be turned on or
      off by sending a text from a mobile telephone, or other device
      with communications technology, to the telemetry means. Also shown
      in FIG. 7 is a pre-programmed chip 218 that processes the feedback
      voltage picked up by the feedback voltage aerial 180 in the
      delivery apparatus 104. The chip 218 computes whether the feedback
      voltage picked up by the aerial 180 is below a pre-determined
      voltage needed to be supplied by the delivery apparatus 104 to the
      solution 102. If the feedback voltage deviates from the
      predetermined voltage by more than 1V DC, this is indicative that
      a fault or malfunction has occurred with the delivery apparatus
      104. The chip 218 will then send an appropriate signal to trigger
      the LED 206 indicating such a fault.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 8 is a schematic of an alarm triggering board 219
      coupled to the control circuitry 200 shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 8
      illustrates the various alarms utilised by the control circuit
      200. In the instance shown, the alarm triggering board 219 is
      coupled to remote telemetry means which utilises GSM technology
      and communications means so that the various alarms 220, 222, 224
      when triggered may be signalled to users in the form of text
      messages. In particular, alarm channel 220 is adapted to transmit
      a signal to a user via text messaging that a power cut resulting
      in the loss of power to the delivery apparatus 104 has occurred.
      Accordingly, a user will be notified remotely by the telemetry
      means of such a fault. Similarly, alarm channel 222 is adapted to
      transmit a signal that the delivery apparatus 104 has been
      disconnected from the control panel 108. The telemetry means thus
      transmits this signal to a user's mobile telephone via a text
      message. Alarm channel 224 signals when mains power has been
      restored to the delivery apparatus 106 following earlier
      dislocation in power supply. The telemetry means is also coupled
      to a battery powered back up 226. Also shown are relay switches
      232, 234 which connect the alarm channels 220, 222, 224 to ground
      to thereby facilitate triggering of the alarms when required for
      the telemetry means. A DC power converter 236 is also provided for
      converting the 24V DC power supplied to the delivery apparatus 106
      from the mains power to the 12V required for the telemetry means.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The telemetry means comprises means for controlling
      switching means in the control circuit operable to control the on
      and off functioning of the delivery apparatus 104. In this way a
      user is able to switch the delivery apparatus 104 on or off by
      sending a text message or other electronic signal to the telemetry
      means. The GSM technology further enables the location of the
      delivery apparatus 104 to be determined. FIG. 9 is a PCB board
      corresponding to the schematic in FIG. 8. Shown on the PCB board
      are mounting holes 230 to enable the board to be secured inside
      the control panel 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Aspects of the present invention have been described by way
      of example only and it should be appreciate that additions and/or
      modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope

      [0022] Referring to the drawings and initially to FIG. 1, the
      first embodiment 10 of apparatus for delivering electromagnet
      energy into a solution comprises a 9V mains adapter 11, an
      oscillator crystal 12, a buffer chip 13 and an antenna 14. A Zener
      diode 15 allows only 5.1 volts to pass through as the oscillator
      crystal 12 only requires a supply voltage of 5 volts+-0.1 volts.
      The oscillator crystal is the main component of the apparatus and
      in this particular embodiment outputs a radio frequency signal of
      20 MHz which is sent through the buffer chip 13 to the antenna 14.
      Similar components in the other embodiments are given similar
      numbers as in the first embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The second embodiment 20 is similar to the first
      embodiment, except that it includes a rechargeable battery 21 as
      well as the 9V mains adapter 11. Battery 21 acts as a backup power
      source. It also includes a switch 23 and a light emitting diode
      (LED) 24 which emits light when the switch 23 is closed and the
      unit is operating.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The third embodiment 30 is similar to the second embodiment
      20 but includes a separate LED 35 which is used to indicate that
      the unit is being powered by a mains adapter. The LED 35 emits a
      red light to distinguish it from the LED 24 which emits a green
      light.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The fourth embodiment 40 includes a 9V mains adapter power
      supply 11, an LED 24 for indicating power on and a switch 23 for
      operating the unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The fifth embodiment 50 is similar to the first embodiment
      10 and includes a power on light LED 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The sixth embodiment 60 is similar to the second embodiment
      20 but includes a mains adapter 61 which gives a 12V DC supply of
      700 mA. It has a power supply socket (not shown) which accepts a
      jack plug from the adapter. The circuit also includes two diodes
      63 and 64 which only allow current to flow in the direction which
      it is pointed. Diode 63 enables the battery 21 to drive the main
      circuit when the mains adapter 61 is not charging or plugged into
      the apparatus. Diode 63 also protects the battery from being
      improperly charged when adapter 61 is plugged in and opening the
      circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The seventh embodiment 70 shown in FIG. 7 includes the
      majority of the components used in the first six embodiments,
      namely a rechargeable battery 21, a crystal oscillator 12, a
      buffer chip 13, an antenna 14, a switch 23, an LED 24, an LED 35,
      a mains adapter 61, 3 diodes 63, 63(a) and a diode 64. Diode 63(a)
      only allows LED 35 to illuminate when the mains adapter 61 is
      plugged into the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The eighth embodiment 80 shown in FIG. 8 is similar to the
      seventh embodiment 70 except that it has an output modified by
      filter circuit 85 to reduce secondary and tertiary harmonics so as
      to reduce interference with other wavelengths and keep the output
      frequency to a constant value which in the eighth embodiment in
      the range 27.225 MHz to 27.255 MHz. The filter circuit 85 includes
      three capacitors 86 and three impedances 87.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The ninth embodiment 90 shown in FIG. 9 is also similar to
      the seventh embodiment 70 except that it has a generator 95 for
      generating a DC supply from the flow of water which is used to
      recharge battery 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In relation to all of the above embodiments, the antenna 14
      is an elongate wire which in the particular embodiments used us
      0.889 m in length which approximates to {fraction (1/16)} of the
      particular wavelength of the RF signal generated by the crystal
      oscillator 12. In a modification (not shown) the antenna has a
      brass ball on the end of it with a cover.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The apparatus according to the invention has numerous
      applications; it can be used to treat water used to irrigate
      plants and flowers. The antenna can extend along the inside of a
      hosepipe used to supply water to the plants. It can be
      demonstrated that it enhances plant growth by achieving higher
      yields of fruit, vegetables, plants, flowers, shrubs, trees and
      other plant life. The apparatus can also be used to treat water
      used in domestic applications, it helps prevent or eliminate
      scaling in kettles, coffee making machines, taps, faucets and
      showerheads.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] It will of course be understand that the invention is not
      limited to the specific details described herein, which are given
      by way of example only and that various modifications and
      alterations may be made without departing from the scope of the
      invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
