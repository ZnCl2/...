      SmeshGear is an high speedshift gearbox that shifts gear under
      full load, without loss of energy<br>
      <br>
      SmeshGear is a basic transmission that is compact, fast, and
      shiftable under full-load . Changing gears takes less than
      0.001157 seconds with continuous output power! SmeshGear operates
      practically shock-free.<br>
      <br>
      SmeshGear provides a selectable, additional (higher or lower)
      speed-ratio on a rotating shaft. The original performance remains
      what it was, virtually 100%. The additional speed-ratio has yields
      greater than 98%.<br>
      <br>
      It makes no difference whether the direction of rotation is left,
      right, or variable.<br>
      <br>
      No matter where the power comes from, where it goes, or even if it
      varies: SmeshGear processes it flawlessly.<br>
      <br>
      SmeshGear is patented worldwide. A gearbox that combines the many
      benefits of existing transmissions, without the disadvantages!
      Fail-safe and well proven.<br>
      <br>
      With the same (electric) motor: SmeshGear provides these
      advantages:<br>
      <br>
      • A much wider range of speeds<br>
      <br>
      • Less energy is used, enhancing the range and/or top speed.
      Mechanical translation keeps the motor operating in the optimal
      speed range.<br>
      <br>
      • An up to seven times higher starting torque possible.<br>
      <br>
      • The rpm range is much larger. The motor remains in its ideal rpm
      range.<br>
      <br>
      • An up to seven times higher breakout force is possible.<br>
      <br>
      • It can provide rapid movement in some applications (e.g. it can
      quickly raise and lower a crane, when it is not loaded, saving
      time!)<br>
      <br>
      • SmeshGear can function as a gear coupling, i.e. start/run
      without load. With the same total performance SmeshGear permits:<br>
      <br>
      • An up to 40% smaller electric motor<br>
      <br>
      • An up to 40% greater range, due to higher electrical efficiency<br>
      <br>
      • A much smaller electrical and electronic infrastructure<br>
      <br>
      • Smaller change, start-up and operational currents, as well as
      higher machine efficiency, especially for operations with many
      starts and stops<br>
      <br>
      • An electric motor to maintain its power band at high speed.
      Yield increases of 25% and more are easily possible for SmeshGear<br>

      </b>Inventor(s): LAUWERS LEONARDUS / GIJSBERTUS CORNELIS<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Also published as: WO2009145616 // NL2001629 // JP5539334<br>
      <br>
      A transmission has a housing and two input/output shafts. Inside
      the housing is a planetary gear set with three rotatable members
      which are connected to the housing and the two input/output
      shafts. Inside the housing is a clutch which can connect two out
      of three of the rotatable members. When the clutch is closed the
      input/output shafts are connected together one to one. The
      pressure plate of the clutch is connected to a brake disc of a
      brake system that is connected to one of the rotatable members.
      When the brake system is closed the input/output shafts are
      connected via the planetary gear set. The transmission further
      includes a lever which can move the brake disc in axial direction
      and can thus open the clutch during operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to a transmission comprising a first
      input/output shaft, a second input/output shaft, a planetary gear
      set comprising three rotatable members of which a first rotatable
      member is connected to the first input/output shaft and a second
      rotatable member is connected to the second input/output shaft,
      which transmission further includes a clutch having a first clutch
      portion which is connected to one of the rotatable members, a
      second clutch portion which is connected to another one of the
      rotatable members and is axially movable relative to the first
      clutch portion, and an axially movable pressure plate, and which
      transmission includes a brake with a brake disc that is fixedly
      attached to the pressure plate and at least one brake pad fixedly
      connected to the firm object in the direction of rotation of the
      brake disc and movably connected to the firm object in axial
      direction of the brake disc, the brake disc being movably
      connected in axial direction to a third one of the rotatable
      members and being fixedly connected in the direction of rotation
      to a third one of the rotatable members.<br>
      <br>
      <b>STATE OF THE ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A transmission of this type is known from FR-A-1.134.821.
      This known transmission has a gear reduction between the two
      input/output shafts determined by the indirect couplingS if the
      brake is closed and a direct coupling between the two input/output
      shafts if the clutch is closed. When the brake is closed the
      clutch is opened at the same time, so that the two can never be
      closed together. The known transmission takes up relatively much
      space. In addition, with the known transmission it is impossible
      to switch during operation because then the transmission utilizes
      two gears and is consequently blocked.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] It is an object of the invention to provide a transmission
      of the type set out in the opening paragraph which is more compact
      than the known transmission. For this purpose the transmission
      according to the invention is characterised in that the
      transmission includes a housing in which the planetary gear set
      and the clutch are arranged while the third rotatable member is
      attached to the housing. As a result, a compact construction is
      obtained. Since the housing can be sealed in a simple manner by
      means of sealing rings between the input/output shafts and the
      housing, the planetary gear set can be lubricated in a simple
      manner and/or the clutch can be arranged as a wet plate clutch. In
      addition, the oil baths of various mutually coupled transmissions
      can be coupled to each other in a simple manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] An embodiment of the brake disc according to the invention
      is characterised in that the brake disc is situated at a distance
      from an axial side of the housing, while a brake disc side turned
      away from the housing forms a braking surface that cooperates with
      the brake pad and the other axial side of the housing forms a
      further braking surface, and the brake includes a further brake
      pad that cooperates with the further braking surface. In
      consequence, a robust construction of the brake is obtained that
      requires little additional space.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A further embodiment of the brake disc according to the
      invention is characterised in that the transmission comprises
      disengaging means which are capable of axially displacing the
      brake disc and thus pushing away the pressure plate of the clutch
      portions and opening up the clutch. As a result, the transmission
      can also be transited to a state where the two input/output shafts
      are disengaged.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Yet a further embodiment of the brake disc according to the
      invention is characterised in that the disengaging means comprise
      a lever that is rotatable around a pivot which is bearing-mounted
      on the housing, one end of which lever can be operated and the
      other end is bearing-mounted on the brake disc. As a result of
      this construction the two input/output shafts can be disengaged
      even during operation.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] FIG. 1 shows a sectional view of a first embodiment of the
      transmission according to the invention. The transmission 1
      comprises a housing 3 and two input/output shafts 5, 7, while in a
      bore in the first end of the first input/output shaft 5 is
      arranged a shaft head-end attached to the end of the second
      input/output shaft 7. Inside the housing 3 there is located a
      planetary gear set 9 having three rotatable members which are
      formed by a sun gear 11, a planet gear support 13 with planet
      gears 14 thereon, and an annulus gear 15. The sun gear 11 is
      connected to the first input/output shaft 5, the planet gear
      support 13 is connected to the second input/output shaft 7, and
      the annulus gear 15 is rigidly connected to the housing 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The housing further accommodates a clutch 17 of which a
      first clutch portion 19 is connected by means of the housing 3 to
      the annulus gear 15, and a second clutch portion 21 is connected
      by means of the second input/output shaft 7 to the planet gear
      support 13. The first clutch portion 19 is constituted by a wheel
      attached to the housing and a further wheel axially movable
      relative to the housing and fixed to the housing in the direction
      of rotation. The second clutch portion 21 is constituted by two
      clutch discs which are axially movable relative to the second
      input/output shaft and are fixedly attached to the second
      input/output shaft 7 in the direction of rotation. One of the
      clutch discs is present between the two wheels of the first clutch
      portion 19 and the other clutch disc is present between the
      movable disc and an axially movable pressure plate 23 of the
      clutch. This pressure plate 23 is pressed down by springs 25 and
      presses the clutch plates and wheels together.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The transmission 1 further includes a brake 27 with a brake
      disc 29 and two brake pads 31 and 33 connected to the firm object.
      The brake disc 29 is present at a distance beside an axial side of
      the housing 3 and fixedly fitted to the pressure plate 23 by means
      of rods 35. The brake pads 31, 33 can be pushed against a side 39
      of the brake disc 29 and a side 41 of the housing 3 by means of a
      hydraulic cylinder 37. These sides 39 and 41 then constitute
      braking surfaces. The brake disc is movable in axial direction and
      is fixedly fitted to the annulus gear 15 in the direction of
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The transmission 1 further includes disengaging means 43
      which are capable of moving the brake disc 29 in axial direction
      and thus pushing away the pressure plate 23 of the clutch means 19
      and 21 and opening up the clutch 17. These disengaging means 43
      have a lever 45 which can rotate around a pivot 47 which is
      bearing-mounted on the housing 3. The free end 49 of the lever can
      be operated and the other end 51 is bearing-mounted on the brake
      disc 29. The lever 45 does not rotate relative to the firm object
      and can thus be operated in a simple manner during functioning
      while this lever, via the brake plate 29, pushes the pressure
      plate 23 away from the two clutch portions 19 and 21 against the
      force of the springs 25 and thus opens up the clutch 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] FIGS. 2 and 3 show two further embodiments of the
      transmission according to the invention, where the planetary gear
      set 9 is connected to the housing 3 and to the two input/output
      shafts 5 and 7 in a different manner. In the transmission 53 shown
      in FIG. 2 the sun gear 11 is fitted to the housing 3, the planet
      gear support 13 is connected to the first input/output shaft 5 and
      the annulus gear 15 is connected to the second input/output shaft
      7. In the transmission 55 shown in FIG. 3 the sun gear 11 is
      fitted to the first input/output shaft 5, the planet gear support
      13 is fitted to the housing and the annulus gear 15 is connected
      to the second input/output shaft 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Albeit the invention has been described in the foregoing
      with reference to the drawings, it should be pointed out that the
      invention is not by any manner or means restricted to the
      embodiment shown in the drawings. The invention also extends over
      any embodiment deviating from the embodiment shown in the drawing
      Figures within the spirit and scope defined by the claims. For
      example, by adapting the construction the brake pads 31 and 33 can
      be arranged in an electrically adjustable manner in lieu of a
      hydraulically adjustable manner.<br>
