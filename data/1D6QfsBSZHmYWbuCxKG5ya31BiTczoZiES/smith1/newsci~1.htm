      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A first reading of this book
          will undoubtedly leave the reader with many questions in mind,
          and with few answers immediately obtainable. As a work which
          purports to provide a comprehensive yet simplified
          understanding of the universe and of reality as we observe it,
          it will appear most novel in its development, intricate in its
          ramifications, and will challenge the most vivid imagination.
          Yet, the implications are far-reaching in their significance
          and the applications innumerable. The serious reader is
          advised to peruse it often, and most of, to THINK.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>THE NEW SCIENCE</i>
          attempts to provide a fundamental understanding of reality in
          general, and of our known universe in particular. It advances
          a unified concept governing our awareness of reality, explains
          the generation of this reality, and describes the factors
          which mold it into the numerous forms in which we find it. To
          some extent it is not a "first" attempt. For centuries
          philosophers and scientists have, with varying degrees of
          success, framed hypotheses with the same considered objective.
          It may be said that such attempts at a unified understanding
          of the universe is a natural result of man's inquisitiveness
          and his searching need of the ultimate order. THE NEW SCIENCE
          is unique, however, in bringing into play not only those
          factors which are usually considered as physical and material,
          but also the more subtle yet no less important influence of
          the mental and spiritual.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The work was produced after
          many years of thought and investigation. Existing concepts
          were considered in all their scope and depth. It is the belief
          of many that numerous "clues" were obtained from civilizations
          much more advanced than ours. Some of the more physical
          aspects were confirmed by actual experiment and the less
          tangible considerations tested against observable data and
          evaluated for consistency. At this point, a few words about
          the author would seem appropriate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wibert Brockhouse Smith was
          born at Lethbridge, in the Province of Alberta, Canada on the
          17th of February, 1910. He exhibited early in life an eager
          interest in the nature of things. At the age of 15, he wrote a
          treatise dealing with the controversial concept of perpetual
          motion. He was also the author of several scientific novels.
          After having obtained his S. SC. And M. Sc. Degrees in
          Electrical Engineering from the University of Columbia in 1933
          and 1934, he spent four years on the staff of radio station
          CJOR in Vancouver, BC, where he became chief engineer. In 1939
          he joined the Department of Transport of Canada, where he

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We find ourselves in this
          Universe, and we are aware of it. We strive to understand it,
          and to do so we use all means at our disposal. We observe and
          speculate; we look and sometimes we find; we ask many
          questions and get many answers. If the questions are proper we
          get proper answers, but if they are not proper questions we
          get indefinite answers or no answers at all.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sometimes we cannot
          distinguish between cause and effect or the phenomenon and the
          effect of the phenomenon. Sometimes we mistake the shadow for
          the substance and pass by the reality while we pursue the
          image.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Often we are so enamoured of
          our own brilliance that we cannot see the little glints of
          Truth that line our way. Many shining nuggets of Truth lie
          buried at our feet and if we are not too proud to dig we will
          find them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are certain
          fundamental Truths in this Universe and if we are prepared to
          accept them we can use them as tools for its better
          Understanding.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No principal can be
          described or satisfactorily defined except in terms of
          concepts which are more basic, until one basic concept is
          reached which in itself cannot be defined at all, but which
          will define all other concepts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Universe contains no
          anomalies, and the appearance of an anomaly is warning that
          our understanding is inadequate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mathematics must be the
          servant of Understanding and not its master. Equations, by
          their very nature, cannot discover; they can only yield
          relationships derived from the initial statements and which
          were inherently in them when they were stated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Truth is not hidden; it is
          available to all and is the same for all. Apparent differences
          must be due to inadequate understanding.</font> </p>

                size="+1">The Basic Concept</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whatever might be the origin
          of this Universe, of one thing we can be reasonable sure, that
          it is within "nothing at all". If it "started", then it must
          have started from nothing at all. It always was, this it has
          nothing at all around it. Whatever there might be beyond this
          "nothing at all" we have no way of knowing for we are within
          it and of this Universe and have no concept beyond it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This idea of nothing at all
          is a most difficult one to come to grips with, but it is an
          absolute necessity to an understanding of even the first ideas
          of cosmology. Nothing at all means exactly what it says:
          NOTHING AT ALL; no space, no time, no substance, no energy, no
          change. To approach it one must slough off all reality and
          proceed deliberately into the void of nothingness. It is
          something extremely personal which must be experienced by the
          individual as a basic exercise; it is something which cannot
          be "taught". Most people recoil from the idea of nothing at
          all, feeling that it is akin to annihilation, which it is, but
          we must know of "nothing at all" before we can understand the
          basic concept upon which our Universe is built. Subsequent
          lessons are futile without this basic understanding.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having become aware of
          nothing at all, there is only awareness and nothing at all,
          and Awareness injects into nothing at all a concept which will
          render it unique. Since no concept of any kind can be defined
          except in terms of that which is more basic, this Concept
          cannot be defined, and we may use it only in defining concepts
          which are less basic. Since this Concept is the basis of our
          Universe, its derivatives must be the basic parameters of it,
          and in itself it must remain the nameless Reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We do not know if this basic
          Reality exists independently from Awareness or whether one is
          the consequence of the other; or whether in the final analysis
          they are in fact one and the same. In any case we do know, or
          think that we know, that Reality does exist and we are aware
          of it. But we do not know how far beyond us the Awareness
          extends, and we must either postpone this determination
          pending a better understanding or accept the statements by
          other entities who are presumably more advanced than we are
          that Awareness is universal and extends throughout all Reality
          and has a particular relationship thereto which will be
          discussed later.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our physical senses are very
          limited and we can observe directly only certain aspects of
          our Universe, and these only within strictly limited ranges.
          However, as our understanding increases we are able to devise
          ways and means for extending our sense both in range and
          scope, which in turn leads to better understanding. But we
          must always remember in thus extending our senses to
          distinguish between the language of observation and its
          translation into the language of our senses, lest we miss the
          phenomenon while inspecting its effect. Also, since the
          information we get through extensions of our senses is
          essentially "second hand", we must be doubly sure that it is
          truly what we think it is, that it is in fact "the truth, the
          whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are two ways of
          "learning", memorizing and understanding. No matter how good
          memory is it can never do more than regurgitate that which has
          been assimilated, without form and undigested. A library is an
          excellent memory but its understanding is nil. Understanding
          however allows one to KNOW and is not limited to material
          which has already been assimilated. Further, understanding can
          extrapolate while memory cannot even interpolate. Therefore,
          in dealing with the Basic Concept of the Universe which is
          Nothing-At-All, mere memory is not good enough; understanding
          must be used, otherwise the whole exercise is meaningless and
          we cannot KNOW.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In striving to attain the
          knowledge of Nothing-At-All and the basic concept of Reality
          within it, words are hopelessly inadequate because by their
          very nature words are merely symbols in which there is some
          degree of common understanding. As yet we have no words for
          that which is basic, and we must attain the understanding of
          it and then carry this understanding into whatever language we
          find convenient. But however we may approach the subject, the
          understanding of it is entirely personal. As one of the people
          from "elsewhere" once stated, "I cannot teach you; I can only
          help you to learn!"</font> </p>

          Nothing-At-All and the basic concept of Reality within it, we
          must next understand the relationship of Awareness to these
          concepts. Whether or not Awareness and Reality are the one and
          same is probably the Creator's secret, but to us at least they
          seem to be separate and through the one we observe the other.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Realizing that at this stage
          we have not yet even approached the basic or derived
          parameters of the Universe, we have no understood framework
          within which t explore the relationship of Awareness to
          Reality. Also, since the only basic concept we have at this
          stage is the nameless one injected into Nothing-At-All, it is
          only this which we can use to define the higher concepts.
          Therefore, the only possible understanding of the relationship
          of Awareness to reality must be determined from that which is
          inherent within the understanding of both.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We could define the
          Quadrature Concept as the relationship of Awareness to
          Reality, and to some a definition of this nature may be
          adequate, but it would carry little or no understanding, and
          great difficulties would arise later when this concept is
          needed to understand the derivation and relationships between
          the twelve fundamental parameters. Therefore, a little time
          and effort spent at this stage to understand this relationship
          will pay large dividends later. Through the symbology of words
          and through analogy an attempt will be made to bracket this
          concept and bring it into approximate focus, and after that
          only individual and personal effort will bring it into precise
          focus and understanding will be attained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our personal; experience
          with awareness is largely confined to the operation of our
          senses. If we see something, and can see all sides of it, we
          usually have a pretty good idea of what it looks like. Also,
          if we can feel it all over we can conclude quite a bit about
          its shape, temperature, texture, etc. We get more information
          from any sounds which it may make, or any smells which it may
          exude. Maybe we may even want to taste it. If we can get at it
          sufficiently to use most or all of our senses on it we can
          form a pretty good idea of what it is, and if we met it again
          we would probably recognize it. What then is the mechanism by
          which our awareness obtains this information?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we find ourselves in a
          certain situation, such as being caught out in a storm, our
          senses respond to certain stimuli and we arrive at certain
          conclusions. Thereafter we have a degree of understanding of
          that particular situation, and would have no trouble
          recognizing or identifying it if we ever met it again.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Emotional responses,
          stemming sometimes from very restricted stimulation, can be
          distinguished and identified, and to a certain degree passed
          along to others if they are coded through their own experience
          to receive such information. Under these circumstances we can
          say that such emotions are "understood", but just what is the
          relationship of Awareness to them?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we get into the area of
          abstracts such as mathematics, physical relationships and the
          like, logic and intuition extend the range and scope of our
          senses, but there still exists that mysterious relationship
          between Awareness and Reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the transcendental area
          involving extra sensory perception, estannation, and those
          other capabilities of the mind which as yet are only vaguely
          appreciated, we also find a definite and determinable
          relationship between Awareness and Reality. In fact, anything
          about which we can think, if it in any way involves an aspect
          of the universe, must implicate and make use of this
          relationship. In the ultimate the Quadrature Concept is the
          link by which Awareness observes and Understands Reality.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mathematics is a discipline
          in which many people have a fair understanding, and within
          which one facet of the Quadrature Concept manifest most
          elegantly. Geometry, complex algebra, and vectors all make use
          of a special relationship in which one line is at right angles
          to another. Various properties, some of which are obvious and
          some which are not so obvious, have been ascribed to this
          quadrature relationship between lines. In fact, whole
          mathematical philosophies have been developed around this
          relationship, and their practical application has given us
          electrical current, radio, aeronautics, and many others. In
          mathematics the Quadrature Concept manifests as two lines
          mutually at right angles, or to a line which has been
          subjected to an operation by the square root of minus one from
          its previous position. Successive operations yield
          relationships which are the cornerstones of various branches
          of mathematics. But the universal Quadrature Concept extends
          much beyond its mere mathematical application, interesting
          though this may be, and is in fact the Concept which links
          Awareness with the Concept which is fundamental.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our Universe appears to us
          as an enormous, tremendously complicated system, with myriads
          of actions and reactions, functions and functional
          derivatives, and it is hard to realize that it is all a
          manifestation of a single basic concept in Nothing-At-All. We
          suspect, correctly, that there must be many "layers" or
          "levels" between the basic concept and what we observe around
          us. It is up these levels that we must work our way to an
          understanding of the universe, rather than downwards.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Anyone who is at all
          familiar with modern physics is, no doubt, appalled at its
          complexity, confused by the many correction and perturbation
          factors, and amazed at the many weird theories propounded in
          all sincerity to explain observations in terms of "established
          principles". Anomalies are the rule rather than the exception,
          and the amount of data which just won't fit is colossal. All
          in all it is fairly obvious that this view of the Universe is
          bogging down and we are in reality conjuring up a mathematical
          monstrosity and raising it to Deity status. It is truly the
          modern Golden Calf.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is much more difficult to
          conceive of a universe which is basically highly complex but
          possible of breaking down into simpler units than to conceive
          of a Universe in which everything is built up of different
          aspects and combinations of these aspects of a single basic
          Reality. Therefore, why not tread again the path which was
          trodden by the Creator when the universe was established, and
          start as he did with Nothing-At-All and place therein the
          single basic Concept of Reality and study that which may be
          derived from it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We were unable to establish
          the point of whether or not there is any interdependence
          between Reality and Awareness, and we may never be able to do
          so, but we must take it that they both do in fact exist,
          otherwise the whole exercise becomes meaningless and all is
          illusion. Therefore, insofar as we are concerned, the Reality
          of the Universe exists as we are aware of it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first degree of
          awareness of the basic concept is length. This is a bald
          statement and although many other combinations of words could
          be sued the MEANING is identical. Again, the understanding of
          this parameter is a personal matter and the mere reiteration
          of a formula will never convey understanding. Hence another
          personal visit into Nothing-At-All and a first hand view of
          the basic concept is called for. The viewing should be by
          means of the Quadrature Concept and, if correctly carried out
          to the exclusion of all else, that which is viewed will be the
          concept of length. This is the First Parameter, or as it might
          fairly be put at this point, the First Dimension. [Planck's
          Constant, *L]</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, if the Quadrature
          Concept is again applied to the basic Concept of Reality,
          taking into account the already established Parameter of
          Length, and Area will be established, which is the Second
          Parameter. This Area is the true Second Dimension, thus making
          Volume the true Third Dimension, and for similar reasons
          another Length at right angles to the other two could not
          qualify.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hence, Awareness of the
          basic concept of Reality, through successive applications of
          the Quadrature Concept has established a fabric of three
          Parameters, Length, Area and Volume, containing One, Two, and
          Three conventional Dimensions. This is the Space Fabric, and
          establishes a place for the Universe, which is at once simple
          and possible of understanding. There is no need for Warps,
          Foreshortenings, and all the other attachments appended to
          Space by conventional science to avoid facing the Universe as
          the Creator faced it, from the viewpoint of Nothing-At-All.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it may be well
          to say something about Zero and Infinity. Originally these
          were mathematical concepts which gradually became established
          in our consciousness even though to most people they never had
          any real meanings. Mathematically it is possible to evolve
          quite satisfactory definitions for Zero and infinity, and so
          long as they are confined to mathematics we can get along with
          them quite well. But when we try to become aware of zero or
          infinity as a personal experience, we find it most difficult.
          It is only through the Quadrature Concept that we can become
          aware of these two extremes at all, but if we do view them "in
          quadrature" we find them quite understandable; in fact, they
          become, they become as real as any other numbers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We can say that Zero is the
          smallest number in which our Awareness has any interest, and
          that Infinity is the largest number in which our Awareness has
          any interest. If we have the same degree of interest in Zero
          as we have in Infinity we will find that Unity is exactly half
          way between. This is quite apart from any scale of measurement
          and is a most important relationship. It is because <i>nothing

            in the universe is absolute except the basic concept of
            reality itself</i>. Even geometrical relationships are
          tempered by the means by which we become aware of them.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In establishing the Space
          Fabric we have understood only the concepts which result from
          the application of the Quadrature Concept to the basic Concept
          of Reality. While we immediately recognize the results of
          these operations as the space within which we dwell we must
          avoid implying other properties to it than can be derived
          directly from the basic premises. In other words, we have only
          space, with nothing in it. Anything which we may subsequently
          define within Space must be derived by further applications of
          the Quadrature Concept if it is to have any meaning.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further word may be said
          about scales of measurement. Within the space just described
          there are no scales of measurement, and any positioning of
          awareness must of necessity be entirely arbitrary with one
          position being quite as good as any other. Relative
          positioning must of course remain relative regardless of how
          many positions may be established. A corollary of this is that
          Space is linear no matte where we investigate it, and this
          relationship must be accepted as fundamental.</font> </p>

                size="+1">The Field Fabric</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In establishing the Space
          Fabric the basic Concept of Reality was operated upon
          successively by the Quadrature Concept, giving the concepts of
          Length, Area and Volume. Further operations with the
          Quadrature Concept will yield more relationships which, when
          established may be recognized as parameters of the Universe in
          which Awareness finds itself.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the relationships
          established to constitute the Field Fabric do not impinge upon
          our awareness as directly as does Space except in their
          composite forms, some sort of language is needed to facilitate
          Understanding. To those having a mathematical background this
          presents no particular problem since the relationships are
          merely those of established Vector Algebra. To those not
          having such a background, understanding must be obtained
          through appreciation of the meanings of the actual words used.
          In any case, if the basic principles already set forth have
          been adequately understood, there should not be too great
          difficulty. A visualization of what is going on, extending
          upwards from Nothing-At-All, as the Quadrature Concept is
          applied successively to Reality and its derivatives, is really
          what is called for.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The application of the
          Quadrature Concept to the Third Parameter yields a further
          parameter which we might describe as Density or gradient, and
          is really an expression of how Reality is distributed in
          Space. Vectorially it is the scalar view by awareness of the
          Volumetric parameter of Reality. It is the scale against which
          any change in Reality must be gauged. The Fourth Parameter is
          therefore essentially Change, the true Fourth Dimension. There
          are many interesting implications which will be studied later
          in more detail.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the Quadrature Concept is
          applied again, another partially familiar vectorial quantity
          results, namely Divergence, or the stable condition in which
          Awareness finds Reality. This is the Fifth Parameter, which
          also presents some interesting implications which will studied
          later.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Sixth Parameter is
          developed by still another application of the Quadrature
          Concept to Reality, which gives the vectorial quantity Curl,
          or Deviation or Reality, which is essentially the dynamic
          aspect of Reality as perceived by Awareness.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it is fairly
          obvious that our Universe is poly-dimensional in the truest
          sense of the word, even though the dimensions are not quite
          what we fancied they ought to be. They are more correctly
          parameters and are aspects of Reality established by Awareness
          through the mechanism of the Quadrature Concept. Again, we
          cannot say whether or not Reality could exist without
          Awareness, but we believe that they are actually separate
          manifestations of the same thing, and one is incomplete
          without the other. In any case, so long as we are aware of our
          Universe it must be through the Parameters which are inherent
          in it. And there are six more of them making twelve Parameters
          in all, after which the system closes on itself. These Twelve
          Parameters are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
          existence of the Universe as we are aware of it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although there is a smooth
          relationship following in the development of the various
          parameters we find that they fall naturally into four fabrics
          of three parameters each. Just as each parameter has its
          unique characteristic so each fabric has its own unique
          characteristics, which include those of the individual
          parameters and the interrelationships between them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be noted that in
          the development of the three parameters in the field fabric
          the Quadrature Concept was applied in each case to the
          previously established parameter, and in its broader sense.
          This should not be confused with the mathematical manipulation
          of multiplying the previously established parameter by the
          square root of minus one, as this is an operation which will
          subsequently be employed and is similar to parallel processes
          which go on in the space fabric. While this distinction is
          fairly obvious in the space fabric it may not be so obvious in
          the field fabric.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us next look at those
          aspects of the Universe which impinge upon our awareness and
          which may possibly be identified with the parameters of the
          field fabric. The Fourth Parameter, Change, reaches our
          awareness through our concept of Time, although we have here
          mistaken the shadow for the substance and vice versa.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A field is a region which
          has a unique characteristic. The space fabric, in displaying
          the characteristic of Change, has a unique characteristic, so
          that this characteristic which so appears can qualify as a
          field. But the filed must be "somewhere" and the space fabric
          fills this need, just as Area is necessary for the evolution
          of the concept of Volume.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suppose we call this field
          of Change a Tempic Field to give it a name of its own, so that
          we can study its relationship to those things which impinge
          upon our awareness. Inspection of the Concept shows that if
          the Change is great the tempic field must be great, but we
          associate Change with our Concept of Time which is something
          against which we gauge a rate of change. Expressed
          mathematically this rate can be written as dS/dt which
          expresses the manner in which something changes with respect
          to time. More explicitly this should be written as TS where T
          is the tempic field operator, and S is the aspect of Reality
          upon which it operates. A convenient, though only partially
          adequate description of the Tempic Field is "Frequency", since
          we recognize frequency as being a certain number of somethings
          per unit of time, and is dimensionally the reciprocal of Time.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heretofore we have always
          considered Time as an immutable flow against which everything
          evolving Change could be measured, whereas, it is really the
          converse which is true; Change is the basic concept and Time
          its derivative. Unfortunately, our mathematics are geared to
          the Time concept and will require considerable reworking to
          fit them into this more precise concept, but when this is done
          there will result a most elegant simplification in all the
          analysis involving time. In the meantime the transition in
          thinking can be made less painful if we merely regard Time as
          the consequence of the existence of a Tempic Field, and is by
          no means fixed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may be interesting at
          this point to mention something about the velocity of light.
          This quantity is generally recognized to be something rather
          basic in our universe, being the "rate at which space changes
          with time", but when viewed in the light of this new field
          concept is merely the tempic field intensity, or how the
          tempic field is distributed in space. We have been told that
          light doesn't "travel"; it "is", which is an idea not at all
          foreign to the field concept. Of course, it follows that the
          velocity of light will be a constant only under conditions of
          constant tempic field, and if this field changes so will the
          velocity of light change.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having had a superficial
          look at the Tempic Field and its derivation we may now allow
          our Awareness to inspect the next parameter which is
          Divergence to see if it is something which can be recognized.
          Previously we noted that Reality had to extend to infinity
          from zero in order to establish Space and that unity, so far
          as Awareness was concerned, lay half way between. With the
          application of the Quadrature Concept to the parameter of
          Change or Tempic Field, Divergence is established, from which
          we derive a starting point a t zero and a finish at infinity.
          Between these two limits and through unity there is
          divergence, which we can recognize as the Electric Field, but
          with the exception that there is no point charge at the zero.
          Our Awareness, however, established the "charge" at radius
          unity, with exactly one half of it being "inside" and the
          other half being "outside". The real significance of this
          boundary will be apparent when we study the tenth parameter.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Divergence was
          established by Awareness, the Quadrature Concept was applied
          to the Tempic Field, so we may expect within the electric
          field two quantities, scalar and vector, or quantity and its
          manner of distribution. These attributes we recognize
          immediately as pertaining to the electric fields with which we
          have experience.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the Tempic field is
          purely scalar, the application of the Quadrature Concept gave
          it an aspect which is vectorial in establishing the Electric
          Field, in that it now has "direction" as well as "quantity".
          In dealing with this parameter both these aspects should
          always be included. Otherwise the analysis is bound to be
          incomplete. In other words, mere vectorial summation is not
          sufficient and the scalar values must be integrated also.
          Also, we must get away from the idea that they are the
          manifestation of the fifth parameter from zero to infinity and
          in themselves are the reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Awareness inspects
          Divergence through the Quadrature Concept and establishes
          Curl. Similar appreciation results, and we see in Curl many of
          the characteristics of the Magnetic Field, but again we have a
          boundary within which is half the reality and outside of which
          is the other half. We call that within (or without) this
          boundary the magnetic moment, but again we cannot establish a
          point source. Also, dealing with magnetic fields we must
          always include the scalar as well as the vectorial aspects.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as Area has Length
          incorporated in it, and Volume has Area incorporated in it, so
          has the Electric Field the Tempic Field incorporated in it.
          Each of these three fields are mutually at right angles to
          each other. The three fields together are the manifestation of
          Reality in the Field Fabric as perceived by Awareness. The
          interrelationships between these various fields manifests to
          our Awareness as Matter and Energy, and the great variety of
          these manifestations is well known to us.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The complete understanding
          of the Control Fabric is not easy, chiefly because by their
          very nature, our mathematics cannot be applied to it directly,
          and any analysis must be indirect. However, it is hoped that
          with some understanding of the Fabric suitable mathematics
          will be evolved with which to deal with it. In any case it
          should be realized the Understanding comes with increasing
          Awareness and if the basic concepts are understood, the rest
          will follow.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Awareness, inspecting
          Reality, notices that the Tempic Field is to some extent
          everywhere, and except for any arbitrarily prescribed
          reference point is largely homogenous. The Electric Field,
          however, does have a reference point of its own but other than
          this it spreads out everywhere. The magnetic Field, in
          addition to having both the foregoing characteristics, has
          another one, namely orientation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the Quadrature Concept is
          applied to the Magnetic Field it will be found that its
          orientation can be anything, or in other words, it is Random.
          The probability of finding it in any particular orientation is
          exactly the same as for any other orientation, and while the
          Field itself has a unique characteristic, its display is
          strictly random. While this is a rather over-simplified
          derivation of the Seventh Parameter, it may be sufficient to
          guide thinking in the direction of its appreciation, and as
          has been said previously, this appreciation is purely
          personal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In all previous applications
          of the Quadrature Concept by Awareness, the matter of choice
          did not arise as how the Concept was applied did not make any
          difference. However, with the application of the Quadrature
          Concept to the magnetic Field, this is no longer the case, and
          a condition of asymmetry has been introduced which makes it
          necessary to decide how the Concept shall be applied. In fact,
          the application of the Concept is in itself a definition of
          the Eighth parameter, which is that of Decision, or Free Will.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Ninth parameter,
          however, again establishes symmetry, and leads to a concept of
          Sequence, or Order, or Specific Arrangement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Up to the Eighth Parameter,
          Awareness was largely in the position of Observer, and was
          unable to make any difference in the scheme of things in the
          Understanding of what happened when the Quadrature Concept was
          successively applied to the Basic Concept. Concept was
          successively applied the basic Concept. However, with the
          Eighth Parameter, Awareness became part of the Scheme in that
          a difference could result. It is at this level that Free Will
          is exercised, even though we may have many ideas to the
          contrary, and it is through this characteristic that we are
          able to control at least a part of this universe. Increased
          understanding will of course make possible extension of
          control, to the extent that our Awareness actually does
          Understand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is a price tag on this
          control through Free Will, however, in that the next
          application of the Quadrature Concept establishes a pattern
          which persists right around the cycle, and sequences are
          established which are directly consequential of the
          application of the Eighth Parameter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our relationship with the
          Universe we see all sorts of applications of the Control
          Fabric, from Random, through Free Will and into Sequence, as
          well as all sorts of combinations of them. Again, as was the
          case in the lower fabrics, each Parameter includes the lower
          Parameters as well as extending the Concept to include a new
          one. Therefore, it follows that all higher Parameters than the
          Eighth will be subject to modification by Awareness, with
          proper Understanding. The modification will be the consequence
          of the operation on the asymmetry of the Field Fabric, and its
          consequences will be felt right up to the Twelfth Parameter.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once Awareness has
          understood through the application of the Quadrature Concept,
          the establishment of the first nine Parameters, the further
          application of this Concept yields three more Parameters which
          bring Matter and Energy as we know them into being. Again, as
          in the Third or Control Fabric, we have no tools except our
          own Awareness and understanding to follow through the
          evolvement of this Fabric. The two higher Fabrics require much
          more sophisticated manipulations than our mathematics are
          capable of to show the relationships existing between the
          lower Parameters and Fabrics and the higher ones, and at our
          stage of evolvement we can reach them only through personal
          mental activity aided by hints and direction from others who
          have already passed this way.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The application of the
          Quadrature Concept to the Parameter of Sequence yields the
          Tenth Parameter, Form. It was previously mentioned that there
          is a unique value between zero and infinity called Unity where
          exactly half the Reality is "inside" and half is "outside"
          While it is true for formal mathematics and may be so
          established, it is also universally true outside of this
          discipline, that no amount of manipulation can alter the value
          of unity and it always remains the fulcrum about which all
          other values pivot, regardless of scale. The Tenth Parameter
          attaches a special significance to this value in that it
          becomes the apparent boundary of Reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is at once apparent that
          there is no prescription of any "absolute" quantity of
          Reality, or any scale of dimensions at all in this derivation.
          Therefore it follows that any and all Reality will manifest
          Form such that its apparent boundary will manifest half of the
          Reality inside and half outside. We do not know, and may never
          know, the total amount of Reality in the Universe, but the
          Form of the Universe will be such that half the Reality is
          inside and half outside. At the other extreme, the smallest
          bit of Reality that we can discern will also have this
          characteristic of one half being inside and the other half
          outside.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next application of the
          Quadrature Concept yields the Parameter of Multiplicity, where
          more than one Form is established. Remembering that each
          Parameter contains within itself all lower Parameters, any and
          all deviations will reflect in the higher parameters and the
          Eleventh Parameter will allow individualization in Form as a
          consequence. This may not be at once obvious, but it is the
          mechanism by which the various bits and pieces of matter and
          energy came into being, actually a coagulation of substance
          out of the basic Reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the Quadrature Concept
          is again applied there results the Parameter of Aggregation,
          or Assembly of bits into a Purposeful Structure. In this
          region resides the recognizable universe, animate and
          inanimate. It is the degree of exercise of Free Will that
          distinguishes between these two realms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further application of the
          Quadrature Concept merely offsets the universe from itself,
          which is the same as another linear dimension or First
          Parameter and the system closes on itself. Therefore, within
          the Universe as we are aware of it there are only these Twelve
          Parameters. They are the necessary and sufficient conditions
          for our Universe as we know it, and all of which we are aware
          can be defined in terms of these Parameters, and it is the
          duty and responsibility of Science to do so.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having established twelve
          Parameters through our Awareness observing the Basic Reality
          through the Quadrature Concept, the question naturally arises
          regarding the place of Awareness in the Universe. Since none
          of the Parameters in any way establishes Awareness, yet
          Awareness observes all twelve, it must occupy some unique
          position relative thereto. This is true, but its understanding
          is not aided by the Reality of the universe and again it
          becomes a personal matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The following analogy may
          assist in visualizing to some extent the relative structure of
          the universal parameters and Awareness. Consider a sphere
          which is completely surrounded by twelve other spheres of the
          same size. All the spheres are in contact, and all the outer
          spheres are in contact with the inner. Only three spheres and
          the inner sphere can have mutual contact under any one
          circumstance. Radius of these three spheres may be mutually at
          right angles and the radius of the inner sphere may be in line
          with any one of these. Depending on the starting point and
          progression, all spheres may be inspected sequentially,
          without any preference. A quadrature relationship is possible
          between any three spheres, including the central one. All
          these relationships are valid with respect to the
          relationships existing among the twelve parameters and
          Awareness.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Establishing the Twelve
          Parameters of the Universe, in their four Fabrics of Three
          Parameters each, makes it possible to study from the point of
          view of the Creator the evolution of the basic building blocks
          out of which our Universe is constructed. Considering the
          evolution of one particle only we need go no higher than the
          first seven parameters, actually holding the seventh constant.
          The higher Parameters enter the scene only when we want to do
          something with the particle so established.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first three Parameters
          set up a framework in space within which the particle will
          appear, and the next three will provide the wherewithal with
          which to make it. We can work with Length, Area and Volume,
          Tempic, Electric and Magnetic Fields, and all needed
          relationships between them. Our result will of course not be a
          true particle, because the higher Parameters will not have
          been applied; for example, it will not display Form, but will
          be diffuse from zero to infinity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the establishment of the
          Space Fabric the repeated application of the Quadrature
          Concept stepped up the available dimensions to three but it
          also made possible all sorts of quadrature relationships
          within this framework. Similarly, in the establishment of the
          Field Fabric three field regions were established with
          quadrature relationships between them. Furthermore, there
          exists complete quadrature freedom between the field and space
          fabric, so that in effect we work in a Six Dimensional
          Continuum. It is easy to appreciate the large number of
          possibilities among the many permutations and combinations of
          spatial dimensions and fields, but the real problem is to sort
          out the actuality from the possibility. This can be done only
          by continual cross-reference to observation of Reality; i.e.,
          by asking Mother Nature the right questions. We can be
          reasonably certain, however, of one thing: there will not be
          any unused Parameters, and the final result of the studies
          will involve all six.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since we have no senses by
          which we can become directly aware of the various fields we
          will have to depend on the second hand data made available
          through our instruments, and here we must be extremely careful
          to distinguish between the phenomenon itself and the effects
          of the phenomenon on the instruments. Also, we must be
          particularly careful in posing our questions to nature that
          they ask exactly what we want to find out and are not
          ambiguous.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In developing the twelve
          Parameters, the Quadrature Concept was applied between
          Awareness and the next lower Parameter, but it may also be
          applied between any aspects of any Parameters, or any
          derivatives of them. In doing this, however, it is most
          necessary to realize just what is being done, and to
          understand the relationships which are involved. Furthermore,
          we must never forget that we are dealing with Reality, and
          even though certain aspects may become zero, the Reality never
          vanishes. Conversely, any aspect which extends to infinity is
          still reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since it was established
          that reality does extend in all cases from zero to infinity,
          it follows that if there is to be particularization as made
          possible by the eleventh Parameter there must be "overlap"
          among certain aspects. This simply means that in the field
          fabric it is possible to have fields that exist independently
          amongst themselves and independently of any "background" which
          may also exist. In fact, we do not know directly at present
          how much "unpercipitated Reality" there is in the universe,
          which will of course appear as a uniform background to the
          precipitated Reality with which we exist.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whether or not fields stick
          together and add up to a single field depends entirely on the
          antecedents of the field. If the fields are of unit particles
          they will become coherent for more than half of the reality to
          be held in common, when the little bits combine to form a big
          bit. If a field is produced by the simultaneous behavior of
          lots of particles or other fields, then it will be coherent,
          so long as more than half its reality exists in common. These
          are basic principles and form the subject matter of a series
          of interesting and enlightening experiments, and when
          understood provides an elegant interpretation of much data
          being pondered by students of these matters.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The transition between
          coherent and incoherent fields results from conditions which
          bring more or less than half of the reality in common, and the
          'stability" is purely a function of how close to "half" the
          system actually is.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In manipulating fields and
          applying the Quadrature Concept between them, we must
          understand that what we are really doing is allowing one field
          to operate on another. The operation of A on b is not
          necessarily the same as the operation of B on A, although
          there can be relationships between these two operations.
          Successive operations will go right around the circle and back
          to the starting point provided certain conditions are met.
          These conditions will become apparent later.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is basically no
          difference between particles and radiated energy, except one
          of structure and configuration. Both contain Reality and are
          made up of fields in space, and are subject to the higher
          Parameters. We can say that radiated energy is "extended" and
          that matter is "reentrant", to describe loosely their
          configurations and structures.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the foregoing in mind
          we can now explore what happens when the various fields are
          operated upon by each other. When an electric field is
          operated upon by a tempic field, i.e., changed, a magnetic
          field results. When a magnetic field is operated upon by a
          tempic field, i.e., changed, an electric field results. A
          tempic field should result when an electric field operates on
          a magnetic field, but the trick is to make it do so. Also, we
          would like to know what happens when a tempic field is
          operated upon by an electric field or a magnetic field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A tempic field is largely
          amorphous and has direction only in relation to its own
          gradient in space, while both the electric and magnetic fields
          have vectorial aspects in addition to their scalar aspects.
          Therefore, we could hardly expect complete symmetry among the
          operations of these three fields. We can, however, work
          through an intermediate arrangement whereby we generate the
          desired field with its interaction already built into it.
          Whether or not there is a limit to this sort of operation we
          do not know, but it certainly hasn't been found yet, and it is
          a valid approach so long as we keep the basic rules constantly
          in mind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As an introductory exercise
          consider the operation of a tempic field on an electric field
          by the simple expedient of having the electric field move. A
          magnetic field will be produced and will have a certain
          specific orientation. The vectorial direction of the magnetic
          field will be mutually at right angles to the direction of the
          electric field and its motion. Now, since the magnetic field
          is a curl function its divergence over the entire field must
          be zero. In order to bring this about the magnetic field must
          operate on either or both if the other fields to close the
          system somehow, somewhere. One such method would be for this
          operation to increase the tempic field on one side and
          decrease it on the other so that the motion would close into a
          loop, which implies the operation of the magnetic field on the
          electric field to produce a tempic field. If the structure of
          the three fields is understood, the validity of this operation
          is at once apparent, which establishes another principle;
          namely, that when a magnetic field, produced by a moving
          electric field, is moved longitudinally a tempic field is
          produced.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More thinking about this
          exercise discloses the fact that if this system merely closes
          on itself, the divergence, which is the electric field is
          eliminated, so that the only way in which the system can be
          self-sustaining is for it to close toroidally, so that there
          will be components of all three fields in all directions. That
          this is in fact the model of the basic particle of the
          universe in which we exist is amply borne out by experiment,
          because it displays a tempic field, an electric field, and a
          magnetic moment. The electric polarity depends on whether the
          spiral is right- or left-handed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inspection of this model
          discloses the fact that the tempic field will drop off as the
          inverse distance from the center of the toroid, the electric
          field will drop off as the inverse square of this distance,
          and the magnetic field will drop of as the inverse cube. What
          fields we observe with our instrumentation in the vicinity of
          such a particle will be the summation of the particle fields,
          the fields of all other particles, and the unresolved
          background fields of the fabric itself.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Possibly a clearer
          understanding of the structure of the basic particle may be
          had by considering the composition, orientation, and
          interaction of the entire field structure, considered together
          as a unit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Looking at the composite
          field structure shows us three fields at right angles to each
          other. There is the tempic with its gradient in one direction,
          the electric with its divergence in a direction at right
          angles to it and including it, and the magnetic at right
          angles to the other two and including both of them. For
          self-sustaining conditions, the operation f each upon the
          other, there must be one-for-one relationships between them.
          Therefore the real movement under stable self-sustaining
          conditions will be in the vectorial 1,1,1 direction, or
          exactly midway among the three directions of the component
          fields.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The skew progression of the
          fields results in a double closure of the system, which will
          have both rotation and precession. It is readily apparent that
          since the tempic field only must have a specified gradient,
          the other two fields have two possible orientations, which
          will result in two directions of possible rotation and two
          directions of possible precession. The electric polarity of
          the particle will be the resultant of the coherent fields
          arising from both the rotation and precession, and can have
          two values of positive and two values of negative. Because of
          the necessary geometrical conditions imposed by the nature of
          space itself, the precessional field will be smaller than the
          rotational field giving particles having two values of
          positive charge rather close together and two negative equally
          close together.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The significance of these
          differences in charges will be discussed later in the chapter
          on gravity, as well as some very interesting circumstances
          arising out of the skew condition, particularly at close
          range.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The basic tempic particle
          rsulted from the operation of the tempic field on the electric
          field through movement. In other words, there was a permitted
          gradient of tempic field in space. If, however, we had
          insisted that the change be such that it occurred at one place
          we would have had a slightly different picture. The only
          change possible under these conditions would have been an
          increase or decrease in the electric field through the
          operation of the tempic field, and it would have had to inject
          its own quadrature relationship in order to exist. Therefore,
          the tempic field must in itself carry the quadrature concept,
          which simply means that it becomes a sinusoidally varying
          alternating field in the single space location.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, if the tempic field
          varies at any point in space, adjacent to that point there
          must be tempic field gradients, or "velocities". Since the
          electric field has a definite orientation, and consequently
          the magnetic field resulting from the tempic field operation
          will also have a definite orientation, it will in turn produce
          a further tempic field of definite orientation which will be
          coherent with the original field, increasing it in one
          direction and reducing it in the other direction. The whole
          business can therefore become self-sustaining only if it darts
          off in this particular direction with the velocity of light,
          or in the direction of the establishing tempic field gradient.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is readily apparent that
          we cannot avoid space getting into the picture in some way or
          other. If we permit things to travel through space, they just
          go round and round and stay in one place, but if we try to
          make them stay in one place they dart of with the velocity of
          light! Furthermore, the difference between matter and radiated
          energy is very similar to that between Direct Current and
          Alternating Current. Otherwise, there is very little
          difference between the two forms of the expression of Reality.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As coherence is possible
          among particles, if more than half the reality is common, so
          is coherence possible in radiated energy if more than half the
          reality is in common.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The extent to which the
          tempic field makes use of the quadrature concept in its
          operation will reflect in the "wave length" of the radiation,
          which in turn will reflect the quantity of reality involved.
          The maximum values of the electric and magnetic fields will be
          those existing in the region where the radiated energy
          originated, since there is no concept in this universe for
          Negative Reality, and the operations must be on the total
          coherent fields present. This same reasoning applies to the
          size and maximum fields of the basic particle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It follows that where
          radiated energy originates in fabrics having appreciably
          different background fields, its wavelength will be different
          from that of equivalent radiated energy originating in more
          familiar fabric.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Within the universe which we
          perceive, we are reasonably satisfied that the maximum value
          of all the coherent fields involved in our particles and
          radiated energy have the same value. Planck's Constant is the
          numerical expression of this value, and the velocity of light
          is the expression of the numerical value of the tempic field
          intensity Whether or not other universes can and do exist
          having other numerical values, and what the relationships
          ought to be between them, is quite another matter, subject to
          entirely separate consideration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the previous
          consideration the operation of the tempic field on the
          electric field was proposed as the starting point. If,
          however, the initial operation was on the magnetic field, an
          additional complication gets injected. The electric field so
          generated can have its required divergence only if the whole
          systemis folded back on itself. This establishes a condition
          where the magnetic field is entirely closed on itself about a
          tempic field "core", with the electric field interlaced with
          alternating polarity. Picturesquely, it would look like a
          string of magnetic doughnuts of alternating magnetic
          direction, stuck together with electrostatic icing of
          alternating polarity, and all threaded into a string of
          increased tempic field and placed inside a tube of decreased
          tempic field. A most complicated picture, but one which does
          exist in this universe and has some most remarkable
          properties. For lack of a better name it is called "tensor
          energy".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tensor energy carries its
          tempic field with it, so it is therefore not subject to
          propagation, and both ends of the beam are actually
          simultaneous (interval zero). The beam does not dissipate and
          has the same numerical values at the receiving end as it has
          at the transmitting end. Regardless of the combination of
          field conditions encountered at the receiving end, the same
          relationships are maintained as existed at the transmitting
          end. Reversing the initial polarity of the magnetic field will
          place decreased tempic field on the inside and increased on
          the outside, so that several tensor beams can be stuck
          together as a "cable". Since the tensor beam does not have any
          external field of any kind it is immune to any and all outside
          field effects. The only manifestation external to the beam
          itself is the tempic field gradient of the outer sheath.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the basic particle was
          developed it was tacitly stated that only the first six
          parameters would be considered. However, during the
          development there were many instances when the higher
          Parameters were invoked, particularly those of the Fourth
          Fabric, so that not only could the particle itself be
          visualized but some idea might evolve a to how it might be
          related to other particles. When all the parameters have been
          applied there exists a particle, having form, along with many
          others of its kind, and having certain definite relationships
          to them, and possible of combination with others to form
          purposeful aggregates.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two particles will merge
          into a single particle if they can be so arranged that more
          than half the reality is in common. Since the basic particle
          is shaped like a toroid, stacking them is rather obviously the
          way to achieve this. We can put them together alternately with
          opposite polarities until we reach a point where this basic
          condition no longer holds. Remembering that the tempic field
          is an inverse distance field, the electric is an inverse
          square field, and the magnetic is an inverse cube field, the
          coherence of the various fields will be different, and there
          will be reached limits beyond which the system will not be
          stable with simple stacking. We can then stick the stacks
          together sideways, and then stick another stack on the ends of
          the resulting assembly, and so on.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electrons and positrons as
          we know them are basic particles, and protons and neutrons are
          simply stacks of these with either an even or odd number in
          the stack. Mesons are merely fragmented stacks. There are
          quite a variety of other bits and pieces made up of basic
          particles stuck together through their field coherence, with
          varying degrees of stability being displayed according to how
          close to the half-in-half-out rule they are.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since it is rather obvious
          that no pattern of stacking can ever make all the fields
          involved equally interpenetrating, there must be some pattern
          of leftover fields manifesting outside the composite particle,
          and these are the fields which establish the characteristics
          of matter as we know it. Study of the relative configurations
          of the electric and magnetic fields establishes the electric
          charge and the configuration of the family of basic particles
          which the composite particle attracts. The electrons will
          drift into the electric field and then attach themselves over
          appropriate poles, to an extent that interpenetration can be
          established between electron fields and the residual fields of
          the composite particle. The number of poles and the number of
          unit charges determine the "elements" as we identify these
          systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tempic field, being
          purely scalar in nature merely contributes to the manner in
          which changes can occur in the system. If, however, through
          some characteristic of configuration, the tempic field within
          a composite particle displays some irregularity, this will
          manifest as a "vibration", and if the magnitude of the
          vibration is such as to cause the interpenetrating fields to
          exceed the half-and-half point the whole system will come
          apart: radioactivity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a system does come
          apart, those fields which were coherent and interpenetrating
          in the correct proportion will remain so and take off down the
          tempic field gradient and become radiated energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fields which contribute
          to the internal "attractions" of atoms are the electric and
          magnetic, supplemented by secondary fields resulting from any
          further operations between the basic field parameters. These
          fields form a static pattern, which is dynamic only when
          tempic field irregularities occur. The difference in energy
          levels is the extent to which the fields are coherent in the
          proportions to form radiated energy, which can enter or leave
          the system upon appropriate arrangement of its components.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it may be well
          to call attention to a simple but often overlooked principle.
          Since all Reality in this universe must conform to the
          parameter of Form, it must always display the characteristic
          of being half-in and half-out. This rule also applies to
          energy, either quantized or amorphous. Energy always exists in
          conjunction with its conjugate. In other words, in any
          reaction involving energy, we see only one half the energy
          involved; the other half is either inside or outside from our
          point of concern. It is most fortunate that this is so,
          otherwise the universe wouldn't work!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In developing our
          understanding of radiated energy we made certain initial
          assumptions, i.e., that we hid have a field upon which we
          could operate, and that this field was sufficiently detached
          that the operation was so isolated that it could be considered
          quite apart from any interaction with other fields or
          particles. Rather obviously this does not represent a real
          condition. In nature we always find a close association
          between matter and energy somewhere in the scheme of things,
          and usually at both ends of the syste, sowe should have a
          closer look at the interaction of matter and energy, always
          bearing in mind that they are both different aspects of the
          same Reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The reason that fields curl
          around to form material particles is because tempic fields are
          generated which increase the time available on one side of the
          system and decrease it on the other. Therefore, whenever any
          degree of asymmetry is introduced into a coherent field
          system, it will change direction and if the conditions are
          right for the system to be self-sustaining, a particle will be
          formed. Conversely, if a discontinuity is introduced,
          sufficient to disturb the closure of a system, the differences
          in the tempic field distribution will disappear and the
          particle will dart off as radiated energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When particles merge to such
          an extent that the interpenetration of the fields exceeds the
          halfway point, and an asymetry is introduced, a tempic field
          gradient is established away from the system in the direction
          bisecting the asymmetry, in both directions so that two bits
          of radiated energy take off down these gradients.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conversely, when two
          approximately equal bits of radiated energy merge beyond the
          halfway point, a deviation in direction of the tempic field
          takes place which, if it can be maintained, allows the bits of
          radiated energy to merge into a particle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Within a complex structure
          of particles there may be coherent field systems, which if
          disturbed may acquire a linear tempic field gradient, and a
          bit of the Reality will take off down this gradient and
          radiation will be emitted by the structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the curling in on
          itself of radiated energy, if the geometry is correct, the
          alternating field aspects flow into a uni-directional
          arrangement, and conversely, when a particle unwraps to form
          radiation, a quadrature phase is introduced in the field
          relationships.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With an understanding of the
          basic particle, the structure of radiated energy, and the
          transition mechanism, we do in fact have the understanding of
          how this universe is put together and how it operates. Using
          the principles already understood we can explore all the many
          and varied manifestations of matter and energy, and understand
          just what goes on. Here and there we can confirm our
          understanding by reference to experiment, in the full
          knowledge that we will pose our questions correctly, and that
          nature will give us explicit answers.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the evolution of the
          twelve Parameters of the Universe by the Quadrature Concept on
          the Basic Concept in Nothing-At-All, such questions as the
          forces involved and the energy which became apparent did not
          arise. These matters come into beings only when the twelve
          Parameters have been established, and we find that what goes
          on in this universe requires some understanding of these
          factors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A field is a region which
          has a unique characteristic. The unique characteristics of
          fields were established by the operation of the Quadrature
          Concept on the Space Fabric and then in turn on the fields as
          each was established. In the earlier stages of this
          development, before the application of the parameters higher
          than the Sixth, we could not discern the presence of these
          factors in the amorphous background of the field and space
          fabrics; only the Reality which had been established.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Subsequent applications of
          the Quadrature Concept provided Control and Percipitation, but
          none of the Fabrics added anything beyond what existed in
          Nothing-At-All as perceived by Awareness, and all Reality
          which existed or can exist was provided by the Creator in that
          original state. Awareness merely established how it was
          arranged to establish the universe as we know it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We generally think of a
          Force as something which pulls or pushes against some sort of
          resistance, and as such have a pretty fair, but superficial,
          idea of what it is. In the establishment of the Space Fabric,
          Force is what stretched a Point into a Line and kept it there,
          and what pulled a line out sideways to make an area and held
          it there, and what pushed the area apart into a volume and
          sustained it. Force provided the means by which the density of
          Reality in Space was adjusted to form the Tempic Field, and
          the means by which the Tempic Field was given a Divergence to
          establish the Electric Field and the means by which the
          Electric Field was given a Curl to establish the Magnetic
          Field, and the means by which these fields were sustained.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Force, in turn establishes
          the parameters of the Control Fabric and the Percipitation
          Fabric, and makes possible the establishment of Matter and
          Energy as we know them. In other words, each operation with
          the Quadrature Concept involves a Force arrangement, and the
          magnitude and significance of each of the Forces depends on
          the manipulation carried out and the Fabric in which it is
          being done. Conversely, forces always develop whenever Reality
          is modified, and always in the Fabric where the modification
          takes place. It takes the combined manipulation of all three
          Parameters in any one Fabric to extend a force into another
          Fabric, which, needless to say, is a rather special
          arrangement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We say that Energy is the
          ability to do work, or the ability to establish a force which
          will operate against a resistance over a certain prescribed
          distance, but these ideas are not quite basic enough to relate
          Force with the basic Reality. Looking at a region of unit size
          in which there is a field, we note that this field came into
          being because of the Quadrature Concept, a Force, and is being
          sustained by this Force. The Unique Characteristic which
          describes this field says that there is s difference between
          opposite sides of the unit region, in the direction of the
          field and therefore the field must be stressed against itself
          in this direction and therefore the Reality so expressed is
          the product of the field intensity with itself, and the total
          Reality within the total field will be the integrated value of
          this "Field Intensity Squared" over the entire space occupied
          by the field, bearing in mind the half-in-half-out
          relationship of Form. Or we can concern ourselves with the
          Reality or Energy within a limited region only and perform the
          integration over that region. There is a very interesting
          factor which enters the picture at this point called the
          Principle of Inversion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If a region is selected in
          which there are two fields of the same kind, same magnitude
          and same direction, such that very nearly half the Reality of
          each is within the region, then the two fields are just on the
          edge of becoming coherent. If the fields are not coherent the
          total energy in the region is the sum of the energies of the
          two fields, i.e., twice the square of the field intensity of
          each integrated over the region. If, however, the fields are
          coherent, the total energy is the square of twice the field
          intensity integrated over the region, or twice the energy of
          the two fields incoherent! This relationship is most
          significant as it represents the "packing energy" of the bits
          and pieces in atomic nuclei, and also points the way to the
          precipitation of energy out of the cosmic background.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we take a look at the
          mechanics of matter we find some interesting relationships.
          Kinetic energy, or energy of change, is one half the mass
          times the velocity squared. But the velocity is the reciprocal
          of the gradient of reality or the tempic field, from which it
          appears that the energy is one half the mass times the tempic
          field intensity squared, integrated over the region involved
          in the change. If the mass is taken as the density of reality
          times the volume it occupies the fact that twice as much
          energy appears indicates that the fields making up matter are
          coherent. This again is an important relationship as it
          pertains to the chopping up of matter.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The twelve Parameters of the
          Universe are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
          establishment of our Universe as we know it, and together with
          the unique position of Awareness forms our entire experience
          in this physical world. All of which we are or can be aware
          are expressable in terms of these twelve Parameters.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity is a phenomenon with
          which we have daily experience but which we haven't earned
          very much about, working backwards as we do from effect to
          cause. The fact that objects fall when given an opportunity to
          do so, experiencing an acceleration which appears to have very
          nearly the same value on this planet for all falls, leads us
          to the conclusion that it is somehow an inertial phenomenon.
          The added fact that ordinary manipulations appear not to
          affect gravity leads to the conclusion that somehow gravity is
          inherent in matter itself. By studying the effects of gravity
          and keeping close track of the numerical quantities involved
          we have established some rules respecting forces, energy and
          interactions, all of which allow us to work with gravity as we
          find it, but there it stops.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since matter and energy are
          manifestations of Reality entirely within the Twelve
          parameters, we must look for explanations of their behavior
          within the structure of these parameters, and regardless of
          any ideas to the contrary this is where we will find it!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The field fabric sets up
          three, and three only, fields which are capable of exercising
          forces on the field structures which constitute matter and
          energy, so gravity must be due to the operation of one or more
          of these three fields. The fact that observation indicates
          that gravity falls off as the inverse square of the distance
          indicates that it is essentially an electric field,
          divergence. The fact that we cannot cancel it out by the
          application of the electric fields to which we have access is
          due to the fact that we cannot make the canceling field
          coherent, and the best we can do is to integrate the effects
          of the fields, not the fields themselves, to produce an
          opposing force in a limited region.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inertial approach
          involves the application of a particular tempic field
          gradient, carefully adjusted so that its effects are
          consistent with observation, but this implies certain
          flexibilities in the space fabric inconsistent with its
          established linear nature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another inertial concept of
          gravity is the all-pervading micro-particular gas, the units
          of which impinge on matter and through an exchange of momentum
          press the matter together. The difficulty of this concept is
          the necessity for explaining the inflow of energy to matter
          and implies either an energy sink within matter or an obscure
          energy exchange phenomenon between the regions within and
          without matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the basic particle was
          being considered, it was established that four kinds of
          particles were possible: right hand and left hand spin and
          right hand and left hand precession, which gave particles
          having positive charges with plus and minus increments, but
          all having the same magnetic moments and tempic fields. Within
          these particles, and within systems made up of them as atoms,
          etc., there is field coherence, so that there are specific
          values for these fields determined by the particles
          themselves, and outside of them the fields will also be quite
          specific.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Looking at the model of the
          basic particle it is noted that the electric field is a
          dynamic condition resulting from the mutual interaction of the
          three basic fields. But since the tempic field is a gradient
          it is in itself not "motional", and the radial component of
          the electric field being divergence and having no component
          along either of the tempic field gradient directions also is
          not motional, and these fields are essentially static so long
          as the particle itself doesn't move or change. However, the
          skew component of the electric field, due to the precession,
          does have a component along a tempic field gradient and is
          motional. Therefore, field coherence is possible within the
          static structure due to spin, but not within the dynamic
          structure due to precession, unless the configuration is such
          that the skew field can comply with the half-and-half Form
          condition.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is fairly obvious from
          the foregoing that only matter having the same direction of
          precession will assemble into large aggregates, first, because
          of the selective action of the differences in forces resulting
          from the differences in electric charges, and second, because
          the interpenetration of particles of opposite precession will
          introduce an asymmetry in the system resulting in its
          immediate conversion into radiated energy. There are, however,
          a few special configurations where fairly large aggregates are
          involved where the initial fields already had an asymmetry
          which could be offset by the asymmetry introduced by the
          particle with the reversed precession and the whole system may
          be stable. Consequently, in the evolution of our universe we
          would expect a separation process to take place which would
          result in matter of essentially the same precession
          congregating together, and a fairly quick conversion to
          radiated energy of particles of opposite precession which
          happened to wander into such regions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In considering the
          integration of basic particles to form the larger units of
          matter, there is a slight advantage for the particles with the
          larger total electric charge to so integrate, because suitable
          configurations will permit coherence of the skew fields. In
          any aggregate system such as a planet, there is bound to be a
          continual circulation of particles, both basic and composite,
          so that after many cycles of such circulation most of the big
          ones congregate in the nuclei and the little ones take up
          outer positions. This is the condition which we find now, as
          we inspect the matter to which we have access.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the forementioned
          separation has taken place and most of the particles of
          opposite precession have been eliminated, we find that the
          system contains nuclei having one specific charge with
          electron shells having the opposite charge. The matter on
          planet Earth has positive charges dominant in the nucleus and
          negative charges in the shells, and as free particles.
          Elsewhere in the universe there will be an aggregate of the
          converse relationship.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An aggregate of matter such
          as we have on Earth, where the sort-out is reasonably
          complete, will be electrically neutral so far as the electric
          fields are concerned, and may or may not have a magnetic
          moment depending on how random is the orientation of the
          various particles, again determined by the summation of the
          effects of the fields, and a tempic field which will be the
          direct scalar summation of the many contributing tempic
          fields. It will also have the skew electric fields of the same
          polarity as the nuclei.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the exception of the
          skew fields, all the other external fields of the aggregate
          may be considered as static because they have no component of
          the tempic field at right angles to them. The skew fields, on
          the other hand, are dynamic because they do have a quadrature
          tempic field component. Furthermore, the skew fields are
          largely incoherent simply because the normal almost random
          orientation precludes their meeting the half-in requirement of
          Form to become coherent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the skew fields do
          have a tempic field component at right angles, they will
          generate an electric field throughout the entire region, of
          the same polarity as the static electric field to which they
          are additive. Such an aggregate may be considered as having
          two electric fields, one of which is subject to cancellation
          by surrounding electric particle fields, and the other not so
          subject. Partial cancellation is possible, and if the
          aggregate is left to its own devices will be attained, by a
          surrounding shell of particles of the opposite polarity, so
          that externally to the entire system the effects of the fields
          will be a minimum and electrically neutral.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, if another
          aggregate of similar precession enters the vicinity, such
          cancellation can no longer be approximated, and the skew field
          induces an electric field within this aggregate which amounts
          to an electric field distortion or "polarization". A
          convenient way of discussing what happens is to consider the
          skew fields and the polarization in terms of electric
          "charges" even though this concept is not strictly correct.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the primary aggregate is
          considered to have a charge which induces the polarization in
          the secondary aggregate, this polarization will be equivalent
          to a charge displacement such that the product of the
          displaced charges and the distance through which they are
          displaced will be a statement of the amount of polarization
          This will be located in the electric field of the primary
          aggregate and will have two forces acting which will be
          numerically equal; one maintaining the polarization and the
          other between the polarization and the primary field.
          Therefore, the net force will be the product of the primary
          field divergence and the square of the polarization in the
          secondary aggregate. There are of course other ways of
          establishing this relationship but they all say the same thing
          in other words, which is that Gravity is a dynamic field
          function and is the product of the gravitational field
          divergence and the square of the polarization induced in the
          attracted bit of matter, with the gravitational field being
          merely the skew electric field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the mathematician the
          following is offered:</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" height="94" width="391"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Polarization in the
          attracted bit is q(q dr)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Equating forces q(q dr) =
          Qq/r<sup>2</sup> + Qq/(r + dr)<sup>2</sup></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity F= Qq/r<sup>2</sup>
          + Qq/(r + dr)<sup>2</sup> = (q dr)<sup>2</sup> 1/r</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having established the
          nature of Gravity and is "formula", we may now see what can be
          done with it. Since it is essentially an electric field
          phenomenon, albeit not an electrostatic one, its distribution
          and behavior will be much the same as any other electric
          field, except for its dynamic characteristic. Altering the
          polarization will alter the force exerted by gravity, but
          because this is a square relationship, no such alteration can
          make the force negative (operate in the opposite direction).
          However, altering the divergence will alter both the magnitude
          and direction of the force, and the trick for controlling
          gravity is precisely this.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the gravitational
          field is due to the skew electric field, or stated
          differently, to the induction from the motional electric
          field, this is the logical region to explore for the mechanism
          by which fields may be produced to combine with the
          gravitational field to produce a resultant having a divergence
          more to our liking.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In taking a quick look at
          the gravitational relationships of the basic particles alone
          there are some interesting aspects. Since in an established
          region practically all the precessions are the same, the free
          particles will have a motional field of polarity the same as
          the particles making up the composite ones, and therefore they
          will be "repelled" by gravity. This repulsion, however, will
          be quite a bit less than the electrostatic attraction, so a
          compromise position will be established at such a distance
          that everything will be in equilibrium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the atomic structure
          there are therefore the electric field forces holding the
          electrons onto the nucleus, the magnetic forces fixing them in
          position, the gravitational forces tending to push them away
          and resulting in a compromised location, with the tempic field
          contributing to the dynamic conditions within and contiguous
          to the structure. All these forces have been developed from
          the basic concepts already put forward and are possible of
          confirmation by experiment if we ask nature the right
          questions. These same forces extend beyond the atom into
          molecular chemistry, crystal forms, and amorphous aggregates.
          These dame forces exist within the atomic nuclei together with
          others resulting from the interpenetration of the fields and
          their coherence. Matter, though magnificently complex is
          elegantly simple in its basic structure when understood.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we consider the fraction
          2/3 we see that we are comparing the number 2 with the number
          3. Nothing is said about the reality to which each number
          applies, beyond the implication that both numbers apply to the
          same reality. If, however, they do not apply to the same
          reality, then one of two things result: i.e., a conversion
          must be made or we agree that we cannot deal with the
          situation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suppose we are considering 2
          apples and two pears. They are both fruit and have many
          features in common. The fraction 2/3 tells us that of the 5
          fruit, 2 are of one kind and 3 are of another, and that we
          have 2/3 as many of one kind as we have of the other, and 3/2
          of the converse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we rewrite the fraction
          in the following form 2/3|5 this nomenclature will tell us all
          of the above in one glance; namely, that we have 5 articles,
          having a factor in common which we are comparing, and that we
          have 2 of one kind and 3 of the other. Written 3/2|5 tells us
          precisely the same thing except that the order of comparison
          is reversed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we write i2/j3|5 we
          realize at once that 2 somethings lie along the x axis and 3
          somethings lie along the y axis, but that we are considering
          their numerical values only.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we write i2/j3|5 we
          realize that we are comparing two vectors in a quite normal
          manner. In fact, we are so familiar with vectors that the mere
          presence of the i and j notation tell us the whole story with
          respect to these two vectors. Therefore, the vertical line and
          what is to the right of it may properly be omitted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider next the problem of
          zero and infinity. If we define infinity as the largest number
          in which we have any interest and zero as the smallest number
          in which we have any interest, and if we maintain exactly the
          same degree of interesting both, then unity must lie exactly
          halfway between our zero and infinity. We may tell this story
          in our nomenclature as follows: 0/00|1 or 00/0|1.</font> </p>

          there are unrelated aspects, then dy/dx implies that only the
          related aspects are being considered. To a limited extent we
          get around this difficulty by "conversion factors" or scale
          constants, but these means do not allow us to cross the gap
          between one type of reality to a totally different type.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we write sy/dx|A we are
          saying that A describes the relationship between y and x which
          we are to consider. This relationship may be ANYTHING.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foregoing, though
          interesting, is not essential to the handling of ordinary
          concepts and their mathematics. However, there are certain
          transcendental concepts which do not lend themselves to a
          mathematical analysis unless we use such devices to orient
          them within the framework of the mathematics we have learned
          to understand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are all familiar (or
          think we are) with the term "NOW" meaning the present. We
          speak of the past, present and future and consider "now" as
          the bracket in time with which we are immediately concerned.
          However, no matter how precisely we define it we cannot
          establish exactly what the present or now really is, except
          that it is vaguely a dividing point between the past and the
          future. Nevertheless, we know quite well instinctively that we
          are living in the present and it is a perfectly real and
          satisfactory situation. Furthermore, we are advised that, to a
          disembodied entity, the present is the complete reality and
          the past and future merely arrangements of events in the
          broadest sense.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we write Future - Past =
          Now, we are saying that "Now is a very small differential
          between two very large items". A more proper expression is:
          Future - Past/Now|90 where we show that the present is
          actually in quadrature with the Future-Past, and hence need
          not be a small differential at all, but can assume the
          proportions which we instinctively know it to possess.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we use the symbol Q for
          this quadrature concept we can write the above as:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><u>F - P</u>| Q</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp; N</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">which tells us the whole
          story regarding this relationship and leaves us satisfied that
          it is all in the proper perspective.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We know that spin itself,
          the divergence of spin and the curl of spin are all mutually
          at right angles. Therefore, any inter-comparison between the
          three fields presented by these quantitites should properly be
          written with the Q concept included:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">De/dm|Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          dm/dt|Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dt/de|Q</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Incidentally, our
          observation of these three fields is always in quadrature.
          This is quite apparent with respect to time as set forth
          above, but a little consideration is necessary to appreciate
          that it also applies to the other two basic fields as well.
          This concept is even more necessary when learning to
          appreciate the higher dimension. Without it we cannot deal
          mathematically with the relationship between fields and, say,
          free will.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here it should be emphasized
          that the Q concept extends beyond mere quadrature, or kind. It
          actually embraces the relationships existing among whole
          families of aspects of reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider the twelve
          dimensions of Deity, oriented in four fabrics of three each.
          Ordinarily one would not consider any dimensional relationship
          to exist, say, between the electric field and probability, but
          these are truly related through the Q concept. In fact, the Q
          concept is the only relationship which does in fact exist
          between the various dimensions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again, we have defined a
          field as any region which has a unique characteristic. If we
          extend our concept of a region to include the abstract as well
          as the spatial idea, then all twelve of the dimensions become
          fields. Admitting this, the Q concept must exist between the
          various dimensions incorporated in the analysis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us look at an example:</font>

          both sides, and everything on each side, refer to the same
          aspect of reality or a Unity relationship exists between all
          of the components. Note the resemblance of this equation to
          certain electromagnetic wave equations, which are in fact
          particular cases of this general case.</font> </p>

The

            Structure of Meaning</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meaning is something which
          we generally take for granted. It is something with which we
          live day by day and which we usually have no occasion to
          define. In fact, a strict definition might be exceedingly
          difficult to evolve. To try to attach a meaning to meaning is
          very much like trying to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps.
          We could say that meaning is a way of conveying understanding,
          or that understanding results from the successful of meaning.
          Understanding itself is something that begs definition.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our knowledge of the
          physical world is acquired in two ways: by physical
          experience, and by conveyance of meaning by others. In either
          case it can have two results. The knowledge can simply be
          stored to be regurgitated on demand, or it can be understood.
          There is a vast difference between these two aspects. In the
          first case the action is much like a phonograph or the memory
          box in an electronic brain. The stored data is usable only in
          the precise form in which it was deposited, any change
          whatsoever being tantamount to error. In the second case,
          however, since the data is understood, it can be used in any
          form whatsoever and in any combination with other data which
          is understood.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obviously, understanding is
          enormously more useful than mere memory storage. Where memory
          bits can be used only one by one, or in combinations which
          have been established in memory, understanding permits use in
          all sorts of permutations and combinations: "The greatest
          wealth which can be acquired by man, is a complete
          understanding" (A-lan).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An example may be used to
          illustrate these points. Of a blind person who has never
          enjoyed the use of his eyes were handed a lemon and told that
          it was yellow, he could feel its shape, texture, hardness and
          smell or taste it. Thereafter, if handed a similar object he
          would be fairly capable of telling someone else that it was a
          lemon and that it was yellow. However, he probably would have
          no understanding of yellow.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three things are necessary
          to understanding, that is for data to have meaning. First, the
          data must actually reach the recipient accurately, and this is
          not nearly as easy as it looks. It must reach him either
          through his physical senses, or through direct mind contact,
          both of which are subject to distortions. Second, the
          recipient must be coded to receive the information. That is,
          each bit of information must be significant to him; it must
          have its own meaning in its own right. Third, the recipient
          must be able to process the data, which is the fitting of it
          together until it becomes an integrated whole, which is
          meaningful and self-consistent. To these three major steps may
          be added a fourth, which is essentially the cross-checking of
          meaning with others who have been exposed to the same data.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There exist many aids to
          understanding, such as formal logic, mathematics, computers,
          and methods of thinking which in themselves are close to
          intuition. In what follows, use will be made of any and all
          aids to understanding. However, it cannot be stressed too
          strongly that in nature there are certain fundamentals upon
          which all else is predicated, and an understanding of the more
          complex cannot be attained until the fundamentals are
          completely understood. And this does not mean merely
          committing to memory certain formulas that appear to work.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When properly understood,
          this universe in which we find ourselves is beautifully
          simple. It is not at all the mathematical monstrosity with
          which we are accustomed to deal in our conventional science.
          True, the basic principles are foreign to our scholastic
          training, but they are strictly ion accordance with what we
          know instinctively to be true. We are actually born with a
          better understanding of our universe than we boast of after a
          college graduation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In formal geometry we base
          our reasoning on certain axioms, which we hold to be
          self-evident truths. The fact that we can build an integrated,
          meaningful, and self-consistent whole on these axioms gives us
          confidence in them. What would our attitude be if we found
          that the farther we advanced in geometry the more corrections
          we had to apply to make things come out right? We most
          certainly should question the validity of our precious axioms,
          or our methods, or both.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our conventional science
          we have assumed certain things to be self-evident, and we have
          built a very complicated structure on them. We actually are
          finding, however, that we have to apply more and more
          corrections to make our philosophy work. In fact, we now apply
          so many corrections that we have formed the habit and consider
          that to do so is perfectly natural and in the orderly course
          of events. We are so far along this road that it is difficult
          even to look back, let alone to return to our axioms for a
          reappraisal and maybe a fresh start.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In what follows a complete
          new start is attempted. No apology will be made for this
          approach, and no explanations will be given beyond those
          believed to be necessary for an understanding of the subject.
          As a matter of fact, a useful preliminary ceremony would be a
          good brain washing. It should be remembered that no one can
          really teach; they can only help others to learn.</font> </p>

The

            Rectilinear Concept</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a first consideration let
          us consider what space appears to be to us. We have no doubts
          about its volumetric nature although we have no senses by
          which we can observe this condition. We conclude that space is
          volumetric by the nature of things which we find in it. What
          would it be like if everything were removed from space? Would
          we even have space?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Can we conceive of a space
          structure completely devoid of matter or energy in any form;
          real empty space? What would such space be like? If we were
          disembodied entities located in such a space, how could we
          identify our position or describe where or how we were? What
          sort of yardstick could we use? These and many more similar
          questions must be faced squarely by those seeking
          understanding.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When one has satisfied
          himself by actually doing it that he can conceive of space
          with absolutely nothing in it, and is not too terrified of his
          creation, he is then in a position to take the next step,
          namely to find his way about in it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An arbitrary decision can be
          made to refer all concepts to where the investigator conceives
          himself to be, thereby establishing a point. He can next
          conceive of an adjacent point, thereby establishing a line. By
          turning in various directions he can establish the concepts of
          surfaces and volumes. But no matter what he does after that,
          the investigator cannot add more concepts to the space itself.
          He therefore concludes that what he instinctively felt soon
          after he first conceived the empty space, that it was
          volumetric, and nothing more, is correct.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foregoing is actually an
          exercise in mental gymnastics, but as physical exercise is
          necessary for body-building, so are these exercises necessary
          for the building of understanding. It is absolutely necessary
          to satisfy oneself on these points before going on to the next
          concept.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next step is to conceive
          of a way of getting about in this empty space, and to realize
          that one has done so when the operation is complete. The
          concept of an adjacent position, or point, is a good approach,
          and here again the operation becomes one of mental gymnastics,
          and a lot of manipulation and practice is necessary to get the
          feel of the situation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As one gains in
          understanding of the properties of space, the various
          geometries become evident, and it becomes increasingly obvious
          that a wide variety can be made to work, if certain basic
          parameters are admitted. However, since our concern is
          primarily with our space and our universe, we will want to
          select the geometry that best fits our experience.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ordinary Euclidean or
          rectilinear geometry is quite familiar and comprehensible to
          us, and we can understand easily how it can be applied to
          space as we conceive it. We can understand a sideways,
          forwards-backwards, up-down concept, or expressed
          mathematically, and x, y and z axis. Also, we experience no
          great difficulty in conceiving of these three axes as
          converging at right angles to a single point and extending
          outward therefrom to enormous distances. We can even introduce
          the idea of infinity in any direction as being somewhat beyond
          the farthest distance in which we have any interest.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our rectilinear concept
          we can conceive of such a thing as a straight line, although
          we might be hard put to define it, since the concept is in
          itself axiomatic. However, if we understand what a straight
          line actually is in our concept and we are sure that others
          with whom we communicate also have the same understanding, we
          can use it as a real datum point in our appreciation of our
          universe. This point is of particular significance in what is
          to follow, as it is one of the few solid anchors we have on
          which to fasten our understanding. Let us never lose sight of
          this concept of a straight line, as entirely distinct from the
          behavior of matter or energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our rectilinear concept at
          once validates our Euclidean geometry. Furthermore, it removes
          any limitations which might be imposed on it by either great
          or small distances. It provides us with a clear-cut framework
          within which we can think our way about in space. We should
          satisfy ourselves that this concept actually is a necessary
          and sufficient condition for this purpose, although we
          remember that its selection was arbitrary and that other
          geometries probably would work just as well. However, since we
          have made our decision to use the rectilinear concept, we must
          be prepared to stick to our decision unless and until proved
          wrong. As a matter of fact, any geometry can be used, and will
          work within the limiting parameters of its definitions. It is
          only when extended beyond these limits that corrections become
          necessary, but even with the corrections the geometry itself
          does not become invalid, only the things we expect it to do.</font>

            Relativity of Measurement</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our concept of space one
          of our first needs is for methods of measurement. We want to
          fix distances and directions, and we want to be sure that what
          we measure stays measured at the value we measure. We can
          agree upon some arbitrary distance between two points of which
          we can conceive, and make our measurements in terms of this
          distance as a unit, or standard, if you please. But can we be
          sure that the two points which form our standard stay put? And
          would it actually make any difference if they didn't? Is there
          any characteristic of our space which would tell us if our
          standard changed? As a matter of fact, if there were, such a
          property itself would make an excellent standard. We are
          forced to the conclusion that, (a) absolute distances in space
          as determined by properties of space cannot exist, all
          measurements being relative to some arbitrary standard, and
          (b) so long as ALL the measurements in which we are interested
          are made relative to the same arbitrary standard, it doesn't
          matter if they do change, as we have no way of knowing anyway.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To get ahead of ourselves a
          bit, we might discuss the use of the so-called constant
          quantity, the velocity of light, as a standard of distance.
          This implies two assumptions: (a) that some quantity, time, is
          fixed somehow so that a measurement can be made relative to
          it, and (b) that we can be sure that light will behave in a
          ladylike manner with respect to our rectilinear geometry. At
          first this may seem to be an attractive way out, but a little
          consideration will show that it merely trades one difficult
          problem for two more which are inherently just as difficult.
          These maters will form the subject of a later section where it
          will be shown that the problem is even more complex than
          appears above. Fortunately, there is a solution which is at
          once simple and satisfying, but a good deal of preliminary
          conditioning must be endured before this concept can be
          understood.</font> </p>

          completely empty space and satisfied ourselves regarding the
          geometry of it and the limitations of measurement which are
          inherent in it, we may quite properly ask ourselves, how real
          it is it? Does our space, the space which surrounds us,
          actually have these characteristics? We know that our space
          contains lots of things we consider as quit real, and we may
          ask of what are they made, and what is their basic reality?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To conceive of an abstract
          quality and assign to it concrete properties and then call it
          a real substance is most unsatisfactory in the face of our
          notions regarding everyday matter. We would much prefer to
          have something more tangible as a starting point.
          Consequently, even though reality actually is a concept just
          as intangible as our rectilinear concept, it might assist
          understanding if some primordial quantity could be introduced
          as a medium of expression. The early postulation of ether and
          the still earlier Greek Ylm might fulfill this requirement.
          Both were considered to be all-pervading strictly continuous
          substances out of which matter was fabricated, and to have
          whatever properties were necessary for the formation of
          matter, without regard to how conflicting these properties
          might be. There is no fundamental objection to the use of such
          a medium of expression, since we will find that all references
          to it actually cancel out anyway. However, if it will serve as
          a crutch to help us in our first faltering steps, by all mean
          let's use it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our considerations of Ylm
          or ether we have something that is structureless,
          imponderable, and without boundaries, and in every sense
          intangible. Our concept of space provides a place in which we
          can conceive of the ether as being located, but by what
          manipulation can we convert this imponderable substance into
          ponderable matter?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instinctively we know that
          we must make use of space as we have it, and that which we
          find therein, if we are to designate reality as distinct from
          the continuous background of ether. If we cannot designate
          some portion of the ether as being unique and distinguishable
          from all the rest, then we cannot say that we have established
          any degree of reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is required then is for
          us to conceive of something which may be done, some
          manipulation which when completed will designate without
          uncertainty a certain region as being unique above all others,
          and therefore real. Ordinary spatial measurement we know to be
          inadequate since they are all relative to the arbitrary
          standard with which they were measured. Obviously what is
          needed is something which in itself is absolute: something
          that will display the same value no matter where or how it is
          inspected, something against which a measurement may be made
          with assurance that when made it will not change. Furthermore,
          to assume the arbitrary injection of such a standard merely
          begs the question, since we transfer the question of reality
          from the substance to the yardstick that measured it, without
          yet establishing the reality of the yardstick. No, we must
          find that for which we seek in our concept of space itself.</font>

            The Concept of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is one, and only one,
          concept that is absolute in its own right in rectilinear
          space, and that is the concept of spin. The word should be
          understood in the sense of a manipulation, or process,
          performed within the concept of space as we have conceived it,
          or performed on the ether within it. Either approach is valid.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;Imagine two points in
          rectilinear space, with a straight line joining them. Imagine
          that another line which started out coincident with the first
          is swung around one of the points until it is again coincident
          with its initial position. Something has been done, once, and
          the concept of it having been done is established. No matter
          how big or small our region may become relative to some
          yardstick, the rotation once around remains the same. So also
          are absolute, multiple and factional rotations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is at once apparent that
          this concept of spin, extended through a place rotating about
          a line, and extending to infinity can be made to encompass our
          entire concept of rectilinear space. We can fill all space
          with a single spin, or any portion thereof, or we can fill it
          with many spins. Furthermore, we can conceive of the many
          spins being oriented in many ways, and having many manners of
          distribution. But the important thing to understand is that a
          region which is spinning is distinguishable from regions which
          are not, and that the actual spin is independent of any
          arbitrary standard of measurement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it must be
          noted that nothing is said about the rate of spin; only that
          spin takes place. Earlier we toyed with a concept of time
          which we held in abeyance because the concept added nothing to
          our concept of space and only posed more problems than it
          solves. We do not need to introduce time so long as we
          recognize the intervals of spin; that is, the relative angles
          of displacement at each comparative measurement. Understanding
          this point is vital to an understanding of spin. It will be
          shown later that time is a consequence of spin, and not
          something by which spin may be measured.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having established the
          absolute nature of spin we may next question its reality. By
          reality, we understand the ability to distinguish the reality
          from all else, to be able to say what it is and what it is
          not, to say where it is and where it is not, to make it
          interact with other reality. In other words, reality is
          something which we can place in a definite mental compartment
          with reasonable assurance that it will remain there. We want
          to be able to think about reality as a unit, and not have it
          mixed up with or overshadowed by unreality, or unresolved
          background. If a concept meets these requirements reasonably
          well, we are reasonably happy with it and prepared to consider
          it as real. If we are to understand the reality of spin we
          must satisfy ourselves that it actually does met these
          criteria. Much of what follows is developed with this end in
          view, and in recognition of the fact that it may be difficult
          to accept the status of reality for something which seems to
          be merely a mental manipulation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even though the concept of
          spin may not be too acceptable at first as a basic reality,
          when its many properties are explored and found to coincide
          with observed properties of matter, and when from these
          properties may be predicted the laws which we know matter to
          follow, the status of spin most certainly will be enhanced and
          with increased understanding will come greater confidence in
          the beautiful simplicity of the rectilinear concept of space
          within which spin manifests as the basic reality. In fact, we
          will find that we need no further foundations upon which to
          build our complete understanding of the material universe with
          all its glittering apparent complexity.</font> </p>

            The Spin Mechanism</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The concept of spin is
          fundamental in nature and is the only concept in nature which
          is absolute in its own right. The idea of spin has associated
          integrally with it the idea of units, multiples and fractions
          of complete revolutions, and these units are completely
          independent of any yardstick with which they may be measured.
          We can conceive of enormously large and enormously small
          numbers and these are applicable directly to spin, and have
          exactly the same significance with respect to any particular
          spin to which they may be applied.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Within any interval of
          attention spin may make many revolutions, one revolution only,
          or even a minute fraction of a revolution, without losing in
          any way its absolute nature. In fact, within any interval of
          attention, it need not actually turn at all, but merely
          display a tendency to turn, or be ready to turn. Or again,
          using our familiar concept of time (which incidentally we
          shall have to modify severely), we could say that one
          revolution completed in eternity would still be valid. On
          other words, there are no intrinsic limits imposed on spin,
          and we can think about it exactly the same way as we can think
          about any pure number, for that is precisely what it is: the
          basic number of our material universe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our concept of
          rectilinear space we conceived of a single spin being present,
          centered about a point and extending out indefinitely far,
          perhaps to infinity. We satisfied ourselves that it could
          involve all of our space, and probably would unless we chose
          to prescribe arbitrary boundaries, which could be relative to
          some arbitrary yardstick at best. So now we can do two things:
          study the structure of a single spin, and then the interaction
          of a plurality of spins, because we know by our experience
          with this physical universe that spins do interact.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it might be
          well to make a blatant statement, and leave the derivation of
          it until much later, in order to facilitate understanding of
          what this discussion of spin is leading up to. Since spin is
          the only concept which we have in this universe which is
          absolute, it is fairly obvious that it must be the primordial
          building material of matter and energy, and a unit of spin
          must be the basic unit of these manifestations. All that we
          have in this material universe, whether matter or energy, is
          made up of spin, various units of which are fitted together in
          manners becoming to each and every form of matter or energy
          with which we are familiar, and many of which we do not even
          yet suspect.</font> </p>

      <p><a name="2.2"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2.2 ~
            The Units</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider first a single spin
          alone in space. Let us inspect it closely to see what we have.
          If our interval of inspection is sufficiently large we sill
          observe it to make one complete revolution, and we can assign
          to that interval one unit, and we may subdivide the unit to
          any extent we please, or we may observe it for a larger
          interval while it makes many revolutions. We have thus defined
          a unit for our interval.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is fairly obvious that
          since linear distances in rectilinear space are purely
          relative, and spin is absolute, the interval of a unit of
          spin, or any fraction or any multiple of it must be precisely
          the same regardless of the relative distance from the center
          of spin that the observation was made. This point is of vital
          importance in the understanding of the origin of time.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Furthermore, uniform
          subdivisions of an interval of spin must all be identical.
          This is almost axiomatic, since if it were not so how could we
          tell anyway?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our conceptions of space
          and spin we must understand that we are not limited in any way
          to numbers in the vicinity of unity. We wish to establish
          relative values of unity to construct useable scales, but
          there is no necessity whatsoever to confine our thinking to
          the middle register of numbers. In fact, we will find that
          nature runs the gamut of numbers from the infinitesimally
          small to the enormously large, for all practical purposes from
          a real zero to a real infinity. Therefore we can construct our
          practical scales where convenient.</font> </p>

            Distribution of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So far, in our conception of
          spin, we have considered it to be distributed uniformly
          throughout our rectilinear space.&nbsp; We have tacitly
          assumed that angular displacement within any interval would be
          constant. However, under this concept it is apparent that the
          farther one goes away from the center of spin, the greater
          will be the actual spin displacement, and the reality of the
          spin will obviously be located anywhere else than at the
          center of spin where we would suppose it to be and where it
          has to be if it is to be consistent with our experience with
          matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While we can conceive of
          many possible distribution of spin, only one is consistent
          with our universe as we find it. We cannot say whether or not
          other real universes can co-exist with ours having spin
          distribution different from that of our universe, but it is
          most unlikely that means would exist to detect them if they
          did. Spin in our universe is almost certainly evenly
          distributed, in that the spin displacement is the same
          regardless of the r elative distance from the center of spin.
          This concept is validated by the fact that conclusions derived
          from it are entirely consistent with our experience with
          matter and energy. If it were not so there would exist voids
          in our universe into which our matter and energy could not
          penetrate, and we know of no such voids although it is quite
          conceivable that they could exist. Certainly within the range
          of our observations on the behavior of matter and energy the
          concept of even distribution of spin displacement appears to
          be valid.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is very important to
          understand what is meant by uniform displacement of spin, as
          this peculiarity of structure is responsible for all the
          characteristics of matter and energy with which we are
          familiar. Imagine a line in space being rotated around a point
          and away from another line through the same point. If both
          lines are straight there will be an increasing angle between
          the, the magnitude of which will be indicative of the spin.
          Bit with uniform displacement of spin in any interval there is
          just as much displacement of the line near to the point about
          which the turning takes place as more remote from it. This is
          a consequence of the relativity of linear measurements, and
          although related to the geometry of the spin must not be
          confused with it. The obvious conclusion is that the interval
          near the center contains more units than the interval farther
          out.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A natural question at this
          point is, just what is this interval about which we have been
          talking? It should be noted that the word time has
          deliberately been avoided, and for a very good reason. It is
          first necessary to establish the interval in terms of spin
          only, so that derivatives of the interval can have an absolute
          status. The interval itself can next be cut up into convenient
          and meaningful units, which are also absolute in nature. If we
          wish, we can call these subdivisions by the name time, but if
          we do we must realize that this time is not quite the same as
          the process which our clocks measure. It is truly the amount
          of spin contained in an interval of attention, and nothing
          more.</font> </p>

          distribution of spin and spin displacement, reference was made
          to an arbitrary interval of attention. The amount of spin in
          this interval signifies the extent of happening, or amount of
          reality present. But since the interval is arbitrary while the

          spin per unit of interval, is spin velocity as referred to a

          interval as time. This quantity, spin velocity or spin
          displacement, is a fundamental concept in nature, and although
          we may use many and varied units for n and i, the quantity
          remains fixed when once defined.</font> </p>

            The Tempic Field</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A field is a region that has
          a unique characteristic. This definition is purposefully broad
          and includes all kinds of fields. It even includes fields of
          grain and battlefields. A broad definition is necessary since
          so far, all we have defined in the universe is a three
          dimensional space (region) and spin (characteristic). But we
          know that our space contains an enormous variety of things,
          all made of spin, and somehow we must explain them all, We
          will have to study all the characteristics of spin in our
          region of interest in order to do this. Therefore, we will
          tackle the job piecemeal and study each field separately, that
          is each spin characteristic manifesting in the region.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the consideration of the
          distribution of spin and in the derivation of the spin
          velocity, it was pointed out that units of subdivision of an
          interval could be defined in terms of spin, and that the
          number of such units was always proportional to the amount or
          quantity of spin present at that point. Consider a region
          about a center of spin, extending as far as we please in all
          directions. The distribution of spin is such that more lies
          close to the center than farther away. Also, the units within
          the interval of attention follow the same distribution. This
          is then a unique characteristic in our region of interest
          qualifying it as a field, and in view of the fact that we may
          associate units of interval subdivision with our ideas of
          time, it would be proper to give this field a name having some
          kind of time significance. We will call it the tempic field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The intensity of the tempic
          field is obviously the number of units of interval subdivision
          associated with the spin that is present at that point. The
          distribution of the field of course follows exactly the
          distribution of the spin that defines it. The more intense the
          tempic field, the larger number of units necessary to express
          it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of its very nature,
          and being located as it is in a rectilinear space, spin must
          be both scalar and vector. That is, there will be a quantity
          of reality that does not involve direction, and various
          characteristics that involve direction as well as magnitude.
          By definition of the units by which spin is measured these
          units must always be positive; therefore it is apparent that
          they cannot have direction, and must be completely scalar in
          nature, but always additive. However, because of the geometry
          of space and the distribution of spin, many of its
          characteristics will be vectorial.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tempic field actually is
          the direct manifestation of spin, and like the reality of the
          spin quantity itself, is a scalar quantity. Its distribution
          throughout the space can, however, have directional properties
          and hence be vectorial. We could say that the tempic field is
          synonymous with the quantity of spin, although it would not be
          quite correct to say that the tempic field and spin were the
          same thing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It would be well to remember
          that the entire concept of interval, subdivisions of interval,
          and tempic field, is necessary to enable us to conceive of
          spin as a real quantity and to make it possible for something
          to happen in our concept of rectilinear space. Our universe
          being what it is, a basic rectilinear or three-dimensional
          matrix, with the only absolute quantity of spin with which to
          populate it, means that regardless of what we might choose to
          call the various manifestations of spin they are none the less
          real and are the building blocks of our matter and energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to determine just
          where reality lies we might perform an interesting
          mathematical operation. Consider a system of spherical
          coordinates centered on our spin center, with q as the
          vertical angle and  as the horizontal angle. Let r equal the
          radius and dv the element of volume.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">dv = r cos q d  r d q dr</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But since the tempic field
          intensity is proportional to I / r, the quantity of spin in
          the element dv is</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">dq = k dv / r<sup>3</sup></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">dq = k cos q d q d  dr / r</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Integrating q = 4pi&nbsp; k
          log<sub>e</sub> r2 / r1</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For unit radius k = 1 / 4pi
          , also note loge 1 = 0</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hence for unit radius one
          half the total spin lies inside a sphere of radius1, and half
          lies outside. Also, the total quantity is 4pi times the
          quantity per unit volume. These figures will be seen to have
          significance later when the various other spin fields are
          considered.</font> </p>

            The Significance of the Tempic Field</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have just satisfied
          ourselves that spin may be described or measured in terms of
          subdivisions of an interval and that these units may properly
          be considered as a field. We have called this field tempic
          field, rather than a time field, because time for us has a
          connotation that is not strictly in accord with the
          characteristics of this field. As a matter of fact, our clocks
          do not measure either time or tempic field; they measure
          entropy changes. If it were not for the fact that so much of
          the matter in our universe is behaving in a most ladylike
          manner, our clocks would indeed by quite erratic. It will be
          shown later that time may be altered through natural processes
          or manipulated by intelligent control.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suppose again that we were
          disembodied entities, but this time located in space near
          where a certain quantity of spin existed. If our psychological
          time sense were reasonably good and we set about to explore
          the region we would find that it took us longer to explore a
          given relative distance near to the spin center than farther
          away from. Also, we would probably notice that if we moved at
          right angles to the line joining our position with the spin
          center it would take us just as long to develop a given angle
          regardless of how far from the spin center we might be. This
          is the true concept of time, reduced to its most basic form.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As disembodied entities we
          are able to prowl around the spin center and investigate its
          many aspects without disturbing it, and in order to understand
          it we must appreciate it as it is, not through a third or
          fourth hand effect as may be shown on some crude indicating
          instrument. When we understand the structure of matter then we
          may devise confirmatory experiments using whatever
          instrumentation we please, but until that understanding is
          attained, the proper tool is the uninhibited mind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our explorations of the
          region surrounding the spin center we would always find some
          spin, and it would always be present. It would never become
          negative or zero, although t might be quite small. But we
          would find that the tempic field intensity s such that it
          could easily fool us in regard to the amount of space which we
          had explored, particularly if we had used an arbitrary
          yardstick to measure it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again, if we used an
          arbitrary yardstick to measure the space, we would find that
          the spin density would be inversely proportional to the
          distance from the spin center, provided that our arbitrary
          yardstick didn't change. We would, however, find that the time
          taken to explore an equal volume close to the center was more
          than that taken to explore the same volume farther away. We
          might jump to the conclusion that time was fixed, and that the
          space was stretched or warped close to the spin center. This
          is precisely what happened when the Theory of Relativity was
          formulated. This theory is quite valid, provided it is used
          only in a region where the tempic field bears a simple
          relation to the relative linear scale; otherwise it can become
          frightfully complicated as all who have struggled through it
          can testify.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Theory of Relativity,
          therefore, is really a special case where Time is held
          constant and everything else is allowed to vary if need be. Is
          it not ever so much simpler to recognize the field nature of
          time and have a rectilinear space which is straight forward
          and easy to understand, than to insist on a constant time with
          its attendant necessity for continually introducing and trying
          to justify such weird concepts as space warps, contractions,
          etc? The fact remains furthermore, that whether we like it or
          not, the tempic field exists and no amount of skepticism will
          make it go away.</font> </p>

            Simultaneity</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In developing the properties
          of spin the term "interval" was used extensively. It was not
          defined except by implication. In fact, it would be most
          difficult to define it except in terms of spin itself. We
          could say, with respect to a single spin center, that an
          interval was a multiple or fraction (or unity) of a complete
          revolution, but this definition would not be valid when more
          than one spin center was under consideration, except in
          special circumstances. It is suggested that understanding is
          more readily attained if the term is always considered in this
          subjective sense, as "interval of attention", and merely
          brackets the extent of our consideration for the matter. This
          may seem to be laboring a point but a full appreciation of the
          term is essential for an understanding of simultaneity.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the tempic field and
          therefore time at any point is the result of the spin
          condition manifesting at that point the concept of
          simultaneity in its usual sense becomes somewhat ambiguous and
          requires redefining. There is no great difficulty when a
          single spin center is considered, or within a region where the
          tempic field is constant, but the matter is not quite so
          simple in other cases.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider first the case of a
          single spin center. Here simultaneity would be established by
          one or more straight lines converging on the spin center. In
          the practical case some means of direct observation or
          communication along such lines is implied. If this is not
          possible, then it is at once apparent that simultaneity cannot
          be established directly and may only be deduced. Subjectively,
          however, we can visualize the spin angle swept out within any
          given interval of attention and declare that simultaneity
          existed throughout that particular spin during that interval.
          It must be carefully noted that this simultaneity is quite
          separate from the amount of time that might have been included
          in the interval in the various parts of the spin, although
          measurable by any of the times.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider next a region that
          is relatively small enough that the tempic field is uniform
          throughout. Here it is fairly obvious that simultaneity exists
          throughout the region. Also, that within any interval of
          attention the amount of time existing is the same for the
          entire region. The surface of the earth very closely
          approximates this condition.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In anticipation of cases to
          be discussed at greater length later, let us turn our
          attention to something of a general case, where the tempic
          field is neither uniform nor follows a simple pattern of
          distribution. Subjectively we can declare that simultaneity
          exists throughout the region within any given interval of
          attention, but how are we to establish this fact? Obviously,
          throughout the region different parts will have different
          amounts of time within the interval, but unless we are able to
          observe all points separately, or have means of communication
          between these points, we will not know when to start counting
          the time at the start of the interval nor when to stop
          counting it at the end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although simultaneity is a
          concept which in itself is not difficult, because of the
          characteristics of spin that make up our universe,
          simultaneity cannot be established unless the interval of
          attention starts with everything in which we are interested
          located at a single point in space and finishes at another
          single point in space. This is probably the most fundamental
          concept in connection with the tempic field, and merely states
          that with respect to time one cannot have a cake and eat it
          too.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suppose two observers
          started out from a point where the tempic field was t1 and one
          went immediately to a region where the field was t2 and the
          other went to a region where the field was t3. Suppose that
          there were three clocks that responded proportionately to the
          tempic fields, one carried out by each of the observers and
          the third remaining at the starting point. Suppose that, after
          a certain interval, both observers returned to the starting
          point and compared notes. They would find that the elapsed
          time as measured by the clocks was closely proportional to the
          fields within which they had been operating, any discrepancies
          being due to the transition periods between the various
          regions. Probably the two observers would disagree violently
          with each other and with the home clock as to how long they
          had been away, but with simultaneity established by common
          points of start and finish of the interval, they would be
          forced to admit that the time change was real. Otherwise, the
          time would appear to be absolute and simultaneity would be
          sacrificed.</font> </p>

            The Divergence of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was shown previously that
          the only reality that we have in our universe is spin. This
          reality is of course both scalar and vector. The total
          quantity of spin is scalar and represents the total quantity
          of reality. The distribution of this reality gives rise to
          another scalar quantity, namely spin density, and also to
          several vector quantities, including gradient, divergence and
          curl. There are also other tensor quantities as well. Spin
          density was shown to have the characteristics of a field, the
          properties of which were identified with a time aspect and the
          field seen to be that which gives rise to our phenomena of
          time, and therefore was called a tempic field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may readily be
          appreciated that since spin is centered about a point and has
          a distribution other than uniform, it must have a divergence.
          This divergence is identical with the result of the
          mathematical operation of the scalar product of the
          differential operator del, or unit differential vector with
          the spin unit itself. The mathematical development will be
          dealt with later when we come to the integration of these
          basic concepts with conventional science. With this subsequent
          analysis it will be shown why the electric field has the
          properties that it displays, and how they got there. Because,
          the divergence of spin is the electric field. Here again we
          have a fundamental principle derived and stated.</font> </p>

      <p><a name="3.4"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.4 ~
            The Curl of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having seen that the
          divergence of spin results from the mathematical operation of
          the scalar product of del and spin, we may next look at the
          vector product of these two quantities. This produces the curl
          of spin, and again the detailed mathematical developments will
          be deferred until we study the properties of the magnetic
          field, because the curl of spin is the magnetic field. This
          may come as something of a shock, particularly in the light of
          certain of our preconceived ideas regarding the structure of
          magnetic fields. However, skepticism has never yet made a fact
          go away, and the magnetic field is still the curl of a spin.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Incidentally, at this point
          we may inject a comment that was directed at our science and
          in particular of our knowledge of magnetism: "Scientists of
          Earth know an amazing number of things about magnetism which
          are not so!", and in the light of the understanding of the
          true nature of magnetism this statement is most appropriate.
          The two things that are possibly closest to our daily lives of
          the entire physical science are magnetism and gravitation, and
          these are the things about which we have the wildest
          misconceptions. One of our queer ideas about magnetic fields
          is that they are made up of lines of force that loop around
          and close on themselves. Undoubtedly we got this idea from
          playing with iron filings and a magnet. What we didn't see,
          however, was what happened inside the magnet. In fact, the
          field does not close on itself and inside the magnet it has
          exactly the same sense of direction as outside. These and many
          more features of the magnetic field will be demonstrated
          later.</font> </p>

            The Gradient of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having considered the
          mathematical operation of the unit vector del on the vector
          aspect of spin to obtain the divergence and curl, and having
          seen the significance of these operations, let us next look at
          the effect or consequence of the operation of del on the
          scalar aspect of spin. It is at once apparent that this will
          yield a gradient of spin and to this we must attach meaning.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have seen the scalar
          aspect of spin to be the parent quantity from which our time
          is derived. The gradient of this quantity is therefore the
          rate of change over time over the incremental distance
          considered and in the direction decreed by the unit vector
          del. In writing this out we have</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G = dt / dx + dt / dy + dt /
          dx = dt / ds</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">where t is the tempic field
          and s the distance in the direction of del. Inverting this
          equation, we have</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1 / G = ds / dt</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">which we recognize
          immediately to be a velocity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course we will at once
          ask the question, if this gradient is the reciprocal of a
          velocity, what is going where? The answer is that one spin
          center in the universe would be unstable and at once expand to
          infinity, but within the structure of our matter, the
          arrangement is such that these gradients precisely cancel each
          other out and stable matter results. This property the gives
          us the clue for the manner in which our matter is built up,
          and in effect is responsible for the ponderable nature of
          matter</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is interesting to note
          the relationship defining momentum, mass times velocity, which
          is, of course, mass divided by the spin gradient. Or, we can
          define mass as the product of the ponderability of matter and
          the spin gradient that produced it. Much more will be said
          about these and other relationships later.</font> </p>

            General Considerations</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have had a superficial
          look at the behaviors of a single spin center and a peek at a
          multiplicity of spin centers. We know that our matter is made
          up of enormous numbers of spin centers, some of which are
          relatively quite close together, so let us now see what
          happens when there are a great many to consider.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the first place, all the
          spin centers could be lined up; that is, their spin vectors
          could all be pointing in the same direction. In this case we
          would say that such matter is "polarized", and we would expect
          different properties than from unpolarized matter in which the
          spin vectors were randomly oriented.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may be readily
          appreciated that at any point the effect of the summation of
          each of the fields due to each individual spin will depend on
          (a) the relative distance from the reference point to each
          spin center, and (b) the relative orientation of the spin
          centers with respect to one another. This consideration is
          apart from any "background" field that may be present.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since spin is both scalar
          and vector, it follows that the scalar components will simply
          add up, while the laws of vector addition will be followed by
          the vector components, with one important additional
          consideration. The scalar addition must be performed before
          the mathematical operations with del are performed to yield
          the field conditions. This consideration is merely stated at
          this stage as being important. Its significance will be
          apparent later, but it has to do with the fact that spin,
          which is what is being operated upon, is in itself the only
          absolute quantity with respect to which the operation may be
          performed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another important
          consideration is to realize that spin centers are exactly what
          their name implies; they are centers about which the units of
          reality function. They are not particles. Therefore, the
          standard equations of vector analysis such as LaPlace's and
          Poisson's equations may not always be valid. These equations
          are derived on the assumption that the entire virtue of a
          particle is contained within the point center and its only
          influence is apparent outside of the point. This is of course
          not the case, as the entire virtue of a spin center actually
          lies completely outside the point center, and may correctly be
          said to be everywhere except within the point.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider first an aggregate
          or cluster of a large by a finite number of spin centers. At
          any point the total spin will be the scalar sum of all the
          individual spins at that point. The total resultant spin
          density will give the tempic field intensity at that point. If
          the reference is very far from the cluster, then the resultant
          tempic field intensity will appear to originate
          (approximately) from a single large spin center coincident
          with the geometry of the cluster. It will be found to vary
          intensely as the distance from this virtual center.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the cluster is approached
          by the reference point, the tempic field intensity increases
          according to the inverse distance law until quite near, when
          it levels off to become nearly constant as the cluster is
          penetrated. The significant point here is that the presence of
          additional spin centers modifies the simple inverse distance
          law of spin distribution around a single spin center.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The exact description in any
          particular case can of course be worked out mathematically but
          at this stage there is little point in doing so as it is only
          part of the story and does not necessarily represent any
          actual condition of spin distribution. In practical cases
          there is always a "background" of tempic field to be
          considered along with the purely local consideration, and in
          addition there may be tempic fields due to "dynamic"
          relationships between the other fields present in the region.</font>

      <p><a name="4.3"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4.3 ~
            Summation of Gradient of Spin</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have seen that the
          gradient of spin has the characteristic of one over a
          velocity; also that the ponderability of matter multiplied by
          the spin gradient gives mass. It is not too difficult to
          conceive of configurations of spin centers that will produce
          extensive regions of reduced spin gradient. In these regions
          the apparent spin velocities become high, but since the
          physical distances involved remain unchanged, and spin
          velocity is constant, the effect is a decrease in the tempic
          field. In other words, holes are formed in the background of
          the tempic field, i.e., there is to all intents and purposes
          negative spin introduced. Surrounding these holes there will
          be represent all the characteristics of new, but negative,
          spin centers with their attendant fields superimposed on the
          fields of the original spin centers that produced the holes.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a matrix of a large
          number of spin centers all oriented in the same direction, it
          is easy to see that there will be very nearly the same number
          of holes formed in the spaces between them. In the microscopic
          sense the gradients balance and the entire mass is stable. In
          the case of a large number of randomly oriented spin centers
          only a few will produce real holes, with the remainder
          producing "virtual" holes. These virtual holes are none the
          less real even though they lie in effect "outside" the spin
          centers responsible for their existence.</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig5.jpg" height="142" width="408"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we look at a pair of spin
          centers that are oriented in the same direction, we find a
          hole developing between them, and a "shell" of increased spin
          developing around them. On the other hand, if they are
          oriented in the opposite direction, a region of increased spin
          develops between them and a shell of reduced spin develops
          around them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here we must be careful to
          maintain a clear concept of what is going on. The scalar
          aspect of spin is its absolute reality and is either present
          or absent. It has no fixed direction or polarity. It adds up
          arithmetically to produce the total amount of reality present.
          The distribution of spin, however, is a function of relative
          position and its derivative, the gradient of spin, also has
          direction in that it is a scalar quantity measured in a
          certain direction. In the foregoing, the basic spin units
          remain unaltered by the presence or absence of other spin
          units, but the field structure associated with them is altered
          by the presence of other spin centers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where holes develop, there
          is no change in the absolute quantity of spin present, only a
          redistribution; a conversion of some spin from positive to
          negative, super-imposed on the background of positive spin.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We may ask what the
          difference is between a real and a virtual hole. A real hole
          develops in "polarized" matter where the gradient of spin is
          reduced in the space between the spin centers and increased in
          the region surrounding the spin centers. Consequently, since
          the ponderability of matter is proportional to the reciprocal
          of the spin gradient, such polarized matter loses
          ponderability while still retaining reality (mass) with
          respect to all outside consideration. A virtual hole develops
          in unpolarized matter and may have almost any distribution
          from a real hole to a completely virtual hole as in the case
          of opposite spin orientation. The one feature in common is
          that of increasing the ponderability of matter with respect to
          outside considerations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where there are available
          large numbers of randomly oriented spin centers patterns of
          real and virtual holes can develop, which when taken together
          with patterns resulting from other field considerations give
          rise to the structure of matter as we know it.</font> </p>
