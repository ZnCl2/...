        <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Dr Hooper:<a name="hooper1"></a>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Your telegram was phoned to me just
          as I was getting ready to go on a field trip to determine the
          electrical conductivity of Lake Ontario, so I grabbed a
          handful of essays, put them in an envelope and sent them off
          to you although I didn’t have time to write. I hope there were
          sufficient copies, if not I have a few more and you are
          welcome to them. You certainly may make of them whatever use
          you can of this material. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We have rebuilt our machine and are
          now about to look for some of the answers to some questions.
          This unit has about 14 ceramic magnets mounted in a groove cut
          in a ¼ inch thick 6 inch diameter disc. We haven’t yet run it
          up to full speed as we are very cautious after the other
          exploding. We don’t expect much from this machine except maybe
          answers to a couple of pointed questions. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our major design effort now is
          looking towards making a magnetic field move without having to
          move the magnets. It should be possible, since we found that
          the converse was true. Also, there are some rules concerning
          fields, which are not in the literature which might be
          exploited to attain this end. We refer in particular to the
          rule that field s can and will remain as separate entities if
          such arrangement has a lower energy level than that of the
          corresponding field structure. Also, we found that magnetic
          fields move only at right angles to their vectorial
          directions, and in strict correspondence with Maxwell’s
          equations. They refuse stubbornly to move in their vectorial
          direction, and apparent motion in this direction is actually a
          folding in or out of the field, always at right angles. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We have drawn up quite a few
          designs to make the field move, but have discarded most of
          them either because the present technology was inadequate to
          do the job, or there was too much uncertainty as to what
          actually would be going on. We have one design which looks
          promising, namely notching a circular DC field with a (1 - cos
          O) function which is rotating and confining the whole in a
          shield so that the lower energy level is attained if the field
          structure rotates. We haven’t tried it yet, and it will
          probably fall before we can test this principle. However, it
          looks promising. </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Dr Hooper,<a name="hooper2"></a>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I want to thank you for your kind
          interest in our gravity work, and to give you an insight into
          our current thinking. I am enclosing a couple of sketches of
          our "gubbine" and what we think is going on around it. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We visualize the magnetic field to
          have somewhat the configuration of the red lines, with
          somewhat more field outside of the ring than inside it. There
          are discontinuities in the magnet structure due to the fact
          that the individual vectors are square, but this seems to be
          an asset rather than a liability as it ensures that the field
          turns with the magnets, since a higher energy level will be
          required to bridge the gap between the [ magnets ? illegible
          word] if it did not turn. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Rotation of the magnet-carrying
          disc causes the field to acquire a velocity throughout its
          structure, said velocity being directly proportional to the
          radius. The v x b will in all cases be at right angles to the
          velocity and the field vector and will be proportional to the
          magnetic field strength and the velocity. We hold that this
          condition will apply within the magnets and outside of them,
          since the magnetic field exists there also. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Following the above reasoning, it
          is apparent that a virtual gravitron will form on the outer
          edge of the magnetic ring and another of opposite polarity on
          the inner edge. The outer gravitron will be somewhat stronger
          than the inner one, and the field configuration will be
          determined by the antecedents of the field (magnitude and
          direction of the magnetic and charge fields, reducing the
          gravitron field). </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, since the entire structure
          is immersed in the earth’s gravitational field, the
          antecedents of which may or may not be compatible with the
          locally generated field, two complexes are possible, within a
          field structure or a field aggregate. Experiment must give the
          answer. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We have considered the use of a
          conventional gravimeter, but we do not think that it would be
          as good as the precision balance. The sensing element in the
          gravimeter is several inches from the bottom of the
          instrument, and since a table of sorts is necessary, it would
          not be possible to get the sensing element within a foot of
          the magnets. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Dr Hooper: </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I am very slow in replying to your
          letter of Oct. 6, but I have really been quite busy. I am
          sorry that I can't seem to explain my views on gravitational
          polarization lucidly, but the trouble is probably with me. I
          shall try to get something worked up to send you but I don't
          quite know where to start. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our work here has been progressing
          slowly because of silly little mechanical troubles. We have
          built 5 commutators to swich the currents to produce a
          rotating field and there has been a serious difficulty with
          each. We are now working on a rolling mercury design which
          looks promising. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We did try to use the rotating
          field from the ceramic magnets to drag around a field produced
          by a coil and current, but there seems to be a problem with
          the compatibility of the antecedents of the fields, because
          the limits within which it will spin are apparently narrow and
          we have not yet been able to determine their magnitude or the
          rules governing this action. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Because of the commutator
          difficulties we have not yet been able to try the big rotating
          field, but we have it all built and if and when we get this
          last bug licked we should be able to look for a few answers...
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Sincerely, <br>
          Wilbert B. Smith </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Mr Rideout,<a name="rideout"></a> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I read your letter of October 23
          with appreciation and some amusement. It is quite apparent
          that my comments on time as a field function did not ring a
          bell. I am well aware that regarding time as a variable places
          modern science in the untenable position of trying to lift
          itself by its bootstraps; but I can only say that these are
          not my ideas but originates with those to whom our science
          resembles medieval superstition. I do not understand them
          fully and I have much to learn, but I have mastered a few
          basic principles and of these I am sure. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Time as a field function is NOT the
          same function as registered by our clocks, which record the
          changing entropy of a system, but is the function which makes
          this happen. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There is only ONE reality in our
          universe, and that is the concept of SPIN, and from this
          derive twelve dimensions. Twelve dimensions are necessary and
          sufficient to express our universe in its entirety. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Dimensions must include, as well as
          their vector direction, the component of reality in that
          direction for without the reality there would be no dimension.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Dimensions are arranged in four
          fabrics of three each, linked by a "quadrature concept". This
          is the structure that Relativity strives for by introducing
          the [square root of -2] between the space and time axis. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The concept of force is a fiction
          which we invented to stultify our thinking. It is merely a
          coverup for our lack of understanding of the interaction of
          reality. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The foregoing will probably sound
          most sacreligious to the ears of orthodoxy, but I don’t mind
          in the least if these ideas are not immediately subscribed to.
          Science has a long and lurid history of reluctance to accept
          ideas which subsequently proved to be of great value. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We are progressing quite well in
          our gravity research, and ran our unit for the first time on
          October 26. The effect was measured on a precision chemical
          balance, when a brass weight increased from 24.4623 grams to
          24.4628 grams when active material ( cubic inch of aluminum)
          was 10 inches directly under the weight. Needless to say we
          have much yet to do and as soon as we have some relationships
          established we will prepare a suitable paper, a copy of which
          I will send you if you are interested. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, don’t be upset about the
          above unorthodox ideas; they either click or don’t click, and
          I am quite satisfied that we will come to them sooner or
          later. </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I am glad that the coil arrived OK,
          but I am sorry that I can tell you very little about it. All I
          know is how to build it and that it worked. Apparently the
          hole down the center of the core is necessary for its proper
          functioning, as is an adequate power input. It will take a
          kilowatt comfortably, without heating at all, and we know that
          it will work on 100 watts, but it won’t work for us on 30
          watts. It just gets hot on the lower power! I don’t know what
          the lower cutoff power is, nor do I know what the boys topside
          told me; "Play with it and learn". </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Don Steadman built a simplified
          gravimeter which I have installed on a solid footing at home.
          It is quite interesting as there have been a couple of time
          field surges during the last month. Also when the Russians let
          off the Big Blast, there was a gravity wave which was so
          strong that it broke the quartz spring in the instrument! If
          the Yanks set off some bigger ones I fear for the
          consequences. People just don’t know about these things. In
          the words of Jesus, "Father forgive them, for they know not
          what they do"... </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I understand that plans are under
          way for a number of trips to pick up earth people for visits
          top-side during this coming few months. You might check with
          any of your contacts to see if they are involved... </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Many thanks for your Dec. 4
          letter... </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In attempting to establish
          communication with the saucers, I can offer very little except
          to use frequencies which will penetrate the ionosphere. We
          have used the call M4 AFFA at frequencies around 20
          megacycles. In this business we are all in the kindergarten
          and all I can say is to try anything and everything until
          something works. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We were told about a system which
          uses a radio transmitter as an energy source but a special
          antenna converter, which radiates doughnut-shaped waves, which
          are not time functions. We built a couple and find they have
          the most extraordinary properties. If you wish you could build
          a unit and try to establish a circuit to our group here in
          Ottawa. Following are the construction instructions. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One ferrite core, material with the
          highest permeability and dielectric constant, about 8 inches
          to a foot long, and about 1 inch in diameter. About 20 feet of
          plastic insulated #14 electric house wire. Starting at the
          center of the wire and at one end of the core wind on the wire
          as closely as possible, with the first turn under and then
          over, so that the winding will be exactly symmetrical. It will
          start at one end of the core and finish at the other end and
          will resemble a solenoid with a bifilar winding. It is
          important that the winding be exactly symmetrical. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When connected to a transmitter,
          treat it as any normal antenna for loading and tuning. There
          will be a few points of magnetic domain resonance which will
          be lossy but anywhere else the device will generate the
          required waves. It will not matter whether or not the antenna
          converter is shielded as the doughnut waves go through
          anything. The most remarkable property of this system is that
          the waves can be directly MENTALLY... </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">...The coil is said to be a single
          winding of insulated copper wire, about #16 or #18 gauge,
          wound on a ferrite core of 1" to 1-1/2" diameter, and about 9"
          long. The coil is caduceus wound, that is, one begins the
          winding in the middle of the wire’s length, winding the wire
          in opposite directions around the core and crossing the wires
          on the same opposite diameter points each time around. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The coil is said to be an energy
          sink --- that is, current fed into it just disappears, causing
          no radiation, even of heat. When operating and placed near a
          grid dip meter, the coil is said to show a large number of
          resonance points across the spectrum from 200 to 2.0 Mc. This
          coil is further said to have zero impedance. Further, two or
          more coils cannot be coupled together. </p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">...According to the theory of
          relativity, if I climb into a spacecraft and I set out from
          the earth at a velocity very nearly the velocity of light, and
          I go out to say, Alpha Proxima, and then I turn around and
          comeback, people on earth say that I’ve been gone something
          like 10 years. According to my clock, I’ve only been gone a
          year. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now that is a result, apparently,
          of time dilation in the theory of relativity, in that the
          spacecraft in which I travel was moving relative to the earth
          at a velocity nearly equal to the velocity of light. The
          paradox arises when you consider that relative to the
          spacecraft, the earth was traveling away at exactly the same
          velocity. Therefore, to the people on the spacecraft, who are
          relatively stationary, 10 years should have passed, and by the
          time the earth comes back to them, it should have only been
          away a year. So you can see right away that the very premise
          upon which the theory of relativity is predicated --- namely,
          that if A is relative to B, then B must be relative to A ---
          leads you to an impossible paradox. This paradox is resolved
          completely if you recognize the variable nature of time, and
          as you move round from one part of the Universe to another
          you’ll encounter all sorts of values of time in certain given
          intervals. We become slaves to the clock to the extent that we
          believe that the intervals ticked out by the clock are time
          itself, so we find it very difficult in readjust. Now I don’t
          propose to say any more about this particular aspect, but I
          would like to say something on the subject of the craft
          themselves. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We asked them how they were
          supported, and they said they were supported on the earth’s
          gravitational field. Further studies on our own, with
          occasional references to these people from elsewhere, and we
          figured out that we were able to go into the laboratory and
          conduct a series of experiments which proved beyond doubt that
          this is true. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our laboratory experiments have
          allowed us to make about a 1% change in the weight of objects
          --- we can make them about 1% heavier or 1% lighter. Now that
          is a long way from holding a spacecraft up, because we have to
          go over 100% to do that. But the fact that we can do it ---
          the fact that the principles which these people from outside
          gave us and guided us to finding out for ourselves are valid
          --- certainly indicate that, first, these people are what they
          say they are, and, secondly, that their technology is that
          they say it is, that it is superior to ours and that ours is
          inadequate in many respects [Quite a lengthy description on
          the blackboard followed at this point]. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now we understand that these bells
          (Mr Smith is referring to the bell-shaped spacecraft said to
          come from Venus, which have been photographed by Adamski and
          others) operate on this principle. Underneath the bells are
          three things that people have referred to as landing gear.
          They are not landing gear at all --- they are spheres within
          which a charged sphere is rotating. It is spinning on magnetic
          bearings. Magnetic bearing is something else the people from
          outside gave us the design of. It is very simple in section,
          and this is the north pole and this is south, and in it they
          have a thing that looks like this, with a south and this is a
          north [Here obviously Mr Smith is again demonstrating on the
          blackboard]. They are simply ferrite bearings permanently
          magnetized. We built them ourselves and checked them in the
          lab, and they worked perfectly. They are very simple things.
          The spheres carry an electric charge and they spin on this
          type of bearings down inside these big balls. We are told that
          the tilt is simply produced by rotating the sphere a little
          it, which bends the field. The process is much more
          complicated than would appear from what I am telling you, but
          these are the first steps and the end results --- even hough
          there are other steps in between. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now one other thing I would like to
          mention --- as far as I know, our group in Ottawa is the only
          group that has actually taken the information which was given
          to us by the people from outside and translated it into
          hardware that works. Much information has been given to us
          through various channels, but people just talk about it. They
          don’t do anything about it. I think that is deplorable. I
          think that when they give us information, the least we can do
          is to show our good faith by trying at least to convert that
          information into hardware. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We have built two items of hardware
          on their instructions, which I’m rather proud of. One of these
          pieces of hardware is a coil. It has a ferrite core, and a
          trick winding on it. To look at it, it looks rather like an
          oddly wound inductor. When measured on a radio frequency
          bridge, however, it shows very peculiar properties. There are
          certain frequencies at which it is impossible to balance the
          RF bridge, and that is a direct contradiction to what any
          electrical engineer will tell you should happen with a coil
          wound on a ferrite core. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The other item that I’m rather
          proud of resulted from a series of questions that we asked
          regarding accidental destruction or damage to our aircraft by
          flying into the vicinity of flying saucers. And we were
          informed that, although a few of our aircraft had come to an
          unfortunate end by what they considered the colossal stupidity
          of our pilots in flying into a region where the aircraft was
          bound to get into trouble, they said that they are now taking
          corrective measures and whenever they see one of our aircraft
          about to commit suicide, they just get out of the way and give
          him a wide berth. But I asked, if an aircraft was damaged or
          destroyed, what happened? They said the field surrounds the
          saucers in order to hold them up. In order to produce the
          gravity differentials, time field differentials are necessary
          to operate the ships. These sometimes produced field
          combinations which reduced the strength of materials to the
          point where they were no longer strong enough to carry the
          loads that the materials were expected to carry. Now as we
          know, aircraft --- particularly the military type aircraft ---
          are built with a rather small factor of safety, and if they
          fly into a region of reduced binding, the material is no
          longer strong enough to carry the load, and the craft simply
          comes apart. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now we asked a series of questions
          about --- was it possible for our craft to detect these
          regions so that we would not fly into them, and they said that
          it certainly was, and they would do this very thing. They also
          told us that we ourselves were creating regions which were
          much more dangerous than the regions they established in their
          vicinity, because we could detect the presence of their craft
          and give them a wide berth, but we could not detect without
          instruments the presence of these vortices which we ourselves
          had produced. They gave us the design of the instrument (See
          Flying Saucer Review, march-April 1951) which was
          fundamentally this --- they said to select two materials, one
          stronger than the other, and to arrange so that these material
          pulled against each other in such a manner that the weaker
          material was very near its breaking point, and the strong
          material was a long way from its breaking point. On that basis
          we devised instruments, and we built a number of them in the
          shop and sent them around to various people that we know did
          quite a lot of traveling. We asked them if they would
          investigate the regions the regions through which aircraft
          must have passed just prior to breaking up in mid-air, and we
          have unfortunately large reports of our airplanes having done
          just this. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One of these unexplained crashes
          occurred at a place called Esandon, which is about 20 miles
          southwest of Quebec City. We investigated the region through
          which this BOAC aircraft must have passed just prior to its
          crash, and sure enough, --- big as life and twice as natural
          --- we found a very large and very strong vortex. Our
          instruments showed it beyond a doubt. It was about a thousand
          feet in diameter and roughly circular, with a rather sharp
          line of demarcation at the edge of it. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">You will recall also that about two
          or three years ago, possibly a little longer, a jet aircraft
          crashed into a nunnery at Orleans, just out from Ottawa,
          killed a number of people and did a great deal of damage. In
          fact, the jet engine was finally dug out of the ground about
          30 feet below the foundations of this convent. Once again we
          found a very strong vortex of reduced binding. We had a number
          of reports come in from people in the field who found exactly
          the same thing. I wrote a very stiff <b><a href="magnet.htm"
              ">memorandum</a></b> to the appropriate
          people in my own department, pointing out some of these facts.
          I did not state where we got the information, but simply
          stated that we had instruments which showed the existence of
          these regions of reduced binding, and suggested that something
          be done about. The letter wound up in the "crank" file. I’m
          afraid that is the fate of most of these things --- they wind
          up in the "crank" file. However, that does not in any way
          change the fact that these regions of reduced binding exist.
          People from outside told us that they existed, they gave us
          the design of instruments, we built the instruments and we
          have confirmed the fact. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Question: Could you explain why
          they have curtailed the explosions of nuclear bombs? </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I can only guess at why the nuclear
          explosions have been curtailed. I saw a picture which I know
          was never released to the public, showing a very large
          explosion in the Bikini series. This picture showed the
          enormous fireball which I think must have been well over a
          hundred miles in diameter, and shooting out from it were what
          looked like solar prominences --- in other words, they were
          great tongues of activity of some kind. Now these tongues
          looked to me, from the scale of this picture, to be around
          25-50 miles. They were quite comparable in size to the
          fireball. Now, my guess is that these tongues or prominences
          were in fact chain reactions...&nbsp; [&amp;c...] </p>

          the problem of wave propagation in helical line externally
          loaded by azimuthally magnetized hollow ferrite cylinder.
          Computed dispersion curves are given. Attention is drawn to
          non-symmetric modes-as yet absent in the literature-since
          among them are the lowest order ones. The helical line,
          located on the inner surface of the ferrite cylinder is
          simulated by a non-reciprocal conductive cylinder (“sheath
          helix”). The electromagnetic field components inside the
          ferrite medium are expressed by special functions of the first
          and second kinds given by power developments and asymptotic
          expansions. For sufficiently thick ferrite cylinders the
          fields are essentially confined within the structure. The
          method allows analysis and design of non reciprocal phase
          shifters </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">To a first approximation, antenna
          captures the magnetic energy from a volume of space in
          proportion to the length of the ferrite rod, and also in
          proportion to the area of the ends of the rod (or, in other
          words, in proportional to the volume of space between the ends
          of the rod). This description works regardless of the diameter
          of the middle of the rod. The "regardless" part holds as long
          as the permeability of the material is high enough that there
          is a lower reluctance path through the necked down middle
          section is much lower than the reluctance of a constant
          diameter cylindrical volume of space between the large ends of
          the rod.... &amp;c...<br>
