      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Memorandum to the
            Controller of Telecommunications:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the past several years
          we have been engaged in the study of various aspects of radio
          wave propagation. The vagaries of this phenomenon have led us
          into the fields of aurora, cosmic radiation, atmospheric
          radio-activity, and geo-magnetism. In the case of
          geo-magnetics our investigations have contributed little to
          our knowledge of radio wave propagation as yet, but
          nevertheless have indicated several avenues of investigation
          which may well be explored with profit. For example, we are on
          the track of a means whereby the potential energy of the
          earth's magnetic field may be abstracted and used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the basis of theoretical
          considerations a small and very crude experimental unit was
          constructed approximately a year ago and tested in our
          Standards Laboratory. The tests were essentially successful in
          that sufficient energy was abstracted from the earth's field
          to operate a voltmeter, approximately 50 millivolts. Although
          this unit was far from being self-sustaining, it nevertheless
          demonstrated the soundness of the basic principles in a
          qualitative manner and provided useful data for the design of
          a better unit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The design is now completed
          for a unit which should be self-sustaining and in addition
          provide a small surplus of power. Such a unit, in addition to
          functioning as a "pilot power plant" should be large enough to
          permit the study of the various reaction forces which are
          expected to develop.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We believe that we are on
          the track of something which may well prove to be the
          introduction of a new technology. The existence of a different
          technology is borne out by the investigations which are being
          carried on at the present time in relation to flying saucers.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While in Washington
          attending the NARB Conference, two books were released, one
          titled "Behind the Flying Saucers" by Frank Scully, and the
          other "The Flying Saucers are Real" by Donald Keyhoe. Both
          books deal mostly with the sightings of unidentified objects
          and both books claim that flying object were of
          extra-terrestrial&nbsp; origin and might well be space ships
          from another planet. Scully claimed that the preliminary
          studies of one saucer that fell into the hands of the united
          States Government indicated that they operated on some
          hitherto unknown magnetic principles. It appeared to me that
          our own work in geo-magnetics might well be the linkage
          between our technology and the technology by which the saucers
          are designed and operated. If it is assumed that our
          geo-magnetic investigations are in the right direction, the
          theory of operation of the saucers becomes quite
          straightforward, with all observed features explained
          qualitatively and quantitatively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I made discrete inquiries
          through the Canadian Embassy staff in Washington who were able
          to obtain for me the following information;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">a. The matter is the most
          highly classified subject in the United States Government,
          rating higher even than the H-bomb,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">b. Flying saucers exist.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">c. Their modus operandi is
          unknown but concentrated effort is being made by a small group
          headed by Dr. Vannavar Bush.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">d. The entire matter is
          considered by the United States authorities to be of
          tremendous significance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I was further informed that
          the United States authorities are investigating along quite a
          number of lines which might possibly be related to the saucers
          such as mental phenomena and I gather that they are not doing
          to well since they indicated that if Canada s doing anything
          at all in geo-magnetics they would welcome a discussion with
          suitably accredited Canadians.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While I am not yet in a
          position to say that we have solved even the first problems in
          geo-magnetic energy release, I feel that the correlation
          between our basic theory and the available information on
          sauces checks too closely to be mere coincidence. It is my
          honest opinion that we are on the right track and are fairly
          close to at least some of the answers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Wright, Defense Research
          Board liaison officer at the Canadian Embassy in Washington,
          was extremely anxious for us to get in touch with Dr Solandt,
          Chairman of the Defense Research Board, to discuss with him
          future investigation along the lines of geo-magnetic energy
          release.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I do not feel that we have
          as yet sufficient data to place before Defense Research Board
          which would enable a program to be initiated within&nbsp;
          organization, but I do feel that further research is necessary
          and I would prefer to see it done within the framework of our
          own organization with, of course, full cooperation and
          exchange of information with other interested bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I discussed this matter
          fully with Dr Solandt, Chairman of Defense Research Board. On
          Novemebr 20th and placed before him as much information as I
          have been able to gather to date. Dr Solandt agreed that work
          on geo-magnetic energy should go forward as rapidly as
          possible and offered full cooperation of his Board in
          providing laboratory facilities, acquisition of necessary
          items of equipment, and specialized personnel for incidental
          work in the project. I indicated to Dr Solandt that we would
          prefer to keep the project within the Department of transport
          for the time being until we have obtained sufficient
          information to permit a complete assessment of the value of
          the work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore recommended
          that a Projet be set up within the framework of this Section
          to study this problem and that the work be carried on a part
          time basis until such time as sufficient tangible results can
          be seen to warrant more definitive action. Cost of the program
          in its initial stages are expected to be less than a few
          hundred dollars and can be carried by our Radio Standards Lab
          appropriation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attached hereto is a draft
          of terms of reference for such a project which, if authorized,
          will enable us to proceed with this research work within our
          own organization.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. Investigation of the
          propagation of magnetic wave motion in magnetic materials.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. Investigate the
          possibility of producing, an effect, a "sink" in a magnetic

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coordination ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Full coordination is to be
          maintained, within security regulations, with other groups
          working on a parallel or associated problems. Project reports

          fields of research, it is impossible to assess the results in
          advance, which might be obtained through this project.
          However, there exist certain suspicions that the lesser-known
          and little explored aspects of magnetism may hold the key to a
          new and significant technology. Consequently, it is intended
          to classify this work in it entirety until such time as it can
          be assessed for its impact on our civilization.</font></p>
