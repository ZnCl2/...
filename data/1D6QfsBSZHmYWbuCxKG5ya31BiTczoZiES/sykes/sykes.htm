      <p><i>A NANO-ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGH IN THE MOST COMMONLY-USED
          MATERIAL, IN THE MOST-POLLUTING SEGMENT OF OUR ECONOMY, COULD
          SLOW OR REVERSE GLOBAL WARMING.</i> </p>
      <p>SAN JOSE, CA&nbsp;&nbsp; March 19, 2007. --- Housing uses more
        fossil fuel than cars in America --- so it is an obvious target
        for Silicon Valley’s emerging Greentech industry, but 94% of
        American houses are made of low-tech material --- wood. A new
        biotechnology to alter wood at the molecular level has been
        named among the top 25 Inventions of 2007 in the Modern Marvels
        Invent Now Challenge --- to be announced at 10:30am on Thursday
        March 22nd at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. </p>
      <p>The Enertia® Building System, invented by Michael Sykes, has
        been chosen as one of 25 Semi-Finalists in the 2007 Modern
        Marvels Invent Now Challenge. The Challenge is a contest to find
        America’s next great invention idea-and help bring it to life.
        The Challenge is sponsored by the History Channel, Invent Now,
        Inc. TIME Magazine, and Lexus. Sykes was selected from 2,200
        entries based on the criteria of: 1) A technological
        Breakthrough 2) Cleverness, and 3) Historical significance. The
        top five winners will be announced at Citigroup Center in New
        York City on May 11th. </p>
      <p>Sykes will be in San Jose for the Tech Museum announcement
        Thursday, to answer questions and to meet with Silicon Valley
        interests about manufacturing and marketing the homes in
        California. There are already three Enertia® homes in
        California- in the Big Bear, Auburn, and Arnold areas. A video
        of the Big Bear home can be seen at:

      <p>Michael Sykes’ invention, U.S. Patent No. 6,933,016, is
        technology to turn wood into a thermal battery. Zeolitic seed
        crystals are injected into the wood, altering the molecular
        structure at a nanolevel- so there is no change in appearance or
        structural properties. Thus wood is no longer just a structural
        member, or just a decorative trim or paneling- it becomes a
        solar energy storing device, and when the house is properly
        configured and sited it can heat and cool itself. This energy
        from a shift-in-time is called “Enertia®” a word, like the word
        “Laser,” that Sykes made up and trademarked to describe the
        phenomenon. Enertia® Building Systems has developed a line of
        Gluelam wood-wall homes to maximize the energy-storing
        potential, and to offer the mainstream appearance necessary to
        attract traditional frame-housing buyers. Because Enertia® homes
        ‘sequester carbon’ in their massive wood walls, as well reduce
        carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, they caught
        the attention of the Modern Marvels judges- who were looking for
        breakthrough inventions with global potential. </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to fibrous and cellulosic
        materials and, in particular, to natural and man-made wood
        products treated to improve sensible and latent heat
        characteristics. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>When North America was first settled, the eastern coast was
        forested with long-leaf, "heart pine" trees. Their wood is
        characterized by narrow growth rings and high cellular resinous
        content. In additional to structural value in construction, it
        was appreciated that these woods also possessed excellent heat
        retention properties and they were commonly employed as panel,
        floor and ceiling materials around the fireplace rooms, such as
        dens, living rooms, and dining rooms where they functioned to
        provide comfortable, non-insulated living spaces. Moreover,
        homes built entirely of such woods were regarded as more livable
        than homes built with other species. The preferred usage of
        these old growth trees continued into the late nineteenth
        century when the lumber supplies became depleted, and second and
        third growth pine became the material of choice. </p>
      <p>While the newer woods were structurally adequate, they did not
        possess the apparent thermal advantage of the heart pine. They
        did not have either the compact ring structure or the inherent
        resin content, and accordingly needed to be supplemented with
        the available insulating materials and techniques of the time. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the heart pine structures are many. The
        latent heat storing capability allowed heat retention without
        corresponding increases in surface temperature, thereby allowing
        dissipation during non-heating periods when the fireplaces,
        stoves, and furnaces were out. The thermal advantages also were
        enjoyed during summer months when the cool nights reduced the
        temperature structure for energy transfer as the temperature
        rose during the day. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the above erosion of performance, structures
        built of solid wood are inherently energy efficient. With the
        continuing interest in log-type homes, reminiscent of earlier
        times, it would be advantageous to restore as well the unique
        thermal performances of the old growth trees. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
        provide a method for improving the energy retention and release
        properties of cellulosic and fibrous materials. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The foregoing objects are accomplished by treating available
        wood materials to increase their latent heat storage
        capabilities through introducing phase change agents and/or
        additives. In one aspect, nucleating agents are introduced that
        promote internal phase changes. In another aspect, supplemental
        resinous content is added thereby overcoming the deficiencies in
        new growth wood wherein the resin channels are not completely
        filled prior to harvest. In both, the modified material exhibits
        improved thermal release characteristics approaching the
        performance of the old growth woods. </p>
      <p>In one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for
        treating wood to increase latent heat transfer capabilities by
        absorbing into the cellular structure of the wood an effective
        amount of a nucleating agent for promoting increased
        crystallization of the resin content in the wood. The nucleating
        agents are selected from the group comprising borax, boron,
        borosilicates, zeolites, metallic salts and sulfates. The
        process can be further enhanced by removing excess moisture from
        said wood prior to the absorbing, which may be conducted at
        least partially under vacuum conditions and the absorbing
        promoted under vacuum conditions and high pressure conditions.
        Supplemental resin compatible materials may also be absorbed
        into said wood to occupied unfilled cellular space naturally
        occurring and/or occasioned by removing of moisture. The
        materials are selected from resins, waxes, salts, salt-hydrates
        and cross-linked polymers. In another aspect of the invention
        the heat characteristics of a natural wood products having a
        heart area of normal resin content and a sapwood area having
        resin canal structure of reduced resin content are improved by
        infusing supplemental resin compatible materials into said resin
        canal structure to provide a resin content approaching said
        normal resin content of said heart area. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention provides thermally enhanced wood products
        treated or altered to improve heat storage capacity and/or
        change the heat retention and release properties. Referring to
        FIG. 2A, natural unprocessed wood 10 is characterized by resin
        canals 12 that are in whole or in part filed with resin 14. As
        described below and as shown in FIG. 2B, nucleating agents 16
        are inserted into the resin canals 12 and cause a phase change
        in response to temperature fluctuations resulting in improved
        latent heat properties and increase the release or absorption of
        thermal energy. Such core structure is typical of resinous wood.
        As shown in FIG. 3A, the resin canals 12 normally undergo
        progressive crystallization in a peripheral zone 20 inwardly of
        the canal wall 22. As shown in FIG. 3B, the nucleating agents 16
        are effective to propagate the crystallization both inwardly and
        outwardly to greatly increase the phase change material (PCM)
        volume thereby increasing the latent thermal potential of the
        material. </p>
      <p>The latent thermal potential of resinous wood can also be
        enhanced by increasing the resin content, thereby reintroducing
        many of the thermal advantages afforded by the heart pine type
        woods. Referring to FIG. 4A, a typical second or subsequent
        growth pine or like wood 40 is characterized by small heart area
        42, rich in resin content, surrounded by a sapwood area 44
        having a lesser or deficient resin content. Referring to FIG.
        4B, the present invention provides a process for introducing a
        resinous content throughout the sapwood area to provide an
        enhanced thermal zone 46 having thermal characteristic of the
        heart area. </p>
      <p>Both of the foregoing are applicable to a wide variety of woods
        and fibrous materials including new growth pines,
        plantation-grown pines, hardwoods, straw, and bamboo. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a process for
        improving the thermal capacitance or wood products. Therein a
        main pressure vessel 50 having an interior cavity 52 that is
        accessible by end doors 54 for introducing and removing wood
        products 56 as rough cut lumber. The vessel 50 is connected by
        line 58 including a control valve 60 to a three-way selector
        valve 62 for allowing selective connection with a vacuum source
        64 by line 65 or a pressure source 66 by line 67. </p>
      <p>A liquid resin source 70 is connected to the vessel 50 by
        supply line 72 including control valve 74. A nucleating agent
        source 80 is connected to the vessel 50 by supply line 82
        including control valve 84. Vent line 90 including vent valve 92
        communicates with the cavity 52 for atmospheric venting thereof.
        A drain line 94 including drain valve 96 communicates with the
        cavity for removing liquid and/or solid contents therefrom. </p>
      <p>For purposes hereinafter described, a secondary vessel 100 may
        be fluidly connected with the vessel 50 by auxiliary line 102
        including control valve 104. The secondary vessel 100 includes a
        cavity 106 accessible by end doors 108 for loading and removing
        a wood load 110 therefrom. The cavity 106 is vented to
        atmosphere by vent line 112 including vent valve 114. A drain
        line 116 including drain valve 118 communicates with the cavity
        106 for removing liquid and/or solid contents therefrom. </p>
      <p>The vessels 50 and 106 are capable of handling high pressure
        conditions of about 100 psi and above and withstanding low
        vacuum conditions of about 28 in Hg or below. As required by the
        environment or processed materials, the vessels may be jacketed
        or insulated for achieving and maintaining desired processing
        conditions. The sources 70 and 80 as well as associated lines
        and components may also be appropriately temperature controlled.
        Injectable materials in the resin source 70, in particular, are
        preferred in the liquid state, thus requiring elevated
        temperature control. The nucleating agents in the source 80 are
        preferably in solution, also requiring temperature control. </p>
      <p>Suitable resins for the process include natural and synthetic
        resins, waxes, salts, salt-hydrates or cross linked polymers, or
        solutions thereof. Suitable nucleating agents include zeolites,
        borax, borate, boron, borosilicates, metallic salts or sulfate.
      </p>
      <p>The process is initiated using timbers and lumber and removing
        the free-cell water through air drying, kiln drying, vacuum
        drying, dehumidification, desiccant drying, microwave heating,
        steam conditioning or the like. The drying may take place
        entirely or partially exterior of the pressure vessel 50.
        Alternatively, the drying may be performed, totally or
        partially, in the pressure vessel 50. Thereat, the material
        charge of wood product 56 is loaded into the cavity 52 through
        door 54 and the valves 62, 60 opened to connect to the vacuum
        source 64. The cavity 52 is evacuated to a high vacuum of about
        28 in Hg or greater for a sufficient time to remove the
        free-cell water to appropriate levels based on the desired
        subsequent processing. Generally about 40 minutes or less is
        preferable depending on the density and saturation of the
        material charge. Thereafter, the valves 62, 60 are closed, the
        vacuum source 64 disabled and the valve 74 is opened to inject
        the liquids from source 70 and during the course thereof raising
        the pressure to atmospheric, at which time or based on
        requirements therebefore the valve 74 is closed. Next the
        pressure source 66 is enabled, the valve 62 conditioned to
        pressurize the cavity to a pressure of about 150 psi for an
        extended period, up to about 3 hours, sufficient to get the
        maximum resin content absorbed into the product. The amount of
        liquid resin introduced in this step will be dependent on the
        starting resin content of the load, which may vary considerably
        based on source. </p>
      <p>Concurrently with injection, the valve 84 is opened to inject
        the nucleating agents are introduced from the source 80 through
        line 82 into the cavity 52. In the event the agents are not in a
        solution form compatible with the injectables, the nucleating
        agents may be introduced in a secondary evacuation followed by
        pressurization, which may be entirely sequential after the
        injection sequence or a sequential evacuation and a common
        pressurization. Without resin treatment, about 0.2 to 1.0 pounds
        of nucleating agents per cubic foot of load may be required. If
        the load has been resin treated, additional nucleating agents in
        the range of about 0.5 to 2.0 pound per cubic foot of load
        should be sufficient. Depending on the selected nucleating
        agent, the step may be conducted exterior of the vessel through
        infusion by immersion or osmosis. </p>
      <p>Following treatment, the lumber may be dried for usage,
        artificially or ambiently. In the event of weeping of the resin
        content from the material, the excess may be hardened through
        subsequent conventional processing to polymerize, cross link or
        harden the same. </p>
      <p>In a variation of the above process, a secondary material load
        may be placed in vessel 100 and co-evacuated with primary vessel
        50 through line 102. For a secondary material load high in resin
        content, the released resin vapor will be drawing into cavity 52
        thus supplanting or reducing the amount of resin necessary treat
        the load 56. The resulting product in vessel 100, free of water
        and resins, is a light empty cell product much like balsa wood,
        useful for insulation. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that foregoing provides thermally
        enhanced characteristic for a varied wood sources. Young rapid
        growth trees having a marked resin deficiency will have the
        characteristics of the old growth wood as shown in FIG. 4B.
        Adding the nucleating agents will provide a phase change matrix
        increasing the thermal capacitance improving the latent heat
        capabilities of structures based on or incorporating the treated
        wood. By maximizing the use of such materials in construction in
        substitution for conventional source, the energy efficiency of
        the buildings can be greatly increased. </p>
      <p>The foregoing advantages are shown by examples depicted in the
        graphs of FIGS. 5 and 6. Wood product samples measuring 5.75 in.
        by 5.75 in. by 12 in. and having a heart diameter of 1.69 were
        for the example of FIG. 5. The sample of FIG. 5A was unprocessed
        and the sample of FIG. 5B was infused with 0.15 lbs. of borax.
        It will be noted that the unprocessed sample had a latent heat
        period, i.e. the constant surface temperature period of
        72.degree. F. for 10 minutes whereas the treated sample had a
        latent heat period of 20 minutes, or a 100% increase. The
        samples of FIG. 6 had a heart diameter of 5.75 in. and similar
        nucleating treatment. The unprocessed sample had a latent heat
        period of 20 minutes whereas the treated sample had a
        corresponding period of 40, once again about double the
        untreated condition. Both clearly establish the improved latent
        heat capabilities achieved in one aspect of the invention. </p>
      <p>Having thus described a presently preferred embodiment of the
        present invention, it will now be appreciated that the objects
        of the invention have been fully achieved, and it will be
        understood by those skilled in the art that many changes in
        construction and widely differing embodiments and applications
        of the invention will suggest themselves without departing from
        the sprit and scope of the present invention. The disclosures
        and description herein are intended to be illustrative and are
        not in any sense limiting of the invention, which is defined
        solely in accordance with the following claims. </p>
