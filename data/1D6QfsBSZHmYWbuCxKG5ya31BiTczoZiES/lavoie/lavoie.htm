      An industrial engineer from Massachusetts has an invention he says
      could save New Hampshire residents a bundle on home heating costs.
      Eric LaVoie says he has figured out a way to get more heat and
      less soot from the oil that heats many houses in New England, and
      his new contraption - which is only sold in New Hampshire - will
      keep toxic pollutants out of the air while reducing the amount of
      oil needed to heat homes and offices.<br>
      <br>
      The Monitor spoke with LaVoie to learn more.<br>
      <br>
      Do you have a background in science?<br>
      <br>
      I'm an industrial engineer. I work on boilers and environmental
      systems like wastewater treatment and chemical processes and
      pumps. I did that for 10 years - all the way until 1998 - then a
      lot of the companies that used industrial engineers went over to
      Asia and China, so I painted houses on the side to try to support
      my family.<br>
      <br>
      How did you come up with the idea?<br>
      <br>
      I saw somebody burning waste motor oil at a garage that does
      tune-ups. . . . Some garages burn the used motor oil and
      transmission fluid to heat the garage. (The garage owner) had kind
      of an expensive operation going with a lot of apparatuses to try
      to make the system burn clean, but it wasn't clean and would often
      fail. I started putting my thoughts together, and within two days
      I put an idea together in paper. Within four months I had built a
      working prototype.<br>
      <br>
      How does it work?<br>
      <br>
      The science basically is that we are using a much higher pressure.
      The pressure in a traditional system is about 100 pounds per
      square inch. In the Burner Booster, it's between 1,000 and 1,600
      (pounds per square inch). The other part of it is that the fuel
      oil is heated, warmed up to enhance the atomization. It becomes a
      fine mist, compared to fine droplets in other burners.<br>
      <br>
      The droplets take longer to burn, travels in the boiler and once
      you put heat in the chimney, it's not doing any good except
      warming the town you live in. And those emissions that you're
      sending up the stack are more toxic if they aren't burned in the
      combustion chamber. (The Burner Booster) keeps the heat inside the
      center of combustion chamber, and the mist burns up quickly. It's
      a cleaner burn.<br>
      <br>
      Is it patented?<br>
      <br>
      It's patent pending. We are waiting for one more series of signing
      off from the patent office, which we expect in the next three or
      four weeks.<br>
      <br>
      How much can it really reduce the amount of oil used?<br>
      <br>
      No two systems are alike. On average, in the real world, it's a 28
      to 36 percent reduction. Lab tests showed higher, but that's in a
      lab, you know?<br>
      <br>
      And you've tested them out in real homes and businesses?<br>
      <br>
      The first was four years ago, it was in Medway, Massachusetts, and
      the second was a couple months later in Dover, New Hampshire. Both
      were homes. We wanted to see how it works in the real world. We
      first saw results<br>
      <br>
      between 25 and 35 (percent reduction), and we made some
      adjustments with what we learned to increase efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Where is it being sold now?<br>
      <br>
      It's only sold in New Hampshire. We're a small company, so we
      didn't want to be scattered in too many locations at once. We work
      with Paradigm Plumbing and Heating (in Hooksett), it's the first
      independent dealer. They handle service within 45 minutes to an
      hour of Manchester.<br>
      <br>
      How did you get connected with Paradigm?<br>
      <br>
      I had sent out some brochures and fliers to different sellers
      asking if they wanted to see a demonstration, and Paradigm was
      interested. I bought an old 17-foot U-Haul box truck to carry two
      combustion chambers with a glass top so you can look down and see
      the entire thing. Seeing is believing.<br>
      <br>
      How many have you sold?<br>
      <br>
      Two so far, but I've taken orders this week for six. We're trying
      to not go crazy. We can produce eight units a day out of the shop,
      but we're still a startup company.<br>
      <br>
      What are your marketing strategies?<br>
      <br>
      We're getting in touch with large (heating equipment)
      distributors, and they have shown interest in carrying the Burner
      Booster. It does have to be installed by a licensed oil-burning
      technician. The distributors sell directly to plumbing and heating
      companies like Paradigm, so technicians can walk in and purchase
      it before they install it in a home. It takes about one to
      one-and-one-half hours to install.<br>
      <br>
      And it's something that you add on to your current system, instead
      of a replacement?<br>
      <br>
      You don't have to replace the current system, it adds on to the
      boiler. It does come with a new burner from Wayne Combustion
      Systems, though. It's made to work with the Burner Booster, so
      it's unique, and reliable. The parts have a three-year warranty.<br>
      <br>
      How much do they cost?<br>
      <br>
      They vary in price. Residential, on average, will be around
      $5,900. Small- and medium-sized commercial buildings - the kind
      that might go through 10,000 and 20,000 gallons per year - will be
      close to $8,000. One Burner Booster box can fire two boilers, so
      they don't have to get one Burner Booster for each boiler.<br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LAVOIE ERIC<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -- The present invention
        is an oil burning system, capable of burning various waste oils
        with high efficiency burn, reduced emissions, and without
        producing sludge within the system. Generally, the system
        operates by pressurizing liquid fuel to a high pressure and
        delivering the fuel through a two-stage filtration system,
        pre-heating the fuel, dispensing the fuel through a nozzle and
        igniting the fuel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The instant invention generally relates to an oil burning
      system, and more particularly to a system that is capable of
      maintaining high-pressure while reducing fuel usage to generate an
      equivalent quantity of heat as prior systems, while minimizing
      volume requirements of fuel and pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] With rising oil prices, consumers have become more cost and
      efficiency conscious. Homeowners who choose to heat their home
      with oil can opt to use waste oils as fuel for the heating system.
      However, existing waste-oil burning systems are relatively
      inefficient and generate a high level of pollution as these
      systems burn only about 75-85% of the fuel, while 15% (or more) of
      the fuel is not burned and is exhausted as soot plus carbon
      monoxide. Further, existing systems require the fuel to be heated
      to about 190-250[deg.] F. the heating process creates sludge in
      the system; this, in turn, requires disassembly of the system for
      cleaning, and disposal of the sludge.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] The instant invention, as illustrated herein, is clearly
      not anticipated, rendered obvious, or even present in any of the
      prior art mechanisms, either alone or in any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The primary object of the instant invention is to produce
      an oil burning system that increases efficiency by reducing the
      amount of fuel usage through the presence of high pressure within
      the system, along heating the fuel under high pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Another object of the instant invention is to produce an
      oil burning system with reduced emission of carbon monoxide,
      hydrogen sulfates and hydrocarbons, and without creating sludge as
      a byproduct of operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another object of the instant invention is to produce an
      oil burning system that comprises the ability to automatically
      adjust the flame size to maintain a constant stack temperature to
      maximize efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to one embodiment, the present invention operates
      in the following manner: the fuel is pumped out of the storage
      tank by an ultra-high pressure pump which increases the pressure
      of the liquid fuel to approximately one thousand nine hundred
      pounds per square inch and passed through a two-stage
      high-pressure filter, into a pre-heat tank; after the fuel
      temperature is raised, the fuel is dispensed through a nozzle and
      is ignited. By monitoring the exhaust stack temperature of the
      system, and varying the pressure accordingly, optimal heating
      efficiency can be reached. Initially, when the system is cold,
      increasing the pressure substantially, allows the flame to burn at
      a higher level than that of existing systems, while not increasing
      the volume of liquid fuel utilized. As the water temperature of
      the boiler rises, the pressure is gradually reduced. Optimal
      efficiency is reached by monitoring the stack temperature and
      adjusting the pressure to keep the stack temperature at about four
      hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit-the pressure is reduced when
      the system detects the stack temperature above four hundred ten
      degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, monitoring the stack temperature and
      adjusting the pressure accordingly allows the system to use less
      fuel than existing systems (i.e. as little as half a gallon of
      fuel per hour) to deliver the same or better temperature as a 0.85
      gallon per hour system.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more
      important features of the oil burner system in order that the
      detailed description thereof that follows may be better
      understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art
      may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the
      invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form
      the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment
      of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the
      invention is not limited in its application to the details of
      construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth
      in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The
      invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced
      and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that
      the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the
      purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] These together with other objects of the invention, along
      with the various features of novelty, which characterize the
      invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims
      annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better
      understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the
      specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be made to
      the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there
      are illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0013] FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of the instant
      invention, wherein the system includes a storage device, a
      filtration system and a distribution system such that each
      component is in fluid communication with each other via a fuel
      line.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0014] The instant invention relates to an oil burning system, and
      more particularly to a home heating oil booster pump system that
      substantially increases the efficiency and burning capabilities of
      existing systems by reducing overall usage of oil while
      maintaining the same output, along with reducing the amount of
      pollution created by the system. It is know in the art that most
      existing oil burning systems, including but not limited to home
      heating systems, operate at only seventy-five to eight-five
      percent efficiency. Thus, existing systems waste at least fifteen
      percent of oil burning due to incomplete burning of fuel with
      waste products such as soot, carbon monoxide and other pollutants.
      Therefore, the present system increases the efficiency of oil
      burning by having more completely burned fuel, along with reducing
      waste products during the burning process and therefore requiring
      less oil to generate the same amount of heat as pre-existing
      systems through the use of high-pressure, effective fuel flow and
      the elimination of the creation of any sludge throughout the
      process.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0015] FIG. 1</span> illustrates
      a high-efficiency oil burning system 10, wherein the system 10 is
      disposed to increase the oil burning capabilities of existing
      systems, by maintaining high-pressure throughout the system 10 and
      allowing for more effective fuel flow, among other things. The
      overall system 10, includes a storage device 12 for housing liquid
      to be used within the system 10; in the preferred embodiment, the
      oil burning system 10 utilizes number two heating oil, however in
      alternate embodiments the system 10 allows for the burning of a
      combination of number two heating oil with various other waste
      oil, including but not limited to biofuels and light grease, waste
      and virgin paint solvents, waste and virgin cleaning solvents, and
      diesel, kerosene and hydraulic oils. More preferably, the system
      10 allows for up to fifty percent waste oil in combination with
      the burning of number two heating oil, wherein the waste oil may
      be a single composition itself, or a combination of the waste oils
      listed above, given that they do not comprise more than fifty
      percent of the overall liquid within the system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The system 10 further includes a filtration system 14,
      wherein the filtration system 14 substantially removes impurities
      from the liquid housed within the storage device 12. The
      filtration system 14 comprises a pump 16, wherein the pump 16 is
      in fluid communication with the storage device 12 via a fuel line
      18 enabling the introduction of liquid from the storage device 12
      into the filtration system 14 for high pressure purification. The
      system 10 also includes a first pair of filters 20 located
      substantially between the storage device 12 and the pump 16 of the
      filtration system 14, wherein the filters 20 are in fluid
      communication with the storage device 12 and the pump 16 via the
      fuel line 18. In the preferred embodiment, the first pair of
      filters 20 is arranged in a substantially tandem orientation and
      in a canister style.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The pump 16 located within the filtration system 12
      maintains high pressure throughout the system 10, thereby creating
      a more efficient fuel flow throughout the system 10, while also
      preventing the build-up of any sludge during the heating in the
      system 10. In the preferred embodiment, the pump 16 is operable in
      a range of two hundred to three thousand two hundred pounds per
      square inch, and more preferably, the pump 16 is operable in a
      range of one thousand to two thousand two hundred pounds per
      square inch. The pump 16 includes a variable pressure control 22,
      wherein the control 22 regulates the exhaust temperature or stack
      temperature of the overall system 10 for more efficient fuel
      usage, preferably around four hundred ten degrees Fahrenheit; it
      is know in the art that a stack temperature above this range
      creates waste and inefficiency within a system once the boiler is
      heated up to eighty percent of capacity. Furthermore, the system
      10 can be automatically controlled by setting the overall stack
      temperature, alternatively, an individual may manually control the
      system set the pressure of the system for each desire fuel and
      burn usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Additionally, the filtration system 12 includes a
      pre-heater 24, wherein the pre-heater 24 is in fluid communication
      with the pump 16 via the fuel line 18. The pre-heater 24 operates
      at a high pressure to maintain efficient fuel viscosity through
      out the system and prevent the formulation of any sludge or
      impurities within the liquid. In the preferred embodiment, the
      pre-heater 24 operates between three hundred and two thousand five
      hundred pounds per square inch, wherein the pressure is adjustable
      depending on the desired viscosity of the liquid. Therefore, the
      pre-heater 24 serves the purpose of heating the liquid to the
      desired temperature and viscosity for use in the system 10.
      Moreover, in the preferred embodiment, the pre-heater 24 operates
      at a temperature range between seventy and one hundred ninety
      degrees Fahrenheit, wherein the individual utilizing the system
      may determine the specific temperate setting.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Furthermore, a second filter 26 is disposed between the
      pre-heater 24 and the pump 16, wherein the filter 26 are in fluid
      communication with the pump 16 and the pre-heater 24 via the fuel
      line 18. Preferably the second filter 26 comprises a two stage
      high-pressure micron filters with mesh that allows for the removal
      of any liquid in a semi-solid state, thereby creating an extremely
      liquefied material for introduction into the pre-heater 24. More
      preferably the second filter 26 operates at up to three thousand
      five hundred pounds per square inch to remove impurities from the
      liquid while continually maintaining the pressure created by the
      pump 16. The second filter 26 allows for substantially clean and
      sludge-free passage of the liquid through the remaining components
      of the system and prevents clogging, while allowing for individual
      components to be in use longer, but most importantly to prevent
      sludge from building up within the system 10. The filtration
      system 14 also includes an even pressure accumulator 36 as known
      in the art, wherein the accumulator is located substantially
      between the second filter 26 and the pre-heater 24, such that the
      accumulator 36 is in fluid communication with the second filter 26
      and the pre-heater 24 via the fuel line 18. The accumulator
      maintains and ensures steady pressure distribution throughout the
      system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Lastly, the system 10 includes a distribution system 28,
      wherein the distribution system 28 is disposed to deliver the
      liquid to a boiler or furnace, preferably for heating a
      residential or commercial dwelling. The distribution system 28
      further comprises a motor control 30 along with a nozzle assembly
      32 for distribution of the liquid from the system 10. The system
      10 also includes a valve 34 disposed after the motor control 30
      and the pre-heater 24, wherein the valve 34 is preferably a one
      hundred ten volt electrical solenoid valve that is operable at up
      to two thousand eight hundred pounds per square inch. The valve 34
      is in fluid communication with the pre-heater 24 and the control
      motor 30 via the fuel line, and wherein the control motor is in
      fluid communication with the nozzle assembly 32. The valve 34
      operates in an on and off capacity, wherein the vale is in
      electrical communication with the variable control 22 to regulate
      the overall system 10. Moreover, a third filter 38 is located
      substantially between the valve 34 and the pre-heater 24 for
      removal of any remaining particles in the fuel or any sludge that
      has built up prior to distribution through the nozzle 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Furthermore, it is known in the art that existing oil
      burning systems, including but not limited to those for heating
      residential dwellings, create sludge during the process of oil
      burning and as a result, this creates two significant problems,
      one being that the system itself requires regular maintenance and
      cleaning, and two, that some of the oil in the system becomes a
      waste by-product thereby reducing the efficiency of the overall
      system. Therefore, as described above the instant invention does
      not require the use of a sludge collector and/or a blow down tank
      to remove sludge from the system since none is created by
      maintaining high pressure throughout the system, and additionally
      the second pair of filters 26 removes any remaining semi-solid
      particles that may have formed. Moreover, the system 10 creates a
      more effective flow of atomized fuel, and as a result of the lack
      of sludge creation, it is not necessary for the introduction of an
      external air supply, such as an air compressor to be incorporated
      into the system to atomize, clean and remove any sludge that has
      built up through operation. In addition, known pollutants and
      by-products of oil burning systems such as carbon monoxide and
      hydrogen sulfate are reduced substantially over current systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Moreover it is known in the art that an oil burning system
      maintaining a stack temperature above four hundred ten degrees
      Fahrenheit creates waste and leads to inefficiency; current
      systems tend to operate in the range of four hundred seventy-five
      to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit while operating ten to
      twenty-five percent inefficiently. Conversely, the instant
      invention allows for the stack temperature to be regulated through
      the pressure control 22, wherein if the system 10 generates a
      stack temperature above four hundred ten degrees Fahrenheit, the
      pressure in the system can be reduced to prevent inefficiency
      while also limiting oil usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] To demonstrate the feasibility of the instant invention,
      several tests were, performed outlining how by substantially
      increasing pressure throughout the entire system and monitoring
      the stack temperature of the system, the overall usage of oil is
      reduced while simultaneously maintaining output. The below
      examples reveal data of the instant invention versus conventional
      and existing oil burning systems, wherein the overall usage of oil
      was reduced in each instance. Furthermore, as demonstrated below,
      the instant invention also allows for a reduction in the
      pollutants given off by conventional oil burning systems,
      specifically carbon monoxide and hydro sulfides.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0024] To demonstrate the feasibility of the instant invention,
      the system 10 was compared against a two year old Burham oil
      burner with a nozzle possessing a dispensing capacity of
      nine-tenths of gallon of oil per hour. Each system was tested to
      determine the time and oil usage necessary to raise the water
      temperature of the boiler from seventy to one, hundred eighty five
      degrees Fahrenheit. Multiple variables were monitored during this
      process, including overall time lapse, the stack temperature of
      the system, the rate of oil usage, the pressure in the overall
      system and the water temperature. Table 1 represents the current
      system and Table 2 represents the Burham oil boiler; the tables
      clearly show that it takes the instant invention fifty-nine
      minutes and 0.62 gallons of oil to raise the water temperature to
      one hundred eight five degrees Fahrenheit, whereas the Burham oil
      boiler takes forty-seven minutes and 0.71 gallons of oil.
      Furthermore, as evidence from the tables, the usage rate of the
      instant invention dropped to-half a gallon per hour when the
      temperature reached one hundred eighty five degrees Fahrenheit,
      thereby creating a more efficient system, while also maintaining
      the stack temperature consistently around four hundred ten degrees
      Fahrenheit, thereby eliminating inefficiency as described above.<br>

      burner with a nozzle possessing a dispensing capacity of one and
