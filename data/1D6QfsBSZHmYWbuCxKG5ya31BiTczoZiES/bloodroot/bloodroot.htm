      July, 2003<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sanguinaria canadensis L</b>., commonly known as bloodroot, red
      puccoon, Indian paint, redroot, pauson, or tetterwort, is found
      throughout most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains (Reed
      1999). This herbaceous perennial is a member of the Papaveraceae
      (poppy family) (Reed 1999). It reaches a maximum of ten inches in
      height, has basal leaves that can be as wide as eight inches, and
      a white and yellow flower appearing in late winter continuing into
      early spring (Reed 1999). This species is found in rich woods,
      usually on banks or slopes (Anon 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Rhizomes of Sanguinaria canadensis produce an extract that is a
      mixture of benzophenanthride alkaloids, most notably sanguinarine
      (Godowski 1989). American Indians used the rhizome in treatment
      of: rheumatism, asthma, bronchitis, lung ailments, laryngyitis,
      fevers, and warts (Anon 1995).<br>
      <br>
      Alkaloid production in S. canadensis was noted to increase with
      decreased light intensity and fertilizer levels and decline with
      topographic elevation (Salmore and Hunter 2001).<br>
      <br>
      S. canadensis extracts have antibiotic activity. A study conducted
      by Ignatov et al (1994) found that the enzyme-specific activity of
      S. canadensis used in defense against pathogens may depend on the
      presence of methyl jasmonate and acetylsalicylic acid. They found
      that enzyme-specific activity could be increased up to 4- to 14-
      fold when cultured cells were treated with methyl jasmonate and
      acetylsalicylic acid (Ignatov et al 1994). Therefore, less
      sanguinarine is needed if it is given with methyl jasmonate and
      acetylsalicylic acid, than if it given alone.<br>
      <br>
      Antimicrobial effectiveness of extracts of S. canadensis in
      traditional treatment of leprosy and tuberculosis was tested using
      two model species of mycobacteria, Mycobacterium aurum and M.
      smegmatis (Newton 2001). S. canadensis was found to have
      significant antimycobacterial activity against M. aurum only
      (MIC=62.5 microg/ml) which supports the traditional uses of this
      plant against those diseases (Newton et al 2001).<br>
      <br>
      Effects on white blood cells are also dependent on the dosage of
      extracts of S.canadensis. Sanguinarine extracts are not lytic to
      neutrophils but even at very low concentrations (0.001%) will
      inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis, oxidative metabolism and
      degranulation within 5 minutes (Agarwal et al 1997). Therefore,
      both the length of exposure and the dose of the drug both are
      critical while considering the effectiveness of the extract in the
      treatment of infections (Agarwal et al 1997). An in vitro analysis
      of fifteen strains of Helicobacter pylori, bacteria that cause
      common gastrointestinal upset, were growth inhibited by a methanol
      extract of S. canadensis, with a MIC50 range of 12.5-50.0
      microg/ml (Mahady et al 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Sanguinaria has been investigated as an anti cancer treatment. The
      activation of human myloid cells with tumor necrosis was
      completely suppressed by sanguinarine in a dose- and
      time-dependent manner (Chaturvedi et al 1997). Uterine cervical
      cancer treatment with 2.12 or 4.24 microM sanguinarine induced
      cell death in most pathogenic cells, providing first evidence that
      sanguinarine is effective against cervical cancer cells via cell
      death (Ding et al 2002). Sanguinarine showed no specificity for
      cancer cells in human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells, inhibiting
      the growth of all cells tested, suggesting clinical usefulness is
      limited in cancer treatment (Debiton et al 2003). Four cases in
      which patients had used sanguinarine extracts in lieu of the
      recommended conventional treatment for basal cell carcinomas
      showed that scarring ensued. One patient had a residual tumor, and
      another "healed" for several years but then had deeply recurring
      basal cell carcinomas (McDaniel and Goldman 2002).<br>
      <br>
      The commercially marketed product Viadent mouthrinse and
      toothpaste both contain sanguinarine, commonly used to treat adult
      periodontitis. A comparison study shows that doxycycline hyclate
      (a synthetic) is superior to sanguinarine chloride in treatment of
      adult periodontitis (Drisko 1997). In a double-blind parallel
      study, people using sanguinaria extract oral rinse did not show
      improvement (Polson et al 1990). A 14-week controlled clinical
      trial supported the combined use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse for 2
      weeks followed by sanguinaria mouthrinse and toothpaste up to
      three months in treating periodontitis (Tenenbaum et al 1999). The
      MIC of sanguinarine ranges from 1 to 32 micrograms/ml for most
      species of plaque (Godowski 1987). A match case-controlled study
      including 58 patients diagnosed with oral leukoplakia showed that
      Viadent product use may cause oral leukoplakia (Mascarenhas et al
      2002). Based on reviews and discussions of the database on
      Sanguinaria extract, the Expert Panel declared Viadent products to
      be safe in present use (Frankos et al 1990).<br>
      <br>
      Benefits of Sanguinaria canadensis extract include leprosy and
      tuberculosis treatment, antimicrobial treatment for the
      gastrointestinal system, cervical cancer and tumor treatments, and
      adult periodontitis treatment. Risks include a dose and time
      dependent treatment that is not well understood or proven, no
      specificity in growth inhibition of cells (normal or cancerous),
      and proven harm in abandoning traditional treatments in basal cell
      carcinomas. More research is necessary to determine whether
      Sanguinaria canadensis is effective as an anticancer treatment.<br>

      If you want to know the REAL history of Cansema® -- plus get
      valuable formulary information, read Meditopia® at meditopia.org.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis)</b> has long been known for
      its strong medicinal properties, especially with respect to its
      curative action in treating a wide variety of skin disorders.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Although designed for self-administration, Cansema is not a
      replacement for timely, competent medical advice and attention.
      Alpha Omega highly recommends that prior to usage, the user obtain
      a biopsy or other diagnosis of the suspected cancer site. On the
      basis of reliable diagnosis and in conjunction with medical
      consultation, the user may then make the decision as to whether or
      not to use the Cansema system. Cansema, because of its ability to
      discriminate between healthy and cancerous tissue, is often used
      simultaneously as both a diagnostic tool and a skin cancer remedy,
      but we do not recommend this use, simply because skin cancer is
      sometimes a by-product of other pathological condition(s) that
      should be attended to by a competent physician.<br>
      <br>
      Information and order instructions on Cansema are broken down as
      follows:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Cansema is a miraculous product with a miraculous history with
      roots that go back to the late 19th century. Only suppression and
      greed have prevented its enormous benefits from being made
      available to the mainstream.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Cansema® is now featured in Dr. Allan Spreen's new book,
      Tomorrow's Cancer Cures Today : 25 Secret Therapies from Around
      the World -- it is the subject of Chapter 18 ("The Herbal Salve
      That Saved an Astronaut"). <br>
      <br>
      To avoid purchasing counterfeit versions of our product, please
      read our Compensation for Fake Product page<br>
      <br>
      To U.S. Users Only: None of the Cansema products or H3O are being
      sold to the U.S. now. The viewing of these pages in your country
      is for historic and educational purposes only. We now sell AO
      Black Salve and AO Alkalizer to the U.S. but without any health
      claims.<br>

      <b>Fake Product Compensation Program Announced</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The success of AO Lab products in the alternative health care
      community is well-established. (A Google search for Cansema®
      yields over 9,000 pages . . . it takes several hours just to read
      our four web pages of customer testimonials connected to
      Cansema®).<br>
      <br>
      There is no success that does not attract opportunistic imitators.
      The legal attack against AO Labs by the FDA in 2003 attracted
      several such imitators. Because Cansema® has been in use since we
      created it in 1991 and we are the holder of the U.S. trademark, we
      sent polite letters to various violators to cease and desist in
      using our web pages, copyrighted material, and trademarks.<br>
      <br>
      Our pleas have been ignored.<br>
      <br>
      The most serious aspect of these violations is that the imitations
      don't work as well, if they work at all. They are not the original
      product. For a period of four years, we attempted to work with the
      FDA to put a stop to the fraud. We even sent them a small sampling
      of the hundreds of complaint letters we received.<br>
      <br>
      They did nothing.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the adulteration and misbranding involved in the
      McAdams operation -- whose primary sites are Bloodroot
      Products.com and RisingSun Health.com -- we can only assume that
      this is an FDA renegade operation is to permit, foster, and
      protect illegal product. By working less effectively, they will
      hopefully convince people that alternatives are inferior to
      mainstream pharmaceuticals. This would make perfectly good sense
      and is consistent with their overall modus operandi, as documented
      in numerous books by Lynne McTaggart, Leonard Horowitz, John
      Abramson, Joseph Mercola, John Morgenthaler -- to name just a few.<br>

      Bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis, is a perennial, herbaceous
      flowering plant native to eastern North America from Nova Scotia,
      Canada southward to Florida, United States, and west to Great
      Lakes and down the Mississippi embayment. It is the only species
      in the genus Sanguinaria, included in the family Papaveraceae, and
      most closely related to Eomecon of eastern Asia.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot is also known as bloodwort, red puccoon root, and
      sometimes pauson. Bloodroot has also been known as tetterwort in
      America, although that name is used in Britain to refer to Greater
      Celandine (Chelidonium majus). Plants are variable in leaf and
      flower shape and have in the past been separated out as different
      subspecies due to these variable shapes. Currently most taxonomic
      treatments lump these different forms into one highly variable
      species. In bloodroot, the juice is red and poisonous.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot, is a variable species growing
      from 20–50 centimetres (7.9–20 in) tall, normally with one large,
      sheath-like basal multi-lobed leaf up to 12 centimetres (4.7 in)
      across. Bloodroot stores sap in an orange colored rhizome, that
      grows shallowly under or at the soil surface. Over many years of
      growth, the branching rhizome can grow into a large colony. Plants
      start to bloom before the foliage unfolds in early spring and
      after blooming the leaves expand to their full size and go summer
      dormant in mid to late summer.<br>
      <br>
      The flowers are produced from March to May, with 8-12 delicate
      white petals and yellow reproductive parts. The flowers appear
      over clasping leaves while blooming. The flowers are pollinated by
      small bees and flies, seeds develop in elongated green pods 40 to
      60 mm in length and ripen before the foliage goes dormant. The
      seeds are round in shape and when ripe are black to orange-red in

      <b>Habitat</b><br>
      <br>
      Sanguinaria canadensis plants are found growing in moist to dry
      woods and thickets, often on flood plains and near shores or
      streams on slopes, they grow less frequently in clearings and
      meadows or on dunes, and are rarely found in disturbed sites. Deer
      will feed on the plants in early spring.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reproduction and genetics</b><br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot is one of many plants whose seeds are spread by ants, a
      process called myrmecochory. The seeds have a fleshy organ called
      an elaiosome that attracts ants. The ants take the seeds to their
      nest, where they eat the elaiosomes, and put the seeds in their
      nest debris, where they are protected until they germinate. They
      also get the added bonus of growing in a medium made richer by the
      ant nest debris.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Toxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot produces benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, primarily the
      toxin sanguinarine. The alkaloids are transported to and stored in
      the rhizome. Comparing the biosynthesis of morphine and
      sanguinarine, the final intermediate in common is
      (S)-reticuline.[2][3] A number of plants in Papaveraceae and
      Ranunculaceae, as well as plants in the genus Colchicum (family
      Colchicaceae) and genus Chondodendron (family Menispermaceae),
      also produce such benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.<br>
      <br>
      Plant geneticists have identified and sequenced genes which
      produce the enzymes required for this production. One enzyme
      involved is CYP80B1,[4] which produces
      (S)-3'-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine and mendococlaurine from
      (S)-N-methylcoclaurine.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot flowers are produced from March to May, with 8-12
      delicate white petals and yellow stamens<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot leaves grow rapidly after the flowers die and persist
      until late summer<br>

      Double-flowered cultivars such as S. canadensis forma multiplex
      are popular with gardeners, as their flowers last longer than
      single ones<br>

      <br>
      <b>Cultivation</b><br>
      <br>
      Sanguinaria canadensis is cultivated as an ornamental plant. The
      double flowering forms are prized by gardeners for their large
      showy white flowers, which are produced very early in the
      gardening season. Bloodroot flower petals are shed within a day or
      two of pollination so the flower display is short lived. The
      double forms bloom much longer than the normal forms, the double
      flowers are made up of stamens that have been changed into petal
      looking like parts, making pollination more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal</b><br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot was used historically by Native Americans for curative
      properties as an emetic, respiratory aid, and other treatments.[5]<br>
      <br>
      In physician William Cook's 1869 work The Physiomedical
      Dispensatory is recorded a chapter on the uses and preparations of
      bloodroot,[6] which described tinctures and extractions, and also
      included at least the following cautionary report:<br>
      <br>
      The U. S. Dispensatory says four persons lost their lives at
      Bellevue Hospital, New York, by drinking largely of blood root
      tincture in mistake for ardent spirits [...]<br>
      <br>
      Greater Celandine (Chelidonium majus), a member of the Poppy
      family (Papaveraceae) was used in Colonial America as a wart
      remedy. Bloodroot has been similarly applied in the past. This may
      explain the multiple American and British definitions of
      "Tetterwort" in 1913.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Bloodroot extracts have also been promoted by some supplement
        companies as a treatment or cure for cancer, but the U.S. Food
        and Drug Administration has listed some of these products among
        its "187 Fake Cancer 'Cures' Consumers Should Avoid".[7]</i><br>

      <b>Toxicity to animal cells</b><br>
      <br>
      Sanguinarine kills animal cells by blocking the action of
      Na+/K+-ATPase transmembrane proteins. As a result, applying
      bloodroot to the skin may destroy tissue and lead to the formation
      of a large scab, called an eschar. Bloodroot and its extracts are
      thus considered escharotic.<br>
      <br>
      Internal use is inadvisable. Applying escharotic agents, including
      bloodroot, to the skin is sometimes suggested as a home treatment
      for skin cancer, these attempts can be severely disfiguring.[8]
      Salves derived from bloodroot cannot be relied on to remove an
      entire malignant tumor. Microscopic tumor deposits may remain
      after visible tumor tissue is burned away, and case reports have
      shown that in such instances tumor has recurred and/or
      metastasized.[9]<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i> In 2005, "folk healer" Dan Raber (of Georgia, United
        States) was arrested and charged with causing severe bodily harm
        and practicing medicine without a license for dispensing
        bloodroot paste to nine women with various ailments including
        breast cancer, causing severe disfiguring destruction of their
        skin and underlying tissue (as well as failing to successfully
        excise their tumors). Lois March, M.D. of Cordele, Georgia, was
        also charged as an accomplice and had her medical license
        permanently revoked for her role in assisting Raber's unlicensed
        treatment by prescribing massive amounts of opiate pain
        medication to his customers in order to allow them to continue
        their bloodroot treatment despite the severe burning pain and
        disfigurement it caused.[10][11][12]</i><br>
      <br>
      Numerous published, pre-clinical In Vitro and In Vivo studies have
      demonstrated that Sanguinarine causes targeted apoptosis in human
      cancer cells, and recommend future development of Sanguinarine as
      a potential cancer treatment.[13][14][15][16][17][18] <br>
      <br>
      A study conducted by the Case Western Reserve University in 2000
      found that low doses of sanguinarine caused this apoptosis in
      cancerous human epidermoid carcinoma cells while little reaction
      from normal human skin cells was observed.[19]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Commercial uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Commercial uses of sanguinarine and bloodroot extract include
      dental hygiene products. The United States FDA has approved the
      inclusion of sanguinarine in toothpastes as an antibacterial or
      anti-plaque agent.[20][21][22][23] Currently, it is believed that
      this use may cause leukoplakia, a premalignant oral lesion.[24] On
      24 Nov 2003, the Colgate-Palmolive Company of Piscataway, New
      Jersey, United States commented by memorandum to the United States
      Food and Drug Administration that then-proposed rules for levels
      of sanguinarine in mouthwash and dental wash products were lower
      than necessary.[25] However, this conclusion is controversial.[26]<br>
      <br>
      Some animal food additives sold and distributed in Europe such as
      Phytobiotics' Sangrovit contain sanguinarine and chelerythrine. On
      14 May 2003, Cat Holmes reported in Georgia Faces[27] that Jim
      Affolter and Selima Campbell, horticulturists at the University of
      Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, were
      meeting with Phytobiotics to relate their research into commercial
      cultivation of bloodroot.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plant dye</b><br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot is a popular red natural dye used by Native American
      artists, especially among southeastern rivercane basketmakers.[28]
      The blood of the root (when cut open) was used as a dye. A break
      in the surface of the plant, especially the roots, reveals a
      reddish sap.<br>

      <br>
      The single bloodroot leaf and flower each rise on a separate stem,
      and at first the leaf completely enwraps the flower bud. The
      clear, white, many-petaled blossom may open before the leaf has
      completely unwrapped, rising slightly above the leaf to a height
      of 6-10 in. Leaves, which are large, round and deeply cleft,
      eventually reach a height of 12-14 in. On a smooth stalk a
      solitary white flower, with a golden-orange center, grows beside a
      lobed basal leaf that often curls around the stalk. Roots and stem
      with acrid red-orange juice.<br>
      <br>
      This fragile spring flower develops and rises from the center of
      its curled leaf, opening in full sun, and closing at night. Like
      most members of the Poppy Family, it lasts for a relatively short
      time. The red juice from the underground stem was used by Indians
      as a dye for baskets, clothing, and war paint, as well as for
      insect repellent. The generic name, from the Latin sanguinarius,
      means bleeding.<br>

      Bloodroot is also known as<b> Puccoon or Red Puccoon, Indian
        Paint, Redroot, Pauson and Tetterwort.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Plant Type:</b> This is a herbaceous plant, it is a perennial
      which can reach 25cm in height (10inches). Only about half that
      high at the time of blooming.<br>
      <b>Leaves:</b> This plant has basal leaves only. Leaves can be as
      wide as 20 cm (8inches). There is usually only one leaf which has
      five to nine lobes. It is much smaller at the time the flower is
      open.<br>
      <b>Flowers:</b> The flowers have numerous parts and are up to 5cm
      wide (2 inches). They are white with yellow center. Blooms first
      appear in late winter and continue into early spring. The flower
      usually has eight symmetrically arranged petals four large and
      four smaller, but can have up to twelve and sometimes sixteen.<br>
      <b>Fruit:</b> A two part capsule pointed on both ends with a row
      of seeds in each half. (see 'Other Images' below)<br>
      <b>Habitat:</b> Rich woods. Usually on banks or slopes.<br>
      <b>Range</b>: Most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains.<br>
      <br>
      This is the only species of the genus Sanguinaria. While sometimes
      locally abundant, this plant is generally somewhat rare. It is
      known from areas that have been little disturbed usually on hills
      and mountains. A blood red juice can be extracted from the reddish
      orange root, actually a rhizome, hence the name Bloodroot.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lore:</b> The juice from the root was used as a body paint and
      dye by Native Americans. Warriors painted their faces with it and
      maidens their bodies. Reportedly a woman was given as a bed mate
      to a colonist at Jamestown by a local tribe and was presented
      wearing only a coat of red body paint made from
      Bloodroot.(Dobelis) The root juice has been used as a dye for
      fabrics producing a yellow orange color that is very fast. It has
      also been used as a charm. Young men of the Ponca tribe would put
      the juice of the root on their palm and contrive to shake hands
      with the maiden they desired to marry and in five or six days she
      would be willing to marry him.(Foster &amp; Duke) Applying the
      root or juice to the skin is a questionable activity as the plant
      is known to be an escharotic, a substance that kills tissue. See
      warnings below.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Medical Uses: </b>Native Americans, early settlers and
      herbal practitioners have prescribed Bloodroot for myriad medical
      conditions from skin cancers to sore throats. Its most persistent
      and possibly valid use takes advantage of the flesh destroying
      properties of the root juice or powered root for treating
      conditions of the skin such as ringworm, warts, polyps, fungal
      growths and the like. Researchers are investigating the root's
      value in cancer treatment. An extract has long been used in
      toothpaste and mouthwash to fight plaque and gingivitis and this
      use is now sanctioned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
      The root has been used internally, in very small doses, to
      stimulate the digestive system and as an emetic. Self medication
      should be avoided, as the plant can be toxic. Even small doses can
      produce unwanted effects such as visual distortions. Warning:T The
      FDA considers Bloodroot "unsafe" and urges that it not be used by
      herbal healers. It is far to attractive a plant to dig up anyway.

      Poppy family (Papaveraceae)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description:</b> This native perennial plant is about 6" tall.
      It produces only basal leaves that are about 4-5" wide and across.
      Each of these basal leaves is wrapped around the stalk of a single
      flower (sometimes two [Colony of Plants in Bloom] stalks are
      produced) as the flower begins to bloom. The basal leaves continue
      to unfold to their fullest extent as the flowers wither away. Each
      basal leaf is orbicular in outline and palmately veined, with 5-9
      major lobes and several minor lobes along the undulating margins.
      The palmate venation is fairly prominent and provides the rather
      succulent leaves with a wrinkly appearance. This venation is even
      more conspicuous on the lower surface, providing a reticulated
      appearance. The color of the leaves on the upper surface is light
      green, sometimes with greyish or bluish tints, while the lower
      surface is whitish green. The round petioles are about 4" long and
      rather stout. The foliage of this plant is glabrous and glaucous.
      The flowering stalk is round, stout, hairless, and sometimes
      slightly reddish, terminating in a single large flower. This stalk
      is about 3-4" tall when the flower begins to bloom. The flower is
      about 1½–3" across, consisting of 8-16 white petals, a green oval
      pistil, and numerous stamens with prominent yellow anthers. The
      pistil has a pale yellow stigma at its apex. There are 2 light
      green sepals that are nearly as long as the petals, but they fall
      off the flowering stalk as soon as the flower begins to bloom. The
      blooming period occurs from early to mid-spring and lasts about 2
      weeks. Each flower remains in bloom for only 1 or 2 days (when it
      is sunny), and produces a fragrant scent. The seed capsule
      eventually turns yellow and falls to the ground, splitting open to
      release the seeds. The root system consists of thick reddish
      rhizomes with coarse fibrous roots. Both the foliage and the
      rhizomes contain an acrid reddish juice. This plants often forms
      vegetative colonies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cultivation: </b>During the early to mid-spring, this plant
      should have access to some sunlight, otherwise the flowers may
      fail to open. After the trees begin to form leaves later in the
      spring, considerable shade is tolerated. The soil should be
      fertile and loamy, with average moisture levels (by woodland
      [Close-up of Leaf] standards). The foliage is not affected by
      disease significantly, although it will gradually wither away as
      the summer progresses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Range &amp; Habitat:</b> Bloodroot is a common plant that
      occurs in most counties of Illinois (see Distribution Map).
      Habitats include mesic deciduous woodlands, either in wooded areas
      with slopes (ravines, bluffs, valley bottoms), or wooded areas
      where the ground is reasonably level.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Faunal Associations:</b> The pollen of the flowers attracts
      various kinds of bees, including honeybees, Little Carpenter bees,
      Halictid bees, and Andrenid bees. Other insects that visit the
      flowers include Syrphid flies, bee-flies, and beetles, which feed
      on the pollen (or search vainly for nectar). The seeds are
      distributed by ants because of their fleshy appendages. This is a
      common method of seed distribution for woodland wildflowers, as
      wind speeds are greatly reduced in wooded areas. The foliage and
      rhizomes contain an acrid reddish juice and are toxic.
      Consequently, this plant is not often eaten by mammalian
      herbivores.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Photographic Location:</b> A partially-shaded flower garden
      near Busey Woods in Urbana, Illinois.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comments:</b> Bloodroot is one of the spring ephemerals of
      deciduous woodlands. It has unusual-looking, but attractive
      foliage, and very showy flowers, although they are short-lived.
      Across different localities, there are significant variations in
      this plant, involving such characteristics as the number of petals
      and size of the flowers, and the appearance of the foliage. On
      rare occasions, light pink flowers are produced. The Amerindians
      created a red dye from the juice of the rhizomes. The juice of
      plants in this genus possesses anti-bacterial properties with
      possible pharmaceutical applications, including an anti-plaque
      mouthwash.<br>

      Early spring bloomers are much appreciated after a long, cold
      winter. Bloodroot is one of the first wildflowers to open its
      bright white flowers in Midwestern woodlands. This native plant is
      at home in deciduous forests and in gardens where appropriate
      conditions can be provided. <br>
      <br>
      Very early in the spring, native wildflowers begin blooming in the
      forests of Wisconsin. One of the most easily recognizable of these
      wildflowers is bloodroot, an herbaceous perennial native to
      eastern North America, from Florida up into Canada. Sanguinaria
      canadensis is the only species in this genus in the poppy family
      (Papaveraceae). Other common names include bloodwort, Indian
      paint, puccoon, and red puccoon. This species is found in
      Bloodroot and trout lilies in a woodland in southern
      Wisconsin.undisturbed woodlands, on flood plains and on slopes
      near streams or ponds in zones 3-8. It is generally rare, but can
      be locally abundant. The reddish sap that exudes from all parts of
      the plant, but especially the root, when cut is what prompted the
      common name of bloodroot.<br>
      <br>
      Sap (R) from the red to orange-colored rhizomes (L) gives rise to
      the common name of bloodroot.This species grows in clumps,
      producing leaves and flowers early in the season, then going
      dormant and disappearing by midsummer. The range in the shape of
      the leaves and flowers led to divisions into several subspecies,
      although most taxonomists now consider this just a highly variable
      species. The flowers and leaves are produced from a
      shallow-growing, branching, orange-colored rhizome. The rhizome,
      which is about one-half inch thick and up to four inches long,
      grows slowly, eventually branching to form a large colony.
      Bloodroot has morphine-like alkaloids, primarily the toxin
      sanguinarine, in the rhizome. Although Native Americans used
      bloodroot sap as an emetic, ingestion of bloodroot is not
      recommended. Bloodroot in late bloom.It is also an escharotic, a
      substance that kills tissue, and external application is a skin
      irritant causing severe burning pain and disfigurement. Because of
      the flesh-destroying properties of the rhizome’s sap, the fresh or
      powered root was used for treating conditions of the skin such as
      ringworm, warts, polyps, and fungal growths. Sanguinarine is used
      in some commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes as a plaque
      inhibitor. Since even small doses can produce unwanted effects, it
      is considered unsafe for self medication. Bloodroot is used as a
      natural red or yellow-orange dye.<br>
      <br>
      The brilliant white – or rarely light pink – flowers up to 2
      inches across open in early spring. The blooming period lasts
      about 2 weeks. Each flower stalk produces a solitary flower with a
      number of delicate, elongate petals surrounding the numerous
      yellow stamens and central green pistil, with a pale yellow,
      two-lobed stigma at its apex. The flower usually has eight
      symmetrically arranged petals, with four large petals and four
      smaller ones. But some forms have up to sixteen petals. The
      flowers open up in sun but close at night or on very cloudy days
      (when their bee and fly pollinators are not active). The flowers
      are ephemeral, with the petals falling within a day or two of
      pollination. The double forms persist longer, however, because
      those extra petals are really modified stamens, which reduces the
      chances of pollination – which makes these cultivars more
      desirable as garden plants. There are a number of semi-double and
      fully double cultivars, such as ‘Multiplex’ (= ‘Flore Pleno’); the
      double types are often sterile and will not multiply, except by
      division.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot flowers are variable, usually with 8 petals (L). Some
      flowers may have 12-16 petals (C), while double forms, such as
      ‘Multiplex’ (R) have modified stamens that look like petals.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot is cross-pollinated by bees and other insexts, but will
      self pollinate if not visited by insects.If pollinated, the
      flowers are followed by elongate seed pods. The two-part capsule
      is pointed on each end, with a row of 10-15 seeds in each half.
      The round, red to black seeds ripen by the time the foliage begins
      to senesce. When ripe, the pods split open to scatter the seed.
      The seeds have a fleshy organ called an elaisome that is
      attractive to ants. These insects disperse the seeds when they
      carry them back to their nests. The seeds are hauled out to the
      ants’ trash dump after the elaisomes are eaten and the seeds are
      protected within the pile until they germinate.<br>
      <br>
      Elongated seed pods are produced (L and LC) which are filled with
      reddish seeds (RC) that each have a fleshy elaisome (R) that is
      attractive to ants.<br>
      <br>
      Leaves and flowers are produced from each end, or branch, of the
      horizontal rhizome. The plants bloom before the foliage unfolds,
      with each short (2-4") flower stalk emerging wrapped by one
      tightly clasping basal leaf enclosing a flower bud which can be
      purple, yellow, white, or many shades of pink. The pale green to
      grayish- or bluish-green, palmate leaf is shorter than the flower
      pedicel, and unfurls as the flower blooms. The rounded,
      multi-lobed leaves expand to their full size, up to 9 inches
      across after the flowers fade and the stalk elongates to 12-15
      inches tall. Conspicuous venation on the whitish green lower leaf
      surface creates a reticulated appearance. The species is quite
      variable, with plants having 5 to 9 deeply-scalloped major lobes
      and several minor lobes along the undulating margins.<br>
      <br>
      The leaves are wrapped around the flower stem when they first
      emerge (L), and unfurls as the plants bloom (C) to reach their
      full size after flowering.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot leaves decline as the plant goes dormant.This native
      wildflower is best grown in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in
      part shade to full shade (in areas where it will receive sun for
      at least a few hours in early spring before the trees leaf out).
      In time it will spread to form large colonies if conditions are
      appropriate. It is perfectly suited to woodland gardens or any
      shady areas where the plants can be allowed to naturalize. It
      combines well with other native woodland wildflowers as well as
      ferns, hosta, and Virginia Bluebells to provide early season
      interest before the ferns and hostas emerge. Those plants will
      then cover up the bloodroot foliage as it senecenes in mid summer
      when the plants go dormant.<br>
      <br>
      Bloodroot for gardens should not be collected from the wild.Plants
      for the garden should be obtained from reputable sources that have
      not collected them in the wild. This plant can be propagated from
      fresh seed which should be sown immediately ½ inch deep and kept
      moist, even though it will not germinate until the following
      spring (or after several months of cold stratification). It will
      take 2 to 3 year for plants to reach blooming size. Colonies can
      also be transplanted, but plants should not be collected from wild
      populations; over-collecting has led to dramatic declines in
      natural populations. They are best moved or divided as the plants
      are starting to go dormant in the summer (gloves should be worn
      when handling the roots, especially if they are being broken apart
      for divisions). Plants should be spaced about 6 inches apart with
      the rhizomes buried no more than an inch deep. It may take a year
      or more for plants to re-establish unless the roots are left
      undisturbed when moved.<br>

      A composition which comprises principally powdered bloodroot
      powdered ginger root, and zinc chloride in relatively equal parts
      by weight, is applied in a number of treatments to skin lesions
      such as epithelioma tumors. After a short time, the growth comes
      out and a healing ointment comprising lard, lanolin, phenol and
      tannic acid powder is applied to the site until healing is
      effected.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b>A. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to compositions of matter and processes and
      especially to ointments for removing certain types of skin cancers
      and healing the site of the removed growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Prior Art</b><br>
      Various natural substances such as herbs or roots have beeb
      proposed for ingestion to treat cancer as set forth in U.S. Pat.
      No. 114,544. Sarsaparilla, sassafras bark, bloodroot are parts of
      a composition described in that patent. More recent U.S. Pat. No.
      4,229,437 has taught the use of a different root, namely, dried
      bittersweet, together with zinc chloride to form a salve which,
      according to the patent, removes certain types of skin growths
      when applied topically.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 1,411,577 to Mullens is an ointment for external
      application for unspecified conditions or diseases, there being no
      mention of removal of skin growths or the like. Its ingredients
      include bloodroot and zinc chloride as well as an equal part of
      metallic cobalt and some glycerine to form a paste.<br>
      <br>
      Ginger has also been used for many years as an ingredient for
      medicines or liniments for many different medical problems such as
      headache, toothache, removal of blotches and pimples, and animal
      diseases. Such usage is shown in Schroeck U.S. Pat. No. 267,159;
      Ward U.S. Pat. No. 95,173; Barger U.S. Pat. No. 92,248 (cholera),
      Perrin U.S. Pat. No. 448,728 (panacea) and Ramsaur U.S. Pat. No.
      92,209 (blotch and pimple removal).<br>
      <br>
      While each of the three ingredients of the present invention have
      been used as components in medicines or ointments, they have never
      appeared together in the form which has been found by the present
      inventor to be an extremely effective ointment for removing
      certain skin growths of the malignant type.<br>
      <br>
      I have discovered through repeated experimentation and treatment
      of human patients that if substantially equal parts, by weight, of
      powdered bloodroot, powdered ginger (kowlang) root, and zinc
      chloride are formed into a paste, allowed to stand, then applied
      to certain skin cancers such as epithelioma in a series of
      successive treatments as detailed below, the cancerous growth or
      lesion selectively becomes disengaged from the surrounding dermal
      region in a number of days and may be easily removed. After
      removal, I then begin treatment of the former site of the growth
      with a healing ointment which comprises hog lard, lanolin,
      liquefied phenol and tannic acid, as will be described later.<br>
      <br>
      My epitheliomal cancer-removing ointment comprises approximately
      equal parts by weight of (1) bloodroot in its powdered form such
      as Penick's "Initial Line" powdered bloodroot U.S.P. distributed
      by S. B. Penick and Co. of New York and Chicago, (2) powdered
      ginger root and (3) zinc chloride. The ginger root used was
      manufactured by S. B. Penick and Co. in its U.S.P. form. The zinc
      chloride may be, for example, the U.S.P. form 1-4326 marketed by
      the J. T. Baker Chemical Co. of Phillipsburg, N.J.<br>
      <br>
      To make this epitheliomal cancer-removing ointment, the zinc
      chloride is exposed to air for several days whereupon it becomes a
      thick liquid. It is then added to the bloodroot and ginger root
      and blended together to form a paste which does not run or drop.
      Then the paste is allowed to set for about a week or two.<br>
      <br>
      When a patient with epithelioma, malignant moles or sun spots is
      treated, the ointment is applied with an applicator to the lesion
      which, at first, appears to be, externally, very small. The day
      after, the previously-applied ointment is removed by swabbing with
      a cotton-tipped applicator which has been dipped in rubbing
      alcohol. An additional amount of fresh growth-removing ointment is
      again applied to the lesion. In the days following, the treatment
      is repeated in the same way. These successive applications of the
      removing ointment result in the lesion appearing to have a
      progressively larger external aspect. Depending upon the original
      size of the lesion, the period of enlargement may range from 4-8
      days, for example. When the lesion maintains dimensional
      stability, it usually is ready to fall out and may easily be
      picked out.<br>
      <br>
      At this juncture, I have found that it is highly advantageous to
      use a second healing-promoting ointment. This ointment is made by
      mixing one half pound each of hog lard and lanolin (hydrous)
      U.S.P. grade 1-2253 such as the product distributed by the J. T.
      Baker Company mentioned above. To this combination 15-20 drops of
      liquefied phenol U.S.P. grade as distributed by J. T. Baker or
      Merck, for example, is added. Liquefied phenol is 89% phenol and
      11% water. Then 1/3 of a teaspoon of food grade gallotannic acid
      powder such as 1-0380 marketed by J. T. Baker and one oz. of white
      beeswax U.S.P. grade such as #0207 cakes sold by Humco Laboratory
      of Texarkana, Tex. are added. The ingredients are put into a
      double boiler and heated for 30-60 minutes until the mixture
      becomes entirely liquid, the ingredients being continually
      stirred. It is then allowed to cool whereupon it solidifies and
      becomes a salve or ointment.<br>
      <br>
      This salve is applied by the patient to the site of the former
      lesion twice daily. To prevent scarring, it is important to insure
      that no excessive phenol remains on the healing skin, so that
      after it is applied, it is washed off quickly with alcohol. After
      each three days of applying the healing salve, the patient should
      return to the doctor for a check-up.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A 62 year old white male had two epithelioma cancers; one one the
      nose (basal cell) which was 4 cm before and 6 cm after treatment
      and the second on his neck (squamous cell) which was 1/2 in.
      before and 11/2 in. after treatment. The removal salve was first
      applied on Feb. 2, and was treated with it each consecutive day
      from the 2nd to the 10th. On the 16th of Feb., both lesions were
      out and treatment with the healing salve began. On March 3, they
      were healed.<br>

        </big></div>
      <big> </big> <br>
      The invention relates to a bloodroot alkaloid dental plaque-proof
      mouth wash, which comprises trisodium citrate.dihydrate, citric
      acid anhydride, alcohol, polyoxyethylene (62)-polyoxypropylene
      (39)-polyoxyethylene (62) polyether, polyoxyethylene ether (20)
      sorbitan monooleate, essence, zinc chloride, glycerol, saccharin,
      bloodroot extract (1 percent) and refined water. The mouthwash is
      spitted after being kept in the mouth for 1 to 2 minutes. The pH
      value of the mouthwash is 4 to 5.6, and therefore, the mouthwash
      is very stable, can effectively absorb dental plaques, thereby
      playing a dental plaque-proof role.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical areas:</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a blood grassroots alkaloids,
      anti-plaque mouthwash, belongs to the field of oral health care.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technology:</b><br>
      <br>
      The plaque will lead to various diseases such as dental caries,
      periodontitis.<br>
      In order to prevent the plaque, it is necessary to clean the
      mouth.<br>
      <br>
      But currently, domestic and outside mouthwash many types of water,
      but a very effective anti-plaque mouthwash is rare.<br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide a pH value of
      from 4 to 5.6, very stable, dental plaque, which can effectively
      absorb play an anti-plaque blood grassroots alkaloids anti-plaque
      mouthwash.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a blood grassroots alkaloids
      anti-plaque mouthwash is tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, citric
      anhydride, ethanol, polyoxyethylene (62) polyoxypropylene (39)
      polyoxyethylene (62) polyethylene ether, polyoxyethylene vinyl
      ether (20) sorbitan monooleic acid ester, flavor, zinc chloride,
      glycerin, saccharin, blood grassroots extract (1%), and purified
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Containing spit in the mouth after one minute.<br>
      <br>
      Lift the etiology of dental caries, periodontitis, doctors will be
      referred to a single word: "plaque. Plaque is a thin film on the
      surface of the teeth contains many bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Its formation can be divided into three steps: First, in the
      saliva in the mouth to form a film on the tooth surface (its
      formation speed quickly, on the just cleaned teeth cooked minutes
      formation); then, intraoral The bacterial species ordered
      adsorption Ordering in this layer on the film; Finally, bacterial
      growth and reproduction in this layer of saliva film gradually
      cast the type and quantity of bacteria is gradually increased to
      become mature plaque.<br>
      <br>
      Individual bacteria in the dental plaque bacteria associated with
      oral, by virtue of the the plaque layer unique film structure,
      various bacteria firmly adhering to the tooth surface and can not
      be washed out or rinse out, difficult to remove.<br>
      <br>
      The same time, the connection between the membrane of bacteria is
      also very close, able to resist the defense capabilities of the
      human body and the killing effect of the drug, and thus long-term
      survival in the oral cavity. Harmful bacteria in the plaque
      gradually increased, and can lead to the various diseases of the
      teeth and gums.<br>
      <br>
      4 to 5.6, the pH value of the present invention is very stable,
      which can effectively absorb the dental plaque, and play a role in
      anti-plaque.<br>
      <br>
      Below in conjunction with the embodiment of the present invention
      will be further described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1:</b> for each mouthwash the ratio of the respective
      components of the water as follows: tri-sodium citrate dihydrate
      0.3%, 0.02% of citric anhydride, ethanol 12%, polyoxyethylene (62)
      polyoxypropylene (39) polyoxypropylene ethylene (62) Polyether
      0.3% polyoxyethylene ether (20) sorbitan monooleate 0.3% 0.5%,
      flavor, zinc chloride and 0.4%, glycerol 5.0%, 0.10% saccharin,
      blood grassroots extract ( 1%) 5.0%, and the balance purified
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Made mouthwash directly after mouthwash containing spit in the
      mouth after 1-2 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      For 10 consecutive days, every morning and evening, dental caries
      pain eased significantly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2:</b> The ratio of the each mouthwash respective
      components is as: tri-sodium citrate dihydrate 0.2%, 0.01% of the
      citric anhydride, ethanol 10%, polyoxyethylene (62)
      polyoxypropylene (39) polyoxypropylene ethylene (62) Polyether
      0.2% polyoxyethylene ether (20) sorbitan monooleate 0.2% 0.2%,
      flavor, zinc chloride and 0.2%, glycerol 3.0%, 0.05% saccharin,
      blood grassroots extract ( 1%) 3.0%, and the balance purified
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Made mouthwash directly after mouthwash containing spit in the
      mouth after 1-2 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Long-term use, gingival inflammation disappeared a month later,
      the plaque did not continue to increase.<br>
