      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The perpetual
      static energies, as provided by the electron (self spin) and the
      permanent magnet (push and pull) are combined to form a dynamic
      function. Electrons emitted from a heated coil F are entrapped
      permanently within the central magnetic field of a cylindrical
      magnet M5. A second magnet M6, in opposite polarity to the poles
      of the electrons causes polar tilt, and precession. This
      precession radiates powerful electromagnetic field to a coil L
      between the cylindrical magnet and a vacuum chamber C - wound in a
      direction perpendicular to the polar axes of the electrons.
      Alternatively, the electromagnetic radiation is emitted as
      coherent light. The original source of electrons is shut off after
      entrapment.<br>

      <br>
      This invention relates to methods and means for producing
      perpetual motion. An object of the invention is, therefore, to
      produce useful perpetual motion for utility purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief embodiment of the invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The electron has acquired self spin from the very beginning of its
      birth during the time of creation of matter, and represents a
      perpetual energy. But self spin alone, without polar motion is not
      functional, and therefore, useful energy cannot be derived
      therefrom. Similarly, the permanent magnet represents a perpetual
      energy, but since its poles are stationary, useful energy cannot
      be derived from it.<br>
      <br>
      However, the characteristics of these two types of static energies
      differ one from the other, and therefore the two types of energies
      can be combined in such a manner that, the combined output can be
      converted into perpetual polar motion.<br>
      <br>
      In one exemplary mode, a cylindrical vacuum chamber having a
      filament and a cathode inside, is enclosed within the central
      magnetic field of a cylindrical permanent magnet, the
      magnetization of which can be in a direction either along the
      longitudinal axis, or from the center to the circumferential outer
      surface of the cylinder. When current is passed through the
      filament, the emitted electrons from the cathode are compressed
      into a beam at the center of the cylindrical chamber by the
      magnetic field of the cylindrical magnet. Thus, when the current
      through the filament is shut off, the electrons in the beam remain
      entrapped within said magnetic field permanently.<br>
      <br>
      In such an arrangement, the poles of the electrons are aligned
      uniformly. When a second permanent magnet is held against the beam
      in repelling polarity, the poles of the electrons are pushed and
      tilted from their normal longitudinal polar axes. In such tilted
      orientations, the electrons now start wobbling (precessing) in
      gyroscopic motions, just like a spinning top when it is tilted to
      one side. The frequency of this wobbling (precessional resonance)
      depends upon the field strengths of the two magnets, similar to
      the resonance of the violin string relative to its tensional
      stretch. The polar movements of the electrons radiate
      electromagnetic field, which is receivable by an inductance for
      conversion into any desired type of energy. Because of the
      uniformly aligned electrons, the output field is coherent, and the
      output is high.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Observed examples upon which the
        invention is based</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The apparatus can best be described by examples of a spinning top
      in wobbling motion. Thus, referring to the illustration of Figure
      1, assume that the spinning top T is made of magnetic material, as
      indicated by the polar signs (S and N). Even though the top is
      magnetic, the spin motion does not radiate any type of field, for
      reception and conversion into a useful type of energy. This is due
      to the known fact that, radiation is created only when the poles
      of the magnet are in motion, and in this case, the poles are
      stationary.<br>
      <br>
      When a magnet M1 is held from a direction perpendicular to the
      longitudinal polar axis of the top, as shown in Figure 2, the
      polar axis of the top will be tilted as shown, and keep on
      spinning in that tilted direction. When the magnet M1 is removed,
      however, the top will try to regain its original vertical posture,
      but in doing so, it will wobble in gyroscopic motion, such as
      shown in Figure 3. The faster the top spins, the faster the
      wobbling motion will be.<br>
      <br>
      The reason that the top tilts angularly, but does not wobble when
      the magnet M1 is held from horizontal direction, is that, the one
      sided pull prevents the top from moving away from the magnetic
      field for free circular wobble. But instead of holding the magnet
      M1 from the side of the top, we may also hold the magnet from a
      direction above the top, as shown in Figure 4. In this case,
      however, the polar signs between the magnet and the top are
      oriented in like signs, so that instead of pulling action, there
      is pushing action between the magnet and the top - causing angular
      tilt of the top, such as shown in Figure 4. The pushing action of
      the magnetic field from above the top is now equalized within a
      circular area, so that the top finds freedom to wobble in
      gyroscopic rotation.<br>
      <br>
      The important point in the above given explanation is that, the
      top tries to gain its original vertical position, but it is
      prevented to do so by the steady downward push by the static
      magnetic field of the magnet M2. Thus, as long as the top is
      spinning, it will wobble in a steady state. Since now there is
      polar motion in the wobbling motion of the top, this wobbling
      motion can easily be converted into useful energy. To make this
      conversion into perpetual energy, however, the top must be
      spinning perpetually. And nature has already provided a
      perpetually spinning magnetic top, which is called, the electron -
      guaranteed to spin forever, at a rate of 1.5 x 1023 (one hundred
      fifty thousand billion billion revolutions per second).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Best mode of carrying out the
        invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to the exemplary illustration of Figure 4, the spinning
      top T is pivoted to the base B by gravity.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the electron, however, it must be held tight
      between some magnetic forces. Thus, referring to the illustration
      of Figure 5, assume that an electron e is placed in the center of
      a cylindrical magnet M4. The direction of magnetization of the
      magnet M4, and the polar orientation of the electron e are marked
      in the drawing. In this case, when a permanent magnet M3 is placed
      at the open end of the cylindrical magnet M4, the electron e will
      precess, in a manner, as described by way of the spinning top. The
      difficulty in this arrangement is that, electrons cannot be
      separated in open air, and a vacuum chamber is required, as in the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 shows a vacuum chamber C, which contains a cylindrically
      wound filament F, connected to the battery B1 by way of the switch
      S1. Thus, when the switch S1 is turned ON, the filament F is
      lighted, and it releases electrons.External of the vacuum chamber
      C is mounted a cylindrical permanent magnet M5, which compresses
      the emitted electrons into a beam at the center of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      When the beam is formed, the switch is turned OFF, so that the
      beam of electrons is entrapped at the center of the chamber
      permanently.<br>
      <br>
      The permanent trapping of the electrons in the chamber C
      represents a permanent storage of static energy. Thus, when a
      permanent magnet M6 is placed to tilt the polar orientations of
      the uniformly poled electrons in the beam, they start precessing
      perpetually at a resonant frequency, as determined by the field
      strengths of the magnets M5 and M6.<br>
      <br>
      The precessing electrons in the beam will radiate quadrature
      phased electromagnetic field in a direction perpendicular to the
      polar axes of the electrons.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a coil L may be placed between the magnet M5 and the vacuum
      chamber C, to receive the radiated field from the beam. The output
      may then be utilized in different modes for practical purposes,
      for example, rectified for d-c power use.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The electron beam-forming
        cylindrical magnet</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      M5, which may also be called a focusing magnet, is shown to be
      bipolar along the longitudinal axis. The direction of
      magnetization, however, may be from the central opening to the
      outer periphery of the magnet, as shown by the magnet M7, in
      Figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      But the precessing magnet M6 will be needed in either case.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrangement of Figure 6, I have included a current control
      grid G. While it is not essential for operation of the arrangement
      shown, it may be connected to a high negative potential B2 by the
      switch S2 just before switching the S1 in OFF position, so that
      during the cooling period of the filament, there will occur no
      escape of any electrons from the beam to the cathode. Also, the
      grid G may be switched ON during the heating period of the
      cathode, so that electrons are not forcibly released from the
      cathode during the heating period, and thereby causing no damage
      to the cathode, or filament.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biological precessional resonance</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Electron precessional resonance occurs in living tissue matter, as
      observed in laboratory tests. This is called ESR (Electron Spin
      Resonance) or PMR (Paramagnetic Resonance). In tissue matter,
      however, the precessing electron is entrapped between two
      electrons, as shown in Figure 7, and the polar orientations are
      indicated by the polar signs and shadings, for clarity of drawing.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simulation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The arrangement of Figure 7 may be simulated artificially in a
      manner as shown in Figure 9, wherein, the electron trapping magnet
      is a pair of parallel spaced magnets M8. In actual practice,
      however, thestructure of this pair of magnets M8 can be modified.
      For example, a second pair of magnets M8 may be disposed between
      the two pairs, so that the directions of the transverse fields
      between the two pairs cross mutually perpendicular at the central
      longitudinal axis of the vacuum chamber. The inner field radiating
      surfaces of these two pairs of magnets may be shaped circular, and
      the two pairs may be assembled, either by physical contact to each
      other, or separated from each other.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to the arrangements of Figures 6, 9 and 10, when the
      electron is in precessional gyroscopic motion, the radiated field
      in a direction parallel to the polar axis of the electron, is a
      single phased corkscrew waveform, which when precessed at light
      frequency, the radiation produces the effect of light.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas, the field in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the
      electron produces a quadrature phased electromagnetic radiation.
      Thus, instead of utilizing the output of electron precession for
      energy purposes, it may be utilized for field radiation of either
      light or electromagnetic waves, such as indicated by the arrows in
      Figure 9. In this case, the output will be coherent field
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In reference to the arrangement of Figure 6, the electron emission
      is shown to occur within the central magnetic field of the
      focusing magnet M5. It may be practically desired, however, that
      these electrons are injected into the central field of the
      cylindrical magnet from a gun assembly, as shown in an exemplary
      arrangement of Figure 10. In this case, the vacuum chamber C is
      flanged at the right hand side, for mounting an electron emitting
      cathode 1 (the filament not being shown), and a curved
      electron-accelerating gun 2. The central part of this flange is
      recessed for convenience of mounting an electron-tilting magnet
      (as shown), as close as possible to the electron beam. In
      operation, when current is passed through the filament, and a
      positive voltage is applied (not shown) to the gun 2, the emitted
      electrons from the cathode are accelerated and injected into the
      central field of the magnet 11. Assuming that the open end of the
      gun 2 overlaps slightly the open end of the cylindrical central
      field of the magnet M1, and the positive accelerating voltage
      applied to the gun 2 is very low, the accelerated electrons will
      enter the central field of the magnet My 1, and travel to the
      other end of the field. Due to the low speed acceleration of the
      electrons, however, they cannot spill out of the field, and become
      permanently entrapped therein.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to the direction in which the coil L1 is positioned, its
      winding should be in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal
      axis of the beam to which the polar axes of the electrons are
      aligned uniformly in parallel. In one practical mode, the coil L1
      may be wound in the shape of a surface winding around a tubular
      form fitted over the cylindrical vacuum chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to the operability of the apparatus as disclosed herein,
      the illustration in Figure 7 shows that the field output in a
      direction parallel to the polar axis of the electron is singular
      phased, and it produces the effect of light when the precessional
      frequency is at a light frequency. Whereas, the output in a
      direction perpendicular to the polar axis of the electron is
      quadrature phased, which is manifested in practiced
      electromagnetic field transmission.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to experimental references, an article entitled
      "Magnetic Resonance at high Pressure" in the "Scientific American"
      by George B. Benedek, page 105 illustrates a precessing nucleus,
      and indicates the direction of the electromagnetic field radiation
      by the precessing nucleus. The same technique is also used in the
      medical apparatus "Nuclear magnetic resonance" now used in
      numerous hospitals for imaging ailing tissues (see "High
      Technology" Nov. Dec. 1982. Refer also to the technique of
      detecting Electron Spin Resonance, in which electrons (called
      "free radicals") are precessed by the application of external
      magnetic field to the tissue matter. In all of these practices,
      the electromagnetic field detecting coils are directed
      perpendicular to the polar axes of the precessing electrons or the
      nuclei.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to the production of light by a precessing electron, in
      a direction parallel to the polar axis of the precessing electron,
      see an experimental reference entitled "Free electrons make
      powerful new laser" published in "high Technology" February 1983
      page 69.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to the aspect of producing and storing the electrons in
      a vacuum chamber, it is a known fact by practice that the
      electrons are entrapped within the central field of a cylindrical
      permanent magnet, and they will remain entrapped as long as the
      magnet remains in position.<br>
      <br>
      In regard to the performance of obtaining precessional resonance
      of the electron, the simple example of a wobbling top is
      sufficient, as proof of operability.<br>
      <br>
      Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention, and
      in view of the suggestions of numerous possibilities of
      modifications, adaptations, adjustments and substitutions of
      parts, it should be obvious to the skilled in related arts that
      other possibilities are within the spirit and scope of the present
      invention.<br>
