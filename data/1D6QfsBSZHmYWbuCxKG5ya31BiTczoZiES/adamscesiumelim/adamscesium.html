        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          &nbsp;In yet another science breakthrough for humanity, the
          U.S. patent office has just awarded patent # US 9526751 B2 for
          a unique formula called “Cesium Eliminator” which eliminates
          radioactive cesium isotopes from the human digestive tract
          where contaminated food and water may have been ingested.<br>
          <br>
          I developed this lifesaving invention, which is also described
          at CesiumEliminator.com, to save lives in the aftermath of a
          nuclear accident, nuclear terrorism or nuclear war.<br>
          <br>
          The formula is based on a unique combination of zeolites and
          dehydrated seaweeds which my laboratory (CWClabs.com) has
          confirmed to be extremely effective at binding with and
          eliminating cesium-137 from the human digestive tract.<br>
          <br>
          I’m publicly announcing, right now, that I will donate
          manufacturing and licensing rights for this invention to any
          state or national government, anywhere in the world, that
          wishes to use this technology to protect its citizens from
          nuclear fallout from any cause. I have also stockpiled 10,000
          kg of raw materials for this formula in a warehouse in Texas,
          and I plan to manufacture and donate this product for free to
          any victims of nuclear incidents that might take place in the
          continental United States or in the State of Texas.<br>
          Lifesaving invention could help save millions of lives
          following a nuclear disaster, act of terrorism or act of war<br>
          <br>
          As described on CesiumEliminator.com:<br>
          <br>
          Cesium-137 is radioactive isotope produced from nuclear
          catastrophes like Chernobyl and Fukushima. It’s also a deadly
          radioisotope created in the aftermath of nuclear bombs.<br>
          <br>
          Cesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years and it mimics potassium
          in soils and plants. It contaminates soils for 200 – 300
          years, making the land unusable for agriculture. Cesium-137
          contamination is the reason why no one lives near Chernobyl to
          this very day.<br>
          <br>
          Once you eat cesium-137, you are irradiating your body from
          the inside out.<br>
          This invention eliminates over 95% of cesium-137 from the
          digestive tract<br>
          <br>
          As the laboratory results chart shows below, this invention
          eliminates over 95% of cesium elements from the digestive
          tract, making it extremely effective at protecting the body
          from absorbing radioactive cesium.<br>
          <br>
          Why is this important? When people drink radioactive water or
          eat radioactive food, Cesium Eliminator can capture up to 95%
          of the radioactive cesium elements in food and water before it
          gets absorbed into the blood stream and gets deposited in soft
          tissues throughout the body:<br>
          <br>
          Exposure to Cesium-137 causes cancer from high-energy gamma
          radiation<br>
          <br>
          According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control:<br>
          <br>
          Exposure to Cs-137 can increase the risk for cancer because of
          exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to
          Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the
          radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues,
          especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta
          particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk.<br>
          <br>
          Even the New York Times, which is often reluctant to report
          any legitimate scientific truth on topics like vaccine
          ingredients, acknowledges the harm caused by radioactive
          cesium-137:<br>
          <br>
          Over the long term, the big threat to human health is
          cesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years. The radiation
          from cesium-137 can throw cellular machinery out of order,
          including the chromosomes, leading to an increased risk of
          cancer.<br>
          Iodine does not block radioactive cesium<br>
          <br>
          Many people are purchasing iodine products such as potassium
          iodide or nascent iodine as a defense against radiation. But
          few people know the truth about iodine: It does NOT block
          radioactive cesium.<br>
          <br>
          Iodine protects primarily just one organ: your thyroid. And it
          protects your thyroid from just one radioactive isotope:
          Iodine-131, which has a half-life of around 7 days.<br>
          <br>
          Iodine does nothing to protect you from radioactive cesium.
          Iodine, in fact, has no ability whatsoever to block, capture
          or bind with cesium isotopes. (Iodine binds well with calcium
          and potassium, however.)<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, the over-marketing of iodine for radiation
          protection has misled many people into thinking they are
          “bulletproof” against radiation if they take iodine. This is
          blatantly false.<br>
          <br>
          The best protection comes from covering all routes of exposure
          to ionizing radiation: air, food, water and direct exposure to
          radioactive sources (such as fuel rods).<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, all those preparing against nuclear catastrophe
          should protect themselves from all radioactive isotopes,
          including iodine-131 and cesium-137.<br>
          Cesium Eliminator is NOT currently for sale to the public, but
          we can manufacture it in quantity for state and national
          governments<br>
          <br>
          Importantly, Cesium Eliminator, the dietary supplement formula
          based on my U.S. patent, is not currently for sale to the
          public. Because the primary ingredient of the formula —
          Zeolites — always contains high levels of aluminum, we are
          withholding direct sales to the public. This is because we do
          not want people taking the product as a “vitamin” or a routine
          supplement. It isn’t a vitamin at all. It’s an emergency use
          dietary elimination technology that binds with and helps your
          body eliminate radioactive elements, and it’s only appropriate
          to be consumed in a dire emergency involving the release of
          radioactive elements.<br>
          <br>
          (In a pinch, for anyone who wants to take advantage of this
          discovery in a real emergency, you can simply consume
          zeolites, knowing that you’ll also be consuming large
          quantities of aluminum at the same time. But in the race of
          aluminum vs. cesium-137, it’s far more important to eliminate
          the cesium.)<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          A dietary supplement comprising powdered ingredients: zeolite
          powder: 70%-5%, dehydrated seaweed: 5%-25%, seawater extract:
          5%-10% Chlorella: 5%-10% and Spirulina: 5%-10%, methods of

          <br>
          <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0001] A dietary supplement having affinity for cesium-137 and
          cesium-134 (radioisotopes).<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0002] Cesium Eliminator (CE-137) is a dietary supplement
          comprising zeolite powder plus four natural ingredients
          generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”) by the FDA. In
          combination, they have the property of demonstrating strong
          affinity for cesium-137 and cesium-134.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] CE-137 is a dietary supplement made of natural
          ingredients and assembled for the purpose of allowing people
          to consume the capsules alongside herbs, foods or beverages
          which they believe may contain radioactive cesium isotopes.
          Radioactive cesium mimics potassium in plant biology and is
          the primary long-term pollutant found in areas impacted by
          nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. The
          half-life of cesium-137 is approximately 30 years. The isotope
          persists in an agricultural environment for 200-300 years with
          sufficient strength to make all foods grown in such soils too
          dangerous for consumption by humans or animals.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] CE-137 is intended to be take orally during a meal in
          which components of the meal are suspected of containing
          concerning concentrations of cesium-134 or cesium-137. CE-137
          selectively binds with the radioactive cesium isotopes,
          capturing them and removing them from the body through normal
          bowel movements that eliminate fecal matter. The primary
          benefit is that CE-137 prevents the radioisotopes from being
          absorbed through intestinal walls and into the bloodstream,
          thereby limiting the time the radioisotopes exist in the body.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0005] An object of the invention is to provide a dietary
          supplement composition, comprising: powdered ingredients:<br>
          a) Zeolite powder: 70%-95 wt. %<br>
          b) Dehydrated seaweed: 5%-25 wt. %<br>
          c) Seawater extract: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
          d) Chlorella: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
          e) Spirulina: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
           particle sizes for all particles can be from #40 mesh to #100
          mesh.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Another object of the invention is to provide a method
          of producing a dietary supplement composition, comprising
          combining powdered ingredients as follows,<br>
          a) Zeolite powder: 70%-95 wt. %<br>
          b) Dehydrated seaweed: 5%-25 wt. %<br>
          c) Seawater extract: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
          d) Chlorella: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
          e) Spirulina: 5%-10 wt. %<br>
           particle sizes for all particles can be from #40 mesh to #100
          mesh.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] Another object is to provide a method of causing
          cesium-137 and cesium-134 to be excreted from an animal,
          comprising feeding to an animal in need of fecal excretion of
          cesium-137 or cesium-134 a dietary supplement containing an
          effective amount of zeolite powder, wherein about 99% of
          particles in said zeolite powder are larger than 5 microns,
          plus effective amounts of dehydrated seaweed, seawater
          extract, Chlorella, and Spirulina to remove ionic aluminum or
          lead introduced by the zeolite.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0018] CE-137 is based on five key ingredients: zeolite
          powder, dehydrated seaweed, seawater extract, chlorella,
          spirulina. CE-137 is laboratory validated to bind with 96% of
          cesium atoms during digestion. The zeolite powder is the key
          element in this formula, as it binds with and captures cesium
          atoms.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] However, zeolite powders normally release very high
          levels of aluminum, and somewhat high levels of lead. The
          other ingredients in the present invention are designed to
          bind with and capture the excess aluminum and lead that is
          introduced by the zeolites, allowing zeolites to be safely
          used to bind cesium.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Zeolites are, in general, microporous, aluminosilicate
          minerals of type Clinoptilolite. All zeolite materials contain
          a high concentration of aluminum in its structure. All
          zeolites also contain lead. Typically, zeolites which are
          digested in gastric acid release significant concentrations of
          aluminum, and much lower concentrations of lead. This
          invention makes use of chemistry discoveries and methods which
          minimize these releases of aluminum and lead, resulting in
          them being measured at near-zero levels.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] It is believed that CE-137 works on a combination of
          physical adsorption as well as ion exchange. Without being
          bound by theory, it is thought that the zeolite physically
          adsorbs cesium atoms due to its unique physical structure.
          This adsorption process works in the same way that carbon
          (charcoal) adsorbs mercury. That is, it is a physical binding
          process, not necessarily a chemical ion exchange.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] The aluminum and lead given off by zeolites are bound
          and captured by the other ingredients in the formula. It is
          thought that the Al and Pb are bound using ion exchange
          processes.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] The finished CE-137 product is provided as an
          encapsulated powder. The powder is generally grayish white in
          color.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] CE-137 is a dietary supplement comprising zeolites of
          size from #50 mesh to #100 mesh, plus natural ingredients
          assembled for the purpose of allowing people to consume the
          capsules alongside herbs, foods or beverages which they
          believe may contain cesium isotopes. CE-137 binds to cesium
          ions and prevents them from being absorbed through intestinal
          walls during digestion. Most dietary substances show little or
          no selective affinity for cesium when subjected to an
          identical testing process.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] During digestion the gastric acid found in human
          stomachs interacts with CE-137 ingredients, causing them to
          attain a high state of affinity for ionic heavy metals such as
          lead and aluminum, Heavy metals tend to carry positive charges
          such as Aluminum (+3), Lead (+2), etc. CE-137 carries a strong
          negative ionic charge, once activated, causing it to bind with
          lead and aluminum.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The formula of the invention bind with and carries
          cesium isotopes plus the heavy metals introduced with the
          zeolites through the entire digestive tract, ultimately
          transporting the heavy metals out of the body and preventing
          them from being reabsorbed through intestinal walls.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Radiation Defense Ingredients Preparation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0027] The following section describes the harvesting and
          preparation of each ingredient in the formula:<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Zeolite powder (Clinoptilolite powder) is obtained by
          mining zeolite material from zeolite-rich mines which are
          located in North America and other nations such as Turkey. Raw
          zeolite material is scooped out of the ground using excavation
          equipment such as a Caterpillar 20-ton excavator. The material
          is loaded into large trucks which transport it to a washing
          station to remove dust and soil debris. Once washed, the
          material is dried and then milled to the desired mesh size.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Dehydrated seaweed: Seaweed specimens are collected by
          swimmers from shallow coastal waters and stacked in a large
          washing container. They are washed to remove debris and salt
          water. After washing they are dried using a large commercial
          air dryer with a slow mixing/agitation wheel in order to allow
          the seaweed sufficient exposure to air. Once fully dried, the
          seaweed specimens are ground to a power of approximately a
          #100 mesh size, producing a gray-white powder. This powder is
          packaged for use in manufacturing.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Seawater extract: A saturated salt (brine) area of
          seawater is identified, usually at very low depth. The water
          is extracted by means of a long pump, then mixed with
          dolomitic limestone (CaMg(Co3)2) to precipitate solids. The
          mixture is heated to high temperature, driving off the carbon
          dioxide and leaving “calcined dolime,” a seawater extract.
          This solid material is ground to approximately #100 mesh
          particle size.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Chlorella: Strains of the single-celled algae known as
          Chlorella vulgaris are grown in large vats of water and fed
          sufficient nutrients to support their growth to maturity. Once
          fully grown, chlorella is harvested out of the water by means
          of large filters which separate the chlorella alga from the
          water in which they were grown. This green mass is rinsed with
          fresh water, flash dried on a conveyor belt, then agitated by
          powerful sonic blasts in order to disrupt their cell walls and
          provide improved bioavailability. Finally, this green mass is
          powdered to a relatively large mesh size of around #40 mesh.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Spirulina: Spirulina pacifica is a strain of edible
          blue-green algae which can be grown in large outdoor pools
          which combine fresh water with deep ocean water that enriches
          the spirulina with minerals. Once fully grown, the spirulina
          is harvested from the water by means of large filters giving a
          green mass which is rinsed with fresh water, flash dried on a
          conveyor belt, then ground to a relatively large mesh size of
          around #40 mesh.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] Particle sizes of the above ingredient are specifically
          chosen to avoid passing through intestinal walls (99% of
          particles are &gt;5 microns in diameter).<br>
          <br>
          [0034] Carriers and processing aids may be used to obtain
          satisfactory flow and packaging characteristics. These
          excipients can include antitacking agents such as talc,
          stearic acid, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide
          and the like, surfactants such as polysorbates and potassium
          lauryl sulphate, fillers such as precipitated calcium
          carbonate, polishing agents such as beeswax and the like. All
          these excipients can be used at levels well known to the
          persons skilled in the art<br>
          <br>
          [0035] In general the product is manufactured in an
          environment free of airborne metals in order to preserve the
          ion exchange “potential” of the raw materials.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] In another embodiment, zeolite powder can be consumed
          separately, along with dehydrated seaweed: 5%-25%, Seawater
          extract: 5%-10%, Chlorella: 5%-10%, Spirulina: 5%-10%, with
          the Zeolite powder again constituting 70%-95%.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Laboratory Protocol for Validation of CE-137</b><br>
          <br>
          [0037] CE-137 is specifically designed to minimize the release
          of aluminum and lead which are both typically released by
          zeolites. A typical off-the-shelf zeolite, when 3 grams are
          combined with 20 ml of synthetic gastric acid, will release
          approximately 8 mg of aluminum and 40 micrograms of lead.
          CE-137 reduces the release of these metals to approximately 20
          micrograms of aluminum (or almost 1/500th the typical release)
          and near-zero micrograms of lead.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] The following protocol is used for laboratory
          validation of the CE-137 formula:<br>
          <br>
          [0039] First, all laboratory protocols for handling
          radioactive substances must be followed, including operating
          air exchange filters, wearing protective lead vests, wearing
          protective lead-based goggles and wearing respirators with
          filters that can capture and remove airborne radioactive dust.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] In addition, radiological samples must be acquired
          through legal processes requiring registration and licensing
          with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). All safety
          protocols and laboratory procedures customarily used for
          handling radioactive materials must be strictly followed.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] One gram of CE-137 formula is placed in a polypropylene
          vial (vial #1). A second vial is set aside for control testing
          (vial #2), with no CE-137 placed in it (zero grams).<br>
          <br>
          [0042] To each vial, 20 ml of synthetic gastric acid is added.
          This acid has a pH of around 1.0 and is made of deionized
          water (DI), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium chloride and
          potassium chloride, all in ratios that mimic typical human
          gastric acid.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] A 2 ml liquid “spike” of radioisotope Cs-137 is then
          added to both vials using precise volumetric liquid handling
          via pipette. This spike contains a known concentration of
          Cs-137, typically in the range of 5 ppm-15 ppm. The strength
          of the radiation given off by the Cs-137 is not relevant, only
          the concentration of cesium atoms.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] Both vials are then subjected to simulated digestion
          for a period of 8 hours. This digestion consists of human body
          temperature and agitation designed to mimic digestion in the
          human stomach.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] After digestion, both vials are filtered through a
          2-micron filter to remove any solid particles which would be
          too large to pass through intestinal walls. 5 ml of the
          remaining liquid is extracted from each vial and placed in a
          fresh, new vial in preparation for acid digestion. 5 ml of
          nitric acid (HNO3) is added to each vial. Both vials are
          digested via HotBlock digestion, at a temperature of 100° C.
          for a period of two hours. The vials are then removed from the
          HotBlock and allowed to cool.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Both vials are then normalized to 50 ml total volume
          using a blank acid normalization liquid made of DI water, 2%
          HNO3 and 0.5% HCl. These vials are placed in an autosampler
          connected to an ICP-MS atomic spectroscopy instrument which
          has been calibrated by the manufacturer and validated by field
          technicians.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] The instrument runs a multi-element custom calibration
          process followed by a mid-range calibration check. Calibration
          blanks are also run before and after the samples in order to
          further confirm the accuracy of the instrument. External
          calibration solutions are prepared and nm at 0 ppb, 1 ppb, 10
          ppb, 100 ppb and 1000 ppb concentrations. And internal
          standard is mixed with the sample intake liquid for analysis
          accuracy.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Unknown samples are then run and concentrations of
          analytes are calculated from the calibration runs, as it
          customary in all ICP-MS laboratory operations. Specifically,
          analytes tested in this protocol must include Cs, Al and Pb.
          The cesium concentration found in vial #2 provide the
          “baseline concentration” of cesium atoms in the total 22 ml of
          synthetic gastric acid. Cesium concentrations found in vial #1
          are then compared to the baseline. The difference in the two
          concentrations is the reduction of cesium-137 concentration
          caused by the CE-137 formula.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] In addition, Al and Pb concentrations found in vial #1
          are compared to zero, which is the level of Al and Pb in the
          gastric acid. All Al and Pb found in vial #1 are known to have
          been released by the CE-137 formula, which is specifically
          designed to substantially minimize these releases.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] In this laboratory testing. CE-137 was shown to
          accomplish approximately a 96% reduction in Cesium-137. In
          addition, the introduction of aluminum and lead, both
          typically released by zeolite materials, are minimized
          essentially to zero due to the ion exchange effects of the
          accompanying materials in the CE-137 formula; resulting in Al
          below 1 ppm, and resulting in Pb below 50 ppb.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] Most dietary substances, when subjected to an identical
          testing process show little or no selective affinity for
          cesium-137 binding.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Encapsulation Process</b><br>
          <br>
          [0052] The CE-137 powder is encapsulated and packaged using
          traditional powder encapsulation methods which are customarily
          used in dietary supplements manufacturing. Specifically, raw
          materials are weighed, apportioned and blended using a large
          commercial blender. The resulting blended power is deposited
          into the encapsulation machine. Empty vegetarian capsules are
          also deposited into the machine. The machine opens each
          capsule and fills each capsule with approximately 400 mg of
          power, then firmly closes each capsule.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] Capsules are then counted by machine and dropped into
          supplement bottles. Desiccants are dropped into the bottles to
          absorb moisture. A capper affixes a cap with a special seal
          containing both a sealant and a thin metallic element which is
          sensitive to induction. An induction machine exposes the lid
          of the bottle to a brief electric current sufficient to create
          heat to seal the top of the bottle, under the lid. A shrink
          bander machine affixes a shrink band around the neck of the
          bottle. A heat tunnel shrinks the shrink band, creating a
          tight seal. A labeler affixes the product label. The bottle is
          then boxed into cases for distribution.<br>
