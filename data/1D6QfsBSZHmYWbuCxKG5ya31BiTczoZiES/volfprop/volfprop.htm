      <p>A design for a siren gave Christian A. Volf, Danish-borm
        acoustical engineer, an idea that may lead to such a new
        departure in aviation as the aerial leviathan on this page. </p>
      <p>One day in his New York City laboratory, Volf was struck with
        the likeness between the spinning rotor that makes a siren's
        whine and an airplane's whirling propeller. The qualities that
        make a good siren, he observed, make a bad propeller for one
        reason alone --- noise. Aviation engineers would like to quiet
        the propellers of planes, for they make even more sound than the
        motor. </p>
      <p>Many aviation experts have sought better propellers, but Volf
        started from an entirely new angle --- that of the acoustical
        expert. A "silent siren" could easily be built. Proceeding on
        this idea, he set out to design a noiseless airplane propeller.
        Instead of slashing at air, it would slip through it. The result
        of his work is a novel "spinner" or rotor rimmed with
        three-bladed scoops. </p>
      <p>Volf set up his new propeller and a standard marine propeller
        in a tank of goldfish. The fish were struck and kiled by the
        revolving blades of the standard propeller. But they were sucked
        through the blades of Volf's propeller, following the natural
        course of the water, uninjured. </p>
      <p>Whirling the new rotor in air confirmed that it was silent. But
        it showed a fact far more interesting. Its tractive force upon
        models was amazing, according to Volf. The combination of
        suction and pressure that it produced seemed to give an
        efficiency far surpassing that of standard propellers. </p>
      <p>Out of this idea was born the revolutionary airplane that Volf
        now proposes. Enormous and silent, it would be driven by 8 of
        the odd spinners, or rotors, that Volf has invented, arranged in
        pairs. Each pair would have a vane above and below to direct the
        air through the blades. The whole assembly of rotors and vanes
        would be revolved at will by the pilot to tilt the ship up or
        down. </p>
      <p>Theoretically, Volf declares, the spinners should be so much
        more efficient than ordinary propellers that they could support
        an airplane with practically no wing at all. He proposes first
        to build a wingless craft, and then add as much wing as turns
        out to be necessary for flight. </p>

      <p>This invention is a rotor, impeller, propeller, or the like,
        which is capable of a variety of uses. The rotor comprises a
        plurality of blades of special design, one of the main features
        of which is that the fluid displaced by the rotor is discharged
        directly rearward substantially parallel to the axis of
        rotation. The rotor is capable of&nbsp; broad application in
        pumping and displacing fluids, either gaseous or liquid. In
        other words, it is capable of use as a water pump, as an air
        pump, as a supercharger and in any other application where it is
        desired to displace a fluid. </p>
      <p>The rotor comprises a plurality of blades, one of the chief
        features of which is a flange at the end of each blade extending
        substantially at right angles to the blade, this flange serving
        to prevent the escape of fluid from the blades in a radial
        direction, and serving to direct it straight to the rear. It is,
        of course, well understood, that the reactive force of a
        propeller is directly proportional&nbsp; to the weight of fluid
        displaced rearwardly; fluid displaced tangentially or outwradly,
        has very little effect in creating a reactive push. </p>
      <p>In fact, this propeller will direct the fluid leaving the
        blades not only directly rearwardly, but in a path which
        converges slightly toward the axis of rotation, which direction
        of flow tends to fill in the low pressure area caused by fluid
        flowing past the propeller hub and blades. </p>
      <p>More specifically, each blade of the propeller comprises a back
        portion, which is substantially flat, the plane of which is
        substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Merging
        with and connected to the back portion of the blade is an angled
        impeller portion, which is the promary agent in driving the
        fluid rearwardly. Bridging the space at the ends of the back and
        impeller portions, is a flange portion which is substantially
        perpendicular to the faces of the back and impeller portions.
        This flange is an important feature of the invention and is in
        the shape of a segment of a cylinder, the axis of which is
        coincident with the axis of the rotor. </p>
      <p>The general features of the invention having been thus
        outlined, reference is now made to the accompanying drawings
        illustrating specific embodiments of the invention. </p>

      <p>Referrring now to these drawings, the rotor comprises a hub 2,
        from which radiate a plurality of blades oindicated generally at
        4.Each blade comprises a back portion 6, which is substantially
        flat, and the plane of which is substantialy perpendicular to
        the axis 8-8 of the rotor. Secured to one edge of the back
        portion 6, along the line 10, is an angled impeller portion 12.
      </p>
      <p>The rear edge of the impeller, represented by the line 10, is
        substantially perpendicular to the axis of the rotor. The
        delivery edge of the impeller portion, represented by line 13,
        extends inwardly at an angle, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, so as
        to converge with respect to edge 10. </p>
      <p>Bridging across the space between the ends of back portion 6
        and impeller portion 12 and attached to each of these portions
        along the lines 14 and 16 respectively is a flange 18, which is
        in the shape of a segment of a cylinder, the axis of which is
        coincidnet with the axis of rotation 8.&nbsp; The curved flange
        18 is preferably substantially perpendicular to the plane of the
        blade portions 6 and 12, that is to say, a tangent drawn to 18
        at any point along the lines 14 or 16 would be substantially
        perpendicular to the plane of the blade portions 6 or 12. </p>
      <p>As shown more particularly in Figure 2, teh flange 18, looked
        at from above, is substantially in the shape of a parallelogram
        with substantially equal sides. </p>
      <p>Fitted on the hub 2 at the delivery side of the rotor is a
        conical cap 20 or the like for preventing eddying at this point.
      </p>
      <p>When the rotor is rotated in the direction of the arrow at the
        right of Figure 2, fluid is driven as indicated by the arrows 22
        substantially directly rearwardly although there is a definite
        tendency to drive the liquid or fluid along slightly converging
        lines, converging towareds the axis of rotation as indicated by
        the arrows 22. However, the blades can be designed to drive the
        fluid either directly rearwardly, or rearwardly on slightly
        converging lines, as desired. </p>
      <p>Fluid enters between the blades through the spaces 24 at the
        intake side of the propeller. </p>
      <p>The intake of one of these spaces 24 is substantially equal in
        area to the area of one of the back portions of a blade 6, which
        area is also approximately the same as the inside area of an
        impeller blade 12, and is also substantially equal to the
        outside area of one of the flange portions 18. </p>
      <p>In operation, when the rotor is rotated, fluid enters between
        the blades at 24 and is driven directly rearwardly, or
        rearwardly on the slightly converging lines, by the cooperative
        action of the blade portions. This cooperative action may be
        expalined as follows. Fluid enters between the blades on the
        rotor and the angle at which they are placed, each of the rotors
        being the same, and their sum being 360 degrees. The angle of
        the impelling surface of the following blade counteracts this
        angle of the fluid and straightens it out. in the case of a
        6-blade rotor, fluid enters at an angle of 30 degrees with the
        axis of rotation of the rotor and meets the impelling surface of
        the next blade, which is at a 30 degree angle and is going in
        the opposite direction from the fluid; the fluid is straightened
        out and driven in a line parallel with the axis. The flange 18
        prevents any radial or lateral escape of fluid and directs it
        rearwardly or rearwardly and inwardly. </p>
      <p>Referring now to Figure 4, each blade of the rotor has a back
        portion 6 and impeller portion 12 and a flange 18, as before.
        The corners between 6, 12 and 18 are preferably filled out and
        rounded out, as indicated at 26, so as to eliminate sharp
        corners and prevent the formation of eddies, thus promoting the
        smooth flow of fluid. </p>
      <p>The delivery end of the hub 28 is provided with a cone 30 for
        preventing eddying on the delivery side. On the intake side the
        hub is provided with a concial extension 34 which serves to
        guide the fluid outwardly along its outer surface to the intake
        spaces 24 between the blades. </p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the flow of liquid along member 34 and
        into the spaces 24 between the blades, spiral grooves 35 may be
        formed in the outside of member 34, the inner ends of the
        grooves opening into the space between the blades, at the roots
        thereof. </p>
      <p>Figure 7 illustrates a modification where the back portion of
        the blade, here designated as 6', is reduced for a substantial
        part of its area so as to facilitate a more rapid flow of fluid
        to the impeller on the suction side. The area of this portion
        6', reading outwardly from the root thereof, is substantially
        constant, not increasing appreciably until near its tip, where
        it is widest. The rest of the rotor is substantially like that
        shown in Figures 1 or 4 and corresponding parts are indicated by
        corresponding reference characters. This modification is
        particularly useful where there is not a great deal of back
        pressure to work against. If there is considerable back
        pressure, the form of invention shown in Figures 1 or 4 is more
        satisfactory. </p>
      <p>It is of course within the contemplation of the invention to
        use two or more of any forms of the rotors in series. Where used
        in series they would preferably run in opposite directions. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been illustrated in some detail, it
        should be understood that the invention is not to be limited to
        these details, but may be carried out in other ways as falling
        within the scope of the claims... </p>
