      <br>
      <div align="left"> Canton inventor Robert Cuppetilli has received
        a patent for a secondary heating system he says will sharply
        reduce energy consumption, slash customer bills and create
        thousands of jobs for companies that install it.<br>
        <br>
        “This is like a gold mine with no end in the bank,” Cuppetilli,
        72, said, sitting in a Canton home where he already has
        installed the new system.<br>
        <br>
        A consultant and former demolition business owner, Cuppetilli
        has enlisted partners and formed Sunrise Mechanical Inc., in
        hopes of marketing what he calls an industry-changing creation
        that has prototypes for natural gas, propane, fuel oil and
        electric heating systems.<br>
        <br>
        He also has a separate patent pending for a secondary cooling
        system he says will dramatically curb energy usage and reduce
        consumer bills.<br>
        <br>
        Cuppetilli has compared his energy usage and customer bills with
        those of friends and neighbors who don't have the secondary
        heating system, and he has kept charts to show the results.<br>
        <br>
        Last December, a Plymouth woman who has a home similar in size
        to Cuppetilli's 5,875-square-foot house had a utility bill of
        $631 compared to his $192, even though she kept her temperature
        setting at 62 degrees compared to his 71 degrees.<br>
        <br>
        Cuppetilli has compared several homes with similar results. Joe
        Barone, a business partner and attorney, has been impressed by
        the results.<br>
        <br>
        “The numbers are there, and they're quite phenomenal,” he said.
        “I think he's got something here.”<br>
        <br>
        Cuppetilli estimates his invention can reduce heating costs by
        67 percent or more. He hopes to secure bids from companies for
        the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute the secondary
        heating system.<br>
        <br>
        Essentially, the heating system operates in supplemental mode to
        carry water from a water heater to the heat exchanger within an
        air passage in the furnace. Air within the air passage passes
        through the heat exchanger and is heated from the water. Then,
        the water returns to the water tank.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, a supplemental thermostat connected to the system
        controls an air circulator for the furnace without requiring the
        furnace to be activated. The furnace will turn on and heat the
        air only if the supplemental mode isn't sufficient to maintain
        the desired temperature.<br>
        <br>
        Cuppetilli also uses coils and soapstone, which retains heat for
        48 hours, for the system that gravity-feeds heat through his
        house without requiring much work from the furnace. A thermostat
        for the secondary heating system is set higher than the one for
        the furnace.<br>
        <br>
        “What controls this whole thing is the thermostat,” Cuppetilli
        said, adding later, “The only thing I really use off the furnace
        is the blower. I figure I'm saving about 67 percent on my
        heating bill.”<br>
        <br>
        It sounds complicated, and it is. Cuppetilli concedes he has
        spent hours explaining his invention to industry insiders. Yet,
        he seems confident it works — and Barone and others say he has
        the statistics to show it.<br>
        <br>
        If he gets his invention marketed, Cuppetilli said the system
        could be installed without affecting a furnace's warranty.<br>
        <br>
        Cuppetilli has sought bids from 29 furnace companies, and he
        would get royalties. He said utility companies, which stand to
        lose revenue, “don't want to see this.”<br>
        <br>
        Even so, he said his invention could create thousands of jobs in
        an economy that sorely needs them. Moreover, he said he will
        dictate that all parts used for installation are made in
        America.<br>
        <br>
        “I want to keep the work here,” he said.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A heating
        and cooling system operates in a supplemental heating mode or a
        supplemental cooling mode. In supplemental heating mode, the
        system carries water from a hot water supply of the water heater
        to a heat exchanger within an air passage in the furnace to heat
        the building. In the supplemental cooling mode, the system
        carries cool water from a cool water storage tank to the heat
        exchanger within the furnace to assist in cooling the building.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0002] This invention relates to a heating system and cooling
        system. More particularly, this invention relates to a system
        for supplementing a main heating system and main cooling system.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] Conventional heating systems for homes generally include
        a water heater and a furnace. The furnace typically provides hot
        air to warm the interior temperature of the house while the
        water heater provides hot water for the household. An air
        conditioner provides cool air to the building. The energy
        requirements of the furnace are substantially greater than the
        energy requirements of the hot water heater. In addition, water
        temperatures are less affected by environmental changes than air
        within a house.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] An apparatus and method for supplementing a furnace to
        heat a building and an air conditioner to cool a building while
        decreasing overall utility costs is needed.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0005] A heating system operates in normal and supplemental
        modes to increase system efficiency and reduce overall cost.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] A heating system for use in heating a residential
        dwelling includes a furnace and a water heater. In supplemental
        mode the system carries water from the hot water supply from the
        water heater to a heat exchanger within an air passage for the
        furnace. A water return passage returns the water from the air
        passage back to the water heater. Air within the air passage
        passes through the heat exchanger and is heated from the water
        within. The water then returns to the water tank through a water
        return passage.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] A supplemental thermostat is connected to the system to
        control an air circulator for the furnace without requiring the
        furnace to be activated. In supplemental mode the air circulator
        operates at a reduced speed compared to the speed when in normal
        mode such that, the system is continuing to warm the air enough
        to maintain the temperature without cycling on and off. A main
        thermostat, for the furnace, would preferably be set at a lower
        desired temperature than the supplemental thermostat. Thus, the
        system will only operate in normal mode if supplemental mode is
        not sufficient to maintain the desired temperature.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] A cooling system for use in cooling a residential
        dwelling includes an air conditioner and a holding tank. In
        supplemental mode the system carries water from the cold water
        supply from the holding tank to a cooling coil. A water return
        passage returns the water from the cooling coil back to the
        holding tank. There is soapstone in the holding tank to aid in
        keep the water cool.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] These and other features of the present invention can be
        best understood from the following specification and drawings,
        the following of which is a brief description.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
          PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0012] A heating and cooling system 10 (or "HVAC system") is
        shown schematically in FIG. 1. The system 10 is preferably for
        use in heating a home or other residential dwelling. The system
        10 includes a furnace 12 and a water heater 14. The furnace 12
        and water heater 14 may operate on natural gas, electricity, oil
        or any available energy source. The furnace 12 has a thermostat
        16 to control furnace operation and a control line 18 to connect
        the thermostat 16 to the furnace 12. The thermostat 16 is
        mounted within the house remote from the furnace 12 in an easily
        accessible area to the user. The system 10 may also include an
        air conditioner coil 20 (condenser) attached to the furnace 12,
        so that the system can provide hot and cool air for the home. An
        air passage 22 extends from the furnace 12 to carry the heated
        or cooled air (airflow indicated with arrow A) through the home.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] An air circulator 24 incorporated in the furnace 12
        controls the airflow through the air passage 22 and includes a
        control 26 to control the volume of air that is circulated
        through the home. Typically the air circulator 24 includes a fan
        28. The speed of the fan 28 is set by the control 26 which
        receives input from the thermostat 16 to turn the fan 28 on or
        off or adjust a variable speed.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] The water heater 14 includes a cold water supply 30
        leading into a water tank 32 and a hot water supply 34 leading
        from the water tank 32. Water, indicated by arrow W, from the
        ground supply enters the water tank 32 through the cold water
        supply 30. The water is heated within the water tank 32 and
        exits through the hot water supply 34 to be distributed at
        desired locations throughout the house. The water heater 14 also
        includes a water tank drain valve 36. The water tank drain valve
        36 is normally used to drain water from the tank 32 during
        maintenance or repair. During typical operation of the water
        heater 14 the water tank drain valve 36 is closed to retain the
        water within the water tank 32.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] During normal system 10 operation the furnace 12 receives
        a control input from the thermostat 16 based upon the desired
        interior temperature of the home and the actual interior
        temperature of the home. When the difference in temperature has
        reached a predetermined level the system 10 is activated to
        either warm or cool the air. The air is distributed through the
        home through the air passage 22 until the thermostat 16 senses
        the actual interior temperature is the same as the desired
        interior temperature. Activating the furnace 12 requires power
        to heat the air and to activate the air circulator 24 to
        distribute the air. The fan 28 may have one operating speed or
        may be variable speed, and is either rotating or stationary.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] When difference between the actual home temperature and
        the desired home temperature is large enough to require heating
        the home, but not large enough to require the furnace 12, the
        system 10 operates in supplemental mode.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] A water supply passage 38 carries water from the water
        heater 14 to the air passage 22 for the furnace 12. The water
        supply passage 38 is connected to the hot water supply 34
        leading from the water tank 32 to the house. Thus, the water
        within the water supply passage 38 has been heated by the water
        heater 14. A water return passage 40 returns the water from the
        air passage 22 back to the water heater 14. The water return
        passage 40 preferably is connected to the water tank 32 at the
        water drain valve 36. The water supply passage may be connected
        to the water tank 32 in another manner that allows water to
        return to the water tank 32, but is preferably connected at a
        lower end of the water tank 32.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] The water passes through the water supply passage 38 to a
        heat exchanger 42 within the air passage 22. Air within the air
        passage 22 passes through the heat exchanger 42 and is heated
        from the water within the heat exchanger 42. The water then
        returns to the water tank 32 through the water return passage
        40. The heat exchanger 42 is preferably a water coil heat
        exchanger. Water coil heat exchangers are specifically designed
        for carrying water through the heater exchanger coils 44. The
        coils 44 are typically copper and aluminum, or entirely
        aluminum.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] A supplemental thermostat 46 is connected to the air
        circulator 24. A supplemental control line 48 also leads to the
        air circulator 24. The supplemental control line 48 is separate
        from the main control line 18. The supplemental thermostat 46
        and control line 48 allow the air circulator 24 to be controlled
        in supplemental mode without requiring the furnace 12 to be
        activated. The air circulator 24 is used to activate the fan 28
        and create air flow through the air passage 22 when in the
        supplemental mode. In supplemental mode the fan 28 will operate
        at a reduced speed compared to the fan speed when in normal
        mode. If the control 26 for the fan 28 does not provide variable
        speed capability, a rheostat or other power control can be added
        so that the speed of the fan 28 is reduced in supplemental mode.
        Optionally, in some situations, the fan 28 may not be necessary
        in supplemental mode, as the air may circulate sufficiently
        purely by convection.<br>
        <br>
        [0020] The supplemental thermostat 46 is set at a desired
        temperature. When the actual temperature drops below the desired
        temperature, as sensed by the supplemental thermostat 46, water
        is passed through the supply passage 38 to the heat exchanger
        42. The thermostat sends a signal to the air circulator 24 to
        begin fan 28 operation. The supplemental thermostat 46 is
        connected to an electric supply valve 50 and an electric return
        valve 52. The thermostat 46 can shut off water flow through the
        supply passage 38 and return passage 40 when the actual
        temperature is the same as the desired temperature. Preferably,
        the fan speed 28 is set at low revolutions per minute such that,
        in supplemental mode, the system 10 is continuing to warm the
        air enough to maintain the temperature without cycling the
        system on and off. The main thermostat 16 would preferably be
        set at a lower desired temperature than the supplemental
        thermostat 46. Thus, the system will only operate in normal mode
        if supplemental mode is not sufficient to maintain the desired
        temperature. The system 10 could operate in both normal mode and
        supplemental mode at the same time. In other words, the
        supplemental mode continues to operate when the normal mode is
        switched on.<br>
        <br>
        [0021] The hot water could circulate continuously through the
        heat exchanger 42 and the heat could circulate by convection
        through the house most of the time, with the furnace 12 switched
        on only when necessary.<br>
        <br>
        [0022] By maintaining a desired temperature with the system 10
        in supplemental mode, operation of the furnace 12 is reduced.
        The reduced operation of the furnace 12 saves on energy costs
        for the system 10.<br>
        <br>
        [0023] Manual supply valve 54 can be used to override the system
        10 and prevent water flow through the supply passage 38.
        Likewise, manual return valve 56 can be used to override the
        system 10 and prevent water flow through the return passage 40.
        The manual valves 54, 56 can be used to prevent water flow to
        the system 10 in warmer months.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] In another embodiment, a separate auxiliary cooling
        system 67, shown in FIG. 2, can be connected to the supply
        passage 38 and the return passage 40 of the heating system 10
        (without or without the supplementary heating system). Cold
        water is initially supplied by the cool water intake 66 through
        the fresh water inlet 59. When the air conditioner 20 turns on,
        the auxiliary cooling system 67 is activated. The pump 62 is
        connected to the main thermostat 16 (FIG. 1) such that when the
        air conditioner 20 is turned on, the pump 62 will begin to
        circulate water in the system 67 to the coil 42 above the air
        conditioner 20 (FIG. 1).<br>
        <br>
        [0025] The system includes two shut off valves 57, one each
        located on the outline pipe 56 and the return pipe 61, which can
        be used to shut down the system (e.g. in the winter, when the
        supplementary heating system is being used). These valves 57 can
        also be used to connect the auxiliary cooling system 67 with the
        supply passage 38 and the return passage 40 of the heating
        system 10. Temperature gages 60 are located on the outline pipe
        56 and the return pipe 61 to send water temperature information
        to the thermostat 16 (FIGS. 1 and 2). An air separator 63 is
        included on the return pipe 61 to increase efficiency and remove
        air from the system. A drain plug 65 on the holding tank 55 is
        connected to a water return passage 40, which drains the water
        in the system and the tank 55.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] During the initial startup of the system 67, the water is
        delivered through the cool water intake 66. After the initial
        activation of the system, the water will remain in the system,
        being pumped to the secondary coil 54 through the outline pipe
        56 and back to a holding tank 55 through the return pipe 61. The
        holding tank is preferably made of any non-corrosive material
        and would be well insulated. In one embodiment, the holding tank
        55 is 33.7 gallons and 18 inches long by 12 inches wide by 36
        inches tall.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] When the air conditioner 20 is turned off, the holding
        tank 55 stores the water to keep it at the cool temperature.
        Rools of soapstone 64 are placed in the water in the interior of
        the holding tank, preferably four rools with two pieces of
        soapstone to each rool. In one embodiment, the soapstone is 17
        inches long by 3.5 inches wide by 1.25 inches thick and rests on
        a 1.5 degree angle.<br>
        <br>
        [0028] After the initial startup, the thermostat 16 switches on
        the pump 62 to circulate the cold water in the tank 55 through
        the coil 42 whenever the air conditioner 20 is turned on. This
        cold coil 42 in addition to the air conditioner 20 cools the
        home more quickly, so that the air conditioner 20 does not have
        to run as long, thereby saving energy.<br>
        <br>
        [0029] In an alternate mode of operation, or additionally, the
        pump 62 could switch on whenever the thermostat 16 detects that
        the temperature in the home has risen above a first cooling
        threshold and switches the air conditioner 20 on whenever the
        thermostat 16 detects that the temperature in the home has risen
        above a second cooling threshold, higher than the first cooling
        threshold. When the water temperature measured by temperature
        gages 60 indicates that the water has risen above a threshold
        water temperature, then the water will not be able to provide
        sufficient cooling, and the air conditioner 20 is switched on.<br>
        <br>
        [0030] The thermostat 16 may include a processor with software
        or a simple circuit for controlling the operation of the various
        pumps, valves, furnace, air conditioner, etc. as described
        above. Because the air condition 20 will run less, it may be
        necessary to take other steps to reduce the humidity in the
        home, such as adding air boosters.<br>
        <br>
        [0031] Although a preferred embodiment of this invention has
        been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would
        recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope
        of this invention. For that reason, the following claims should
        be studied to determine the true scope and content of this
        invention.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A heating
        system operates in supplemental mode to carry water from a hot
        water supply of the water heater to a heat exchanger within an
        air passage in the furnace. A water return passage returns the
        water from the air passage back to the water heater. Air within
        the air passage passes through the heat exchanger and is heated
        from the water within. The water then returns to the water tank
        through a water return passage. A supplemental thermostat is
        connected to the system to control an air circulator for the
        furnace without requiring the furnace to be activated. The
        furnace will turn on and heat the air only if supplemental mode
        is not sufficient to maintain the desired temperature.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0001] This invention relates to a heating system. More
        particularly, this invention relates to a system for
        supplementing a main heating system.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] Conventional heating systems for homes generally include
        a water heater and a furnace. The furnace typically provides hot
        air to warm the interior temperature of the house while the
        water heater provides hot water for the household. The energy
        requirements of the furnace are substantially greater than the
        energy requirements of the hot water heater. In addition, water
        temperatures are less affected by environmental changes than air
        within a house.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] An apparatus and method for supplementing a furnace to
        heat a building while decreasing overall utility costs is
        needed.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0004] A heating system operates in normal and supplemental
        modes to increase system efficiency and reduce overall cost.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] A heating system for use in heating a residential
        dwelling includes a furnace and a water heater. In supplemental
        mode the system carries water from the hot water supply from the
        water heater to a heat exchanger within an air passage for the
        furnace. A water return passage returns the water from the air
        passage back to the water heater. Air within the air passage
        passes through the heat exchanger and is heated from the water
        within. The water then returns to the water tank through a water
        return passage.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] A supplemental thermostat is connected to the system to
        control an air circulator for the furnace without requiring the
        furnace to be activated. In supplemental mode the air circulator
        operates at a reduced speed compared to the speed when in normal
        mode such that, the system is continuing to warm the air enough
        to maintain the temperature without cycling on and off. A main
        thermostat, for the furnace, would preferably be set at a lower
        desired temperature than the supplemental thermostat. Thus, the
        system will only operate in normal mode if supplemental mode is
        not sufficient to maintain the desired temperature.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] These and other features of the present invention can be
        best understood from the following specification and drawings,
        the following of which is a brief description.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
          PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0009] A heating and cooling system 10 (or "HVAC system") is
        shown schematically in FIG. 1. The system 10 is preferably for
        use in heating a home or other residential dwelling. The system
        10 includes a furnace 12 and a water heater 14. The furnace 12
        and water heater 14 may operate on natural gas, electricity, oil
        or any available energy source. The furnace 12 has a thermostat
        16 to control furnace operation and a control line 18 to connect
        the thermostat 16 to the furnace 12. The thermostat 16 is
        mounted within the house remote from the furnace 12 in an easily
        accessible area to the user. The system 10 may also include an
        air conditioner 20 attached to the furnace 12, so that the
        system can provide hot and cool air for the home. An air passage
        22 extends from the furnace 12 to carry the heated or cooled air
        (airflow indicated with arrow A) through the home.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] An air circulator 24 incorporated in the furnace 12
        controls the airflow through the air passage 22 and includes a
        control 26 to control the volume of air that is circulated
        through the home. Typically the air circulator 24 includes a fan
        28. The speed of the fan 28 is set by the control 26 which
        receives input from the thermostat 16 to turn the fan 28 on or
        off or adjust a variable speed.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] The water heater 14 includes a cold water supply 30
        leading into a water tank 32 and a hot water supply 34 leading
        from the water tank 32. Water, indicated by arrow W, from the
        ground supply enters the water tank 32 through the cold water
        supply 30. The water is heated within the water tank 32 and
        exits through the hot water supply 34 to be distributed at
        desired locations throughout the house. The water heater 14 also
        includes a water tank drain valve 36. The water tank drain valve
        36 is normally used to drain water from the tank 32 during
        maintenance or repair. During typical operation of the water
        heater 14 the water tank drain valve 36 is closed to retain the
        water within the water tank 32.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] During normal system 10 operation the furnace 12 receives
        a control input from the thermostat 16 based upon the desired
        interior temperature of the home and the actual interior
        temperature of the home. When the difference in temperature has
        reached a predetermined level the system 10 is activated to
        either warm or cool the air. The air is distributed through the
        home through the air passage 22 until the thermostat 16 senses
        the actual interior temperature is the same as the desired
        interior temperature. Activating the furnace 12 requires power
        to heat the air and to activate the air circulator 24 to
        distribute the air. The fan 28 may have one operating speed or
        may be variable speed, and is either rotating or stationary.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] When difference between the actual home temperature and
        the desired home temperature is large enough to require heating
        the home, but not large enough to require the furnace 12, the
        system 10 operates in supplemental mode.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] A water supply passage 38 carries water from the water
        heater 14 to the air passage 22 for the furnace 12. The water
        supply passage 38 is connected to the hot water supply 34
        leading from the water tank 32 to the house. Thus, the water
        within the water supply passage 38 has been heated by the water
        heater 14. A water return passage 40 returns the water from the
        air passage 22 back to the water heater 14. The water return
        passage 40 preferably is connected to the water tank 32 at the
        water drain valve 36. The water supply passage may be connected
        to the water tank 32 in another manner that allows water to
        return to the water tank 32, but is preferably connected at a
        lower end of the water tank 32.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] The water passes through the water supply passage 38 to a
        heat exchanger 42 within the air passage 22. Air within the air
        passage 22 passes through the heat exchanger 42 and is heated
        from the water within the heat exchanger 42. The water then
        returns to the water tank 32 through the water return passage
        40. The heat exchanger 42 is preferably a water coil heat
        exchanger. Water coil heat exchangers are specifically designed
        for carrying water through the heater exchanger coils 44. The
        coils 44 are typically copper and aluminum, or entirely
        aluminum.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] A supplemental thermostat 46 is connected to the air
        circulator 24. A supplemental control line 48 also leads to the
        air circulator 24. The supplemental control line 48 is separate
        from the main control line 18. The supplemental thermostat 46
        and control line 48 allow the air circulator 24 to be controlled
        in supplemental mode without requiring the furnace 12 to be
        activated. The air circulator 24 is used to activate the fan 28
        and create air flow through the air passage 22 when in the
        supplemental mode. In supplemental mode the fan 28 will operate
        at a reduced speed compared to the fan speed when in normal
        mode. If the control 26 for the fan 28 does not provide variable
        speed capability, a rheostat or other power control can be added
        so that the speed of the fan 28 is reduced in supplemental mode.
        Optionally, in some situations, the fan 28 may not be necessary
        in supplemental mode, as the air may circulate sufficiently
        purely by convection.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] The supplemental thermostat 46 is set at a desired
        temperature. When the actual temperature drops below the desired
        temperature, as sensed by the supplemental thermostat 46, water
        is passed through the supply passage 38 to the heat exchanger
        42. The thermostat sends a signal to the air circulator 24 to
        begin fan 28 operation. The supplemental thermostat 46 is
        connected to an electric supply valve 50 and an electric return
        valve 52. The thermostat 46 can shut off water flow through the
        supply passage 38 and return passage 40 when the actual
        temperature is the same as the desired temperature. Preferably,
        the fan speed 28 is set at low revolutions per minute such that,
        in supplemental mode, the system 10 is continuing to warm the
        air enough to maintain the temperature without cycling the
        system on and off. The main thermostat 16 would preferably be
        set at a lower desired temperature than the supplemental
        thermostat 46. Thus, the system will only operate in normal mode
        if supplemental mode is not sufficient to maintain the desired
        temperature. The system 10 could operate in both normal mode and
        supplemental mode at the same time. In other words, the
        supplemental mode continues to operate when the normal mode is
        switched on.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] By maintaining a desired temperature with the system 10
        in supplemental mode, operation of the furnace 12 is reduced.
        The reduced operation of the furnace 12 saves on energy costs
        for the system 10.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] Manual supply valve 54 can be used to override the system
        10 and prevent water flow through the supply passage 38.
        Likewise, manual return valve 56 can be used to override the
        system 10 and prevent water flow through the return passage 40.
        The manual valves 54, 56 can be used to prevent water flow to
        the system 10 in warmer months.<br>
        <br>
        [0020] Although a preferred embodiment of this invention has
        been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would
        recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope
        of this invention. For that reason, the following claims should
        be studied to determine the true scope and content of this
        invention.<br>
