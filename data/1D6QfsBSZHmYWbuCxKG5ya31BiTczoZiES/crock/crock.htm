        <br>
        Lee Crock died in March 2010.<br>
        <br>
        I received a fascinating phone call from Mr. Lee Crock this
        afternoon and decided to post what we talked about, which I had
        jotted down during the call.<br>
        <br>
        What is most amazing is that Lee has an explanation about what
        he is doing and how he believes it to work. He has incorporated
        this into a machine.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says although he is a '1924 model' he expects to be around a
        lot longer, doing what good he can with his discovery from three
        years ago.<br>
        <br>
        His healing system stems from Reiki massage therapy which
        partially relies on the production of heat in the hands to heal
        the body.<br>
        <br>
        The treatment takes from 3-5 days and is given at his
        Therapeutic Academy in Caldwell, Ohio. They have 10 beds and,
        give treatments around the clock and for those too ill to care
        for themselves, they request that you bring a friend or helper.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says a counter clockwise (CCW) motion is positive,
        discharges the cellular electrical energy and relieves pain
        within about 14 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Whereas, clockwise (CW) is negative and refills the cells with
        energy.<br>
        <br>
        The principle Lee describes as like emptying a bucket, filling
        it back up and emptying it again, over and over with the idea
        being to flush out any toxins.<br>
        <br>
        He says an easy demonstration is to hold your hands flat against
        or close to the ailing organ or body of a subject, and move the
        palms of your hands in a CCW motion until you begin to feel a
        heating effect. Once it achieves the maximum heat, you lay your
        hands on the area being treated, and let them cool down.<br>
        <br>
        A CW motion will recharge the cellular energy and after about 30
        hours of this CCW, then CW treatment, repeated over this 30 hour
        period, the subject improves.<br>
        <br>
        By using a relay of 4 or more people, doing this without the
        machine, you can continually flush and recharge the damaged
        cells continually over 24 hours for 3-5 days or as needed.<br>
        <br>
        The machine Lee has developed apparently produces this same
        alternate CCW and CW motion without the need of a human operator
        to produce the same flushing and recharging effect.<br>
        <br>
        One of the side effects is excess urination which Lee says is
        due to the body discharging the toxins that are being released
        as the tissues are being flushed with this very simple method.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says he and his volunteers have worked with 10,000 people
        over a 3 year period with excellent success rates, with these
        people coming from 10 foreign countries and all 50 states.<br>
        <br>
        He has been called into court, changed his Therapeutic Clinic to
        Therapeutic Academy and never claims to be able to heal or cure
        anything or anyone. He simply assists the body to heal itself by
        flushing out the toxins that cause the problems.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says his electronic device has one wire leading from it
        which is connected to a screen that is usually sealed in a
        pillow. The pillow can then simply be laid on the suspect organ
        and the bigger the screen, the more area is affected.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says the CCW motion is like building a coil and since coils
        attract electricity, this energy coil will pull the electricity
        out of the cells which will carry the toxins with them.<br>
        <br>
        He says the proof of it is the production of heat in the palms
        of the hand which can be felt with or without the machine and a
        less subjective proof is that the subject urinates often when
        being subjected to this bio-heating and cooling effect.<br>
        <br>
        Sounds to me like a version of iontophoresis, where charged ions
        can be used to introduce or remove elements or chemicals to or
        from the cells. Once these cellular contaminants are in the
        blood stream, they are detected as invaders or excesses and
        removed as waste, most easily via urination.<br>
        <br>
        And yes, he has treated himself with the machine for months
        where he used a 4 foot by 8 foot wire mesh screen placed between
        the mattress and box spring of his bed, with his machine feeding
        this mesh screen so he would be treated while he sleeps.<br>
        <br>
        He reports during this process, he would have to go to the
        bathroom 4-5 times a night and had to discontinue it because it
        was causing him to dehydrate since his body was flushing out all
        toxins. He also says after discontinuing this nightly treatment,
        he still has to go to the bathroom often to urinate but the
        effect is going away over time.<br>
        <br>
        I take this comment as a great warning to not OVERUSE this
        technique, use it when you need it. Many would never have
        mentioned this for fear it might scare people away from the
        entire claim, and to my view that is a sign of Lee Crock's
        sincerity and integrity. Also that he provides a background fot
        the basic effect, that he charges NOTHING for his treatments and
        is just there to help whoever he can. Look around and see how
        rare this is these days.<br>
        <br>
        Lee has an 'Aura Therapy' book that he does not sell, but gives
        away freely. He is generous to a fault and charges nothing for
        people to come to his academy to stay in one of the 10 beds for
        as long as necessary to get them better. He says to give him a
        call so he can find you an open slot in their schedule.<br>
        <br>
        I asked if he was setup as a non-profit and he said yes, so they
        are in a position to accept donations, bequests, etc.. His call
        impressed me that Lee didn't seem the least concerned with
        selling anything but his main concern is helping as many people
        as he can while he is here, another excellent sign of character.<br>
        <br>
        He reports amazing results with Altzheimers' because his system
        flushes aluminum from the tissue as well as arthritis and
        rheumatism which resolves as the excess calcium crystals are
        flushed. He says you can get a sample of the urine of the
        arthritic person and you will see tiny brown calcium crystals in
        the sample.<br>
        <br>
        The treatment involves one of the screen embedded pillows which
        is laid over the person with the machine attached.<br>
        <br>
        I asked him about muscular dystrophy and other such illnesses,
        he says they are nerve disorders and it depends on the degree of
        decay though it couldn't hurt. Also, since Lee has a great sense
        of humor I asked him if it helped hair growth or would act like
        electronic Viagra.<br>
        <br>
        He said no, he didn't think it would help restore hair and he
        didn't know what Viagra was, I explained it and he said well,
        most of that is in the mind anyway, so he didn't think it would
        help..(g)..<br>
        <br>
        One of the other discoveries is that you can have several people
        touch the pillow while the machine is on and the effect is
        greatly increased, as if the machine, producing its alternating
        CCW and CW fields milks the healing energy from the people
        participating, which greatly intensifies the healing effect.<br>
        <br>
        This is very similar to the claims of the Eeman screens where
        two wire mesh screens are laid next to each other and offset on
        the floor to be connected with one wire at the top and one wire
        at the bottom. A healthy person lays on one mesh screen and a
        sick person lays on the other mesh screen opposite each other,
        so that the feet are on the end of each screen. The idea is that
        a bio electric current will flow between the two and a form of
        empathic trans-sympathetic healing is induced.<br>
        <br>
        Lee has a lot of great stories, one of them had to do with a
        woman who had lung cancer and was given up to death. In the
        hospital she was in an oxygen tent to assist her breathing.
        Since she was known to be a very religious woman, they thought
        about ways to smuggle the machine into the hospital to help her.<br>
        <br>
        So they put the device in a suitcase and wrote 'anointing oils'
        on it, then took the pillow and the suitcase in. The pillow was
        placed on the womans chest and the single wire connected to the
        machine. The helpers all placed their hands on the pillow and
        put on a show when the nurse or doctors came in. They went back
        every day and treated the woman for 2 hours at a time, within 3
        days, she was taken off the oxygen tent, within 5 days released
        to go home. The cancer had 'disappeared' and was written off as
        a miracle due to spontaneous healing.<br>
        <br>
        He has another great story about a priest who had been
        unknowingly using this healing technique by placing his right
        hand on the left shoulder of the faithful until he felt a heat,
        usually after about 6 minutes. He attributed this heat
        production to his faith and considered himself one of a gifted
        few.<br>
        <br>
        The priest told him there were probably a total of 13 people in
        the world with this 'gift'. Lee told him that 6 of these people
        were with them today at the academy and if he'd give him a
        couple of hours, he'd call up the other 7. He then did a
        demonstration and showed the priest what was really happening
        and how to speed it up with the CCW motions so he could do more
        people instead of just waiting for the flow to happen.<br>
        <br>
        Lee Crock is a phenomenon waiting to happen.<br>

        Went through the patent application, very interesting. He is
        putting the subject into a capacitive circuit where the subject
        takes on the role of the dielectric. Basically, the subject lies
        on a conductive plate or mat connected to one polarity of a DC
        current source and has the other polarity connected the the
        moveable wire screen that he puts inside a pillow. On 7 and 8,
        the patent says;<br>
        <br>
        "The electrical system of one's body can be modified by
        stimulating the healing process using the apparatus as shown in
        figures 1A and 1B. The present invention is comprised of two low
        voltage direct current sources, having opposite polarities, the
        current direction being controlled by a polarity switch. A
        conductive wire mesh electrode is placed within a distance of 2
        to 12 inches above the area to be treated.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus performs by alternately charging and discharging
        the cells over periods of time from 1 to 12 hours. The static
        charge is removed by an electric discharge that resulted from
        the accumulation of electric charge on an insulated body. The
        accumulated charge manifests itself in ones aura. The healing of
        a malfunctioning area can be stimulated by a plurality of
        polarity reversals in a therapeutic application.<br>
        <br>
        In a typical therapeutic session, the patient lies upon the
        conductive treatment surface (plates 60 and 65). The conductive
        mesh electrode (50) is placed over the area to be treated, at a
        distance preferably ranging from 2 to 12 inches. The polarity
        switch 40 is maintained in the uppermost position for an elapsed
        period of approximately 15 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        During this interval the wire mesh 50 is connected to a negative
        direct current source, having low potential. At the end of 15
        minutes, the switch 40 is toggled to its lower position,
        connecting a positive direct current source, having a low
        potential to the wire mesh electrode 60, again for a period of
        about 15 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        The reversal sequence is repeated several times until the
        therapeutic session is completed. The therapy, using the
        apparatus of the present invention, finds usefulness in soft
        tissue therapy; however, it does not prove effective in the
        treatment of skeletal formations. In the preferred embodiment,
        the voltage sources 20 and 30 are 10 'D' cell batteries, all
        connected in parallel.<br>
        <br>
        The voltage can range from the preferred 1.5VDC to about 3/4 of
        a volt (.75). Treatment times can range from as little as one
        and 1/4 hour to as much as 12 hours of 6 hours per session.<br>
        <br>
        Note : As of April 2000, Lee kindly sent a unit to be tested and
        it was noted on inspection of the unit that the batteries are
        NOT connected as 10 in parallel, but are 5 sets of TWO 'D' cell
        batteries connected in series to give 3 volts per pair, and all
        of these are hooked in parallel. The following diagram has been
        changed to reflect this reality. Additionally, a single hook
        projects from the box to which one or more wirescreens are
        connected. This hook provides either negative or positive
        polarity from the 15 minute timer relay.<br>

        So we have a lipid oil film on the surface of cells which acts
        as a dielectric to hold charge on and in cells. He does refer to
        an 'static' charge on cells which are discharged when the
        polarity alters the dielectric of the body to allow the
        breakdown. Cells are like tuned capacitors and inductors (with
        DNA as the coil) as per Lakhovsky and others who pioneered
        'electronic medicine'.<br>
        <br>
        Charged Ions can carry elements into and out of the cells
        depending on polarity of the cell and the ambient medium. I
        believe somewhere I have read that cancer cells are electro
        positive with respect to surrounding tissue.<br>
        <br>
        A capacitor consists of two conductive surfaces separated by a
        dielectric that has high resistance. The two mesh screens serve
        as the capacitor plates, the body of the subject serves as the
        dielectric. A positive current flowing from one electrode
        through the body into the other electrode should cause the ions
        in the cells to migrate and carry out any excess of elements or
        toxins. By changing the polarity, so that a negative current now
        flows, the polarity of the tissues should reverse and ions would
        be absorbed into the cells.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says this system works by emptying and refilling the
        tissues, like a bucket full of mud, that is filled and emptied
        over and over with clean water, until all the mud is gone and
        the bucket is clean. The ions would carry the toxins out of the
        cells where they would be caught up in the blood stream,
        intercepted by phages and probably stored in the lymph system to
        be excreted during urination or other waste removal.<br>
        <br>
        When the polarity of the body is reversed, the cells would now
        accept ions to add electrical energy, hopefully carrying in
        nutrients and other material beneficial to the body. By
        repeating this process, over and over, IF it works as he says
        and this basic description/analogy is correct, then I think he
        is onto something very basic that appears to be fundamental to
        health in general. I'd think that drinking pure water would help
        in purging the system as he did comment on dehydration as a
        possibility if you overuse it.<br>

        In my travels and researches over the years, I have tried
        several electronic methods claimed to help the body to heal
        itself. None have given results that were measurable. Of course,
        no sane person will say outright that their method 'cures'
        anyone for fear of the wrath of the FDA, AMA or local medicos
        whose regular income depends on you remaining sick.<br>
        <br>
        Wouldn't it be great to adapt the ancient Chinese method where
        you pay the physician as long as you are healthy, when you get
        sick, he pays you!<br>
        <br>
        Don't read this as a slam against all medical practitioners,
        there are many fine doctors, nurses and medical technicians who
        do a great job in their fields, but so many aren't remotely open
        to the idea that any kind of alternative therapy beyond what
        they learned in school could possibly help anyone.<br>
        <br>
        The machine I want to tell you about first came to my attention
        through several emails sent to KeelyNet asking if there was any
        information about a fellow in Caldwell, Ohio named Lee Crock who
        was using something called 'Aura Therapy' to get amazing results
        with sick or ailing people with varied conditions, some given up
        on as beyond hope.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the conditions this machine has been used to help
        resolve include all types of cancer, Altzheimers, rheumatism,
        arthritis, viruses, kidney, heart and lung failure, hearing
        loss, various physical pains, headache, epilepsy, Hodgkins
        disease, shortness of breath and other conditions as reported in
        testimonials seized and on file at the Noble County Courthouse
        in Caldwell, Ohio.<br>
        <br>
        I had never heard of the guy and didn't actively began looking
        into his work until a couple of months later. I ended up calling
        Mr. Crock on several occasions and found him to be charming,
        personable and very informative about his method.<br>
        <br>
        To put it mildly, Lee is a ball of fire and enthusiasm. He
        repeatedly told me he wanted to help as many people as possible
        with his discovery while he could.<br>
        <br>
        After speaking with him several times on the phone and after he
        sent me a copy of his patent, I wrote up a file on KeelyNet
        about the Crock machine.<br>
        <br>
        In 2001, we had the first KeelyNet conference in Dallas which
        gave me the opportunity to fly Mr. and Mrs. Crock to Dallas to
        give a presentation and demonstrate his machines. We just happen
        to have a videotape of Lee should you be interested in obtaining
        a copy.<br>
        <br>
        The original patent is slightly different from the current
        machines being sold. As you can see in the diagram, it shows two
        screens with the body sandwiched between them.<br>
        <br>
        It has now been found unnecessary to use two screens since the
        body serves as a 'floating ground' for whichever polarity is in
        effect during a given 15 minute interval.<br>
        <br>
        Meaning one screen has either positive OR negative applied to it
        and the body acts as the ground for whichever is in effect at
        the moment.<br>
        <br>
        The one wirescreen is all that is necessary to couple with the
        body field and serve to complete the 'circuit.'<br>
        <br>
        One schooled in formal electronics would think this can't
        possibly work or do anything useful unless it has a current
        path. How can a single wirescreen that doesn't even have to make
        contact with the body POSSIBLY do anything to help heal the
        body?<br>
        <br>
        How can there be a circuit path between this screen and the
        body? Lee originally thought it was the aura and has taken
        photographs with a very expensive aura camera which shows the
        aura changing brightness and colors after exposure to his
        machine. That is why he called it 'Aura Therapy', thinking the
        screen somehow couples with the aura of the body to add energy.<br>
        <br>
        It turns out there is an interesting effect called
        electro-poration, where the cells can be made to expand or
        contract depending on the polarity of current applied to them.
        That is what I think is going on in a weak fashion with Lee's
        machine, possibly occurring as part of a coupling to the aura,
        or what the Russians call the 'Bio-Plasmic field'.<br>
        <br>
        New information has been released recently on work done by the
        husband and wife team of D. James and Dorothy Morre', who have
        worked on biological clocks since the 1960's and recently found
        a 12 minute expansion and a 12 minute rest cycle associated with
        proteins and cells. This is remarkably close to the 15 minutes
        Lee found by empirical observation as the optimum time between
        switching polarities for his machine.<br>
        <br>
        Before the Conference, Lee kindly sent me one of his very early
        units as pictured here. You will note the corroded battery plate
        grids arranged for 3vdc output, use of an off-the-shelf AC timer
        and a single wire output for the pad. There is also a plus and
        minus port to measure battery power.<br>
        <br>
        Lee brought about 6 of the new units (shown later in this
        article) to the KeelyNet conference which he let people examine
        and use.<br>
        <br>
        These six devices also used the single wire pads which have
        proven superior to the dual pads as in the original patent.<br>
        <br>
        The machine itself is remarkably simple, a combination of 10 'D'
        cell flashlight batteries connected to produce 3 volts DC.<br>
        <br>
        A switching circuit set for 15 minute intervals alternates the
        polarity (negative or positive) sent to a wirescreen made of
        aluminum and available at any hardware store.<br>
        <br>
        This wirescreen was held on or near the part of the body to be
        'treated' though it appears to produce effects as long as it is
        held within about 6 inches of the body, thereby reinforcing the
        idea there might be some unknown aura coupling effect.<br>
        <br>
        As an update since this article was written, an associate
        suggested using aluminized plastic Mylar film as a flexible pad
        substitute for the stiffer wirescreen. This is the material the
        metallic looking ballons are made of. You can buy it as an
        'emergency' blanket for about $2-$3US at any camping or hiking
        store or in the camping section of WalMart. You can easily cut
        it to any size you want and it is perfectly conductive.<br>
        <br>
        However, Tom Berryhill, who makes the Energy Cleaner machines
        for Lee Crock, reports they work fine as long as you don't flex
        them too much, which will damage conductivity. But you could cut
        them into pieces the size you want and simply replace when they
        begin to crack or lose conductivity over the larger part of the
        sheet.<br>
        <br>
        I would like to bring in some other correlations which might
        further help to understand how this very simple machine could
        actually be assisting the body to heal itself.<br>
        <br>
        It is my opinion that the aura of the body produces lines of
        force which actually 'write' the pattern of the aura into the
        physical matrix of the body. The aura, I believe, changes very
        slowly and is amenable to 'sustained' thought, meaning you can
        reprogram your aura with concentration and repetition.<br>
        <br>
        According to Dr. Harold S. Burr of Yale University, all protein
        in the body is replaced approximately every 159 days (6 months),
        so why then do we not have a new body each 6 months?<br>
        <br>
        Why do scars and aging appear in a body that is new? Because the
        aura IS the energy pattern which is written into the physical
        body and it holds the pattern of the scars as well as tallies up
        all the stresses we have encountered over our past, including
        the prior 6 months, all written into the flesh of our body.<br>
        <br>
        One interesting claim that correlates is that of David Hudson
        who states that monoatomic gold is superconducting and when
        ingested will add energy to the body, increase psychic abilities
        and promote healing among other things.<br>
        <br>
        David was with our group in Dallas for several days giving us
        the opportunity to spend a lot of time with him. I must say, the
        man is brilliant, with a mind able to span vast bodies of
        information and correlate relevant parts.<br>
        <br>
        He kindly provided me with copies of two lab reports which
        showed that new, growing tissue was naturally superconducting, a
        condition he believes ingestion of monoatomic elements might
        induce artificially and a technique he suspects the Patriarchs
        and religious figures knew and used in the past to develop their
        'powers.'<br>
        <br>
        It was from David that I first heard the aura being described as
        a resultant of superconductivity. A term I like to use in
        describing the aura is based on Davids' ideas as 'a dynamic
        attenuating Meissner field.'<br>
        <br>
        Dynamic because it is living and in slow motion giving the body
        time enough to 'write' the aura pattern into the reality of
        flesh.<br>
        <br>
        Attenuating because it weakens with age and time, eventually
        becoming so weak that the transcription (copying) of the aura
        pattern to the body is so weak as to not be able to sustain the
        energy connection, thus resulting in death.<br>
        <br>
        Meissner 'field' because the Meissner effect is experienced with
        superconductors as a repulsion of magnetic lines of force, no
        matter the polarity of the magnetic pole.<br>
        <br>
        This effect is called 'diamagnetism' when both poles are
        simultaneously repelled. Scientists in Finland have succeeded in
        levitating living frogs, fruits and other 'non-magnetic' objects
        in a high density magnetic field, based on this diamagnetic
        repulsion effect.<br>
        <br>
        Lee Crocks' Energy cleaner machine requires a 'steady state' DC
        field from the 10 batteries at low voltage (3 volts). Although
        there is no current flow that I know of or which has been
        measured between the wirescreen and the body or even the aura of
        a body, I think it provides an ambient pool of force from which
        the aura can extract energy.<br>
        <br>
        I base this on natural law where nature always seeks
        equilibrium, so by immersing a low potential object into a high
        potential field, the low potential will necessarily be pulled up
        trying to come into equilibrium with the high potential field.
        Thus a weak aura or body energy field will be pulled up by
        absorbing energy from the wirescreen via a coupling to the aura.<br>
        <br>
        David Hudsons' idea of ingesting the superconducting monoatomic
        elements would likewise increase the field strength of the aura,
        allowing for more perfect transcription to the physical,
        promoting healing and possibly inducing paranormal abilities.<br>
        <br>
        A similar background energy effect is that of Dr. Gianni Dotto
        who designed and built the famous healing machine known as the
        'Dotto Ring' which produced an intense magnetic field using
        30,000 amps at almost no voltage, which makes it 'almost
        superconducting', ergo, current without voltage in a supercold
        material has no resistance.<br>
        <br>
        Reports were that Dottos' machines would levitate off the floor
        when in operation due to the intense magnetic field they
        produced.<br>
        <br>
        This effect resulted from repulsion against the magnetic field
        lines of the earth.<br>
        <br>
        This claim causes many to sneer and say it is impossible because
        the field lines of the earth's magnetic field aren't that
        strong.<br>
        <br>
        However, about 3-4 years ago I received a couple of telephone
        calls from a young man in Atlanta, Georgia asking if I knew of a
        compact power supply that ran on gas or some other replaceable
        fuel.<br>
        <br>
        Well yes, there are many power supplies that could fit that
        requirement, depending on how much power was required to be
        generated. He then proceeds to say he had built a three foot
        spherical model of the Wachspress levitating monopole magnet,
        connected with a power cable and which he flew around the room.<br>
        <br>
        He wanted to expand this to a 6 foot model which would allow a
        pilot and needed a self-contained onboard power source. I was
        impressed by the claim, he swore it was true but that he could
        only fly it for about 20 minutes or so before the coils became
        too hot due to the very high current necessary to drive them, so
        he risked shorting them out.<br>
        <br>
        This young man was very paranoid and never contacted me again
        after the two phone calls, so I didn't have a name or any way to
        contact him. Granted it could have been a hoax but he sounded
        sincere and rather harried, like he was afraid of something.<br>
        <br>
        His machine was based on a magnetic 'monopole' which is
        described in the 1989 patent by Herb Wachpress describing a toy
        based on a unique geometry that produced just such a 'monopole'.<br>
        <br>
        Basically, it consisted of 6 electromagnets all pointing with
        the same polarity towards a center so as to form a sphere.<br>
        <br>
        Though with sufficiently strong small magnets, you should be
        able to make a purely magnet 'powered' monopolar sphere.<br>
        <br>
        When measured around the surface of the sphere, it would appear
        as a monopole since only one polarity was facing outwards.<br>
        <br>
        Using this, Wachspress made a table with electromagnets
        appropriately positioned and connected to a joystick, so that
        the magnetic monopolar sphere could be 'flown' in the air above
        the electromagnetic table.<br>
        <br>
        This has no real bearing on the Crock machine or how it works, I
        just thought it might be interesting in light of the claims that
        the Dotto Ring machines levitated off the floor when in
        operation to produce the 30,000 amps and thus a very intense
        magnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        It would be great to hear from anyone working along these lines,
        though I don't think I would want to ride in a flying machine
        with such a strong magnetic field density.<br>
        <br>
        Another interesting correlation to the Crock machine is EEMAN
        relaxation screens, sometimes called biocircuits or Eeman
        screens. These were discovered by Leon Ernest Eeman in the early
        1920s. After serious injuries in a plane crash, Eeman was deemed
        100 percent disabled.<br>
        <br>
        While hospitalized he recalled Jesus' admonition "Heal the sick
        by the laying on of hands." Eeman reasoned that this healing
        energy was the subtle energy of the life force itself.<br>
        <br>
        Within two years after his release from the hospital he
        developed techniques using these screens that "restored him to
        better health than he had ever known."<br>
        <br>
        These screens are passive devices that facilitate the flow of
        subtle bodily energy. A scientific, double blind study, that
        measured muscle tension and skin conductance as well as
        monitored EEG, found these screens to be superior for producing
        relaxation.<br>
        <br>
        After all this preliminary material, now is a good time to
        repeat what Lee told me on the telephone in our numerous
        conversations and what he said at the KeelyNet Conference. By
        the way, we do have a videotape of Lee speaking at the
        conference if you are interested. Order Lee Crock Video.<br>
        <br>
        Lee said he was fascinated by the 'laying on of hands' as
        reported to be used by Jesus, his disciples and other healers.
        His healing system stems from Reiki massage therapy which
        partially relies on the production of heat in the hands to heal
        the body.<br>
        <br>
        The treatment takes from 3-5 days and is given at his
        Therapeutic Academy (now called EDK University due to legal
        reasons) in Caldwell, Ohio. They had 10 beds (at the time of the
        conference Lee reports 30 beds) and give treatments around the
        clock. For those too ill to care for themselves, they request
        that you bring a friend or helper.<br>
        <br>
        If you cannot acquire a machine, by building or buying, it might
        be worth a brief 'vacation' to Caldwell to stay for a week. Meet
        Lee and his people, experience the machines, relax and take a
        break from your normal routine. If nothing else, you will get a
        vacation though it might help in other ways. Contact information
        for Lee and his University are included below.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says a counter clockwise (CCW) motion is positive,
        discharges the cellular electrical energy and relieves pain
        within about 14 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        As opposed to clockwise (CW) motion which is negative and
        refills the cells with energy.<br>
        <br>
        The principle Lee describes as like emptying a bucket, filling
        it back up and emptying it again, over and over with the idea
        being to flush out any toxins.<br>
        <br>
        He says an easy demonstration is to hold your hands flat against
        or close to the ailing organ or body of a subject, and move the
        palms of your hands in a CCW motion until you begin to feel a
        heating effect.<br>
        <br>
        Once it achieves the maximum heat, you lay your hands on the
        area being treated, and let them cool down.<br>
        <br>
        A CW motion will recharge the cellular energy and after about 30
        hours of this CCW, then CW treatment, repeated over this 30 hour
        period in 15 minute intervals, the subject improves.<br>
        <br>
        By using a relay of 4 or more people, doing this without the
        machine, you can continually flush and recharge the damaged
        cells continually over 24 hours for 3-5 days or as needed.<br>
        <br>
        The machine Lee has developed apparently produces this same
        alternate CCW and CW motion without the need of a human operator
        to produce the same flushing and recharging effect.<br>
        <br>
        One of the side effects is excess urination in people with very
        serious health issues, which Lee says is due to the body
        discharging the toxins that are being released as the tissues
        are being flushed out using this very simple method.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says he and his volunteers have worked with over 10,000
        people over a 3 year period with excellent success rates, with
        these people coming from 10 foreign countries and all 50 states.<br>
        <br>
        He has been summoned into court, forced to change the name of
        his Therapeutic Clinic to Therapeutic Academy (now changed again
        to EDK University) and never claims outright to be able to heal
        or cure anything or anyone. His method simply assists the body
        to heal itself by flushing out the toxins that cause the
        problems.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says his electronic device has one wire leading from it
        which is connected to a screen that is usually sealed in a
        pillow. The pillow can then simply be laid on the suspect organ
        and the bigger the screen, the more area is affected.<br>
        <br>
        Lee says the CCW motion is like building a coil and since coils
        attract electricity, this energy coil will pull the electricity
        out of the cells which will carry the toxins with them.<br>
        <br>
        He says the proof of it is the production of heat in the palms
        of the hand which can be felt with or without the machine and a
        less subjective proof is that the subject urinates often when
        being subjected to this bio-heating and cooling effect.<br>
        <br>
        This sounds to the author like a version of iontophoresis, where
        charged ions can be used to introduce or remove elements or
        chemicals to or from the cells. Once these cellular contaminants
        are in the blood stream, they are detected as invaders or
        excesses and removed as waste, most easily via urination.<br>
        <br>
        And yes, Lee says he has treated himself with the machine for
        months where he used a 4 foot by 8 foot wire mesh screen placed
        between the mattress and box spring of his bed, with his machine
        feeding this mesh screen so he would be treated while he sleeps.<br>
        <br>
        He reports during this process, he would have to go to the
        bathroom 4-5 times a night and had to discontinue it due to
        dehydration where his body was flushing out all toxins. He also
        says after discontinuing this nightly treatment, he still has to
        go to the bathroom often to urinate but the effect is going away
        over time.<br>
        <br>
        I take this comment as a great warning to not OVERUSE this
        technique, use it when you need it. Many would never have
        mentioned this for fear it might scare people away from the
        entire claim, and to my view that is a sign of Lee Crock's
        sincerity and integrity. Lee also provides a background for the
        basic effect and its' discovery as well as charging NOTHING for
        his treatments at his facility and is just there to help whoever
        he can. Look around and see how rare this attitude is these
        days.<br>
        <br>
        Lee has an 'Aura Therapy' booklet which he does not sell, but
        gives away freely. He is generous to a fault and charges nothing
        for people to come to his academy to stay in one of the 30 beds
        for as long as necessary to get them better. He says to give him
        a call so he can find you an open slot in their schedule.<br>
        <br>
        I asked if he was setup as a non-profit organization and he said
        yes, so they are in a position to accept donations, bequests,
        etc.. His call impressed me in that Lee didn't seem the least
        concerned with selling anything. His main concern is helping as
        many people as he can while he is here, another excellent sign
        of character.<br>
        <br>
        Amazing results have been achieved with Altzheimers' because his
        system helps to flush aluminum from the tissue as well as
        arthritis and rheumatism which resolves as the excess calcium
        crystals are flushed. He says you can get a sample of the urine
        of the arthritic person and you will see tiny brown calcium
        crystals in the sample.<br>
        <br>
        The treatment involves one of the screen embedded pillows which
        is laid over the person with the machine attached.<br>
        <br>
        I asked him about muscular dystrophy and other such illnesses,
        he says they are nerve disorders and it depends on the degree of
        decay though it couldn't hurt. Also, since Lee has a great sense
        of humor I asked him if it helped hair growth or would act like
        electronic Viagra.<br>
        <br>
        He said no, he didn't think it would help restore hair and he
        didn't know what Viagra was, I explained it and he said well,
        most of that is in the mind anyway, so he didn't think it would
        help......<br>
        <br>
        One of the other discoveries is that you can have several people
        touch the pillow while the machine is on and the effect is
        greatly increased, as if the machine, producing its alternating
        CCW and CW fields absorbs additional healing energy from the
        people participating, which greatly intensifies the healing
        effect.<br>
        <br>
        This is very similar to the claims of the Eeman screens where
        two wire mesh screens are laid next to each other and offset on
        the floor to be connected with one wire at the top and one wire
        at the bottom.<br>
        <br>
        A healthy person lays on one mesh screen and a sick person lays
        on the other mesh screen opposite each other, so that the feet
        are on the end of each screen. The idea is that a bioelectric
        current will flow between the two and a form of induced empathic
        trans-sympathetic healing is produced.<br>
        <br>
        Lee has many great stories about using the machines, one of them
        had to do with a woman who had lung cancer and was given up to
        death. In the hospital she was in an oxygen tent to assist her
        breathing. Since she was known to be a very religious woman,
        they thought about ways to smuggle the machine into the hospital
        to help her.<br>
        <br>
        So they put the device in a suitcase and wrote 'anointing oils'
        on it, then took the pillow and the suitcase in. The pillow was
        placed on the womans chest and the single wire connected to the
        machine. The helpers all placed their hands on the pillow and
        put on quite a show when the nurse or doctors came in.<br>
        <br>
        They went back every day and treated the woman for 2 hours at a
        time, within 3 days, she was taken off the oxygen tent, within 5
        days released to go home. The cancer had 'disappeared' and was
        written off as a miracle due to spontaneous healing.<br>
        <br>
        He has another great story about a priest who had been
        unknowingly using this healing technique by placing his right
        hand on the left shoulder of the faithful until he felt a heat,
        usually after about 6 minutes. He attributed this heat
        production to his faith and considered himself one of a gifted
        few.<br>
        <br>
        The priest told Lee there were probably a total of 13 people in
        the world with this 'gift'. Lee told him that 6 of these people
        were with them today at the academy and if he'd give him a
        couple of hours, he'd call up the other 7.<br>
        <br>
        He then did a demonstration and showed the priest what was
        really happening and how to speed it up with the CCW motions so
        he could help more people instead of just waiting for the flow
        to happen on its own.<br>
        <br>
        I will tell you my experience with the machine. For some 23
        years, I worked in three different photo-finishing labs running
        the Technical Support department. During that time I was exposed
        to chemicals which I blame for damaging my spleen and causing it
        to become enlarged. The spleen kills off old red blood cells
        among other functions, so when it is enlarged, it kills off many
        more red cells than it should, leaving the subject tired and
        needing sleep. That was my problem.<br>
        <br>
        After 5 doctors, I was sent to a hemotologist who found an
        enlarged spleen to be the problem. My options were to have it
        removed and become susceptible to opportunistic infections where
        my only recourse was to take antibiotics, or take massive doses
        of cortisone. Either option would eventually damage other
        organs. Or I could just live with it. I chose to live with being
        tired and needing more sleep than normal but was always looking
        for something that might help my non life-threatening condition.<br>
        <br>
        My red cell count when I was first tested was 7.9 and the doctor
        said I should not have enough energy to even be walking around.
        The normal red cell count for a healthy male is 12 to 16
        according to the medical staff I consulted. They put me on
        massive doses of iron and folic acid which in the next test
        about a month later, only increased my count to 8.1.<br>
        <br>
        That was their best and they expressed regret that they could
        not do more. That was in October of 2000. In the summer of 2001,
        we had the KeelyNet Conference and Lee loaned me one of his
        machines. I used it for approximately 3 months, with a 3 X 4
        foot aluminum wirescreen under my mattress pad and the machine
        running unnoticed under my bed, all but forgotten.<br>
        <br>
        In the 3rd month I began having trouble sleeping and would wake
        up with a lot of energy. I would have to get up to clean the
        house or do something to dissipate this extra energy so that I
        could sleep to make it in to work the next day. Finally I
        realized the only change I had made recently was the Crock
        machine under my bed, so I disconnected it and over the next 2
        days, my sleep pattern was restored.<br>
        <br>
        Around that time, I quit my job for my planned move to Mexico
        since the hemotologist warned me I was now subject to sudden
        heart attack. It scared me pretty badly so I decided to make a
        serious life change. Before I left Dallas for my exploratory
        trip to Mexico, I went back to the hemotologist to have another
        red cell count and this time it showed 8.9!!<br>
        <br>
        I had taken NO iron and NO folic acid. The doctor and the nurses
        came to read this result and were amazed, asking me what I had
        been doing to cause such an increase when their best was 8.1. I
        tried to tell them about the Crock machine but all of them put
        their hands over their ears and said they didn't want to hear
        about any alternative health machine. So much for that. But I
        made them give me photocopies of the test from the 8.1 (my last
        best reading under their guidance) and this new 8.9 using ONLY
        the Crock machine.<br>
        <br>
        Needless to say, it certainly gave me faith in the machine, I
        definitely had more energy and this test showed why, I simply
        had more blood. Now I don't know if the machine is helping to
        increase my red cell production or if it is healing my spleen.
        To tell you the truth, I don't CARE because I feel so much
        better.<br>
        <br>
        Since moving to central Mexico in November of 2001, I have built
        my own version of the machine which I call the 'MexiStim' and
        have been using it under my bed with a wirescreen under my
        mattress pad. The machine is on all the time and sometimes I
        have to disconnect it due to too much energy preventing me from
        sleeping.<br>
        <br>
        I have completely changed my diet and lost 4 pants sizes,
        further benefiting my health. Adding to my success, I also
        credit not having the temptations of fast food and the stresses
        of the computer call center job I was working that was adding to
        my health problems.<br>
        <br>
        My goal here in central Mexico is to build an alternative
        science research center where the climate is 70-90 degrees year
        round, land is very reasonable, local labor is $15-$20US a DAY!
        I soon learned many of the horror stories about Mexico I had
        read on the Internet simply are not true.<br>
        <br>
        We have many dozens of projects which have commercial potential
        and need one or more investors or partners to finance these
        various projects. The returns could be phenomenal and we could
        do much to quantify so many of the bogus claims in the
        alternative science arena. That includes many projects relating
        to free energy, gravity control, claims of health machines and
        rejuvenation systems. KeelyNet interests and technical
        information are both wide ranging and prolific in many areas. If
        you are interested in investing in or discussing this
        alternative research center, please Email me.<br>
        <br>
        The new machines Lee uses necessarily require just 9 'D' cell
        batteries to get the 4.5vdc and require no outside power making
        them completely portable, a much desired feature for many
        situations and for travel.<br>
        <br>
        These self-contained battery powered machines (shown here
        labeled as 'Energy Stimulator') are very well built by Mr. Tom
        Berryhill and you can contact Lee if you might wish to purchase
        one.<br>
        <br>
        I would recommend you visit Lee Crocks' website at
        www.edkuniversity.com and read all the details they have
        provided, particularly the testimonials.<br>
        <br>
        In experimenting with the machines, I notice with the 3vdc
        system, a heat sensation from the pad which I don't experience
        with the 4.5vdc system.<br>
        <br>
        I thought this was just me until a fellow in Texas asked me to
        build him a machine.<br>
        <br>
        When he got it, he wrote back saying he had also bought one of
        the 4.5vdc systems and he also felt heat from the 3vdc machine
        but not from the 4.5vdc. I don't know that this is critical as
        people have used and are using the 4.5vdc system and getting
        good results.<br>
        <br>
        My red cell count increased and my lady friends rectal cancer
        dissolved, both using one of Lees' newer 4.5vdc machines so it
        apparently doesn't make a difference. The resolved sarcoiditis
        cancer used the 3vdc system as in the MexiStim unit and it is
        the design for the machine I now use for myself.<br>
        <br>
        Lee has an unusual way to sell the machines, using a 'lease with
        option to buy' system. The University where Lee allows people to
        come use the Energy Cleaner machines for free does cost money to
        operate. Many people cannot pay to stay there, so the money has
        to come from somewhere. Lee offers a money back guarantee where
        he charges $3,000 for a machine which you can use for a month.<br>
        <br>
        On receipt of the money, a machine is overnighted to you with
        the cost of that shipping taken from the $3,000. If you send the
        machine back undamaged, you receive the $3,000 minus the
        overnight shipping cost. If you decide to keep the machine, the
        extra money helps to run his clinic and allows those who cannot
        pay an opportunity to benefit from the machines. In this way
        many can benefit from those who buy his machines, so I urge you
        to consider helping him to help many others less fortunate if
        you can possibly do so.<br>
        <br>
        I understand his logic and applaud the money back guarantee but
        to me, that is a lot of money to have to put up front, even for
        a money back guarantee. Lee and I have discussed this and he
        knows my feelings about it.<br>
        <br>
        Having met Lee Crock, I must say I am totally impressed with his
        discovery, the results he definitely gets in some cases that I
        am aware of (as in my case and the two cited above) and his
        genuine desire for his machine and technique to be used to help
        as many people as possible.<br>
        <br>
        Many people, including me, have suggested to Lee that he lower
        the price of the machines and sell many more in volume without
        the money back option. It would let so many more people benefit
        from the machines. He resists this suggestion as the system has
        worked well thus far. The Energy Cleaner machine can be used for
        so many problems that many people choose to keep them and use it
        for their family and friends. As the saying goes with Murphys'
        law, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."<br>
        <br>
        You can build yourself a machine with some basic ability, the
        most difficult part is the timer. Some use an integrated circuit
        based on a 555 timer with a big capacitor, others use a 24 hour
        appliance timer which I believe gives you 12 cycles which would
        switch in 15 minute intervals for a total of 3 hours, yet others
        do the absolute simplest thing, they hook the wire from the
        batteries to the screen and watch the clock for 15 minutes, once
        15 minutes has elapsed they move the wire to the opposite
        polarity and wait another 15 minutes. All the methods seem to
        work.<br>
        <br>
        (The following Carbon battery comment is incorrect, ALKALINE
        batteries such as Duracell, Energizer, etc. can be used with
        excellent results.)<br>
        <br>
        I think it critical to repeat something Lee was quite adamant
        about at the conference. Lee says use ONLY CARBON 'D' cell
        batteries, not lead acid, not alkaline, not NiCads, not
        rechargeables and not AC adapters because he tried all of them
        and didn't get the same feeling in his hands when testing the
        machine with 10 'D' carbon cell batteries wired for 3vdc. We had
        quite a discussion about carbon being key to life on this planet
        and why it was that carbon batteries are the best type to use.
        Some kind of sympathetic resonance connection through the carbon
        connection? Somewhat reminscent of Edgar Cayce and other
        bio-energy devices that use carbon. Who knows, it could lead to
        a new science.<br>
        <br>
        At the conference and in our telephone conversations, Lee also
        says to use 10 batteries, not 9, not 11, but 10 which they found
        produces the identical heating and healing sensation he and his
        fellow practitioners feel in their hands. Since their new
        portable machine uses 9 batteries to produce the 4.5vdc, perhaps
        this recommendation has changed.<br>
        <br>
        The one wirescreen method as diagrammed earlier in this article
        is the method currently in use for the machines Lee is providing
        and in the MexiStim machine I build by request.<br>
        <br>
        Though you can cut a piece of wirescreen to whatever size you
        want, I use a 1 foot by 1 foot wirescreen for local application
        and a 3 foot by 4 foot wirescreen under my mattress pad for all
        night application. It makes sense that the smaller the pad, the
        more concentrated the energy should be.<br>
        <br>
        This energy effect can be further increased by holding a hand on
        the pad to intensify the local energy field. Though it is my
        opinion that a large screen under the resting/sleeping body will
        still receive energy but at a slower rate since it is exposed to
        more surface area.<br>
        <br>
        All you do is attach one corner of the wirescreen to the
        negative pole of the batteries and leave it for 15 minutes, then
        attach it to the positive pole and leave it for 15 minutes,
        repeat, or you can build a switching circuit that does it
        automatically, or buy one of the prebuilt and tested machines
        and save all the hassle.<br>
        <br>
        Lee Crock and Tom Berryhill recently reported you can connect
        the output wire to a metal bathtub filled with water or just
        suspend it in the water, then sit for awhile to experience what
        Lee calls the 'Fountain of Youth'.<br>
        <br>
        In the 1900s, people used 'galvanic baths' for medical
        treatments but this machine doesn't have a current path so it
        shouldn't be doing anything. Since the machine is battery
        powered I think it is perfectly safe due to such a low voltage
        and no current flow. The MexiStim I build has a completely
        separate battery system isolated from the AC adapter powered
        timer. I definitely plan to try this 'Fountain of Youth'
        claim...<br>
        <br>
        For those who might not have the technical ability or patience
        to build one of these machines, I can build you a MexiStim unit
        for $230 plus UPS shipping and handling (without the 10 'D' cell
        batteries as they are too heavy to ship), which runs about $50
        to ship UPS from Mexico to the United States and more for
        overseas. I cover any additional shipping costs to simplify
        payment.<br>
        <br>
        This is not a big factory operation, each unit is hand built by
        me by request which is why I can keep the costs down very low. I
        build the machines in the sequence I get the orders so it might
        take 2 weeks to fully complete and test your machine. Then I
        ship UPS to non PO Boxes with an email to you of your TRACKING
        NUMBER.<br>
        <br>
        Since I have been here in Mexico, I met a North American lady
        named Donna who wrote a best selling book on Anger Management
        and was invited as a guest on Oprah. Donna told me her +30 year
        old son had an incurable cancer called sarcoiditis. He was
        visiting here for a week so she took him around for
        aromatherapy, acupuncture and anything that might help him, none
        of which helped. I told her about the Crock machine and loaned
        him the unit I brought to Mexico. He said he could feel a heat
        coming from the pad so he used it the last 3 days he was here.<br>
        <br>
        On his arrival back home, he had an MRI done and the doctors
        told him his cancer appeared to be 'melting', so he was eager to
        spend more time using the machine but could not afford the
        $3000. So impressed was he and his mother with the results of
        even a short exposure to the machine, his mother asked me to
        build him a MexiStim unit, I did and mailed it to him in
        Connecticut. This was in 2002.<br>
        <br>
        Donna only stays here with her husband for about 6 months of the
        year, so they went back to the states and I forgot about the
        machine. About 2 months ago, around March 2003, she returned and
        was all effusive saying the machine I sent her son had healed
        his sarcoiditis cancer as proven by MRI and biopsy. They were
        both ecstatic, though the doctors claimed it was 'spontaneous
        remission.'<br>
        <br>
        A lady friend in Dallas had rectal cancer and I loaned her one
        of the other Crock machines Lee had loaned us to let people use.
        My lady friend now reports she is cancer free and is now taking
        the machine to another friend who has many ailments, we are
        hoping it will help him.<br>
        <br>
        I recently received an email from a medical practitioner in
        England who received one of my MexiStim units and he writes;<br>
        <br>
        "Have my cancer patient on box and already getting positive
        feedback from her within an hour of using it her pain in the
        chest had reduced by 75%. The next morning her energy was also
        good as well so we'll see how she does as she has to have Chemo
        next week again. She only has a 10% chance of survival so this
        should prove interesting."<br>
        <br>
        I have built several of the MexiStim machines at the request of
        people who visit KeelyNet.<br>
        <br>
        My version uses the original 3vdc system with an AC adapter to
        power the custom switching timer circuit I build.<br>
        <br>
        Though you can't see it in the photo, there are 10 batteries in
        my unit.<br>
        <br>
        Also included with the MexiStim device;<br>
        <br>
        the custom switching timer circuit board, a jack for the AC
        adapter power, the AC adapter as shown, a jack for the
        wirescreen connection, the cable for connecting to the
        approximate one foot square wirescreen and instructions, all of
        which come with the unit for $230 plus UPS shipping and handling
        from central Mexico.<br>
        <br>
        Prior to shipping, each machine is tested over a period of
        several hours to verify correct operation.<br>
        <br>
        The 10 'D' cell batteries are NOT included because of their
        weight for shipping.<br>
        <br>

        Normally I am a big skeptic about healing machines mostly
        because I have tried several and didn't get any effects.
        Granted, I didn't have life threatening or serious illnesses
        which should ideally respond more easily to them if they really
        worked as claimed.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of Lee Crocks' Energy Cleaner machine, I originally
        had my doubts as I just could not believe such a simple machine
        could possibly impact health in any way, positive or negative.<br>
        <br>
        Yet I had extra energy plus my red cell count printouts showing
        the seriousness of my condition, had used the machine and forgot
        it was even there until I began trying to find the source of why
        I couldn't sleep, then when I got my next red cell count, my
        results amazed the doctor and staff, plus I had the printout
        verifiying an increase.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, I was not fooling myself as do so many who 'want
        to believe' in an alternative therapy that seems to make them
        'feel better.'<br>
        <br>
        Before I knew about Lee Crocks' Energy Cleaner machine, I had
        friends die from failing to get proper medical tests when they
        became ill. Instead they chose alternative methods and believed
        they were better, though as time progressed, their illness
        progressed to a point of no return.<br>
        <br>
        Several years ago, I knew an intelligent, beautiful young lady
        who found a lump on her breast. Rather than have conventional
        therapy for what was found to be a malignant tumor, she used a
        custom Rife type machine sold by a fellow named Robert Fox in
        the Dallas area. She believed she was better and became a
        spokeswoman for this machine.<br>
        <br>
        Over time, her breast lump became seriously infected and she
        wound up in the hospital. They did what they could for her, but
        too much time had elapsed and she died as a result of massive
        infection from the cancer, all the while wanting to believe the
        claims of an alternative therapy and denying orthodox therapy.<br>
        <br>
        This hit all her friends hard. Alas, no lesson was learned by
        any of us apparently, as my closest lady friend developed a
        shooting pain in her hip which she believed to be sciatica from
        a pinched nerve. Rather than have it formally tested, she tried
        various alternative medical approaches over an approximately six
        month period. She began with a limp, progressed to having to use
        a cane, then a walker, then a wheelchair.<br>
        <br>
        All her friends urged her early on to PLEASE go see a real
        doctor and have Xrays done, instead, she had a very fuzzy Xray
        done by an alternative medical guy which showed nothing useful.
        Time progressed and we all watched helplessly as she went
        further down, despite our voiced concerns, she refused to allow
        anyone to take her to the doctor. Finally, she went to a
        hospital, by this time she was in a wheelchair and in horrible
        pain, taking morphine for suppressing the pain.<br>
        <br>
        The Xrays showed her hip bone had been eaten away with only a
        sharp spike left. Additional Xrays showed massive scarring on
        her lungs from an earlier mastectomy. As time went on, her lungs
        became reinfected with cancer spreading from her diseased hip.<br>
        <br>
        The doctors said there was nothing they could do as it had gone
        too far. She quickly ended up in the hospital, lung cancer
        ensued and her friends attended her in her last days, as she was
        given a morphine drip that had to be increased almost daily to
        compensate for the ever worsening pain.<br>
        <br>
        Her closest friends were there at her passing and we all
        regretted immensely that we did not somehow force her to seek at
        least quantified tests much earlier. This woman, a brilliant
        biochemist, extremely intelligent, sparkling with life and
        interest, a friend and inspiration to many, was also very
        stubborn.<br>
        <br>
        From this loss of a great and dear friend, I have learned; DO
        NOT TRUST YOUR FEELINGS! I can't and won't attempt to give any
        advice, but speaking for myself, if I have any ongoing medical
        problem which I cannot resolve in a reasonable period, I will
        most definitely have tests done to find out what is truly
        happening and what my options are. I will NEVER BELIEVE without
        proof just because I have tried an alternative system and seem
        to 'feel better.'<br>
        <br>
        Excuse me, but that's just not good enough. And I would hope
        others learn from this sad story and spend the money to have
        real tests done. I like the idea of before, during and after
        tests but that can get expensive. For myself, I would want to
        know what IS NOW, then try my alternative for a reasonable
        period and if I 'felt better', then I would have comparable
        medical tests done to VERIFY the FACT. Not just trusting my
        feelings.<br>
        <br>
        Hey, its YOUR life we are talking about here. Believe in
        alternative methods without quantifiable (measured) tests and
        take a chance of letting whatever it is get SO BAD there is no
        chance of recovery, or have the tests done and KNOW what your
        problem is and what options you have.<br>
        <br>
        As for Lee Crocks' Energy Cleaner, I can for certain say it
        originally did help me, though I now use my 3 volt DC MexiStim
        version because I prefer the effects I get, more energy and a
        sensation of well being which the 4.5vdc system also gave me but
        I think not as intense as the 3vdc system.<br>
        <br>
        I would love to report a further increase in my red cell count
        but when I was last in Dallas back in October 2002, the office
        of my hemotologist told me they no longer take cash, credit
        cards or checks, only group insurance as provided by companies.
        I even tried to bribe them (one learns this in Mexico, called a
        'mordida' meaning little bite) to test my blood but they
        refused.<br>
        <br>
        Despite my last test in Dallas that so surprised the medical
        staff, before I can be CERTAIN I am not fooling myself, I need
        to find a place here in Mexico where I can have more red cell
        counts done to verify the machine is continuing to help me get
        to a normal red cell level. The increased energy level could
        even be imaginary though I almost never think about the 'machine
        under my bed.'<br>
        <br>
        For those who know me, they know what a skeptic I am for medical
        claims especially, it's a hard thing to say, but I have
        experienced proof of it myself and have the printouts to prove
        something positive is going on. I never intended to make and
        sell the MexiStim units, designed and built based on my version
        of Lee's current machine, only doing so when people wrote me
        asking that I build one for them for whatever reasons.<br>
        <br>
        I rely on Lees' statement that he wants to see as many people
        helped with this discovery as possible and I share with him all
        information that comes in about the machines as well as forward
        questions and requests people make and address to me for him. I
        would hope people would write in with their successes or lack of
        them.<br>
        <br>
        The more information we have, the more can be posted to help
        others. If you have experiences with this machine, whether one
        you build yourself, one you lease or buy from Lee, or one I
        build for you, do feel free to write me and I will compile your
        information into a 'testimonials page,' please include the
        condition you were trying to alleviate, how long you used it,
        where you used it, what kind of results you had and if you have
        had any formal testing to verify an improvement in your
        condition.<br>
        <br>
        As you can see from the diagrams above, it is not a complicated
        high tech machine, the current and most effective version to
        date uses the single wirescreen for a pad with the body as the
        'floating ground', so its really your choice as to whether you
        want to wire it up for 4.5vdc or 3vdc as in the original.<br>
        <br>
        I want to thank Lee Crock for providing much of the information
        in this article, especially the technical details and wonderful
        anecdotes about experiences he has had with his machine and
        'laying on of hands' technique. If you are having a conference
        or want an entertaining, informative speaker willing to
        demonstrate his technology, I most certainly recommend Lee
        Crock.<br>
        <br>
        How many people would share something like this so freely? I
        can't say enough good things about Mr. Crock and the builder of
        his machines, Mr. Tom Berryhill.<br>
        <br>
        One thing I want to write in closing, the machine uses batteries
        to power the wirescreen and so is perfectly safe to use. I can't
        see any way this machine could possibly hurt you unless you got
        tangled up in the cable leading from the machine to the
        wirescreen. There are SO MANY illnesses and conditions whose
        true cause is simply not known that this machine might help.<br>
        <br>
        The idea of toxins in the cells causing irritation and various
        conditions makes much sense to me, and if this machine can help
        your body remove those toxins, so much the better.<br>
        <br>
        The bottom line is, I am so glad I was made aware of Lee and his
        machine, then tried it and found such success that I would
        gladly recommend it to my friends to at least TRY.<br>
        <br>
        As an example of how I think the machine has played a part in
        improving my life and realizing of course that there are many
        other factors involved, I want to show you a 'before' photo of
        me captured from a videotape taken at the 2001 KeelyNet
        conference in Dallas as compared to a photo a friend took in
        December of 2002, here in Mexico.<br>
        <br>
        My god, I was almost too embarrassed to include it here, on
        looking at it, I couldn't believe I was so out of shape! But in
        the interests of information, I have to include this gordo photo
        and apologize for ever being on videotape!<br>
        <br>
        As they say in Mexico, Las Cosas Cambien! - Things Change...<br>
        <br>
        At 49 years of age, I will admit I tint my hair (for $5US here)
        which began turning salt and pepper some 6 years ago.<br>
        <br>
        Since moving here to Mexico Lindo I had dental work done, lost
        over 4 pant sizes from 46 down to 38, working on size 36.<br>
        <br>
        I sleep on a 3 foot by 4 foot aluminum wirescreen under my
        mattress pad which is connected to the first MexiStim unit I
        built, which I leave on day and night.<br>
        <br>
        I bought my wirescreen at the local ferreteria (hardware store),
        cut it to size, then folded the edges in about an inch to
        minimize the rough edges.<br>
        <br>
        I keep the wirescreen under my mattress pad and it is connected
        to my MexiStim machine which is under my bed with the AC adapter
        always plugged in. When I can't sleep from being too 'wired' I
        disconnect the machine for a couple of days.<br>
        <br>
        On visiting my friends and family, everyone says I look and act
        years younger. I most certainly feel it.<br>
        <br>
        They are amazed at the very positive health changes much of
        which I credit to Lee Crock because, speaking from my own
        experiences with the machine, I seem to have more energy than
        I've had in years from using his very simple yet effective
        technology.<br>
        <br>
        The weight loss I think was mostly facilitated by the easily
        obtainable fresh foods here in Mexico, no junk food, but I do
        think the 'perceived' energy I get from the machine really
        helped.<br>
        <br>
        Delusional? Tell that to my hemotologist and try to ignore the
        printouts showing a MUCH higher red cell count than they could
        hope to get. From 7.9 to 8.1 is only .3 points, from 8.1 to 8.9
        is .8 points, which is better?<br>
        <br>
        At any rate, its great when people first meet me me these days
        and they guess I am 30 or 35 years old. I've had people say 28
        but I think they need eyeglasses or maybe not so much tequila or
        cerveza. (I just turned 50 years old!)<br>
        <br>
        Geez, if this is just using the machine under the bed, I really
        need to try Lees' 'fountain of youth' idea of connecting the
        machine to a tub of water and immersing in it.<br>
        <br>
        All this said, I am sold on the Energy Cleaner 'technology' and
        very pleased to have the opportunity to report it to readers of
        Nexus, thanks for that goes to Duncan. For myself, I am 'livin
        la vida loca' in glorious Mexico but I DO wish Lees' machine
        grew hair!!!<br>
        <br>
        If you can't afford to buy a machine, I really would recommend
        that you try to build one, even if its' where you have to switch
        the polarity wire by hand after waiting every 15 minutes. A few
        hours might make you tired doing this, but it might also give
        you an interesting and possibly beneficial experience.<br>

        These UPDATES are highly relevant to this article.<br>
        <br>
        Over the years, new information has come in which follows;<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 09/05/03 (changes which
          apply to the original document of 08/01/03)</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Item 1 - in the following article is a specification that ONLY
        Carbon cell batteries will provide the heating/cooling effect.
        This has now been found inaccurate. The machines work well with
        alkaline, carbon or any mix of these types of batteries. The
        effect has been tested on both the 4.5vdc Energy Cleaner machine
        Lee Crock sells AND the 3vdc MexiStim unit described below. You
        can use easily available Energizer, Duracell, etc. alkaline
        batteries with no problems.<br>
        <br>
        Item 2 - because of the flushing of toxins/irritants believed to
        be induced by this machine, it is recommended you drink
        additional water.<br>
        <br>
        Item 3 - results DECREASE with the age of the person, due to the
        more dynamic system functions in younger bodies. As we age, our
        bodies slow in their ability to heal rapidly so it might take
        longer to observe and experience effects based on your age.<br>
        <br>
        Item 4 - battery life - the MexiStim uses 10 D cell
        (flashlight/torch) batteries (alkaline OR carbon cells as above)
        - since there is no current path, battery life is easily 2-4
        years, simple to check with a cheap voltmeter, for the MexiStim
        unit it should read 3vdc or higher, for Lee Crocks Energy
        Cleaner machine, it should read 4.5vdc or higher.<br>
        <br>
        As described below, the original Crock machine used on over
        10,000 people used 3vdc (which is what the MexiStim uses,
        Murphys law, if it works, don't fix it....), the new PORTABLE
        machine uses 4.5vdc. The MexiStim machine uses an AC adapter to
        provide 9vdc to the custom timer circuit which switches the
        battery polarity.<br>
        <br>
        Item 5 - price change - I found 'hidden costs' in the pricing
        system I was using so had to bring up the price for the online
        purchases as I was losing money. Those ordering from Nexus will
        get the Nexus price, CONTACT ME if you are ordering from the
        Nexus article. Thanks.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 06/10/07</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Over time, people sometimes forget or change their minds about
        things they said in the past. I wish to clarify a few things;<br>
        <br>
        1. Lee Crock's current website offers the Energy Cleaner with
        peripherals for $1000. Note the original price was $3000 for
        which he offered me half if I would become a distributor. At the
        time of the offer he told me he had sold some $900,000 worth of
        Energy Cleaner machines. I declined for ethical reasons (which I
        explained to him as my concerns about the extremely high price
        when the box could be built much cheaper and thus made available
        to many more people who might benefit from it) but thanked him
        for the opportunity.<br>
        <br>
        2. Lee Crock does not endorse the MexiStim and I have never said
        he did. As noted in the article, there are essentially 2
        versions of the machine, the patented 2 screen device and the
        2nd device using only one pad which Lee told me in our phone
        conversations (detailed above) and at our conference that he had
        used with success on over 10,000 people. Murphy's law says don't
        mess with what works, so 10,000 people with results? That is the
        design used in the MexiStim.<br>
        <br>
        3. You will note Lees original machines used a 110vac timer to
        switch the DC of the battery. The relay I use is completely
        isolated from 110vac so despite what you might have read, there
        is no risk of any 'frying'. I have a MexiStim I have been using
        24/7 for over 5 years now and it has not failed. That is simply
        fear mongering to sell higher priced machines so you aren't
        having to pay for factory infrastructure.<br>
        <br>
        4. Lee Crock graciously lectured and did a workshop at the
        KeelyNet 2001 conference and AT THE TIME, he claimed many things
        which have apparently changed over time, including the repeated
        statement that this discovery was given to him and he wanted to
        help as many people as he could while he was alive. There were
        approximately 100 people at the conference and a videotape of
        Lee was produced.<br>
        <br>
        5. As noted in this document, a true and accurate report of our
        telephone conversations preceding and after the conference.<br>

        6. One final universal rule....follow...the....money....<br>
        <br>
        7. You have several options;<br>
        <br>
        a. build your own energy stimulation machine with the schematic
        in this file<br>
        <br>
        b. buy the newer model portable Energy Cleaner from Lee Crock
        for $1000 at Lee Crocks website<br>
        <br>
        c. Order a MexiStim Polarity Cycler for $225 plus $50 shipping<br>
        <br>
        d. buy from another source<br>
        <br>
        8. I make no claims for the MexiStim. It is very easy to test
        for yourself if you wish to do so. Please note how hospitals and
        clinics spend a fortune on expensive equipment, then charge high
        fees to the customer to pay for that equipment. The MexiStim
        isn't produced in any factory or using an expensive machine that
        puts out 1000 per run. They are built per order.<br>
        <br>
        9. Everything else is covered in the article for which Lee
        thanked me for writing, at the time because it got him a lot of
        publicity and new sales for his machines. My 'ethics' issue was
        about charging so much for such a simple device. And that is why
        I included a schematic in this article so that others could
        build and test it for themselves if they could not afford to buy
        a unit.<br>
        <br>
        10. If you study the original patent and the original claims
        from the US Patent office (#6,016,450), all ANY of these
        'cleaner' machines acutally does is alternatively switch the DC
        polarity energy from batteries into a conductive screen or
        screens. It is DC (direct current) so there here are NO
        FREQUENCIES involved other than the timing for switching. This
        is simple obfuscation along with the claim of 'frying you from
        110 volts'...similar to when Edison who used DC power promoted
        fear of Tesla's AC power with the fear of frying people. It
        can't happen with the MexiStim because the AC is only for the
        power supply for the timing circuit which just happens to use an
        integrated circuit as does the current Crock machine, though it
        is a different 'microchip/integrated circuit'.<br>
        <br>
        11. Again, sufficient details are provided in this page to BUILD
        YOUR OWN machine to test the effect for yourself. Never mind the
        wild claims of microchips (an integrated circuit) and 'DC
        frequencies' (which is a totally bogus term) and 'frying
        yourself' (AC isolated from the DC with a relay as you can see
        in the circuit), that is just to sell high priced devices to pay
        for an expensive plastic injection molding machine. Much like
        doctors prescribing expensive unnecessary tests using high
        dollar equipment in a hospital, SOMEONE has to pay for that
        equipment. It is always the case that when people smell big
        money in this world, they tend to try to get as much of it as
        they can, ramp up production, confuse the terms with techo-speak
        and dream up sensational claims. Believe no claims and nothing
        that you haven't tested and proven for yourself. This page lets
        you try it for yourself. If you can't build it, pay some local
        electronic guy or smart kid to build you the simple version
        below to try out.<br>
        <br>
        12. ALWAYS follow the money and feel free to assemble and test
        your own device. Good luck and good health!<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The present invention relates to therapeutic methods and
        apparatuses, and more particularly to a method and device to
        stimulate the healing of living tissue by repairing damaged
        aurae.<br>
        <br>
        An aura is an invisible envelope of vital energy, which
        apparently radiates from everything in nature: minerals, plants,
        animals, and humans. It is not visible to normal vision, but may
        be seen by those who are sensitive to these emanations as a halo
        of light. It often appears as a multicolored mist that fades off
        into space with no definite boundary, and having sparks, rays,
        and streamers.<br>
        <br>
        Much of what is purported to be known about the aura is based on
        paranormal experiences where no scientific evidence has been
        found to prove its existence. The body does, however, have a
        magnetic field, a biofield, as it is called, but it is far too
        weak to account for a light-emitting aura. Even if the field
        were many times stronger, it still would be insufficient to emit
        light. It has been theorized that the aura might actually be a
        form of light that emanates at frequencies beyond the normal
        range of vision, caused by some yet-to-be-discovered light
        emitting substance embedded in living organisms. Another theory
        suggests that those who are sensitive to these emanations, who
        say they see the aura, may in fact see the magnetic field, which
        may register as light, perhaps because of some sort of sensitive
        magnetic detector in the brain.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The emanation of vital energy from life forms is believed to
        have originated in ancient times, and appears in the writings
        and art of Egypt, India, Greece, and Rome. In the sixteenth
        century, Paracelsus was one of the first Western scholars to
        expound upon the astral body, which he described as a "fiery
        globe." In the eighteenth century, the clairvoyant Emanuel
        Swedenborg said in his Spiritual Diary that "there is a
        spiritual sphere surrounding every one, as well as a natural and
        corporal one."<br>
        <br>
        The scientific study of the aura began in the late eighteenth
        century, when Franz Anton Mesmer put forth the theory of "animal
        magnetism," an electromagnetic force that could be transmitted
        from one person to another and effect healing. In 1845, Baron
        Karl von Reichenbach, a German chemist, announced the discovery
        of the "odic force" energy. Reich-enbach's clairvoyant test
        subjects sat in darkened rooms and saw flame-like energy
        radiating from fingertips, animals, plants, magnets, and certain
        crystals. The subjects described seeing flames of red, orange,
        green, and violet, which alternately appeared and disappeared; a
        violet-red, which disappeared in a smokelike vapor; and
        intermingled in streamers, sparks and stars among all colors.<br>
        <br>
        Shortly before World War I, Dr. Walter J. Kilner, who was in
        charge of electrotherapy at St. Thomas's Hospital in London,
        discovered that an apparent human aura could be made visible if
        viewed through an apparatus containing a coal-tar dye called
        dicyanin, which made ultraviolet light visible.<br>
        <br>
        Kilner saw the aura as a faint haze, which sometimes could be
        separated into two or three portions. It enveloped the whole
        body. Men in good health all showed the same aura
        characteristics, women, however, varied. In childhood their
        auras appeared the same as males, but by adulthood were more
        developed and more refined in texture, according to Kilner.<br>
        <br>
        He divided the aura into three parts: (1) the etheric double, a
        transparent dark space, narrow and often obliterated by the
        second band; (2) the inner aura, fairly constant in size and the
        densest portion; and (3) the outer aura, varied in size, which
        often appears blended into the inner aura. He also observed rays
        emanating from the body in healthy people. Kilner noticed that
        the aura reflected the state of health, and by 1919, formulated
        a method of auric diagnosis of illness. In some cases the aura
        was affected only locally, while in other illnesses, the entire
        aura was affected; as the patient recovered, so did the aura.
        Kilner also noticed that weak, depleted auras drains the auric
        energy of healthy, vigorous auras around them.<br>
        <br>
        Kilner published the results of his early research in The Human
        Aura in 1911. It was greeted with a great deal of skepticism,
        but he continued his experiments, attracting the interest of Sir
        Oliver Lodge. Kilner's work was interrupted by World War I. In
        1920, he published a revised edition of his book, which was
        sympathetically reviewed.<br>
        <br>
        Those who are sensitive to emanations from the aura, see the
        aura as emanating from and interpenetrating the human body.
        Health and emotion show in various colors, energy patterns or
        breaks, and clear and cloudy spots.<br>
        <br>
        Physical health appears to be related to the part of the aura
        that is closest to the body, often called the vital body or
        etheric body. It is said that illness manifests first in the
        etheric body, sometimes months or years before its physical
        symptoms manifest. Except for the etheric body, which appears to
        directly affect health, the composition of the aura is the
        subject of conflicting opinions. No two observers see exactly
        the same aura. Some say they see the entire aura, divided into
        different layers or bodies, while others say they see only parts
        of the aura.<br>
        <br>
        Interpretations of the colors seen in the aura vary
        considerably. There is little agreement by observations made by
        those sensitive to emanations from the aura, as to what is seen
        when they view an aura that is exactly same. Some say they see
        the entire aura, divided into different layers or bodies, while
        others say they see only parts of the aura. Further, it appears
        that the aura fluctuates constantly, and that various colors
        reflect the fluctuations.<br>
        <br>
        To reduce the variability in interpretation and improve the
        repeatability, Semyon Davidovich Kirlian, a Russian electrician,
        began work in 1939 that led to the development of techniques
        purported to record the aura on film.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kirlian Photography</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Kirlian photography is a technique for photographing objects in
        the presence of a high frequency, high voltage, low current
        electrical field. The photographs of which show glowing,
        multicolored emanations are said to be auras or biofields. Some
        researchers say it reveals a physical form of psychic energy.
        Others believe that it reveals the etheric body; that is, one of
        the layers of the aura believed to permeate all living things
        and, that an understanding of this energy will lead to greater
        insights into medicine, psychology and healing. Critics say the
        technique shows nothing more than a discharge of electricity,
        which can be produced under certain conditions.<br>
        <br>
        Prior to Kirlian's work, the process of photographing objects in
        electrical fields was generally known as "electrography" or
        "electrographic photography." Little value was seen in the
        process, which received scant attention from researchers.
        Electrographic photographs date to as early as 1898, when
        another Russian, Yakov Narkevich Yokdo (also given as Todko),
        displayed his work at a photographic exhibition. Research was
        published by a Czech, B. Navratil, in the early 1900s. In 1939,
        two Czech researchers, S. Prat and J. Schlemmer, published
        photographs of leaves showing coronas.<br>
        <br>
        Kirlian used his own hand for his first experiment, and
        photographed a strange glow radiating from the fingertips. He
        and his wife, Valentina, a biologist, experimented with
        photographing both live and inanimate subjects. In the ensuing
        years, the couple refined their equipment and graduated from
        black-and-white to color photography.<br>
        <br>
        The principle of Kirlian photography and all electrography is
        the corona discharge phenomenon, which occurs when an
        electrically grounded object discharges a corona between itself
        and an electrode generating the electrical field. The corona
        discharges are captured on film, appearing as coronas of light.
        These discharges can be affected by temperature, moisture,
        pressure, and other environmental factors. Various Kirlian
        techniques have been developed, but the most basic uses a Tesla
        coil connected to a metal plate. The process is similar to one
        that occurs in nature, when electrical conditions in the
        atmosphere produce luminescences and auras, such as St. Elmo's
        fire.<br>
        <br>
        Kirlians' work was brought to the attention of the West in the
        1960s. Response in the scientific community was mixed, but
        sufficient interest led to a gathering of interested scientists
        in Alma Ata in 1966. Biophysicist Viktor Adamenko theorized that
        the energy field was the "cold emission of electrons," and their
        patterns might suggest new information about the life processes
        of animate objects. Adamenko and other Soviet scientists
        discerned that biological energies of humans were brightest at
        the seven hundred points on the body that coincide with Chinese
        acupuncture points.<br>
        <br>
        Kirlian photos are said to reveal health and emotion by changes
        in the brightness, colors, and patterns of the light.
        Experiments in the 1970s, conducted by Thelma Moss and Kendall
        Johnson at the University of California's Center for Health
        Sciences at Los Angeles, showed changes in a plant's glow when
        approached by a human hand and pricked. When part of a leaf was
        cut off, a glowing outline of the amputated portion still
        appeared on film. Moss, Kendall, and other researchers found
        that the glow around humans similarly reflected changes in
        emotional state.<br>
        <br>
        Some Kirlian enthusiasts consider the phantom leaf phenomenon
        evidence for the existence of an etheric body. However, critics
        say the phenomenon disproves Kirlian photography altogether;
        Should the method truly have photographed a biofield, then the
        aura should disappear when an organism dies. The effect that is
        produced is solely by a high-voltage electric field breakdown of
        air molecules between two condenser plates.<br>
        <br>
        Supporters nonetheless foresee applications of Kirlian
        photography in diagnostic medicine. Experiments using Kirlian
        photographs to detect cancer have been sporadically successful.
        Some researchers envision diagnostic systems that combine
        Kirlian photography with computerized tomography (CT) scanners
        (advanced versions of computerized axial tomography or CAT
        scanners, which utilize a thin beam of X-rays to photograph an
        object from 360 degrees) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
        The latter technique uses no X-rays, but uses magnetic fields to
        produce images of body cells and water in tissues.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chakras</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Chakras are the vortices that penetrate the body and the body's
        aura, through which various energies, including the universal
        life force, are received, transformed, and distributed. Chakras
        are believed to play a vital role in physical, mental, and
        emotional health and in spiritual development. They are
        invisible to ordinary sight but may be perceived clairvoyantly
        or by use of aura photography. It is said of some people that
        they can activate the chakras to whirl faster and can direct the
        flow of energy through them.<br>
        <br>
        Chakra is Sanskrit for "wheel." Chakras are said to be shaped
        like multicolored lotus petals or spoked wheels that whirl at
        various speeds as they process energy. There are differences
        between the two systems, and in various Western descriptions of
        the chakras.<br>
        <br>
        There is no accepted scientific definite evidence that the
        chakras exist; until recently, they were dismissed by Western
        medicine. They have been increasingly acknowledged, along with
        the acupuncture, meridians and other Eastern Systems, in
        alternative treatments. Evidence for the existence of chakras,
        albeit controversial, has been presented by Hiroshi Motoyama of
        Japan, who hypothesized that an enlightened person could
        influence the chakras, and the energy output would be
        measurable. Using a lead-lined recording booth, Motoyama
        measured the energy field opposite various chakras which
        subjects claimed to have awakened, usually through years of
        meditation. He found that the energy levels at those areas were
        significantly greater than over the same areas of control
        subjects.<br>
        <br>
        The health of chakras is diagnosed by clairvoyance or by energy
        scans. Clairvoyants say that health disturbances often manifest
        in the aura, and thus in the chakras, months and sometimes years
        before they manifest in the physical body.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR
          ART</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The referenced prior art that follows, shows one disclosing an
        aura camera device, while others show low voltage treatment
        devices, some operating at various frequencies. In particular:<br>
        <br>
        U.S. Pat. No. 3,774,620, granted Nov. 27, 1873, to A.
        Hansjurgens, discloses an electromedicinal apparatus for use in
        interference therapy. Treatment is produced by stimulation to
        the target area of a patient, through electrodes, each operating
        at different frequencies, set by varying current densities,
        whose frequency difference is in the low frequency range.<br>
        <br>
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,471,787, granted Sep. 18, 1984, to R. H. C.
        Bentall, discloses a portable apparatus comprising a battery
        driven r.f. oscillator and an antenna which is flexible to
        overlie an area of tissue to be treated.<br>
        <br>
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,714, granted Jul. 21, 1992, to S. W. Samon,
        discloses a portrait camera with an aura generating means for
        creating a photographic of a portrait subject and a visible aura
        image.<br>
        <br>
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,133,352, granted Jul. 28, 1992, to P. H.
        Lathrop, et al., discloses an apparatus and method for treating
        infectious skin conditions, by the application of an electrical
        field and current to the affected area to activate a reaction at
        the cell level to combat the virus and disrupt its attack on a
        healthy cell structure. The apparatus consists of a low voltage,
        low direct current device. It is recommended that the infected
        skin area be stimulated, using the device, for a few seconds
        each hour.<br>
        <br>
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,304, granted Dec. 14, 1993, to T. Matthews,
        discloses an electrotherapy apparatus having at least two
        electrodes to feed an oscillating current to selected areas on
        or beneath the epidermal or mucous surface remote from the
        treatment site. The feed electrodes operate at different
        frequencies so that the treatment site is stimulated by the beat
        frequency, which may be at 80 or 130 Hz.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention differs from the aforementioned prior art
        in that the approach is not limited to the use of high frequency
        applications to effect a healing stimulus, but uses an
        application of a steady state charge that is intermittently
        reversed in a therapeutic manner.<br>
        <br>
        Accordingly, it is therefore an object of the present invention
        to provide an apparatus to stimulate the healing of living
        tissue through the use of aura therapy.<br>
        <br>
        These as well as other objects and advantages of the present
        invention will be better appreciated and understood upon reading
        the following detailed description of the presently preferred
        embodiment taking in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The general objective of the present invention is to provide a
        novel tool to aid in the determining the location of a
        malfunctioning area within the body. This is accomplished by
        using a means of photographing one's aura so that it remains as
        a permanent record, in such a manner, much like that of an
        X-ray. In addition, the present invention also provides for a
        novel apparatus to stimulate the therapeutic healing of the
        damaged living tissue.<br>
        <br>
        The aura is a representation of one's life force energy, which
        is an electrical field that surrounds the body. When an aura
        photograph is taken, there are spots of light that show up in
        front of the body, which are the energy centers where the nerves
        come together. An aura camera records the energy density at
        these energy center locations because there is more energy
        radiated from these points.<br>
        <br>
        When one's energy system becomes clogged, and part of the body
        stops functioning properly, it is not receiving the signals that
        it should and the aura will have a hole in it. Once the healing
        process is completed and the body healed, the aura becomes
        complete, where one once treated will feel good again.<br>
        <br>
        The colors associated with one's aura show the condition of
        one's body and reveal the location of the problematic condition.
        The aura is given by our body's energy, which some clairvoyants
        see and the aura camera shows as colors. In other words, the
        human body's energy is visible; the colors depend on the speed.
        The slower the energy, the stronger the color will be. For
        example, the slowest vibration is red and the fastest white.<br>
        <br>
        One can also combine the meaning of the aura colors with that of
        the chakra colors. Chakras are the energy centers in our body.
        If the energy is a certain color, it means that the attention is
        mainly centered in a certain part of the body. For example, if
        one vibrates in yellow, they are sensitive in the stomach area
        and the third chakra is open or opens up at this time; they may
        also be involved yellow themes like trying to be independent.<br>
        <br>
        Just taking a nice aura photo is not enough, the interpretation
        of an aura photo is the most important. To read an aura photo
        you have to consider it's many different parts: the shape of the
        aura, the energy positions and the color of the aura.<br>
        <br>
        Trained therapists can restore the electrical system of the body
        and open up the channels of energy that run through us. When
        part of our body becomes clogged or stagnant, it presents itself
        as pain in that area.<br>
        <br>
        An individual's aura also contains information of one's
        personality. It consists of the electricity spent that one's
        body has used in order to function. Spent electricity cannot be
        stored in an individual and it cannot be discharged into the
        ground, so when it is discharged into the air, it is referred to
        as the aura.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
          INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        In the past, the observation of the aura was only seen by
        clairvoyants, those who are sensitive in viewing emanations from
        the aura. It is now believed that the acquired skill of viewing
        the human aura occurred best when the clairvoyant was having an
        episode of epilepsy, migraine or other types of neurological
        disorders.<br>
        <br>
        A method of standardizing the viewing of the human aura was
        developed using Kirlian photography. Kirlian photography is a
        technique for photographing objects in the presence of a high
        frequency, high voltage, low current electrical field. The
        photographs of which show glowing, multicolored emanations are
        said to be auras or biofields.<br>
        <br>
        The principle of Kirlian photography and all electrography is
        the corona discharge phenomenon, which occurs when an
        electrically grounded object discharges a corona between itself
        and an electrode generating the electrical field. When the
        corona discharges are captured on film, they appear as coronas
        of light.<br>
        <br>
        Various Kirlian techniques have been developed, but the most
        basic uses a Tesla coil connected to a metal plate. The subject
        is typically in a darkened room, such a photographer's dark
        room, and a photographic film is placed adjacent or behind to
        the subject. The corona discharge produces illumination in the
        visible light spectrum that is captured on film.<br>
        <br>
        The Tesla coil that is employed is an air-core transformer that
        is used as a source of high-frequency power, such as for use
        with x-ray tubes. It was invented by Nikola Tesla, a prominent
        Serbian-born American electrical engineer and physicist who
        discovered the principles of alternating current in 1881 and
        invented numerous devices and procedures that were seminal to
        the development of radio and the harnessing of electricity. He
        was a pioneer in high-tension electricity. His many discoveries
        and inventions were of great value to the development of radio
        transmission and to the field of electricity, including an
        arc-lighting system, the Tesla induction motor, the Tesla coil,
        and various generators and transformers.<br>
        <br>
        The Tesla coil 100 is best illustrated by referring to the
        schematic drawing of FIG. 2. An input transformer 110 steps the
        applied voltage from 110 VAC to approximately 17,000 VAC.
        Immediately connected across the secondary is a glass-plate
        capacitor 120. The capacitor serves as an energy storage device,
        charging up to the voltage of the secondary of step-up
        transformer 110. When the instantaneous voltage exceeds the
        breakdown voltage of the air spark gap 130, current flows
        through the primary coil 140 (L1) of the air core transformer
        150. The discharging of capacitor is through the spark gap into
        the primary coil L1. The larger the capacitor, the greater the
        current flowing through L1. The resulting voltage appears across
        the secondary winding 150 (L2) of the air core transformer,
        which can range from 75,000 to 250,000 volts.<br>
        <br>
        Discharges across the spark gap produces extremely jagged and
        random pulses of power that are extremely rich in r.f.
        harmonics. The output voltage is maximum when the primary
        winding and capacitor are tuned to the resonant frequency of the
        secondary coil co-acting with its distributed capacitance (not
        shown). The corona discharge is available at terminal 160, where
        it can be observed usually in the violet region.<br>
        <br>
        The visible light spectrum ranges from 400 to 700 millimicrons.
        For example, the three primary colors differ in frequency; where
        red is between 610 and 700 millimicrons, green is between 500 to
        570, and blue, between 450 and 500.<br>
        <br>
        The visual effect that results is from the eye's ability to
        distinguish the different wavelengths or frequencies of light.
        The apparent color of an object depends on the wavelength of the
        light that it reflects. In white light, an opaque object that
        reflects all wavelengths appears white and one that absorbs all
        wavelengths appears black. Any three primary, or spectral,
        colors can be combined in various proportions to produce any
        other color sensation. Beams of light are combined "additively,"
        and red, blue, and green are typically chosen as primaries.<br>
        <br>
        It is known that the aura cannot be viewed directly by most
        persons, except for those whose are sensitive to these
        emanations, such as clairvoyants. As shown in FIG. 3, there
        numerous electromagnetic radiation's that cannot be directly
        observed; radio waves require r.f. receivers to be detected, as
        do microwave sensors and infrared sensors.<br>
        <br>
        Electromagnetic radiation is the result of the acceleration of a
        charged particle. It does not require a material medium, and can
        travel through a vacuum. In order of decreasing wavelength and
        increasing frequency, the various types of electromagnetic
        radiation are radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation,
        visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x rays, and gamma
        radiation. The possible sources of electromagnetic radiation are
        directly related to wavelength; long radio waves are produced by
        large antennas such as those used by broadcasting stations; much
        shorter visible light waves are produced by the motions of
        charges within atoms; the shortest waves, those of gamma
        radiation, result from changes within the nucleus of the atom.<br>
        <br>
        It is theorized that the wavelength of the aura may reside in
        the frequency domain within the gamma region or beyond. By using
        the Tesla coil in conjunction with the Kirlian photography, the
        harmonics generated by the Tesla coil combine in such a manner
        with one's aura to produce different frequencies that lie within
        the visible light spectrum, allowing the colored corona
        discharge to be photographed.<br>
        <br>
        Once the colored photograph of the aura is produced, trained
        technicians can effectively determine the nature of a
        malfunction should one be present.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention provides a novel tool to aid in the
        determining the location of a malfunctioning area within the
        body. This is accomplished by using a means of photographing
        one's aura so that it remains as a permanent record, in such a
        manner, much like that of an x-ray. In addition, the present
        invention also provides for a novel apparatus to stimulate the
        therapeutic healing of the damaged living tissue.<br>
        <br>
        The aura, once detected, shows one's life force energy, which is
        an electrical field that surrounds the body. When an aura
        photograph is taken, there are spots of light that show up in
        front of the body, which are the energy centers where the nerves
        come together. An aura camera records the energy density at
        these energy center locations because there is more energy
        radiated from these points.<br>
        <br>
        The colors associated with one's aura show the condition of
        one's body and reveal the location of the problematic condition.
        When the human body's energy become visible, the colors that are
        shown depend upon the speed. The slower the energy, the stronger
        the color will be. For example, the slowest vibration is red and
        the fastest white.<br>
        <br>
        One can also combine the meaning of the aura colors with that of
        the chakra colors. Chakras are the energy centers in our body.
        If the energy is a certain color, it means that the attention is
        mainly centered in a certain part of the body. For example, if
        one vibrates in yellow, they are sensitive in the stomach area
        and the third chakra is open or opens up at this time; they may
        also be involved yellow themes like trying to be independent.<br>
        <br>
        When one's energy system malfunctions, and a part of the body
        stops functioning properly, it is not receiving the signals that
        it should and the aura will have a hole in it. Once the healing
        process is completed and the body healed, the aura becomes
        complete, where one once treated will feel good again.<br>
        <br>
        Reading an aura photograph requires that it be interpreted as a
        whole, the combined area of it's many different parts: the shape
        of the aura, the energy positions and the color of the aura.<br>
        <br>
        Trained therapists can restore the electrical system of the body
        and open up the channels of energy that runs through us. When
        part of our body becomes clogged or stagnant, it presents itself
        as pain in that area.<br>
        <br>
        The electrical system of one's body can be modified by
        stimulating the healing process using the apparatus, as shown in
        FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B. The present invention is comprised of two
        low voltage direct current sources, each having opposite
        polarities, the current direction being controlled by a polarity
        switch. A conductive wire mesh electrode is placed within a
        distance of 2 to 12 inches above the area to be treated.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus performs by alternately charging and discharging
        the cells over periods time from 1 to 12 hours. The static
        charge is removed by an electric discharge that resulted from
        the accumulation of electric charge on an insulated body. The
        accumulated charge manifests itself in one's aura. The healing
        of a malfunctioning area can be stimulated by a plurality of
        polarity reversals in a therapeutic application.<br>
        <br>
        In a typical therapeutic session, the patient lies upon the
        conductive treatment surface plates 60 and 65. The conductive
        mesh electrode 50 is placed over the area to be treated, at a
        distance preferably ranging from 2 to 12 inches. The polarity
        switch 40 is maintained in the uppermost position for an elapsed
        period of approximately 15 minutes. During this interval the
        wire mesh 50 is connected to a negative direct current source,
        having a low potential. At the end of 15 minutes, the switch 40
        is toggled to its lower position, connecting a positive direct
        current source, having a low potential to the wire mesh
        electrode 60, again for a period of about 15 minutes. The
        revered sequence is repeated several times until the therapeutic
        session is completed.<br>
        <br>
        The placement of the electrode generally corresponds to one of
        the seven major areas that correspond to the chakra. The
        therapy, using the apparatus of the present invention, finds
        usefulness in soft tissue therapy; however it does not prove
        effective in the treatment of skeletal formations.<br>
        <br>
        In the preferred embodiment, the voltage sources 20 and 30 are
        10 "D" cell batteries, all connected in parallel. The voltage
        can range from the preferred 1.5 DC volts to about
        three-quarters of a volt. Treatment times can range from as
        little as one and one-quarter hour to as much as 12 hours of 6
        hours per session.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE USE OF THE CHAKRA IN
          DETERMINING PHYSICAL HEALTH</span><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
        <br>
        There are seven major chakras and hundreds of minor ones. In the
        aura the etheric, astral, and mental bodies are said to each
        have seven major chakras. The seven major etheric centers, which
        are most directly concerned with physical health, lie along the
        spinal column. Each is associated with a major endocrine gland,
        a major nerve plexus, a physiological function, and a psychic
        function. The higher the position along the spinal column, the
        more complex the chakra and the higher its functions.<br>
        <br>
        The chakras are connected to each other and to the body through
        the nadis, channels of subtle energy. There are thousands of
        nadis, of which three are the most important. The "sushumna,"
        the central channel, originates at the base of the spine and
        rises to the medulla oblongata at the base of the brain; it
        processes energy coming in from the etheric field. The "ida"and
        "pingala" also extend from the base of the spine to the brow and
        end at the left and right nostrils. They crisscross the sushumna
        in a spiral that resembles the shape of a caduceus. They wrap
        around, but do not penetrate the chakras, and are concerned with
        the outflow of energy.<br>
        <br>
        The universal life force is said to enter the aura through the
        chakra at the top of the head, and is filtered down to the other
        chakras, each of which transforms the energy into usable form
        for the functions it governs. When "kundalini," the universal
        life force, is aroused, it rises up the chakra system through
        the sushumna.<br>
        <br>
        Each chakra has its own coloration, number of petal "spokes,"
        and speed of vibration. When the chakras are balanced and
        healthy, their colors are clear and luminous and their rotation
        is smooth. In poor health they become cloudy and irregular or
        sluggish in rotation. Chakras that are blocked are believed to
        adversely influence the body functions they govern. In
        alternative healing there are techniques for clearing chakra
        blockages and stimulating rotation.<br>
        <br>
        The seven major etheric chakras are the root, the sacral, the
        solar plexus, the heart, the throat, the brow, and the crown:<br>
        <br>
        1. The root (muladhara) is located at the base of the spine and
        is the seat of kundalini. It is concerned with
        self-preservation, one's animal nature, taste, and smell. It is
        the least complex of the seven centers, divided by only four
        spokes. It is red in color.<br>
        <br>
        2. The sacral (svadhisthana) lies near the genitals and governs
        sexuality and reproduction. It has six spokes and is primarily
        orange. In some systems the root chakra is ascribed reproductive
        functions, and the sacral chakra is overlooked in favor of the
        spleen chakra, a rosy pink and yellow sun with six spokes
        located halfway between the pubis and navel. It influences
        overall health and in particular governs digestion and functions
        of the liver, pancreas, and spleen. The spleen chakra is seen as
        minor in other systems.<br>
        <br>
        3. The solar plexus (manipura) rests just above the navel. It
        has ten spokes and is predominantly yellow. It is associated
        with the emotions, and is the point where astral energy enters
        the etheric field. The solar plexus affects the adrenals,
        pancreas, liver, and stomach. Most trance mediums work through
        this chakra.<br>
        <br>
        4. The heart (anahata) has twelve glowing golden petals and is
        located midway between the shoulder blades, in the center of the
        chest, where the color green predominates. It governs the thymus
        gland and influences immunity to disease. It is linked to higher
        consciousness and unconditional love.<br>
        <br>
        5. The throat (vishuddha) is a sixteen spoke wheel of silvery
        blue that is associated with creativity and self-expression and
        the search for truth. It is prominent in musicians, singers,
        composers, and public speakers. This chakra also influences the
        thyroid and parathyroid glands and metabolism, and is associated
        with certain states of expanded consciousness.<br>
        <br>
        6. The brow (ajna), located between the eyebrows, is called the
        third eye for its influence over psychic sense and spiritual
        enlightenment. It has ninety-six spokes, half of which radiate a
        yellow-rose color and half of which radiate a violet color in
        blue and purple. This chakra is associated with the pituitary
        gland the pineal gland, intelligence intuition, and psychic
        powers, called siddhis in Hindu yoga.<br>

        7. The crown (sahasrara) whirls just above the top of the head.
        Its 972 spokes radiate a glowing white. It is not associated
        with any glands, but reveals the individual's level of conscious
        evolution. The crown cannot be activated until all the other
        chakras are refined and balanced; when activated it brings
        supreme enlightenment and cosmic consciousness. While other
        chakras rotate in slight depressions, the crown chakra whirls in
        a dome. In religious art deities saints, and mystics are
        portrayed with radiant crown chakras in the form of halos or
        domed headdresses.<br>
