      </b><br>
      ...It is likely that it was on one of his sailing trips in the
      waters around Veere that Platz got the idea of converting sailboat
      aerodynamics into sailplane ones. He knew that the course of a
      sloop-rigged sailing boat can, within certain limits, be
      controlled by hauling in or paying out the jib sail. He simply
      transposed the sail-plan of a sloop into the horizontal plane,
      doubled up to form a symmetrical shape and hypothesized that, like
      in his sloop, the angle of the two jib sails (the canard, we might
      say) would control the angle of attack of the main sails.<br>
      <br>
      To try this out, he cut out the planform of his invention from
      paper, and weighed the nose with a paperclip. It turned out to fly
      beautifully, and very stable too; and not only could the angle of
      attack be controlled by varying the jibs, but they also could be
      set to turn, when one was tilted upward more than the other. In
      fact, while a normal rudder would function only with sufficient
      horizontal speed, the "jib rudder" works even if the model is
      released without any forward speed at all.<br>
      <br>
      As the paper model had shown his theory worked, Platz built a
      model of his envisioned glider, with a wing span of 1,30 m. and 40
      cm² surface. This model was tested from the dunes between
      Vlissingen and Koudekerke, to find the right settings for the
      jibs, and to adjust the centre of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      In November 1922 the model soared for some time along an 8 m. high
      stretch of dune. Before building the final thing, still a lager
      model was built to make sure of some details. This model had 2,50
      m. wingspan and 1,30 m² surface. While the smaller model still had
      rigid wing surfaces, this time the sails had been made from cloth,
      and it had to be checked whether they would billow into the
      desired airfoil shape...<br>
      <br>
      Though unbattoned, the larger model flew well; like the small one,
      it could soar the dune lift band and stay at altitude for some
      time. So finally, back at the Fokker factory the definitive glider
      was made. It measured 6,60 m. span, 16 m² surface, and tethered
      loading with a 100 kg man had proven the structure generated
      sufficient lift.<br>
      <br>
      A close look at the photographs reveals that, between the tethered
      tests and the free flights, somehow a correction had been made to
      the jib assembly. Not only has the upturned front part of the keel
      been cut down some, but the jib sail seems to hinge on a point
      behind the leading edge. Of course, originally the pilot had been
      supporting a certain percentage of the lift with his hands; by
      moving the hinge point back, the force needed to hold the control
      surfaces in position could be largely diminished. Finally, the
      glider was considered safe enough for free flight. On a day in
      February 1923, on the Dutch coast near Vlissingen, the glider
      soared for some time along the dunes.<br>
      <br>
      The glider weighed 40 kg; quite heavy for nowadays standards, but
      then, the materials were canvas sails, wooden booms and some iron
      hardware. Even though, it may well have been one of the lightest
      gliders for years; and surely it was the very first with a
      cantilever wing!<br>
      <br>
      To ensure directional stability and to do away with a tailfin,
      which due to the absence of adverse yaw did not require a rudder
      anyway, Platz had chosen to give the structure quite a lot of
      dihedral. On the model gliders this had proven to work well.<br>
      <br>
      The keel construction (no hang glider keel ever deserved that name
      more than this one!) was a bent iron tube at front, with a wooden
      boom stuck into it for the aft end; at the junction, two butts of
      tube were welded on at right angles, to stick the wooden wing
      booms into.<br>
      <br>
      The only moving part of the glider was the connection of the jib
      sails. They had a pivoting anchor point at the front end of the
      keel, and the aft ends were hand held by way of controls. Surely,
      compared to early Rogallo hang gliders which measured up to 20 m²,
      the wing surface of 16 m² was quite small; especially considering
      the tips were very pointed, like on the first Rogallos, and thus
      must have been quite ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      However, with his canard wing, there was no need for Rogallo wing
      billow, rather, as in the sailing boats that inspired the concept,
      he had every reason to make the sail as tight as possible, as the
      pictures show. This, of course, is an advantage over early Rogallo
      type wings.<br>
      <br>
      The Platz glider of 1923 in the photo was the subject of some
      great scheming, planning, and dreams of mine about a year or two
      ago. I was just absolutely certain that I wanted to build one, and
      hordes of great thoughts came rolling along... carbon fiber tubes
      making the whole thing weigh 70 pounds... powered paraglider
      backpack engine on the pilot... being able to market the world's
      simplest rigid ultralight.<br>
      <br>
      With my first 16 inch span free flight stick and tissue model I
      found out the same thing that Reinhold Platz found out in 1923, it
      doesn't fly well at all. I rigged up a trim system in which you
      could position the canards (jibs in sailboat speak) in any
      position to trim the thing for level flight. That barely worked,
      but was manageable.<br>
      <br>
      When I tried to use the differential position of the canard/jibs
      to make it turn, the little glider would have no part of it! Even
      a 20-25 degree differential angle on the canards made almost NO
      difference, and it droned along in a straight line into the
      nearest wall. This insurmountable problem occurred with and
      without the micro electric motor and propeller.<br>
      <br>
      All I can suspect is that the mild turning force of the canards
      (when positioned at a differential angle) was completely offset by
      either adverse yaw, or the drag of closing off one aerodynamic
      "slot" between the canard and main wing. It was the equivalent of
      a car going in a straight line with the driver madly turning the
      wheel one way and another, with the front wheels turning one way
      and another, and making no difference to the trajectory at all.<br>
      <br>
      The problem is fix-able, if anyone out there wants to build a
      Platz Glider, but it will not be an accurate replica. You need a
      movable vertical rudder, that is attached to the control system.
      You'll need to rig it up with a stick that moves the rudder left
      and right, and then moves the canards up and down equally like an
      airplane's elevator. I strongly suspect that this would make it
      flyable and controllable, however it will not be a three axis
      control.<br>
      <br>
      It does not matter what that book's caption, or anyone else's
      hopes and dreams claimed the Platz Glider configuration is not
      controllable with the minimalist canard grips alone, as cool as
      that might have been.<br>
      <br>
      Platz' more successful designs all had rudders, and were noted for
      their excellent maneuverability and controllability. His Fokker
      D-VII was the only aircraft so feared and respected by the enemy
      (Allies) that they were specifically ordered to be turned over at
      the end of WW1 as part of the armistice.<br>

      The Platz glider was a very simple, though unusual, collapsible
      canard glider designed and tested in Germany in the early 1920s.
      The Platz glider predated the well known Rogallo designs by over
      two decades. But in the same decade of the 1920s was a device that
      had also a high second deck: the Argabrite man-carrying device
      that featured a triangle undercarriage with wheels on the
      basebar.[1][2]<br>
      <br>
      The Platz glider was intended to provide a cheap, easily
      transported, and simple to fly introduction to the increasingly
      popular sport. <br>
      <br>
      Platz recalled sailing a sloop rigged boat, which had been very
      stable upwind and capable of maintaining its course without rudder
      input. He reasoned that the same stability he saw in that boat
      might be achieved by a similarly rigged glider with a small
      forewing and a larger rear plane. Just as the sloop could be
      controlled by adjusting its jib, the glider could be controlled by
      foreplane trimming. After some preliminary experiments with simple
      paper models, Platz designed the one-man canard glider which was
      then named after him.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The Platz glider was built around a central, two part boom. A
      curved, circular cross-section steel tube reached from the nose at
      least as far aft as the welded sockets which received the ends of
      the main wing spars. A solid, circular section wood beam was
      inserted into this steel tube, extending it rearwards.[5] The wing
      spars were also circular, solid and wooden, set with strong
      dihedral which took their tips to the height of the extreme nose
      so that the foreplanes, elevators or jibs could be attached
      between these three points. Their inner trailing edges were
      directly controlled by the pilot, who sat over the central
      beam-wing spar joint. They were initially hinged together at their
      leading edges, but later the hinge point was moved rearwards
      towards the aerodynamic centre to reduce pilot load and separated
      only behind the hinge. Since there were no ribs, the airfoil was
      determined by the airflow and the pilot, as for the sloop's jib.
      The main wing, a single surface stretched between the spars and
      the extreme tail, also had its camber determined by the airflow,
      like the mainsail of the sloop.[5][6] Both wing sheets were
      produced by sewing together narrow strips of material; the
      longitudinal joints between them are prominent in some back lit,
      better quality images.[5][7]<br>
      <br>
      The Platz could be disassembled into a 3,300 mm (130 in) × 350 mm
      (14 in) × 250 mm (10 in) pack, weighing 40 kg (88 lb) in fifteen
      minutes and reassembled in ten.[5] Transport by bicycle, with
      care, was possible.[6]<br>
      <br>
      First flight &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;February 1923. Free flight trials
      began without pilots and with increasing loads (up to 75 kg (165
      lb)) into strengthening wind and eventually over sandhills as high
      as 25 m (82 ft). With a pilot in place, the glider was then flown
      tethered like a kite. Several people, with weights up to 100 kg
      (220 lb) flew it this way, all reporting that forewing control
      loads were low. In February 1923 it was free flown in a moderate
      wind over 10 m (33 ft) dunes. Platz decided that the dunes did not
      provide usable soaring, their next goal, after which the
      experiments would end. He noted that, whilst his design could not
      compete with the best conventional gliders, it had met the initial
      targets outlined above and thought it or something similar would
      be of great value, seemingly content to leave others to judge his
      design.<br>

          <br>
        </b></div>
      A person, close connected to the pre 1930 era of the Fokker
      company was Reinhold Platz. He was born january 16th, 1886 at
      Cottbus in the province of Brandenburg. Being a welder of
      profession, he went to Fokker at Johannisthal in 1912, and built
      the first welded steel tube ‘Spin’ fuselage. After the death of
      Martin Kreutzer in 1916, Fokker’s designer of the D.I to D.V, he
      became the chief designer at the Fokker Works at Schwerin. Platz
      was not an educated designer, like for instance Dr. Hugo Junkers,
      but neither was Fokker himself. They both were man from the
      practice, and together they made a strong team. Fokker, who had
      the ideas, and Platz, who made them work. This was during World
      War I, a time when things happened fast in aviation. Creating a
      new design was not always done on paper, at the Fokker Works, and
      drawings were not always available. For instance, when Albatros
      had to build D.VII’s under license, they received a D.VII as
      example, and no drawings. After the war, Platz worked for Fokker,
      first at Schwerin, and later at Amsterdam. He stayed there until
      1931. There has been much said about Fokker and Platz. The name of
      Platz appears only once in Fokker’s autobiography /‘The Flying
      Dutchman’,/ and then only as /‘the manager who has been working
      with me for 15 years’/ (translated from the Dutch version). In
      /‘Fokker, the creative years’/, by A.R. Weyl, it is stated that
      Fokker on purpose held Platz in the background, that Fokker
      himself had nothing to do with the designs made, like the Dr.I and
      D.VII. These statements can not be true. As stated above, Fokker
      and Platz were a team. But, Fokker was the one in charge. When
      Platz left Fokker in 1931, he /‘had no reason either
      professionally nor financially to be discontented’/, as said by
      Fokker’s Dutch Manager B. Stephan, and can be read in /‘Fokker,
      the man and the aircraft’/ by H. Hegener. Reinhold Platz died in
      Ahrensburg on September 15, 1966. <br>

          <br>
        </b></div>
      The Plutz, designed by Chee Wan Leong is a kite that I started
      seeing just in the last year, and has now been adapted to the new
      Prism Zero-G under license. This type of kite has a very unique
      kind of structure that gives it an interesting feel compared to
      other gliders. Having flown a Plutz on a rod, I noticed that the
      kite has a fantastic glide, and it will turn very easily. The way
      this kite flies, can be very nice and smooth, but it also has a
      unique characteristic where it almost flies in straight lines,
      while making sharp corners, sort of like flying a box with a sport
      kite. This is something I had never seen in a glider before...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Zero-G, per the Prism website:</b><br>
      Conceived in collaboration with celebrated Malaysian designer
      Ceewan, the Zero G concept was inspired by Reinhold Platz, chief
      designer for the Fokker Aircraft Company after WW1. Decades before
      the modern hang glider, he built and flew a full-scale
      canard-winged craft that folded up to carry on a bicycle. With
      small wings in front, the canard configuration allows a virtually
      stall-proof glider that will float eerily in a level attitude even
      when it’s barely flying forward. A clever dynamic bridle adjusts
      the angle of the forward wings in flight according to the tension
      on the line, allowing the kite to behave as a kite under tension
      and a glider whenever the line is released.<br>
