      <div align="center"><b>P&amp;G Water Purification Kit</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      P&amp;G sachets are now centrally produced in Pakistan, and sold
      to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worldwide at a cost of
      3.5 US cents per sachet.<br>
      <br>
      The P&amp;G product is a small sachet containing powdered ferric
      sulfate (a flocculant) and calcium hypochlorite (a disinfectant).<br>
      <br>
      P&amp;G was designed to reverse-engineer a water treatment plant,
      incorporating the multiple barrier processes of removal of
      particles and disinfection.<br>
      <br>
      To treat water with P&amp;G, users open the sachet, add the
      contents to an open bucket containing 10 liters of water, stir for
      5 minutes, let the solids settle to the bottom of the bucket,
      strain the water through a cotton cloth into a second container,
      and wait 20 minutes for the hypochlorite to inactivate the
      microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lab Effectiveness, Field Effectiveness, and Health Impact</b><br>
      <br>
      The flocculant/disinfectant powder P&amp;G has been proven to
      remove the vast majority of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, even
      in highly turbid waters.<br>
      <br>
      P&amp;G has also been documented to reduce diarrheal disease from
      90% to less than 16% incidence in five randomized, controlled
      health intervention studies. P&amp;G also removes heavy metals —
      such as arsenic — and chemical contaminants — such as pesticides —
      from water.<br>
      <br>
      Studies showing the efficacy of P&amp;G have been conducted for
      highly turbid water in the laboratory, in developing countries, in
      rural and urban areas, refugee camps, and include all age groups.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Benefits, Drawbacks, and Appropriateness</b><br>
      <br>
      The benefits of Flocculant/Disinfectant Powder are:<br>
      <br>
      Proven reduction of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa in water<br>
      Removal of heavy metals and chemicals<br>
      Increased free chlorine protection against contamination<br>
      Proven reduction of diarrheal disease<br>
      Visual improvement of water and acceptability<br>
      Transport of sachets easy<br>
      Long shelf life of sachets<br>
      <br>
      The drawbacks of Flocculant/Disinfectant Powder are:<br>
      <br>
      Multiple steps are necessary—requires training or demonstration<br>
      Requires a lot of equipment (2 buckets, cloth, and a stirrer)<br>
      The higher relative cost per liter of water treated (than drinking
      raw water)<br>
      <br>
      P&amp;G is most appropriate in areas with a consistent supply
      chain for sachet resupply and in urban, rural, and emergency
      situations when educational messages can reach users to encourage
      correct and consistent use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Implementation Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Social marketing organizations, such as the NGO Population
      Services International, sell P&amp;G sachets in multiple
      countries.<br>
      <br>
      Local organizations use the socially marketed P&amp;G sachets in
      their own programming to provide safe drinking water. In western
      Kenya, students in schools are taught how and why to use P&amp;G,
      and safe water clubs treat drinking water for all the students.
      Also in Kenya, HIV self-help groups sell P&amp;G sachets and
      storage containers as an income-generating activity.<br>
      <br>
      P&amp;G sachets have been widely used to respond to emergencies –
      from the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia to flooding in Haiti to cholera
      epidemics in Africa.<br>
      <br>
      The Procter &amp; Gamble Children’s Safe Drinking Water program
      has been given numerous awards, including the Ron Brown
      Presidential Award for Corporate Leadership in 2007, the EPA
      Children’s Health Excellence Award in 2007, the Grainger Challenge
      Bronze Award in 2007, and the Stockholm Industry Water Award in
      2005.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Economics and Scalability</b><br>
      <br>
      Each sachet of P&amp;G is provided to global emergency relief
      organizations or non-governmental organizations at a cost of 3.5
      US cents, not including shipping from Pakistan by ocean container.<br>
      <br>
      Transport, distribution, education, and community motivation can
      add significantly to program costs.<br>
      <br>
      Sachets are generally sold "retail" at product cost recovery for
      10 US cents each, for a cost of 1 US cent per liter treated.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, P&amp;G projects operate either on partial cost
      recovery (charging the user only for the product, and subsidizing
      program costs with donor funds), or fully subsidized free
      distribution such as in emergency situations. Procter &amp; Gamble
      sells the P&amp;G sachets at cost, makes no profits on P&amp;G
      sales, and donates programmatic funding to some projects.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      [CAPE TOWN] A sachet, the size of a fast-food ketchup packet, has
      proved effective in reducing diarrhoea in children by killing
      water-based germs and improving the safety of drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      The sachet has purified more than six billion litres of water in
      about 70 developing countries, saving more than 32,000 lives,
      according to a report presented at the 246th meeting of the
      American Chemical Society in the United States on 8 September.<br>
      <br>
      According to the WHO, around 760,000 children die yearly around
      the world from diarrhoea and developing countries are the most
      affected.<br>
      <br>
      "The water purifying sachet is designed to allow people to treat
      and drink water from a variety of sources such as open ponds,
      rivers and piped water that may not be safe to drink due to
      contamination and at low cost," says Allison Tummon Kamphuis,
      programme manager of the P&amp;G Children's Safe Drinking Water
      (CSDW), a US-based non-profit organisation of Procter &amp;
      Gamble.<br>
      <br>
      CSDW sells a packet at US$10 cents to non-profit organisations and
      humanitarian partners such as Population Services International,
      CARE International, Save the Children and World Vision.<br>
      <br>
      Kamphuis adds that five clinical studies have shown that its use
      can reduce diarrhoeal illness in children aged less than five
      years by an average of 50 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      The sachet, also called P&amp;G purifier of water, uses a water
      treatment chemical ferric sulphate to remove water contaminants
      and a calcium hypochlorite disinfectant to kill bacteria and
      viruses. Both chemicals are approved by the WHO.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment process involves pouring powdered contents of one
      packet — which weighs less than an ounce — into a bucket of 10
      litres of water, which is then stirred, allowed to settle and
      poured into a clean container.<br>
      <br>
      "When used as directed, the P&amp;G purifier of water removes 99
      per cent of bacteria, viruses, and cysts," Kamphuis tells
      SciDev.Net. <br>
      <br>
      The mini-water treatment plant in a packet was launched in 2004 in
      Haiti and Uganda and has so far been distributed through partners
      in 70 developing countries, including the Democratic Republic of
      Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya,
      Malawi, Mexico, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Rwanda, South
      Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.<br>
      <br>
      "Such innovative solutions are instrumental in helping people in
      Sub-Saharan Africa who do not have access to clean drinking
      water," says Nico Elema, the regional programme manager at the
      NEPAD's Southern African Network of Water Centres of Excellence at
      Stellenbosch University, South Africa<br>
      <br>
      "The networks for water such as the African Ministers' Council on
      Water could influence policies on water purification and are in an
      ideal position to act as a catalyst in providing clean water to
      millions of people," Elema tells SciDev.Net.<br>

      <br>
      More than 2,000 children die every day from diseases caused by
      unsafe drinking water. To help address this, P&amp;G developed
      P&amp;G Purifier of Water in collaboration with the U.S. Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). P&amp;G Purifier of
      Water is a small sachet of powdered ingredients that make
      contaminated water potable through coagulation and disinfection.
      It uses the same approach and ingredients as many municipal
      water-treatment facilities — the two primary components are ferric
      sulfate, a well known and widely used coagulant, and calcium
      hypochlorite, a disinfectant. Through extensive lab and field
      testing, the technical efficacy of this product has been
      demonstrated to be robust, as judged by its ability to eliminate
      turbidity, chlorine-resistant parasites, viruses, bacteria and
      pollutants like arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      Five clinical studies were conducted with the CDC and Johns
      Hopkins Univ. to prove the product’s efficacy. These studies,
      involving more than 26,000 people, were conducted in four
      different countries and in a broad range of settings. They looked
      predominately at the reduction in the incidence of diarrhea when
      people were provided water treated with PUR Purifier of Water
      (compared to their normal habits). The results of these studies
      showed that the P&amp;G packets were highly effective and led to
      an average 50% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea and up to
      90% reduction.<br>
      <br>
      P&amp;G Purifier of Water has been distributed on a not-for-profit
      basis since 2004 through P&amp;G’s philanthropic effort called the
      Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program (CSDW).<br>
      <br>
      Since 2004, P&amp;G and our CSDW partners have provided more than
      500 million sachets — enough to purify 5 billion liters of water.
      Efforts in this area are continuing, and P&amp;G has committed to
      saving one life every hour in the developing world by delivering
      more than 2 billion liters of clean drinking water each year by
      2020. <br>
      <br>
      According to the World Health Organization, safe drinking water is
      one of the world's greatest needs and a problem for more than 1
      billion people. An estimated 2,000 children die each day because
      of diarrheal diseases. In fact, more children die from diarrhea
      than from HIV/AIDS and malaria combined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Development</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      P&amp;G Health Sciences Institute scientists have been researching
      ways to purify drinking water since 1995. Much of this work has
      been in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC). This research has led to the development and
      testing of an affordable and simple-to-use in-home water
      purification product, P&amp;G Purifier of Water. This product
      visually clarifies the water and reduces pathogenic bacteria,
      viruses, and parasites to result in drinking water that meets
      World Health Organization guidelines for potability and U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for microbiologic
      water purifiers. The World Health Organization’s guidelines for
      evaluating household water treatment considers P&amp;G packets as
      a “protective” technology given its capabilities in killing
      bacteria and viruses and removing chlorine-resistant parasites. <br>

      <br>
      <b>Objectives</b><br>
      <br>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of point of use water treatment with
      flocculent-disinfectant on reducing diarrhea and the additional
      benefit of promoting hand washing with soap.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      The study was conducted in squatter settlements of Karachi,
      Pakistan, where diarrhea is a leading cause of childhood death.
      Interventions were randomly assigned to 47 neighbourhoods.
      Households in 10 neighbourhoods received diluted bleach and a
      water vessel; nine neighbourhoods received soap and were
      encouraged to wash hands; nine neighbourhoods received
      flocculent-disinfectant water treatment and a water vessel; 10
      neighbourhoods received disinfectant-disinfectant water treatment
      and soap and were encouraged to wash hands; and nine
      neighbourhoods were followed as controls. Field workers visited
      households at least once a week from April to December 2003 to
      promote use of the interventions and to collect data on diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      Study participants in control neighbourhoods had diarrhea on 5.2%
      of days. Compared to controls, participants living in intervention
      neighbourhoods had a lower prevalence of diarrhea: 55% (95% CI
      17%, 80%) lower in bleach and water vessel neighbourhoods, 51%
      (95% CI 12%, 76%) lower in hand washing promotion with soap
      neighbourhoods, 64% lower (95% CI 29%, 90%) in
      disinfectant-disinfectant neighbourhoods, and 55% (95% CI 18%,
      80%) lower in disinfectant-disinfectant plus hand washing with
      soap neighbourhoods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      With an intense community-based intervention and supplies provided
      free of cost, each of the home-based interventions significantly
      reduced diarrhea. There was no benefit by combining hand washing
      promotion with water treatment.<br>

      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Communicable diseases are of particular concern in conflict and
      disaster-affected populations that reside in camp settings. In the
      acute emergency phase, diarrheal diseases have accounted for more
      than 40% of deaths among camp residents. Clear limitations exist
      in current water treatment technologies, and few products are
      capable of treating turbid water. We describe the findings of a
      12-week effectiveness study of point-of-use water treatment with a
      flocculant–disinfectant among 400 households in camps for
      displaced populations in Monrovia, Liberia. In intervention
      households, point-of-use water treatment with the
      flocculant–disinfectant plus improved storage reduced diarrhea
      incidence by 90% and prevalence by 83%, when compared with control
      households with improved water storage alone. Among the
      intervention group, residual chlorine levels met or exceeded
      Sphere standards in 85% (95% CI: 83.1–86.8) of observations with a
      95% compliance rate. (link to study)<br>

      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An estimated two-thirds of all tubewells placed in Bangladesh to
      provide safer sources of drinking water may be contaminated with
      harmful levels of arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objective</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of treating arsenic contaminated
      tubewell water with a point-of-use flocculent-disinfectant for
      reducing exposure to arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methodology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The study was conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh. We provided the
      flocculent-disinfectant to 105 households drawing their drinking
      water from tubewells contaminated with &gt;50 ppb arsenic
      (determined by a rapid field test) for 12 weeks. One woman in each
      household was taught how to treat tubewell water and was
      instructed to drink treated water only. Drinking water and spot
      urine samples were collected at baseline and 2, 5, 9 and 12 weeks
      after intervention. Drinking water was analysed for total arsenic,
      and spot urines for the sum of arsenite, arsenate,
      monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid (total urinary
      arsenic) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The mean baseline arsenic concentration in tubewell water was 162
      ppb. The mean total urinary arsenic concentration at baseline was
      439 ug/g creatinine. Following initiation of the intervention,
      arsenic concentrations in drinking water decreased by a mean of
      138 ppb (85%); 88% met the Bangladesh standard of &lt;50 ppb.
      Urinary arsenic concentrations decreased by a mean of 163 ug/g
      creatinine (37%).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The flocculent-disinfectant markedly reduced arsenic levels in
      tubewell water and, to a lesser extent, urinary arsenic in women
      who consumed treated water. The lesser reduction in urine arsenic
      may be a result of continued exposure (through untreated drinking
      water, other dietary or environmental sources), or metabolic
      factors.<br>

      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The continued prevalence of diarrheal disease in Bangladesh, along
      with arsenic contamination of tubewells, emphasizes the urgent
      need for innovative, practical strategies to provide safe drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objective</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To evaluate the efficacy of a combined flocculent-disinfectant
      point-of-use water treatment for improving the quality and
      microbial safety of surface pond water in rural Bangladesh.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methodology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water from 35 surface ponds in Matlab, Bangladesh was collected
      and treated with the flocculent-disinfectant three times, at one
      month intervals. Samples collected before and after treatment were
      analysed for faecal coliforms by a membrane filtration technique
      using filter coliform agar. Water samples were classified as
      potable if they met the WHO bacterial guideline of &lt;1 CFU/100
      ml faecal coliform. Free chlorine levels were measured 30 minutes
      after treatment. Turbidity was measured with a portable turbidity
      meter. Since the samples were from surface water, arsenic levels
      were not evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prior to treatment, all samples (n=101) were non-potable, and were
      contaminated with a mean of 2.9x104 CFU/100 ml faecal coliforms.
      Turbidity ranged from 6-92 NTU, with a mean of 32 NTU. Following
      treatment, 97 (96%) samples met the potability guideline.
      Treatment resulted in a mean 87% reduction in turbidity (mean 4
      NTU) with 93% of the samples meeting the WHO turbidity guideline
      of &lt;5 NTU. Free chlorine was detected in 83% of the samples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Following treatment with the flocculent-disinfectant, 96% of the
      surface pond water samples met the WHO bacterial potability
      guideline. Samples showed markedly improved clarity. This strategy
      may be useful in programs for improving the quality and safety of
      drinking water.<br>

      <br>
      In many areas of the world, drinking water sources are highly
      contaminated and not suitable for direct human consumption. While
      numerous studies have been conducted on viral removal by
      coagulation and viral inactivation by free chlorine applied in an
      aqueous form, there is little information on the use of a
      coagulant in combination with a slow release disinfection scheme.
      This study evaluated the viral inactivation/removal effectiveness
      of a metal coagulant combined with granular slow-release chlorine.
      One L samples of 1mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) or surface water were
      seeded with purified preparations of MS2 bacteriophage, poliovirus
      type 1 (PV1), and feline calicivirus (FCV). Viral stock solutions
      were purified by 100 kD ultrafiltration to reduce chlorine demand
      and viral aggregates disassociated by 0.1 micron filtration.
      Portions of the coagulant/chlorine product were added to
      virus-containing water samples and mixed constantly at 80 RPM for
      5 m. Free chlorine and viral samples were collected and assayed by
      colorimetric titration and cell culture, respectively, at T=0, 10
      seconds(s), 20 s, 30 s, 45 s, 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 15 m, and 30 m. The
      correlation between free chlorine concentration, viral
      inactivation/removal and time was evaluated. The slow-release
      chlorine resulted in a free chorine concentration ranging from 0.8
      mg/L after 10 to 20 s to a peak of approximately 1.2 to 2mg/L
      after 2 minutes. On average, 0.5-1 log of MS2 was inactivated
      within 10 s, 1.5-3 logs after 45 s and 4-5 logs after 5 minutes.
      Two to 3 logs of PV1 and FCV were inactivated after 10 s and 5
      logs after 45 s. High levels of viral inactivation were observed
      during mixing prior to the settling of the formed floc. In
      summary, the utilization of slow-release chlorine resulted in high
      levels of free chlorine (&gt;1 mg/L) being present in treated
      water for extended periods of time. Although free chlorine
      concentration in the water can be variable due to water quality,
      the levels obtained were sufficient to inactivate 5 logs of
      different viruses within 2 minutes. Data also showed that MS2 was
      more resistant to chlorine than both PV1 and FCV, and can be a
      conservative indicator for viral inactivation.<br>

      In areas of the world where surface water is used for drinking
      there is a need to remove suspended solids including silt and
      bacteria. A flocculating agent has been developed that
      accomplishes this and requires little equipment.<br>
      <br>
      The flocculating agent (PUR)® developed by Procter and Gamble is a
      powder contained in a single use sachet that is added to 10 litres
      of raw water with agitation. After flocculation and precipitation,
      the water is filtered through a cloth to remove the remaining
      precipitate. Hypochlorite is incorporated in the flocculating
      agent to act as a disinfectant. We examined the ability of PUR® to
      remove toxin-producing cyanobacteria from water and see if the
      toxins were present in the cleared water. Four cyanobacteria were
      used: Microcystis producing microcystin, Cylindrospermopsis
      producing cylindrospermopsisn, Anabaena producing anatoxin and
      Aphanizominon producing saxitoxin. The density of the cell
      suspensions used corresponded to a heavy bloom. Two flocculations
      were required to remove all of the cells. Free chlorine
      concentration fell rapidly to undetectable concentration during
      the first flocculation and was usually less than 0.5 ppm after the
      second. Cyanotoxin concentrations were determined in the
      suspension (lysed cells plus medium), the medium only and in the
      treated water after the first and second flocculations. Anatoxin-a
      was reduced to about 60% of the levels present in the cells and
      medium after the second flocculation while microcystin
      concentrations were reduced to less than 5%. Cylindrospermopsin,
      which is readily released by the cells, was reduced to
      undetectable levels only after the second flocculation. Saxitoxin
      was reduced to less than 10% after the second flocculation. PUR is
      capable of rapidly removing cyanobacteria from water, does not
      cause a release of toxins from the cells during the flocculation
      process and does reduce the concentration of toxins both by the
      removal of cells and presumably by adsorption. The treated water
      is acceptable for drinking.<br>

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to treatment of water and
      more particularly to kits for purifying water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] There is a need for potable water in all areas of the
      world. In developed countries, water is purified and potable water
      is supplied on a large scale, typically by large national or
      multinational water management companies. This water is typically
      supplied directly to consumers' homes in a potable form. However,
      in some parts of the world, for example in some rural areas of
      developing countries, many people either do not have a direct
      water supply to their homes and only have access to a non-potable
      communal water supply such as a village well, or cannot be
      guaranteed that the water they do receive is potable.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is known to produce potable water using a flocculent
      composition. Flocculent is mixed with the source water, typically
      a number of times, until large particles ("flocs") are coagulated
      that include various contaminants. These particles are then
      removed from the treated water, for example by pouring the water
      through a filtering material, to produce purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The kits available to date which purify water in this
      manner have been crude. Typically they consist of a flocculent
      composition and a cloth. Two basic containers, such as buckets,
      are typically supplied by the consumer. The flocculent is mixed
      with water in the first bucket until ready. The cloth is then
      typically held by hand over the second bucket. The treated water
      is poured from the first bucket through the cloth and into the
      second bucket. Clean water is then drawn or poured from the second
      bucket as needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Prior kits suffer from a number of shortcomings. One is
      that the floc filtering arrangement is not effective or easy to
      use. Another is that chlorine produced by flocculent treatment
      remains in the water, which has an undesirable taste. Another
      shortcoming is that the buckets are not convenient to use.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, there is a need for a water purification kit
      that produces potable, clean and good tasting water quickly and
      efficiently, and that is easy to use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] In one aspect of the invention, a water purification kit
      comprises a first container, a second container, a water
      purification composition, a filter holder, and a filter. The first
      container is for receiving untreated water, and the second
      container is for receiving purified water. The water purification
      composition, when mixed with water in the first container,
      produces partially purified water having solid matter. The filter
      holder is supported by the second container, and the filter is
      held in the filter holder. Purified water is obtained by pouring
      the partially purified water from the first container, through the
      filter and filter holder, and into the second container, thereby
      removing the solid matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another aspect of the invention, a water purification
      kit comprises a water purification composition, a first filter and
      a second filter. The water purification composition, when
      contacted with water, produces partially purified water having
      solid matter. The first filter is capable of removing the solid
      matter when the partially purified water is passed through it. The
      second filter comprises carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another aspect of the invention, a water purification
      kit comprises a first container, a second container, a water
      purification composition, a first filter and a second filter. The
      first container is for receiving untreated water, and the second
      container is for receiving purified water. The second container
      has a spigot for dispensing purified water. The water purification
      composition, when mixed with water in the first container,
      produces partially purified water having solid matter. The first
      filter is held proximate an upper end of the second container and
      is for removing the solid matter when the partially purified water
      is poured from the first container into the second container. A
      second filter in the second container comprises carbon.
      Optionally, the second filter is located proximate an outlet of
      the second container such that purified water passes through the
      second filter just prior to exiting the spigot. Also optionally,
      the second filter is sealingly held between upper and lower
      chambers of the second container such that purified water passes
      from the first chamber, through the second filter, and into the
      second chamber, from which purified water is dispensed.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Other aspects of the invention, including methods of using
      a kit, are apparent from the detailed description below.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0019] First Embodiment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] A first embodiment of a water purification kit will be
      described with reference to FIGS. 1-3. Referring in particular to
      FIG. 1, kit 10 includes first container 20, filter 30, filter
      holder 40 and second container 60, and a stirring implement 61.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] First container 20 is for mixing a water treatment
      ("flocculent") composition. It is preferably 5-20 liters in
      volume, most preferably 12-14 liters so that a batch of
      approximately 10 liters can be made. Pour spout 26 is for pouring
      the partially purified water with flocs out of first container 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Filter holder 40 is shown assembled onto second container
      60 in FIG. 2. Filter holder 40 includes annular wall 56 which
      rests on upper edge 66 of second container 60. Annular wall 56
      extends outwardly from upper edge 66 to prevent unfiltered water
      from entering second container 60. Downwardly extending lip 58 is
      also for this purpose. Outside wall 54 extends upwardly to top
      wall 59, which supports angled wall 50 and in turn bottom 42, both
      of which are for supporting filter 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] With this filter holder configuration, the bottom 32 of
      filter is held above the upper edge 66 of second container 60.
      This is preferable so that more water can be poured into the
      second container and that the filter does not become immersed in
      the water in the second container.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Filter holder 40 supports filter 30 with holder bottom 42
      beneath filter bottom 32, and angled support wall 50 holding
      filter sidewall 34 inwardly. Support wall 50 is preferably angled
      outwardly, more preferably between 30-60 degrees from vertical,
      and most preferably 45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Filter holder 40 is configured to optimize flow rate
      through the filter while providing adequate filter support. The
      openings through which filtered water flows cannot be too large or
      numerous, as this can cause filter to push through and rupture.
      The openings shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 include five circular central
      openings 46 (1.0 cm in diameter), and twelve outside oval openings
      48 (0.75 cm wide and 1.25 inches long) around central openings 46.
      However, the total area of all openings in filter holder is
      preferably much larger, between 50-80% of the holder surface area,
      most preferably about 75%. Openings could also be provided in
      angled support wall 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Filter holder 40 includes ribs 44, 52 which hold filter 30
      away from holder bottom 42 and support wall 50, breaking the
      surface tension and thereby permitting water to flow between ribs
      44, 52 to openings 46, 48. Bottom 42 is also curved downwardly to
      direct flow to openings 46, 48. In this way, a higher surface area
      of the filter is used and a higher flow rate can be obtained.
      Lifting the filter with the ribs away from the outlet openings
      also reduces the risk of filter rupture.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The volume of the filter is preferably 1.0-5.0 liters, most
      preferably about 2.0 liters. The surface area of the filter is
      preferably 100-300 in.&lt;2&gt;, most preferably about 200
      in.&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The flow rate through the filter and filter holder
      preferably is relatively high so that it does not take too long to
      pour the partially treated water from first container 20. A
      preferred flow rate is 0.5-20 liters per minute, and more
      preferably 5-10 liters per minute. These flow rates are preferably
      achieved after treatment of the water according to the preferred
      process described more fully hereafter. Because the size of the
      particulates of "flocs" can be a function of both the nature of
      the water purification composition as well as the manner in which
      it is used (e.g., the sequence, number, and nature of the stirring
      time intervals), the selection of the filter material and the
      design of the filter holder can affect the flow rate of the
      treated water through the filter 20 and the filter holder 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Filter 30 and filter holder 40 are also configured to
      reduce the possibility of unfiltered water bypassing the filter
      between the filter and holder. Filter 30 includes a top portion 36
      that extends above top 59 of filter holder. If the filter is
      overfilled, its top edge 38 will bend over top wall 59 of holder,
      and the unfiltered water will flow outside of filter holder 40.
      Top edge 38 is also wider than the top of angled wall 50 to avoid
      bypass.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Second container 60 preferably has about the same volume as
      first container 20. Its volume is preferably 5-20 liters, and most
      preferably 12-14 liters.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Second container 60 can include a spigot 80 for dispensing
      purified water. The spigot arrangement of the first embodiment is
      unique because it permits easier and less expensive manufacturing.
      The most common way to attach a spigot in such a container is to
      drill a hole in the side and attach the spigot manually with a
      series of washers, nuts, etc. This is labor and part intensive.
      The preferred spigot 80 includes only three parts, valve body 82,
      valve 90 and O-ring 86. The O-ring perhaps can also be eliminated
      by replacing it with an interference fit. This assembly is simply
      snapped into valve cavity 65 in the bottom of the second
      container. Because valve cavity 65 is axially oriented, it can be
      formed in a "straight pull" molding process.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Spigot 80 is held to second container bottom 62 with flange
      84, and O-ring 86 creates a seal between valve body 82 and valve
      body cavity 65. Valve body 82 includes a vertical upper portion 83
      within cavity 65 and a horizontal lower portion 88 containing
      valve 90. Lower portion 88 is further held in place with locking
      tab 89 engaging an extension of container 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In operation, valve 90 is rotated to the open position
      (shown) in which flow opening 92 of valve 90 lines up with a
      corresponding opening in the bottom of upper portion 83 of valve
      body 82. Water flows from outlet opening 64 of container, through
      vertical portion 83 of valve body 82, into the interior of valve
      90 and out spigot outlet 96.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Stand 70 is provided to accommodate the spigot arrangement
      (via recess 72) and to raise it above for example a table on which
      the assembly is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Referring to FIG. 3, the components of kit 10 are
      configured so that they can be assembled or "nested" into a
      convenient unit. In particular, first container 20 fits over
      filter holder 40 and partially over second container 60, with
      container bottom 22 resting on top 59 of the filter holder. With
      this arrangement, container 20 also acts as a cover to prevent
      contamination of filter 30 or purified water in second container
      60.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0036] Second and Third Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the second and third
      embodiments incorporate into a kit a second filter 100, 200
      positioned in second container 60. This second filter comprises
      carbon to remove undesirable components remaining in the purified
      water, such as chlorine and odors. Chlorine in particular is a
      typical product of the flocculation process that is preferably
      removed in order to improve taste.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The carbon filter locations and constructions shown are
      only two ways in which a carbon filter can be incorporated into a
      kit. For example, a carbon filter comprising an additional filter
      layer beneath the first filter in the filter holder could be
      employed. Various arrangements within the second container could
      also be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Referring to the second embodiment in FIG. 4, a carbon
      filter arrangement is shown in which the filter 200 is located at
      an outlet 162 of second container 60. With this location, the
      water in second container 60 remains chlorinated until dispensed
      through spigot 80. This is preferable so that the chlorine can
      maintain the purified water organism free while it is stored in
      second container 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The filter 100 shown is a radial flow, cylindrical filter
      having a closed end 106 and an opened end 108. Water flows
      radially inwardly through media 102, into central core 109, though
      container outlet 160, and out the conventional spigot 180 shown.
      Media 102 is enclosed with end caps 104 and for example hot melt
      glue. Filter 100 is attached to outlet tube 160 through a bayonet
      connection and an O-ring (not shown). Axial or radial seal
      mechanisms can be employed, although an axial seal is presently
      contemplated. Media 102 can be bound fine mesh carbon (i.e.,
      carbon block) or a sheet of carbon fiber mesh wrapped onto an
      internal cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The second filter can comprise a variety of other carbon
      filter and media constructions that attach to the outlet of the
      second container. For example, the filter could be an axial flow
      filter. One axial flow construction that could be employed is a
      cylindrical filter comprising coarse mesh carbon sandwiched
      between two porous disks.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] One of the requirements of carbon filter 100 of the second
      embodiment is that it have a sufficiently high flow rate. This is
      because the filter operates "on demand"-it must filter water as
      fast as an acceptable flow rate from spigot 180. The preferred
      rate is 0.5-5.0 liters per minute, most preferably 1.0-3.0 liters
      per minute.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring to FIG. 5, another carbon filter arrangement in
      the second container is shown in a third embodiment. Second
      container 260 comprises upper 262 and lower 264 chambers. Upper
      chamber 262 is preferably 5-20 liters in volume, most preferably
      12-14 liters; lower chamber 264 is preferably 5-20 liters, most
      preferably 12-14 liters.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Carbon filter 200 is held by wall 266 separating chambers
      262, 264. It is sealed with sealing lip 208 around its periphery
      against the inner side of sleeve 268 extending downwardly from
      wall 266. The filter could also be sealed for example using an
      O-ring.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] After water has passed through first filter 30, it flows
      into upper chamber 262. From there it flows into second filter 200
      through openings in upper housing 206, then through media 202 in
      lower housing 204, and out through openings in the bottom of lower
      housing 204. The water, now in lower chamber 264, is then stored
      and dispensed as with the first embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Media 202 in carbon filter 200 is preferably loose granular
      activated carbon. Other granular media that could be added include
      ion exchange resin or zeolites. Silver could also be added, for
      example through silverized carbon, to prevent organisms from
      growing in the unchlorinated water while stored.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In addition to the carbon media described above with
      respect to the second and third embodiments, other forms of carbon
      could also be employed within the principles of the invention.
      Non-carbon media in addition to those described above could also
      be added in various forms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0048] Water Purification Composition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] A variety of flocculent compositions are known and could be
      used within the principles of the invention. Examples are
      described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,012 and 5,681,475. These
      compositions typically include a coagulant and an organic
      hydrophilic colloid, as well as a source of alkalinity, a
      disinfectant, a secondary colloid, and clay and/or aluminosilicate
      (which act as seed particles for floc formation).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Certain preferred compositions are described in British
      Patent Application Nos. 0015571.3 and 0015569.7, both filed Jun.
      27, 2000, and in British Patent Application No. 0027214.6, filed
      on Nov. 8, 2000, each of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A first preferred composition comprises: (i) a first
      polymeric material which comprises an amine group; and (ii) a
      second polymeric material which is substantially water-soluble and
      has a weight average molecular weight of at least 2,000,000; and
      optionally (iii) an inorganic metal salt selected from the group
      consisting of iron sulfate, iron chloride, aluminum chloride,
      aluminum sulfate, manganese sulfate, manganese chloride, copper
      sulfate, copper chloride, poly-variations thereof or a combination
      thereof. The first polymeric material most preferably comprises
      chitosan, which is derived from the chitin of crustacea such as
      crabs, lobsters and shrimp. The preferred second polymeric
      material is polyacrylamide, and especially preferred are anionic
      or nonionic polyacrylamides. Typical anionic and nonionic
      polyacrylamides for use herein are those from the Magnafloc range
      supplied by Ciba. Of these polyacrylamides, especially preferred
      are those known under the trade name as Magnafloc LT20, Magnafloc
      LT25, Magnafloc LT25S, Magnafloc LT26, Magnafloc LT28, Magnafloc
      351 and Magnafloc 919.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A second preferred composition comprises: (i) a
      polysaccharide which comprises an amine group; and (ii) a second
      polymeric material which is substantially water-soluble and has a
      weight average molecular weight of at least 100,000; and
      optionally (iii) an inorganic metal salt as described above. The
      preferred polysaccharide comprises chitosan. The preferred second
      polymeric material may comprise a cationic polyacrylamide.
      Preferred cationic polyacrylamides for use herein include those
      known under the trade names as Zetag 89, Praestol 611BC, Calfloc
      1552, Calfloc 1506, Calfloc 1508, Magnafloc LT22, Magnafloc LT22S,
      Magnafloc LT27 and Polymin KP97.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A third preferred composition comprises: (i) a primary
      coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble,
      multivalent inorganic salts and mixtures thereof; (ii) a bridging
      flocculant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble and
      water-dispersible anionic and nonionic polymers having a weight
      average molecular weight of at least about 2,000,000, and mixtures
      thereof; (iii) a coagulant aid selected from the group consisting
      of water-soluble and water-dispersible cationic polymers having a
      weight average molecular weight of less than about 1,500,000, and
      mixtures thereof; and optionally one or more of (iv) a
      microbiocidal disinfectant; (v) a water-soluble alkali; (vi) a
      water-insoluble silicate selected from clays, zeolites and
      mixtures thereof; and (vii) a food additive or nutrient source.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The composition is preferably in a solid form, most
      preferably in a tablet or powder form. The composition is
      preferably packaged in a water impermeable material, such as
      polypropylene or typical laminates, so that it is protected from
      environmental conditions such as moisture. An example of one such
      laminate is a laminate supplied by Akerlund &amp; Raus, comprising
      layers of coated paper (outer), LDPE, aluminium foil and an inner
      layer Surlyn (an ethylene/methacrylate co-polymer)-an FDA approved
      food packaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The kits of the present invention can further include one
      or more unit or dosage forms (e.g., tablets, sachets, pouches,
      etc.) of the water purification composition, wherein each unit
      dosage form is sufficient to treat a volume of water equivalent to
      the previously described volumes for the first container 20 and/or
      the second container 60. The kit 10 can include between about 1
      and about 28 unit dosage forms of the water purification
      composition. More preferably, the kit 10 includes between about 7
      and about 13 unit dosage forms of the water purification
      composition. Each unit dosage form of the water purification
      composition can contain between about 3 gms and about 10 gms of
      the water purification composition. More preferably, each unit
      dosage form of the water purification composition contains between
      about 5 gms and about 8 gms of the water purification composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0056] First Filter Composition and Construction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] The first filter of the invention could comprise a variety
      of materials, including but not limited to cloth, paper, glass
      fiber, activated carbon, zeolite, and ion exchange media. The
      filter can include multiple layers. It can be disposable or
      cleanable. It is preferably hydrophilic to maximize flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The filter is comprised of a plurality of pores, each pore
      having an effective pore size sufficiently small for reduction of
      turbidity and for separating small flocs, and sufficiently large
      for resisting clogging. The pore radius can be 2-250 microns
      depending on the construction. Certain paper towel products have a
      unique structure that allows them to provide a nearly uniform
      distribution of pore sizes below about 200 [mu]m. While it is
      expected that small pores will provide good capture of insoluble
      material, and larger pores will improve flow performance, we have
      unexpectedly found that a nearly uniform, relatively high
      concentration of pore sizes from about 10 [mu]m to 100 [mu]m and a
      still larger concentration peak between 100 [mu]m and 200 [mu]m
      delivers excellent flow and filtering performance with the
      disclosed water purification composition. For example, a pore
      volume of greater than 0.004 cm&lt;3&gt;/g/[mu]m, for pore sizes
      between 10 [mu]m and 150 [mu]m, may be preferred. A pore volume
      greater than 0.010 cm&lt;3&gt;/g/[mu]m, more preferably greater
      than 0.050 cm&lt;3&gt;/g/[mu]m, for the largest concentration of
      pores having a pore radius of between 100 to 200 [mu]m, may be
      further preferred. These pore sizes and volumes were determined
      using the method described below. It is believed that the specific
      pore sizes are found in specific regions of the laminated paper
      structure. This helps support a sustainable balance of flow versus
      insoluble material removal via size classification and settling.
      More typical filter media have a high concentration of pores only
      below about 50 [mu]m. These pores are easily filled by insoluble
      material, and flow rates then decrease dramatically.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The filter may be woven or non-woven. It may be comprised
      of synthetic material (such as but not limited to polyester,
      polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, combinations thereof, and the
      like), natural material (such as but not limited to cotton, wood,
      bagasse, kenaf, recycle fiber, combinations thereof, and the
      like). The filter may be cellulosic, non-cellulosic, or a
      combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A filter suitable for use with the present invention will
      have a basis weight of at least about 20 g/m&lt;2&gt;, preferably
      of at least about 40 g/m&lt;2&gt;, and more preferably at least
      about 80 g/m&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The filter needs to have sufficient strength in both the
      wet and dry states to maintain its integrity in use. The filter
      has a wet burst strength of at least about 300 grams, preferably
      at least about 350 grams, and most preferably at least about 450
      grams.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] A suitable filter useful with the present invention will
      provide a filtrate having a turbidity of no more than about 2.5
      NTU and a flow rate through the filter of at least about 0.10
      liters/minute, and more preferably of at least about 0.50
      liters/minute. The turbidity can be measured using a turbidimeter,
      as is known in the art. An exemplary turbidimeter suitable for use
      herein is Orbeco Hellige Model 966.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] One preferred filter comprises a cloth. A preferred cloth
      is comprised of 100% white cotton flannel. The nap of the flannel
      preferentially traps the fine floc in the top layer of water that
      is filtered through it. A suitable single sided napped flannel
      sloth for this purpose is White Cozy Flannel SKU #1271568
      available from Jo-Ann Fabrics of Cincinnati, Ohio. A more
      preferred flannel sloth is a two-sided napped flannel. The
      two-sided napped flannel is preferred because the orientation for
      filtering is moot. A suitable two-sided napped flannel sloth is
      SKU #63002 Flanela Blanca, Teñid available from Cantel, S.A. of
      Guatemala City, Guatemala.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Another preferred filter comprises a cellulosic paper
      substrate such as that commonly used in BOUNTY(R) brand paper
      towels marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company of Cincinnati,
      Ohio.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The cellulosic paper substrate can be of a homogenous or
      multi-layered construction; and the filter made therefrom can be
      of a single ply or preferably a multiply construction.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The cellulosic paper substrate is typically made by
      depositing a papermaking furnish on a foraminous forming fabric or
      wire. Once the furnish is deposited on the forming wire, it is
      referred to as a web. The web is typically dewatered to a fiber
      consistency of between about 7% and about 25% (total web weight
      basis) by vacuum dewatering.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The web may then be conventionally pressed to further
      dewater the web, using one or more press felts or the web may be
      further dewatered by through air drying. If the web is
      conventionally pressed, it may be conventionally pressed using a
      felt which applies a pattern to the paper as taught by U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,556,509 issued Sep. 17, 1996 to Trokhan et al. and U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,837,103 issued Nov. 17, 1998 to Trokhan et al., the
      disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The web may also be through air dried. A suitable through
      air dried substrate may be made according to commonly assigned
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,191,609, the disclosure of which is incorporated
      herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The dewatered web may then be further pressed and dried by
      a steam drum apparatus known in the art as a Yankee dryer.
      Pressure can be developed at the Yankee dryer by mechanical means
      such as an opposing cylindrical drum pressing against the web.
      Multiple Yankee dryer drums can be employed, whereby additional
      pressing is optionally incurred between the drums. The tissue
      paper structures that are formed are referred to hereafter as
      conventional, pressed, tissue paper structures. Such sheets are
      considered to be compacted since the entire web is subjected to
      substantial mechanical compressional forces while the fibers are
      moist and are then dried while in a compressed state.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Preferably, the substrate which comprises the paper
      according to the present invention is through air dried on a belt
      having a patterned framework. The belt according to the present
      invention may be made according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,859 issued
      Jan. 20, 1987 to Trokhan; U.S. Pat. No. 4,514,345 issued Apr. 30,
      1985 to Johnson et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,565 issued Jul. 12,
      1994 to Rasch et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,289 issued Aug. 2,
      1994 to Trokhan et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated
      herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Alternatively, the papermaking furnish can be initially
      deposited on a foraminous supporting carrier that also operates as
      an imprinting fabric.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The patterned framework of the belt preferentially imprints
      a pattern comprising an essentially continuous network onto the
      paper and further has deflection conduits dispersed within the
      pattern. The deflection conduits extend between opposed first and
      second surfaces of the framework. The deflection conduits allow
      domes to form in the paper.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The through air dried paper made according to the foregoing
      patents has a plurality of domes formed during the papermaking
      process which are dispersed throughout an essentially continuous
      network region. The domes extend generally perpendicular to the
      paper and increase its caliper. The domes generally correspond in
      geometry, and during papermaking in position, to the deflection
      conduits of the belt described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] There are an infinite variety of possible geometries,
      shapes, and arrangements for the deflection conduits and the domes
      formed in the paper therefrom. These shapes include those
      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,700 issued on Jan. 4, 1994 to
      Trokhan. Examples of these shapes include but are not limited to
      those described as the linear Idaho pattern, Bow-tie pattern, and
      Snowflake pattern.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The domes protrude outwardly from the essentially
      continuous network of the paper due to molding into the deflection
      conduits during the papermaking process. By molding into the
      deflection conduits during the papermaking process, the regions of
      the paper comprising the domes are deflected in the Z-direction.<br>

      [0077] Several variations in the substrate used for the paper
      according to the present invention are feasible and may, depending
      upon the application, be desirable. The substrate which comprises
      the paper according to the present invention may be optionally
      foreshortened. The optional foreshortening may be accomplished by
      creping or by wet microcontration. Creping and wet microcontration
      are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,191,756 issued
      to Sawdai on May 4, 1980 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,597 issued to
      Wells et al. on Apr. 3, 1984, the disclosures of which are
      incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The paper according to the present invention may be
      layered. Layering is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No.

      <br>
      [0079] Referring to FIGS. 6A-D, two or more plies may be joined
      together in a face to face arrangement. Each ply may be oriented
      with the adjacent ply in numerous different configurations. For
      example, in a two-ply structure 40, the domes 30 of the first ply
      1 may be aligned in a dome-to-dome pattern with the domes 30 of
      the second ply 2 as shown in FIG. 6A. Alternatively, in a two-ply
      structure 40, the domes 30 of the first 1 ply may be joined in an
      off-set dome-to-dome pattern with the domes 30 of the second ply 2
      as shown in FIG. 6B. In another alternative two-ply embodiment,
      the domes 30 of the first ply 1 may be joined in a nested pattern
      with the domes of the second ply 2 as shown in FIG. 6C. FIG. 6D
      shows an example of a multi-ply structure 50 wherein the domes of
      the first ply 1 and the domes of the second ply 2 are oriented in
      a dome-to-dome pattern. The domes of the third ply 3 are oriented
      in a dome-to-dome pattern with the domes of the fourth ply 4. The
      domes of the fifth ply 5 are oriented in a dome-to-dome pattern
      with the domes of the sixth ply 6. The examples provided herein
      are not to be construed as limiting to the scope of the invention.<br>

      [0082] The substrate may also be made according to U.S. Pat. No.
      5,411,636 issued to Hermans et al. on May 2, 1995 and EP 677612
      published in the name of Wendt et al. on Oct. 18, 1995.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In addition to papermaking fibers, the papermaking furnish
      used to make the filter can have other components or materials
      added thereto. The types of additives that are utilized will be
      dependent upon the particular desired attributes of the filter.
      For example, it is desirable that the filter of the present
      invention have wet strength. Chemical substances known in the art
      as "wet strength" agents are added to the papermaking furnish for
      this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Useful wet strength agents include those that are generally
      cationic in character. Examples of wet strength agents suitable
      for use with the present invention include cationic
      polyamide-epichlorohydrin resins such as those described in U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,700,623, issued to Keim on Oct. 24, 1972, and U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,772,076, issued to Keim, on Nov. 13, 1973, both of which are
      incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] A useful cationic polyamide-epichlorohydrin wet strength
      agent suitable for use with the present invention is KYMENE(R)
      557H, commercially available from Hercules, Inc. of Wilmington,
      Del.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Other suitable wet strength agents include latex based wet
      strength agents and polyacrylamide resins such as those described
      in U.S. Pat. No. 3,556,932, issued to Coscia et al. on Jan. 19,
      1971, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,556,933, issued to Williams et al. on
      Jan. 19, 1971, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      One commercial source of polyacrylamide resin is American Cyanamid
      Co. of Stamford, Conn., which markets one such resin under the
      name of PAREZ(R) 631 NC.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Other water-soluble cationic resins which may be used in
      this invention include urea formaldehyde and melamine formaldehyde
      resins. The more common functional groups of these polyfunctional
      resins are nitrogen containing groups such as amino groups and
      methylol groups attached to nitrogen. Polyethylenimine type resins
      may also be used in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The wet strength agent is applied in an amount from about
      0.05% to 10% by weight of the filter, preferably from about 0.1%
      to 5% by weight of the filter, and more preferably from about 0.2%
      to 2% by weight of the filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In addition to a wet strength agent, a dry strength agent
      may also be added to the papermaking fibers comprising the filter.
      A non-limiting example of a suitable dry strength agent is
      carboxymethyl cellulose. If used, the dry strength agent is
      applied in an amount from about 0.001% to 3.0% by weight of the
      filter, preferably from about 0.01% to 0.50% by weight of the
      filter, and more preferably from about 0.10% to 0.030% by weight
      of the filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Other components could be added to the filter, including
      carbon and silver. For example, fine mesh carbon such as 200 U.S.
      mesh (0.0029 inches), could be layered between layers of filter
      media. Carbon could also be a component of the paper substrate.
      Silver could be added to prevent organisms from growing in the
      unchlorinated water, for example through silverized carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Referring to filter 30 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, sidewall 34
      may be corrugated or pleated. This is for the purpose of
      increasing flow rate by creating channels between sidewall 34 and
      filter holder 40. A discontinuous side wall also helps hold the
      filter in the filter holder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0092] The following is an example of how to make a preferred
      filter of the present invention. The filter is made from plies of
      cellulosic fibers as are commonly used in BOUNTY(R) brand paper
      towels marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company of Cincinnati,
      Ohio. Each ply is made of about 65 percent northern softwood kraft
      pulp fiber and about 35 percent CTMP pulp fiber. Each ply has a
      basis weight of approximately 2.7 grams/m&lt;2&gt;. Approximately
      5-12.5 kg/ton of a wet strength agent and approximately 1-7.5
      kg/ton of a dry strength agent are added to each ply.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Each ply is embossed in a nested embossing process by
      elliptically shaped embossments. The embossments are spaced in a
      complementary concentric diamond pattern on a 45 degree pitch of
      about 0.118 inches (0.30 cm). Two complementary plies are made and
      adhesively joined together at a zero clearance marrying nip, so
      that a unitary laminate having about 346 embossments per square
      inch (5.6 embossments per cm&lt;2&gt;) per ply is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In order to form the filter, three unitary laminate sheets
      are bonded together with an adhesive. A suitable adhesive for this
      purpose is a hot melt glue available as HL-1262 ZP supplied by H.
      B. Fuller Company of Paducah, Ky.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0095] First Filter Pore Volume Distribution Methodology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Pore Volume Distribution measurements are made on a
      TRI/Autoporosimeter (TRI/Princeton Inc. of Princeton, N.J.). The
      TRI/Autoporosimeter is an automated computer-controlled instrument
      for measuring pore volume distributions in porous materials (i.e.
      the volumes of different size pores within the range from 1 to
      1000 [mu]m). Complimentary Automated Instument Software, Release
      2000.1, and Data Treatment Software, Release 2000.1 were used to
      capture, analyze and output the data. More information on the
      TRI/Auroposimeter, its operation and data treatments can be found
      in The Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 162 (1994), pgs
      163-170, incorporated here by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] As used in this application, porosimetry involves recording
      the increment of liquid that enters or leaves a porous material as
      the surrounding air pressure changes. A sample in the test chamber
      is exposed to precisely controlled changes in air pressure. The
      size (radius) of the largest pore able to hold liquid is a
      function of the air pressure. As the air pressure increases
      (decreases), different size pore groups drain (absorb) liquid. The
      pore volume of each group is equal to this amount of liquid, as
      measured by the instrument at the corresponding pressure. The
      effective radius of a pore is related to the pressure differential
      by the following relationship.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Pressure differential=[(2)[gamma] cos [theta]]/effective
      radius<br>
      <br>
      [0099] where [gamma]=liquid surface tension, [theta]=contact angle<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Typically pores are thought of in terms such as voids,
      holes or conduits in a material. For filters, these pores both
      exclude certain size particles and allow other fluids to pass
      through the material. It is important to note that this method
      uses the above equation to calculate effective pore radii based on
      the constants and equipment controlled pressures. The above
      equation assumes uniform cylindrical pores. Usually, the pores in
      natural and manufactured porous materials are not perfectly
      cylindrical, nor all uniform. Therefore, the effective radii
      reported here may not equate exactly to measurements of void
      dimensions obtained by other methods such as microscopy. However,
      these measurements do provide an accepted means to characterize
      relative differences in void structure between materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The equipment operates by changing the test chamber air
      pressure in user-specified increments, either by decreasing
      pressure (increasing pore size) to absorb liquid, or increasing
      pressure (decreasing pore size) to drain liquid. The liquid volume
      absorbed (drained) at each pressure increment is the cumulative
      volume for the group of all pores between the preceding pressure
      setting and the current setting.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In this application of the TRI/Autoporosimeter, the liquid
      is a 0.2 weight % solution of octylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol
      (Triton X-100 from Union Carbide Chemical and Plastics Co. of
      Danbury, Conn.) in distilled water. The instrument calculation
      constants are as follows: [rho] (density)=1 g/cm3; [gamma]
      (surface tension)=31 dynes/cm2; cos [theta]=1[deg.]. A 0.22 [mu]m
      Millipore Glass Filter (Millipore Corporation of Bedford, Mass.;
      Catalog # GSWP09025) is employed on the test chamber's porous
      plate. A plexglass plate weighing about 24 g (supplied with the
      instrument) is placed on the sample to ensure the sample rests
      flat on the Millipore Filter. No additional weight is placed on
      the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The remaining user specified inputs are described below.
      The sequence of pore sizes (pressures) for this application is as
      follows (effective pore radius in [mu]m): 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
      30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300,
      400, 500, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 90,
      80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5. This sequence
      starts with the sample dry, saturates it as the pore settings
      increase, and then subsequently drains the sample of all volume
      above an effective pore radius of 2.5 [mu]m. The equilibrium rate
      was set at 5 mg/minute. No stop radius was specified.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In addition to the test materials, a blank condition (no
      sample between plexiglass plate and Millipore Filter) was run to
      account for any surface and/or edge effects within the chamber.
      Any pore volume measured for this blank run is subtracted from the
      applicable pore grouping of the test sample. This data treatment
      can be accomplished manually or with the available
      TRI/Autoporosimeter Data Treatment Software, Release 2000.1.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The characteristic pore size distribution of the draining
      sample (decreasing pore size settings) was analyzed, since flow
      within and through the filter media for this application is most
      pertinent with a fully saturated material. The TRI/Autoporosimeter
      reports the weight (mg) of liquid drained from each pore group.
      From this data and the weight of the original, dry sample, the
      ratio of pore volume/sample weight can be calculated. This value
      can be reported as mm&lt;3&gt;/mg or cm&lt;3&gt;/g. The pore
      distribution can be interpreted by dividing the cm&lt;3&gt;/g
      volume for each pore group by the range of effective pore radii
      over which that volume was measured. Results can be reported as
      cm&lt;3&gt;/g/[mu]m or mm&lt;3&gt;/g/[mu]m. These data treatments
      may be conducted manually based on the output of the Automated
      Instument Software, Release 2000.1, or one may use the Data
      Treatment Software, Release 2000.1 available from TRI/Princeton.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0106] Method of Use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0107] The kits described herein can be used to purify water using
      a method comprising: (a) contacting a water treatment composition
      with water to obtain partially purified water comprising solid
      matter; (b) alternating mixing and waiting periods; (c) filtering
      the solid matter to produce purified water; and optionally (d)
      passing the purified water through a carbon filter. Additional
      optional steps include: (e) storing the purified water in a
      dispenser; and (f) dispensing the purified water from the
      dispenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The water treatment composition is preferably mixed with
      the untreated water in a first container at timed intervals using
      the stirring implement 61, which can be, for example, a spoon or
      stick. While the stirring implement 61 can be solid, a stirring
      implement 60 having a plurality of apertures 63 can be used to
      provide improved mixing. After addition of the water purification
      composition to the untreated water in the first container, the
      preferred purification process comprises mixing periods with an
      inter-mixing wait period between each mixing period, during which
      time no mixing of the water occurs. There is also a final wait
      period after the last mixing period prior to pouring the treated
      water through the filter 30 and into the second container 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] One or more of the mixing periods is preferably less than
      about 120 seconds. Optionally, one or more of the mixing periods
      is between about 5 seconds and about 20 seconds, or between about
      50 seconds and about 80 seconds. It is believed that relatively
      lower turbidities of the water after filtration can be achieved at
      relatively higher mixing period lengths (e.g. greater than 45
      seconds) or relatively lower mixing period lengths (e.g., less
      than 20 seconds).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] One or more of the wait periods (either the inter-mixing
      wait periods or the final wait period) is preferably less than
      about 45 minutes. Optionally, the inter-mixing wait periods are
      between about 1 minute and about 15 minutes, or between about 1
      minute and about 4 minutes, or between about 8 minutes and about
      12 minutes. The final wait period is optionally less than about 40
      minutes or between about 15 minutes and about 30 minutes. It is
      believed that relatively lower turbidities of the water after
      filtration can be achieved as the length of the final wait period
      increases and/or for relatively short intermixing wait periods
      (e.g., less than about 4 minutes) or relatively longer intermixing
      wait periods (e.g., greater than about 8 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      [0111] It is also believed that as the mixing intensity increases,
      the turbidity of the filtered water decreases. As used herein, the
      phrase "mixing intensity" can be characterized by the square root
      of the power to mix the water divided by the volume of water
      missed and the water viscosity, as shown below.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Mixing intensity=P/V[mu]<br>
      <br>
      [0113] wherein P is power, V is the volume of the mixed water, and
      [mu] is the water viscosity. This formula is further discussed in
      The Nalco Water Handbook, 2d edition (1988), published by McGraw
      Hill Press, the substance of which is incorporated herein by
      reference. The power can be determined from the torque exerted to
      rotate the stirring implement 61 multiplied by the angular
      velocity of the stirring implement. The mixing intensity is
      preferably less than 3,000 s&lt;-1 &gt;and optionally is between
      about 400 s&lt;-1 &gt;and about 1800 s&lt;-1&gt;. As the mixing
      intensity increases, the relaive turbidity of the water after
      filtration is believed to decrease.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] While the above-described purification process is preferred
      for the water purification compositions and filter materials
      described herein, it will be appreciated that the length and
      numbers of mixing periods, inter-mixing wait periods, and final
      wait periods can be varied.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Passing the purified water through the carbon filter can be
      done in conjunction with the filtering step or afterward. Examples
      of the former are where the first filter or one beneath it
      comprises carbon, as described above. Examples of the latter are
      the second filters 100, 200 of the second and third embodiments
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The kit can include instructions for using the kit. The
      instructions can be provided in a text form, in a graphic form, or
      combination thereof. The instructions can be according to any of
      the methods of use described herein and may be directly printed on
      a package storing one or more components of the kit, or printed
      directly on one or more of the components of the kit (e.g.,
      container 40), or presented in a separate manner including, but
      not limited to, a brochure, print advertisement, electronic
      advertisement, and/or verbal communication, so as to communicate
      the method of using the kit to a consumer. The following is one
      example of instructions:<br>
      <br>
      [0117] 1. This packet of powder will purify 10 liters of drinking
      water. DO NOT LET CHILDREN EAT THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] 2. Remove the top bucket and fill it with 10 liters of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] 3. Cut open the packet and add the contents to the
      container of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] 4. Using the stirring device, stir the powder for 30
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] 5. Let the water sit for at least 5 minutes, but never less
      than 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] 6. Stir the powder again for 30 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] 7. Let the water sit for 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] 8. Stir for 30 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] 9. Let the water sit for 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] 10. Place the support for the disposable filter onto the
      rim of the dispenser with the spigot. Place a disposable filter
      into the support.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] 11. Separate the clean water from the large particles in
      the bottom of the bucket by pouring the top layer of clear water
      through the disposable filter, and into the bottom storage vessel
      with the spigot. Pour the water through the filter, making sure
      that all the water goes THROUGH, not around, the filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] 12. If the filtered water is not completely clear, remove
      the purified water to another container, wash out the bottom
      storage vessel to remove any small particles, and filter the water
      again into the cleaned storage vessel with the spigot.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] 13. Leave the large particles in the bottom layer of water
      in the bucket. Discard the layer of water containing these large
      particles on the ground. DO NOT EAT THE ORANGE PARTICLES.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] 14. After the water has been filtered, let it sit for 15
      minutes before drinking it.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] 15. Keep the purified, filtered water in the storage
      vessel, keep the vessel closed by placing the cleaned top bucket
      over the storage vessel, and dispense water only through the
      spigot.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] 16. Throw the used disposable filter into the trash. If
      anyone drinks the orange particles, contact Mercado Empresarial
      for instructions on what to do.<br>
