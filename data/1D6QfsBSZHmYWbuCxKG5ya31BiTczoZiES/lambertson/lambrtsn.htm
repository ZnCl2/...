      </center>
      <p>Win Lambertson, who has a PhD in ceramic engineering, indicates
        that he and his E-dam (energy-dam) technology, which he has
        cultivated and developed over the years, are alive and well. Win
        states that he has been very focused on E-dam circuits over the
        last 2 years, and has learned a great deal about semi-conductor
        switching circuits in this time frame. </p>
      <p>The development and goal of this invention was to extract
        energy from the vacuum continuum and began in December, 1972. At
        that time, Win placed a conical shaped crystal in a DC magnetic
        field from which energy was extracted via a coil of wire. </p>
      <p>He borrowed a precision multimeter for his measurements and
        promptly fried this multimeter. (Win recalls that he has blown
        many multimeters over the years.) Work to improve the efficiency
        of this crystal circuit did not begin until 1976, when it was
        discovered that removal of the crystal resulted in only a 20
        percent reduction of the total energy output. (Win states that
        the energy could actually be felt physically.) </p>
      <p>Win saw no point in continuing crystal studies if it only added
        20 percent to the total energy measured. Win then developed a
        ceramic material to convert the ultra-high frequency energy of
        the vacuum to a lower frequency energy easily handled by
        conventional electronic circuits. </p>
      <p>Since that time, a metal has been added to the ceramic making
        it a 'cermet', but the original concept of this material has
        remained the same, which concept is to collect energy from the
        vacuum, store it in the cermet, and then release it to a load
        for utlization. The term E-dam was coined to reflect this
        concept. </p>
      <p>It was originally surmised that the energy for the E-dams was
        coming from the aether. Later, it was assumed to be coming from
        neutrinos. This hypothesis was then changed to one in which the
        3 degree Kelvin background radiation of the universe was the
        source. </p>
      <p>His current theory is that the energy photons emerging from the
        vacuum continuum. In other words, Win has come full circle back
        to his original aether theory as the source for the energy of
        the E-dams. </p>
      <p>The original crystal circuit slowly began to evolve. Initially,
        the two electromagnets in the original circuit were replaced
        with two bar magnets and then these bar magnets were eventually
        eliminated. </p>
      <p>The voltages evolved from initially 15 volts DC up to a maximum
        of 15,000 volts DC. A spark gap was added to develop high
        current, high voltage spikes. At 15,000 volts, Win began to
        observe in his garage one summer small, blue electric arcs
        moving across his work bench surface. These were as much as
        three feet long. </p>
      <p>After that observation, the voltage was reduced because of the
        danger of sharing his working surface with the high voltage
        arcs. A resistance was also added to the circuit to slow down
        the electric charge across the arc. Neighbors from a block away
        were making snide comments about the noise. </p>
      <p>After reviewers charged that the resistor measurements were in
        error because of phase angle changes, the load was changed to
        many 100 watt incandescent lamps in parallel, following the
        example of Dr. T.H. Moray. </p>
      <p>Even with 100 lamps in parallel, the lamps would burn out. (100
        lamps X 100 Watts each = 10,000 Watts) These lamps were then
        replaced with 100 ohm wire wound resistors. These resistors too
        would burn out, but it was difficult to know when they had
        failed. The next change was to go to industrial eight foot
        fluorescent lamps which lasted less than a week. His present
        load is a bank of 400 watt H.I.D. mercury lamps, and these have
        held up well. </p>
      <p>The spark gap switching was abandoned and the change was made
        to a MOSFET switching system. This has since been upgraded to
        the use of high current IGBT's. In May of 1994, Win Lambertson
        presented his results to date on his E-dam circuits at the 2nd
        ISNE (International Symposium on New Energy) conference. For
        this symposium, Win had calculated a 965 percent over-unity
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>Later in the summer of 1994, independent testing was conducted
        by two electrical engineers, Toby Grotz and Robert Emmerich, on
        a similar circuit utilizing solid state switching and E-dams,
        which were made to Win Lambertson's specifications. </p>
      <p>This testing resulted in the identification of an anomaly in
        the test setup, which anomaly was unassociated with the E-dams.
      </p>
      <p>Subsequent studies by Toby Grotz into 1995 of other circuit
        variables yielded a better understanding of the anomaly. Later,
        in 1996, Toby Grotz applied for an SBIR (Small Business
        Innovation Research) grant from the DOE (Department of Energy)
        to further research and develop a product based on this
        anomalous phenomena. </p>
      <p>At the start of 1994 and before the 2nd ISNE conference, Win
        was using MOSFETs to switch voltages less than 500 volts in his
        E-dam circuits. Today, with the assistance of Walter Rosenthal,
        Win has changed over to IGBTs which can switch at voltages up to
        1700 volts DC and with currents above 30 amperes. </p>
      <p>Win states that he expects to sell his invention later this
        year and begin working on the history of the WIN (World into
        Neutrinos) process around which this invention is based. </p>

            Notes from Jerry Decker (KeelyNet)</font></b> </p>
      <p>I had the good fortune to attend the 2nd ISNE conference and
        meet Dr. Lambertson. He hosted a workshop where he passed around
        a sample of the cells. I examined it closely, it looked like a
        thin Oreo cookie with one wire attached to each outside cermet
        and a very thin rubbery material between the two cermets that
        looked like RTV silicone. </p>
      <p>I speculated to Dr. Lambertson that it could be that he used
        ground up quartz or other crystals mixed with the RTV and
        secreted between the two cermet discs. Thus by shock exciting
        the cermets, a combined piezoelectric discharge might yield more
        energy than it took to produce the shock. Dr. Lamberson said
        he'd rather not discuss this as he was in process of filing a
        patent. </p>
      <p>Also at the conference it was discussed how the 100 watt
        tungsten filament light bulbs he'd been using kept blowing out
        and his wife was upset because he kept using them up. The cause
        was believed to be the crystal nature of the tungsten metal
        which would fracture and break the filament under the impress of
        the high energy discharges being extracted from the aether. </p>
      <p>Many of these cells were stacked into columns to increase the
        overall power output. The excess energy would come from the
        coupling of high intensity, short duration electrical discharges
        with the ambient aether/zpe field. </p>
      <p>He was a very nice fellow and shared more information about his
        discovery than most inventors do, however it is now 2001 and
        below is an article from the Space Energy Association newsletter
        on September 2000 that you might find of additional interest. </p>

      <p>August 9th, 2000 <br>
        To: Friends of WIN energy <br>
        From: Win Lambertson <br>
        Subject: Load Study </p>
      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>In my May, 2000 Progress Report I told how I came to understand
        the lack of certification of my method. The problem lay in the
        electrical measurements that were unable to measure radiant
        energy output when no current was moving through the tank
        circuit. The solution seemed simple enough. I would substitute a
        non-inductive resistance for the lamp load. </p>
      <p><b>Load Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>For the past eight years my load has consisted of 400-watt
        H.I.D. mercury lamps. I started with four in series and
        gradually dropped down to one. The major problem that this load
        has given me has been its change in resistance with power input.
        Figure 1 shows a plot of ohms resistance versus watts. </p>
      <p>The hypothesis of my method is that zero-point energy, ZPE, is
        collected through the acceleration of an electron charge. The
        highest rate of acceleration is achieved with the lowest
        resistance. </p>
      <p>In a normal series of experiments I would collect data at 0.5,
        1.0 and 1.5 DC amperes input. My highest yields were always
        found using the lowest current. If the current were much lower
        than 0.5 amperes the arc would quench and terminate the
        experiment. </p>
      <p>The method utilizes a pulsating DC current that shows up as an
        alternating current on a digital multimeter. It shows up on the
        oscilloscope as a series of square waves. This results from the
        IGBT switching system that operates in either the fully closed
        or fully open position. </p>
      <p>Electrons are knocked out of the mercury vapor atoms to form
        ions and the electrons fall back into the ions to form atoms
        when the switch opens. Falling back into their orbital results
        in the emission of light photons that are measured using 12
        photocells mounted around the outside of the lamp in a light
        box. </p>
      <p>Energy is collected from the vacuum on the electrical charge as
        it moves through a collector called an 'E-dam' after the
        hydro-electric dam analogy. It was evident that more light came
        from the lamp in an alternating current than in a direct
        current. </p>
      <p>Therefore, it was possible to calibrate the photocells using a
        direct current. In the most recent certification attempt, a low
        resistance E-dam was used and it was found that the lamp was
        collecting ZPE without any contribution from the E-dam. This
        action was confirmed in an independent study by Toby Grotz. He
        estimated that the total gas discharge ballast market of 275
        million units per year could be replaced and cut the power
        consumption in half. </p>
      <p>My goal is to utilize vacuum energy in all energy applications,
        not just in lighting, so I had to study energy collection in a
        different type load. A non-inductive resistance load seemed to
        be a simple substitute. Energy is lost as heat and heat is
        generated only when the charge is moving through the load. </p>
      <p>Radio Shack 8 ohm, 20-watt non-inductive resistors were used to
        make up the load. These were mounted in eight sets of three in
        parallel. The total array had a resistance of 24 ohms with a 480
        watt capability. The resistance versus power input curve is
        shown in Figure 2 (not shown on my source material). </p>
      <p>A total of eight thermistors were mounted in series on the
        resistor surfaces with one on each cell. These are calibrated
        using a DC current, allowing enough time for the surface
        temperature to stabilize. Instead of photocells measuring light
        photons, varistor temperature is utilized and measured as
        resistance to indicate energy being lost to the garage air. </p>
      <p><b>E-dam Design ~</b> </p>
      <p>It was clear from my lamp studies that I had to go up in E-dam
        resistance in order to collect energy from the vacuum. A new
        design was developed based on a pyramid shaped crystal as shown
        in Figure 3. This goes back to some early information collected
        in 1973. The crystal shown was an attempt to start with a 1/4"
        base, optimize it and then go up in size and number of crystals
        to increase the power collected. </p>
      <p>Details of the overall E-dam must be withheld in this paper in
        order to maximize the number of possible claims in the patent
        application. It is important for the reader to realize that even
        though the basic concept may remain the same; each final design
        will be different and will probably change over the years as our
        knowledge of materials is enhanced. </p>
      <p>To my surprise, the change in loads did not work out as
        expected. The first yield was 85 percent, which of course, is
        impossible. This meant that some of the energy input was going
        through the load without doing any work. Adjusting the circuit
        brought it up to 116 percent before I stopped my bench work to
        write this paper. The next few days are needed to prepare for
        making a videotape of the method. </p>
      <p><b>Marketing Plan ~</b> </p>
      <p>Individuals interested in marketing my method have requested a
        videotape and certification of my method before getting into a
        sales negotiation. My time availability has made it necessary to
        do the videotape as the next step. Our son, Larry, will be here
        over August 14th to 19th and do the videotaping for us. All
        funding finders should request a copy of the videotape as soon
        as they need it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Anyone who needs a certification immediately should feel
        free to send in his own certifier at his expense with one-week
        notice for scheduling. Otherwise, I will schedule my own
        certifier as soon as I feel that I have had enough time to
        optimize my circuit. </p>

        <p><b>THE CERMET OF WINGATE LAMBERTSON</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In Florida, Wingate Lambertson, Ph.D., lights a row of lamps in
        his garage using what he says is electricity taken from the
        energy of space. It took years for Lambertson, a former director
        of Kentucky's Science and Technology Commission, to overcome his
        academic skepticism about claims that you could get something
        for nothing yet energy freely available from space could be
        tapped for useful work. </p>
      <p>After getting his doctorate from Rutgers University, Lambertson
        works for United States Steel in Chicago before going into the
        United States Navy. After going back to Rutgers for more
        postgraduate work, he joined Argonne National Laboratory, where
        he worked on nuclear fuel technology. </p>
      <p>Then Lambertson discovered the large body of space-energy
        literature that has been written by researchers in the field.
        Eventually, he came to believe that something similar to an
        nether - the basic stuff Of the universe discussed in Chapter
        Could exist, and that where collected, it could be used to make
        electricity. </p>
      <p>After more than two decades of research and experimentation,
        Lambertson is certain that space energy can be turned into a
        practical power source through a process he calls World Into
        Neutrinos (WIN). He envisions it being engineered into units
        that will probably be set outside the home on a small concrete
        pad, like central air conditioning units are now, and wired into
        the home's master electric switchbox. The price? About $3,000
        for either sale or lease cheaper than buying or leasing a car. </p>
      <p><b>The WIN Process and Cermet ~</b> </p>
      <p>The most important part of the WIN process is Lambertson's
        E-dam, and the most interesting component in the E-dam is
        cermet. Cermet is a heat-resistant ceramic-and-metal composite
        invented in 1948 and considered by NASA for rocket nozzles and
        jet-engine turbine blades. Lambertson, who spent almost his
        entire career working with advanced ceramics, is experimenting
        to develop the best cermet for his device. The E-dam contains a
        plate of cermet formed into a round spacer about three inches in
        diameter, sandwic hed between metal plates of the same size. </p>
      <p>The process starts with an electrical charge basically, a
        stream of electrons from a standard power supply. The charge
        flows into the E-dam, where it is held in the cermet: "It stores
        electrons like a [regular] dam stores water," Lambertson says.
        When the dam is opened, the electrons are released. As they
        accelerate, the falling electrons gain energy from the space
        energy that is present in the E-dam. This gain in energy is what
        allows the device to put out more power than it takes in. </p>
      <p>The current of electrons then flows into the device to be
        powered, such as a lamp, and then moves into another E-dam for
        recycling. Lambertson says there is no way for the process to
        become dangerous - if too much power were generated, the E-dams
        would overheat, shutting down the system. </p>
      <p>For years, Lambertson was more interested in proving that the
        process gained energy than in the actual amount of energy
        gained, since he thought scaling up the process to higher
        efficiencies would be a relatively simple engineering problem.
        When his first of three patent applications was rejected, he saw
        it as a blessing because it forced him to study the space-energy
        literature more carefully. By the fall of 1994, he had improved
        the process to the point where it put out twice as much energy
        as it started with. </p>
      <p><b>Lambertson Finds Help ~</b> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lamberston was having a frustrating time in trying
        to find funding and marketing help. Responses to his proposals
        usually fell into one of two categories: </p>
      <p>"This will not work, your calculations are in error." </p>
      <p>"You get it working and free of all technical problems, and we
        will take it off your hands." </p>
      <p>He learned, as have other inventors in this book, that it's a
        waste of time to try to convince people of the validity of one's
        claims when those people don't want to listen. But he did find
        support in 1987, when he spoke at a new-energy conference in
        Germany. There, he found people who saw the need for his
        invention and agreed to market it when the WIN process is
        perfected. </p>
      <p>Lambertson says that he now has active associates in
        Switzerland, in addition to interest shown by the United States
        Navy. Three different groups have shown interest in taking over
        and developing the WIN method. </p>
      <p>Wingate A. Lambertson, Ph.D. believes you can power your home
        on space energy. Lambertson, an inventor from Florida, has
        developed a device he believes will tap the energy freely
        available in space. After earning his doctorate from Rutgers
        University, Lambertson went to work for US Steel before
        enlisting in the Navy, where he taught explosive ordnance. After
        going back to Rutgers for post-graduate work he joined the
        Argonne National Laboratory to work on nuclear fuel technology.
      </p>
      <p>Once the public learns... it will be like taking the genie out
        of the bottle. </p>
      <p>Lambertson, the former director of Kentucky's Science and
        Technology Commission, admits that he was skeptical about space
        energy and that it took time for him to overcome that
        skepticism. He now believes, however, that space energy is real
        and that it can be tapped for useful purposes. He describes
        zero-point energy this way: "Zero-Point Energy is energy from
        the vacuum continuum and is responsible for gravity, inertia,
        the Lamb Shift and the Casimir force (1,2). It is essentially
        inexhaustible and has no polluting byproducts." (3) </p>
      <p>Lambertson has been working working for over two decades on an
        energy collecting process he calls "World Into Neutrinos (WIN)"
        when he thought that neutrinos were his source. He went through
        three other concepts before arriving at his present acceptance
        of ZPE as his source. In his method, energy is collected in a
        device consisting of a Cermet (ceramic metal) positioned between
        two metal plates and called an "E-dam" after the analogy to a
        hydroelectric dam. A charge of electrons is cycled between the
        E-dam to collect the energy and a lamp load to discharge the
        energy. Charge acceleration results in the addition of kinetic
        energy from the vacuum to the charge of electrons. The research
        apparatus used is all solid state and has no moving parts.
        Cermet, Lambertson believes, is the key to the device.
        Lambertson begins the process by supplying an initial charge to
        the E-Dam where he claims that the charge is held in the Cermet:
        "It stores electrons like a [regular] dam stores water,"
        Lambertson says (4). When the dam is opened, Lambertson believes
        that the electrons gain energy from the background zero-point
        energy present in the dam and that this gain in energy can be
        made dramatic enough to power a modern home. </p>
      <p>Patrick G. Bailey, in a publication for the International Forum
        on New Science, describes the WIN device: "[Lambertson] places a
        semiconductor ceramic barrier with a parallel capacitance
        between an oscillating tank circuit and a power supply. He has
        included test results that indicate a power input of 84 Watt-sec
        producing an output of 810 Watt-sec, for an over-unity ratio of
        9.6." (5) The Institute for New Energy has also tested
        Lambertson's WIN device, though apparently without significant
        result so far (6). </p>
      <p>Lambertson and his device have not met with widespread
        acceptance. In his preliminary solicitation to three energy
        companies and nine large energy users, he received responses
        from only four and all were negative. He concluded that any
        development of his method would have to come from entrepreneurs
        and venture capitalists. The U.S. Navy has shown an interest,
        but he requires a working model before they will consider it
        further. </p>
      <p>The problem, which Lambertson has had to solve, was
        stabilization of his E-dams that have changed between the time
        of his apparent energy gain and the time in which a certifier
        has made measurements. It took him three years to understand the
        chemistry of the change which was going due to the electrical
        charge passing through his cermet. He has had to redesign his
        basic composition and the cermet structure several to achieve
        his present design. </p>
      <p>The best results that Lambertson has had, thus far, is a yield
        of 175%. He is presently making a study of simplification of his
        method to one E-dam and one lamp load, and he plans to build
        several revised models for evaluation by interested venture
        capital sources. He has identified at least three venture
        capital sources ready to invest in the new energy field of
        zero-point energy collection. </p>
      <p>Lambertson is currently working on the right combination of
        ceramic and metal for the E-Dam to boost the performance level
        of his device; stating much remains to be done. He is confident
        that he can perfect the process and foresees a time in the
        future when a modern home can be powered on energy drawn freely
        from the zero-point energy he and others believe to be all
        around us in space. "Once the general public learns that it can
        take control over its own energy supply," Lambertson says, "it
        will be like taking the genie out of the bottle." </p>

      </center>
      <p>A pioneering solid-state technology is Wingate Lambertson's
        World into Neutrinos (WIN) process. Dr. Lambertson has conducted
        materials research and development for such organizations as
        U.S. Steel, the Universities of Toledo and Rutgers, Argonne
        National Laboratory, the Carborundum Company and Spindletop. He
        has been doing independent research over the past two decades on
        a a solid state device which he believes can provide a practical
        source of power through the harnessing of zero-point energy.3 </p>
      <p>Lamberton's "electron dam" (E-dam) is made out of Cermet, a
        highly advanced heat-resistant ceramic and metal composite. An
        accelerated electrical charge sends a stream of electrons into
        the E-dam, and the electrons become stored much like a
        conventional dam stores water. When the electrons are released,
        they gain energy from the zero-point energy present in the
        E-dam. After they flow into the unit to be powered, they move
        into another E-dam for recycling. </p>
      <p>Lambertson changed his cermet chemistry and E-dam design when
        he learned that an unexpected chemical reaction was taking
        place. A different combination of materials and composite design
        appears to stabilize the process, and a yield of 145 percent was
        achieved in tests conducted in 1998. Since that time an
        induction effect has become a major problem which severely
        inhibits charge acceleration and yield. The present direction of
        his research is towards reducing induction in his E-dam using
        two different complementary approaches. It appears that these
        approaches will solve his remaining major problem. His highest
        yield using these approaches in June 1999 was 109 percent.
        Lambertson is confident that he will achieve higher yields with
        further experimentation, probably as high as 200 per cent, the
        level needed for commercial viability. He is currently exploring
        future production with interested manufacturers. Lambertson has
        a strong interest in providing new solutions for the energy
        needs of developing nations. </p>
      <p>Highly regarded Canadian inventor John Hutchinson has developed
        a solid state "crystal energy converter" made out of very common
        materials which is an electrical power source he claims behaves
        like a battery and never runs down. This small, self-running
        power source, which typically puts out DC power amounting to one
        or two volts, has produced up to six watts of power, and he
        believes it could be engineered to replace batteries and other
        power needs.<br>

      In Florida, Dr. Wingate Lambertson light a series of bulbs, he
      said, the electricity energy in the room. Lambertson is a former
      director of the Science and Technology Commission of Kentucky, and
      it took him years to overcome his academic skepticism of those who
      claimed to be able to get something out of nothing - the energy
      available in space could be captured and used for practical
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      After over twenty years of research and experimentation,
      Lambertson is now sure that the energy of the space can be
      transformed into a working power source through a process he
      called the World in Neutrinos ( World Into Neutrinos = WIN). He
      intends to manufacture small parts, which will probably be placed
      on the outside of the house, on a small concrete foundation, as
      are air conditioners today, joined by son in the main electrical
      panel in homes. Their price: $ 3,000; we can buy or rent - it's
      cheaper than buying or leasing a car.<br>
      <br>
      The most important part of the process is the WIN-E displeasure
      Lambertson, and most important component of E-dam is the cermet.
      The cermet is a composite ceramic and heat-resistant metal,
      invented in 1948, NASA contemplated use in nozzles of its rocket
      and turbine blades in jet engines. Lambertson, who spent most of
      his career working on advanced ceramics, is now testing what
      cermet be best for his camera. The E-dam contains a disc-shaped
      plate cermet of about 7.5 centimeters in diameter, placed between
      metal plates of the same size. The process begins with an
      electrical charge (actually an electron current) provided by a
      standard source of energy. The charge flows into the E-dam, where
      it is retained in the cermet "it stores the electrons like a dam
      usually holds water," says Lambertson. When the dam is opened, the
      electrons are released. When accelerating, the ropy electrons
      gaining energy through the energy of this space in the E-dam. This
      energy gain allows the device to release more power than it
      consumes. The flow of electrons then enters the object you want to
      run, such as a light bulb, and then enters another E-dam for a new
      cycle. Lambertson said that the method can never be dangerous, if
      the energy was too large, the E-dams overheat and would stop the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      For years Lambertson was more interested in proving that the
      process is capable of obtaining energy, rather than how much
      energy was won, because he thought the adaptation process to
      higher yields was a relatively simple technical problem. When the
      first of three patent applications was rejected, he finally took
      very good because it forced him to look more closely
      bibliographies energy space. In fall 1994, he improved the process
      to the point that it produced two times more energy than it
      consumes.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Remembering energy inventor Dr. Lambertson</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      At the end of July my next bimonthly column – this time honoring
      Dr. Wingate Lambertson — will be published in Atlantis Rising
      magazine. He died recently, mere weeks before his 90th birthday.
      His wife Eileen passed on earlier this year. They had chosen
      Florida for most of their retirement years, so his final month was
      also shadowed by news of oil drifting toward familiar beaches.<br>
      <br>
      Seeing the possibility of a new energy source, Dr. Lambertson had
      wanted to bring clean energy and jobs to replace coal mining in
      his home state of Kentucky.<br>
      <br>
      But he didn’t ever get the funding that could have hired a team of
      specialists to help him refine and further develop his solid-state
      “zero-point energy” converter. (He named the method — which was
      based on acceleration of electron charges — the World into
      Neutrinos (WIN) process.) At the end of this lifetime he had a
      dream telling him that in the year 2018 his process would finally
      be ready for use by the world. Before his daughter told me about
      that dream, I wondered why I decided to write my Report from the
      Front column about an invention whose inventor didn’t live to see
      it vindicated.<br>
      <br>
      Then I received confidential information from another scientist,
      whose very recent small-scale but precise experiments, done in
      collaboration with a colleague, “prove that a ‘field’ exists in
      space which can do work on a mechanical system to increase its
      kinetic energy when acceleration is present.”<br>
      <br>
      The cautious experimenter speculated: “Possibly, this field is a
      consequence of the ether Einstein alluded to in 1920.” (A patent
      is pending on the device used in this new experiment, so no more
      will be said about it at this time.)<br>
      <br>
      Coincidentally, acceleration (in Dr. Lambertson’s case it was
      acceleration of electron charges) was the vital part of both
      experiments, including the un-named device tested this month.
      Acceleration was the factor that Win Lambertson believed enabled
      his WIN system to tap into the background energy of space and
      therefore added excess energy to the output of his system.<br>
      <br>
      He wasn’t a stereotypical garage inventor. Instead, he was a
      former executive director of Kentucky’s Science and Technology
      Commission who overcome his academic skepticism about
      extraordinary claims that energy freely available from space could
      be tapped for useful work.<br>
      <br>
      Following are excerpts from what his daughter wrote:<br>
      <br>
      Wingate Augustus Lambertson, Ph.D., 89, of Lexington, Kentucky,
      departed this earth on May 10, 2010 at St. Joseph Hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Lambertson attended Rutgers University where he received his
      masters and Ph.D. in Ceramic Engineering.&nbsp; While at Rutgers,
      he invented a ceramic coating for boiler-furnace refractories for
      use by the Navy.&nbsp; This invention proved to add substantially
      to boiler life for the Navy fleet and was very important to the
      sea-keeping ability of the fleet.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Lambertson left Rutgers to work in Chicago at the Argonne
      National Laboratories.&nbsp; While there, he worked on refractory
      problem involved in atomic energy.&nbsp; He then went to Toledo,
      Ohio, to teach at Toledo University.&nbsp; Next he went to Grand
      Island, NY to work at Carborundum.&nbsp; In 1963 he moved his
      family to Lexington, KY to work at Spindletop Research where he
      once again was doing research.<br>
      <br>
      He retired to Florida in 1980 where he could devote all his time
      to his energy research, specifically Zero Point Energy, ZPE.&nbsp;
      He was a dreamer beyond his time and very late in life still
      believed that there is a very viable energy source out there and
      believed that it will come to fruition in 2018.&nbsp; He continued
      reading and writing right up to the end of his very active life.<br>
      <br>
      A memorial was held on Thursday, May 13, 2010 in Lexington, KY and
      his ashes are buried next to his beloved wife of 63 years who
      passed away on January 25, 2010.<br>
      <br>
      The following is adapted from my earlier book, The Coming Energy
      Revolution (Avery Publishing Group, 1996, now out of print):<br>
      <br>
      THE CERMET OF WINGATE LAMBERTSON<br>
      <br>
      In Florida, Wingate Lambertson, Ph.D., lights a row of lamps in
      his garage using what he says is electricity taken from the energy
      of space. It took years for Lambertson, a former director of
      Kentucky’s Science and Technology Commission, to overcome his
      academic skepticism about claims that you could get something for
      nothing yet energy freely available from space could be tapped for
      useful work.<br>
      <br>
      After getting his doctorate from Rutgers University, Lambertson
      worked for United States Steel in Chicago before going into the
      United States Navy. After going back to Rutgers for more
      postgraduate work, he joined Argonne National Laboratory, where he
      worked on nuclear fuel technology.<br>
      <br>
      Then Lambertson discovered the large body of space-energy
      literature that has been written by researchers in the field.
      Eventually, he came to believe that something similar to an aether
      – the basic stuff of the universe — could exist, and that where
      collected, it could be used to make electricity.<br>
      <br>
      After decades of research and experimentation, Lambertson was
      certain that space energy can be turned into a practical power
      source through a process he called World Into Neutrinos (WIN). He
      envisioned it being engineered into units that will probably be
      set outside the home on a small concrete pad, like central air
      conditioning units are now, and wired into the home’s master
      electric switchbox. The price? Cheaper than buying or leasing a
      modestly-priced car.<br>
      <br>
      The most important part of the WIN process was Lambertson’s E-dam,
      and the most interesting component in the E-dam was cermet. Cermet
      is a heat-resistant ceramic-and-metal composite invented in 1948
      and considered by NASA for rocket nozzles and jet-engine turbine
      blades. Lambertson, who spent almost his entire career working
      with advanced ceramics, experimented to develop the best cermet
      for his device. The E-dam contains a plate of cermet formed into a
      round spacer about three inches in diameter, sandwiched between
      metal plates of the same size.<br>
      <br>
      The process starts with an electrical charge, a stream of
      electrons from a standard power supply. The charge flows into the
      E-dam, where it is held in the cermet: “It stores electrons like a
      regular dam stores water,” Lambertson said. When the dam is
      opened, the electrons are released. As they accelerate, the
      falling electrons gain energy from the space energy that is
      present in the E-dam. This gain in energy is what allows the
      device to put out more power than it takes in.<br>
      <br>
      The current of electrons then flows into the device to be powered,
      such as a lamp, and then moves into another E-dam for recycling.
      Lambertson said there is no way for the process to become
      dangerous – if too much power were generated, the E-dams would
      overheat, shutting down the system.<br>
      <br>
      For years, Lambertson was more interested in proving that the
      process gained energy than in the actual amount of energy gained,
      since he thought scaling up the process to higher efficiencies
      would be a relatively simple engineering problem. When his first
      of three patent applications was rejected, he saw it as a blessing
      because it forced him to study the space-energy literature more
      carefully. Eventually, he improved the process to the point where
      it put out twice as much energy as it started with, but he still
      needed to perfect it into a reliable product.<br>

          CARBIDE BODIES HAVING SHAPED CAVITIES</b><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      This invention relates to improvements in hot pressing refractory
      carbide bodies, and more particularly to a new and improved method
      of forming hot pressed refractory carbide bodies having shaped
      cavities.<br>
      <br>
      A primary object of the present invention is to form a hot pressed
      refractory carbide body having a shaped cavity by filling the
      oversize cavity in the oversize body with a water-reactive carbide
      forming or 10 containing mixture and by heating such body above
      the reactive carbide forming temperature prior to hot pressing to
      size and shape.<br>
      <br>
      Following such hot pressing, the mixture is readily removed by
      reacting the reactive carbide with water, thereby leaving a cavity
      of the desired size and shape in the hot pressed refractory
      carbide body.<br>
      <br>
      Additional objects and advantages of the invention will become
      apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description
      and accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

      Referring to Figs. 1-3, which are generally to scale, the
      inventive method is shown as applied to forming a cup-shaped, hot
      pressed refractory carbide body having a shaped cavity in
      accordance with the following example.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 1<br>
      <br>
      239.3 grams of niobium carbide having a particle size of -325 mesh
      was mixed with 15 cc of a 10 percent polyvinyl alcohol solution
      and cold pressed to form an oversize cup-shaped, cylindrical body
      10 having the following approximate dimensions: an outer diameter
      of 10 1-5/8 inches, an inner diameter of 1-1/8 inches, an overall
      length of 3 inches and a bottom wall thickness of l/2 inch, and
      being provided with an oversize cavity 12. After drying, body 10
      was placed in a cylindrical graphite mold 14 having opposed
      plungers 16, 18 and its cavity 12 was filled with a water-reactive
      carbide containing mixture 20 of equal volumes of calcium carbide
      having a particle size range of +60 -40 mesh and 20 grams of
      amorphous carbon having a particle size range of +600 -325 mesh.
      Body 10 was heated in an induction furnace (not shown) under argon
      and no applied positive mechanical pressure until the temperature
      reached 1000°C. At this 20 point, while the heating continued, the
      plungers 16, 18 were actuated by suitable means (not shown) to
      maintain contact pressure with body 10 and which pressure was
      gradually increased from 1400°C to a maximum of 3000 pounds per
      square inch at the hot pressing temperature of 2000°C. This
      maximum pressure was held at 2000°C for 20 minutes until the hot
      pressing operation was completed, with the total time of the run
      being 80 minutes. The furnace was shut off and the pressure
      released during cooling.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 2, the hot pressed refractory carbide body 100
      was reduced to the desired size and shape, having about the same
      outer 30 and inner diameters as body 10, but a reduced length of
      about 1-1/2<br>
      inches, and a reduced bottom wall thickness of about l/4 inch. At
      the same time, the cavity 120 was also reduced to the desired size
      and shape, while the hot pressed mixture 200 continued to fill
      cavity 120.<br>
      <br>
      When body 100 had cooled sufficiently to permit handling, it was
      removed from mold 14, and immersed in water. Thereupon, the entire
      mixture was readily removed by reaction between the calcium
      carbide and the water, leaving the hot pressed body 100 and cavity
      120 of the desired size and shape, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figs. 4-6, which are generally to scale, but enlarged
      in the horizontal direction to more clearly illustrate structural
      details, the inventive method is shown as applied to forming a
      serrated hot pressed refractory carbide body having shaped
      cavities or serra-10 tions in accordance with the following
      examples.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 2<br>
      <br>
      Fifty grams of niobium carbide having a particle size of -325 mesh
      was loaded into a cylindrical graphite mold 22 having an internal
      diameter of 1 inch and oppositely disposed plungers 24, 26. This
      was lightly compressed to form circular bottom layer 28a of
      oversize body 28. Then, a 1 inch wide sheet metal divider (not
      shown) was set on edge .into the mold touching the layer 28a. One
      side was loaded with 12.5 grams of the niobium carbide and the
      other side with an equal volume of a water-reactive carbide
      containing mixture, both sides being 20 lightly compressed to the
      same height to form semi-circular layers 28b of body 28 and 30a of
      the mixture filling lower oversize cavity 32a of the body. The
      water-reactive carbide containing mixture was composed of, by
      volume, 25 percent calcium carbide having a particle size range of
      +60 -40 mesh and 75 percent amorphous carbon having a particle
      size range of +600 -325 mesh.<br>
      <br>
      Another, intermediate circular layer 28c of 50 grams of niobium
      carbide was loaded and compressed above the divided layers 28b,
      30a, followed by loading and compressing of corresponding divided
      layers 28d, 30b and the final or top layer 28e corresponding to
      layers 28a and 28c. 30 Thus, the oversize serrated refractory
      carbide body 28 was completed to have the following approximate
      dimensions, an outer diameter of 1 inch, an overall height of
      3-1/2 inches and three circular layers 28a, 28c, 28e each 5/6 inch
      thick and separated by two oversize cavities 32a, 32b each 1/2
      inch thick and filled with layers 30a, 30b respectively of the
      water-reactive carbide containing mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Body 28 was heated in an induction furnace (not shown) under argon
      and only contact pressure by plungers 24, 26 up to the hot
      pressing temperature of 1500°C. At this temperature, the plungers
      24, 26 were actuated to increase the positively applied mechanical
      pressure to the maximum of 1000 pounds per square inch, which was
      held for 20 minutes until the hot pressing operation was
      completed, with the total time of the run being 77 minutes. At
      this point, the furnace was shut off and 10 the pressure released
      during cooling.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 5, the resulting hot pressed refractory carbide
      body 280 was reduced to the desired size and shape, having the
      same outer diameter as body 28, but a shorter length of about
      2-5/8 inches, the thickness of layers 280a, 280c, and 280e being
      reduced to about 5/8 inch each, and the thickness of cavities
      320a, 320b and layers 280b, 280d being reduced to about 3/8 inch
      each, with the hot pressed mixture of layers 300a and 300b filling
      cavities 320a, 320b.<br>
      <br>
      When body 280 had cooled sufficiently to permit handling, it was
      removed from mold 22 and immersed in water. Within 10 minutes,
      most 20 of the moderate and steady reaction between the
      water-reactive carbide and the water was completed permitting
      ready removal of layers 300a, 300b. It was noted that while C2H2
      was evolving during the reaction, it literally "kicked" the excess
      carbon out into the water, thereby assisting in ejection of the
      layers 300a, 300b from cavities 320a, 320b respectively. When
      removed from the water, the hot pressed body 280 and cavities
      320a, 320b were: of the desired size and shape, as shown in Fig.
      6.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 3<br>
      <br>
      Example 2 was repeated, except that the water-reactive carbide 30
      containing mixture of layers 30a, 30b was composed of, by volume,<br>
      <br>
      10 percent aluminum carbide having a particle size of -200 mesh
      and 90 percent carbon. Actually a combination, by volume, of 75
      percent aluminum carbide and 25 percent graphitic carbon having a
      particle size of -200 mesh was mixed with enough amorphous carbon
      having a particle size range of +600 -325 mesh to provide the
      aforesaid mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Following completion of the 68 minute run and cooling, body 280
      was immersed in water, as before. While the reaction was slow, it
      was steady, and eventually layers 300a and 300b disintegrated and
      dropped out leaving a serrated body of the desired size and shape.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 4<br>
      <br>
      Example 2 was repeated, except that the water-reactive carbide
      forming mixture of layers 30a, 30b was composed of, by volume, 6.5
      10 percent aluminum having a particle size of 270 mesh and 93.5
      percent amorphous carbon having a particle size range of +600 -325
      mesh. The purpose of this mixture was to produce a partially
      converted mixture during firing of, by volume, 10 percent aluminum
      carbide and 90 percent carbon.<br>
      <br>
      Following the 80 minute run and cooling, body 280 was immersed in
      water with immediate reaction. Although the reaction was slow, it
      was steady, and eventually layers 300a and 300b disintegrated and
      dropped out, leaving a serrated body of the desired shape.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing, it is now evident how the invention 20
      accomplishes the desired results and numerous advantages of the
      invention likewise are apparent. While the inventive method has
      been described and illustrated herein by reference to certain
      preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various changes
      and modifications may be made therein by those skilled in the art
      without departing from the inventive concept, the scope of which
      is to be determined by the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      For example, while niobium carbide was used in the examples, the
      inventive method is equally applicable to hot pressing various
      refractory carbides such as ZrC, HfC, SiC, TaC, and B^C. Likewise,
      a water-reactive 30 carbide forming mixture composed of calcium
      said carbon could be used in the inventive method, provided
      calcium of sufficiently small particle size, on the order of about
      -200 mesh is employed and care is taken to prevent oxidation.<br>

      <br>
      Semi-conductor Devices We, THE CARBORUNDUM COMPANY, of Niagara
      Falls, in the County of Niagara and State of New York, United
      States of America, a Gorporation organized and existing under the
      laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, do hereby
      declare the invention, for which we pray that a Patent may be
      granted to us, and the method by which it is to be performed, to
      be particularly described in and by the following statement: -<br>
      <br>
      THIS INVENTION RELATES TO electrical resistance bodies, and more
      particularly to thermistor assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      A thermistor, as the term is employed herein, is an electrical
      resistance body having a high sensitivity to changes in
      temperature over a wide temperature range. Thus its electrical
      resistance is sensitive to change with changes in temperature.
      Thermistors which decrease in resistivity with increase in
      temperature are said to have a negative temperature coefficient of
      resistivity.<br>
      <br>
      Thermistors are widely employed in temperature measuring and
      controlling devices and their uses have grown very rapidly in
      recent years. Among present uses of thermistors are included
      replacements for thermocouples, especially for use at moderate
      temperatures up to about 600 F. In this application they offer
      several advantages over thermocouples, since they are more
      sensitive to temperature change than thermocouples.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, thermocouples produce a relatively weak signal which
      must be amplified to actuate controlling circuits, whereas
      thermistors are adapted to actuate relays directly, thereby
      minimizing the cost of control equipment. Thermistors are also
      used to compensate for changes in amBient temperature in order to
      maintain the accuracy of electrical measuring equipment over wide
      ranges of _ ambient temperature. Thermistors are also useful in
      time-delay applications.<br>
      <br>
      An object of the present invention is to provide improved
      thermistor assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, there is provided a thermistor
      assembly, comprising a single crystal of pure silicon carbide or
      silicon carbide modified by the presence throughout the body
      thereof of an element selected from Groups IIIA and VA of the
      periodic chart, and electrical leads joined by high temperature
      fusion respectively to isolated areas of said crystal.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of
      example, with reference to the accompanying drawing in
      which:Figure 1 is a perspective view of a thermistor assembly made
      in accordance with the present invention; and Figure 2 is a top
      plan view of an operating device embodying the thermistor of
      Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us3205465.jpg" height="641"
          width="457"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention a selected silicon
      carbide, in the form of a single crystal, is positioned between at
      least two electrically-conductive leads and in contact therewith.
      The parts are then secured in relationship to each other as by the
      spring tension of the leads and thereafter subjected to a
      temperature sufficient to fuse the leads to contact points of the
      crystal. The fusion is preferably performed in a protective
      atmosphere such as argon, helium, hydrogen or vacuum to avoid
      oxidation of the leads and the silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      The fusion can be effected in two different ways. In one method of
      fusion, which has been employed in the present invention, the
      electrical leads are Tieated by their inherent resistance by
      passing an electrical current therethrough to bring them to fusion
      temperature for a sufficient interval of time to If effect the
      fusion and joining. As an alternative of this method, a heating
      circuit can be established from a source of current through one
      lead, thence through the crystal, back through the other lead, and
      to the source of current.<br>
      <br>
      In a second method, the entire assembly is placed in a furnace and
      raised to a temperature at which the fusion will be effected.<br>
      <br>
      As will be seen in the drawings, thermistor assemblies of the
      present invention include a single crystal 10 of silicon carbide
      which is positioned between two electrical leads 11.<br>
      <br>
      The parts are assembled and held in fixed relationship to each
      other and heated to fusion temperature by one of the methods
      hereinbefore described to join the electrical leads to isolated
      points of the crystal. As shown in Figure 1, a globule of ceramic
      or porcelain cement 12 is thereafter placed on either side of the
      crystal 10, in surrounding relationship to the electrical leads
      and is allowed to harden to hold the parts in fixed, assembled
      relationship, and to strengthen the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      An operating device, made in accordance with the present invention
      is illustrated in Figure 2. As shown in this latter figure, the
      crystal I0 of silicon carbide is fused between two isolated
      electrical leads 11 which are supported on either side of the
      crystal by globules of ceramic cement 12. The terminal ends 13 of
      the electrical leads are exposed to the atmosphere, beyond the
      ceramic cement. However, the other ends of the electrical leads
      extend into a twin conduit porcelain insulator 14 which can be a
      part of a probe assembly, of which the thermistor assembly forms a
      part.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon carbide crystals applicable to use in the present
      invention include the following 5 types:<br>
      <br>
      1. Intrinsic. This designation relates to theoretically pure
      silicon carbide. Intrinsic silicon carbide would provide a high
      resistivity material with a very high sensitivity to temperature
      changes. It would have a B value of 27,600 K.<br>
      <br>
      The B value or characteristic is a measure of the sensitivity of
      the resistance of the body to temperature change over a given
      range of temperature. It is calculated from the formula 2.303 log
      R, R2 B1 1 T, T2 wherein R1 equals the resistance in ohms at
      temperature (T,) and R2 equals the resistance in ohms at
      temperature (To) and T, and T2 are temperatures in degrees Kelvin.<br>
      <br>
      2. Compensated. This designation relates to silicon catrbide
      having P-type and N-type impurities consisting of elements of
      groups IIA and VA of the periodic table in balanced amounts, in
      trace quantities of only a few parts per million. Compensated
      silicon carbide may have a resistivity from about 100 ohmcm, to 10
      ohm-cm, at room temperature, depending upon how well compensated
      the particular material happens to be. Commercial colourless
      silicon carbide is a typical compensated material and has a B
      value of about 2000 K. Commercial colourless crystals are obtained
      by selecting them from commercial green crude silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      3. P-type. This designation relates to silicon carbide
      characterised by electrical conduction by positive charge
      carriers. The positive charge carriers are pictured as the absence
      of electrons (holes). A P-type semiconductor contains a small but
      effective amount of trivalent impurity namely elements from group
      IliA of the periodic chart, which cause impurity semiconduction by
      motion of positive electrical charge carriers. These include
      boron, aluminium and gallium in trace amounts.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial black silicon carbide contains P-type crystals which
      usually have a room temperature electrical resistivity in the
      range from about 0.1 to about 1 ohm-cm., depending upon the
      concentration of impurity.<br>
      <br>
      P-type gilicon carbide crystals having an impurity level
      sufficiently high to impart a resistivity of about 10 ohm-cm.
      could be quite useful as a high wattage thermistor.<br>
      <br>
      In the P-type materials, aluminium and boron can provide B values
      of about 2500 K.<br>
      <br>
      4. N-type. This designation relates to silicon carbide in which
      electrical conduction occurs by motion of negative charge
      carriers.<br>
      <br>
      The resistivity is low, being in the range 100 from about 0.01 to
      0.1 ohm-cm., and it is characterized by low sensitivity to thermal
      change.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial green silicon carbide contains N-type crystals, the
      presence of nitrogen 105 therein in trace amounts contributing
      N-type characteristics. A B value of about 1250 K is provided by
      nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Phosphorus and arsenic in trace amounts also contribute N-type
      characteristics. Thus 110 the N-type materials include nitrogen,
      phosphorus or arsen'ic, representing Group VA of the periodic
      chart of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      N-type silicon carbide would be quite useful as a thermistor for
      very low temperature 115 indications in the vicinity of the
      temperature of liquid oxygen. The low resistivity and the low
      temperature sensitivity of resistivity of N-type silicon carbide
      would be an advantage in this range. P-type and N-type silicon
      123) carbide, of the 5 materials contemplated for use in the
      present invention, are of the lowest resistivity, and the
      resistivity will depend upon the concentration of impurities,
      990,417 990,417 However, a given amount of impurities of the
      P-type silicon carbide would be higher in resistivity than the
      same amount of impurities of the N-type silicon carbide. Likewise
      the temperature sensitivity of resistivity for the P-type material
      would be higher than that for the N-type material.<br>
      <br>
      5. Boron solid solution with silicon carbide. This material is
      readily distinguishable from P-type silicon carbide. The Ptype
      silicon carbide containing boron is lower in resistivity, the
      boron level being in the range below 0.01% by weight. However, the
      solid solution of boron in silicon carbide, boron content above
      about 1% by weight, shows an increase in resistivity due to the
      distortion of the silicon carbide lattice.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals of boron solid solution with silicon carbide are
      obviously different from normal silicon carbide crystals; they
      have a definite fish scale appearance, whereas, silicon carbide
      crystals show definite formations of hexagonal crystal faces.
      There is also a definite shift in the X-ray diffraction lines
      produced from the crystals of boron solid solution with silicon
      carbide. This is proof that the normal silicon carbide crystal
      lattice has been distorted and the spacing between individual
      atoms has been changed.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals of boron solid solution with silicon carbide can be
      formed by two methods.<br>
      <br>
      In one method, silicon carbide is recrystallized in the presence
      of boron. In the other method the crystals are formed directly
      from a mix containing silicon carbide-formning ingredients, namely
      SiO, and carbon, and a desired amount of boron.<br>
      <br>
      Thermistors made in accordance with the present invention, from
      boron solid solutions with silicon carbide have generally
      displayed B values in the range from about 1200 K. to about 1800
      K.<br>
      <br>
      A thermistor of boron solid solution with silicon carbide is
      advantageous because the electrical properties are not sensitive
      to minor fluctuations of boron content. For example, when boron in
      the range from about 1 to about 10% by weight is added to the mix
      before the crystals are formed by recrystallization, there is very
      little difference 'in the resistivity of the resultant crystals at
      room temperature. A boron content from about 1 to about 3% by
      weight is provided by the above additions of boron.<br>
      <br>
      The following specific examples illustrate and highlight the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE I<br>
      <br>
      A pair of tungsten lead Wires approximately 0.005 inch in diameter
      were supported at their ends by spot welding to the ends of larger
      diameter nickel wires and a crystal of compensated silicon carbide
      approximately 0.05 inch square by 0.01 inch thick was positioned
      therebetween with the opposite major surfaces of the crystal
      contacting the leads. The crystal was held by the spring tension
      of the leads.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter alternating current at 2.5 amperes and 6-8 volts was
      run through the leads until they were heated to a temperature of
      about 1950 C., which was maintained for a period of about 5
      seconds to weld the leads to the crystal. The assembly was then
      cooled and globules of ceramic cement were applied to the lead
      wires adjacent the crystal to strengthen the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The thermistor so produced had a B value of 1860 K.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE II<br>
      <br>
      A pair of tungsten lead wires approximately 0.005 inch in diameter
      were supported at their ends by spot welding to the ends of larger
      diameter nickel wires and a crystal of boron solid solution with
      silicon carbide containing about 3% by weight of boron,
      approximately 0.05 inch square by 0.01 inch thick was positioned
      therebetween with the opposite major surfaces of the crystal
      contacting the leads. The crystal was held by the spring tension
      of the leads.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter alternating current at 2.5 amps and 6-8 volts was run
      through the leads until they were heated to a temperature of about
      1950 C., which was maintained for a period of about 5 seconds to
      weld the leads to the crystal. The assembly was then cooled and
      globules of ceramic cement were applied to the lead wires adjacent
      the crystal to strengthen the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The thermistor so produced had a B value of 1500 K.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of the Groups liIA and VA elements to be included
      within silicon carbide crystals for use in the present invention
      will be in the range of a significant amount up to about 5% by
      weight of the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical leads adapted to use in the present invention are of a
      selected number.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that those made of substantially pure tungsten
      and substantially pure tantalum are preferred. However, it is to
      be included within the scope of the invention to utilize leads
      made of tungstentantalum alloys and of alloys of tungsten and
      tantalum with other alloying metals.<br>
      <br>
      Rhenium, molybdenum and iridium can also be employed. Other metals
      such as iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium and platinum can be used.
      However, when the latter metals are used, some free silicon should
      be added at the interface, otherwise a graphite layer tends to
      form at the interface between the metal and the crysal which
      weakens the bond.<br>
      <br>
      The lead wires can be placed on opposite faces of the crystal to
      form a thermistor, and this is a convenient way to form the
      device. Also the lead wires can be attached to opposite edges of
      the crystals or to isolated areas on one face of the crystal. In
      forming the thermistor, the crystal is preferably supported
      between leads by the spring tension of the leads so that no
      extraneous supporting structure is present to contaminate the
      finished thermistor.<br>

      <br>
      This invention relates to electrical resistance bodies, and more
      particularly to thermistor assemblies including a single crystal
      of a silicon carbide»<br>
      <br>
      A thermistor, as the term is employed herein, is an electrical
      resistance body having a high sensitivity to changes in
      temperature over a wide temperature range. Thus its electrical
      resistance is sensitive to change with changes in temperature.
      Thermistors which decrease in resistivity with increase in
      temperature are said to have a negative temperature coefficient of
      resistivity.<br>
      <br>
      Thermistors are widely employed in temperature measuring and
      controlling devices and their uses have grown very rapidly in
      recent years. Among present uses of thermistors are included
      replacements for thermocouples, especially for use at moderate
      temperatures up to about 600°F, In this application they offer
      several advantages over thermocouples, since they are more
      sensitive to temperature change than thermocouples. Furthermore,
      thermocouples produce a relatively weak signal which must be
      amplified to actuate controlling circuits, whereas thermistors are
      adapted to actuate relays directly, thereby minimizing the cost of
      control equipment. Thermistors are also used to compensate for
      changes in ambient temperature in order to maintain the accurancy
      of electrical measuring equipment over wide ranges of ambient
      temperature. Thermistors are also useful in time-delay
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      It is an important object of the present invention to provide
      novel thermistor assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide thermistor assemblies made of a
      single crystal of pure silicon carbide or of a selected silicon
      carbide characterized by the presence throughout the body thereof
      of an element from Groups IIIA and VA of the period chart.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide a thermistor assembly made up of a
      silicon carbide crystal and having electrical leads joined to
      isolated points of said crystal by high temperature fusion only#<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages accruing from the invention
      will become more apparent from the following description and the
      accompanying drawings, wherein<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="ca661137a.jpg" height="623"
          width="466"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention a selected silicon
      carbide, in the form of a single crystal, is positioned between at
      least two electrically-conductive leads and in contact therewith.
      The parts are then secured in relationship to each other as by the
      spring tension of the leads and thereafter subjected to a
      temperature sufficient to fuse the leads to contact point s of the
      crystal. The fusion is preferably performed in a protective
      atmosphere such as argon, helium, hydrogen or vacuum to avoid
      oxidation of the leads and the silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      The fusion can be effected in two different ways. In one method of
      fusion, which has been employed in the present invention, the
      electrical leads are heated by their inherent resistance by
      passing an electrical current therethrough to bring them to fusion
      temperature for a sufficient interval of time to effect the fusion
      and joinder. As an alternative of this method, a heating circuit
      can be established from a source of current through one lead,
      thence through the crystal, back through the other lead, and to
      the source of current.<br>
      <br>
      In a second method, the entii*e assembly is placed in a furnace
      and raised to a temperature at which the fusion will be effected.<br>
      <br>
      As will be seen in the drawings, thermistor assemblies of thé
      present invention include a single crystal 10 of silicon carbide
      which is positioned between two electrical leads 11. The parts are
      assembled and held in fixed relationship to each other and heated
      to fusion temperature by one of the methods hereinbefore described
      to join the electrical leads to isolated points of the crystal. As
      shown in Pig. 1, a globule of ceramic or porcelain cement 12 is
      thereafter placed on either side of the crystal 10, in surrounding
      relationship to the electrical leads and is allowed to harden to
      hold the parts in fixed, assembled relationship, and to strengthen
      the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      An operating device, made in accordance with the present invention
      is illustrated in Pig. 2, As shown in this latter figure, the
      crystal 10 of silicon carbide is fused between two isolated
      electrical leads 11 which are supported on either side of the
      crystal by globules of ceramic cement 12. The terminal ends 13 of
      the electrical leads are exposed to the atmosphere, beyond the
      ceramic cement. However, the other ends of the electrical leads
      extend into a twin conduit porcelain insulator 11+ which can be a
      part of a probe assembly of which the thermistor assembly forms a
      part.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon carbide crystals applicable to use in the present
      invention include the following 5 types:<br>
      <br>
      1, Intrinsic. This designation relates to theoretically pure
      silicon carbide. Intrinsic silicon carbide would provide a high
      resistivity material with a very high sensitivity to temperature
      changes. It would have a B value of 27,600°K.<br>
      <br>
      The B value or characteristic is a measure of the sensitivity of
      the resistance of the body to temperature change over a given
      range of temperature. It is calculated from the formula<br>
      <br>
      2.303 log Rj<br>
      <br>
      B = 1-1 . T ^2<br>
      <br>
      wherein R^ equals the resistance in ohms at temperature (T^) and
      Rg equals the resistance in ohms at temperature (T^) and T^ and Tg
      are temperatures in degrees Kelvin,<br>
      <br>
      2, Compensated. This designation relates to silicon carbide having
      P-type and N-type impurities in balanced amounts, in trace
      quantities of only a few parts per million. Compensated silicon
      carbide may have a resistivity from about 100 ohm-cm. to 10^
      ohm-cm. at room temperature, depending upon how well compensated
      the particular material happens to be. Commercial colorless
      silicon carbide is a typical compensated material and has a B
      value of about 2000°K. Commercial colorless crystals are obtained
      by selecting them from commercial green crude silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      3. P-type. This designation relates to silicon carbide
      characterized by electrical conduction by positive charge
      carriers. The positive charge carriers are pictured as the absence
      of electrons (holes). A P-type semiconductor contains a small but
      effective amount of trivalent impurity such as elements from
      column IIIA of the periodic chart, which cause impurity
      semiconduction by motion of positive electrical charge carriers.
      These include boron, aluminum and gallium in trace amounts.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial black silicon carbide contains P-type crystals which
      usually have a room temperature electrical resistivity in the
      range from about 0.1 to about 1 ohm-cm., depending upon the
      concentration of impurity.<br>
      <br>
      P-type silicon carbide crystals having an impurity level
      sufficiently high to impart a resistivity of about 10 ohm-cm,
      could be quite useful as a high wattage thermistor. i<br>
      <br>
      In the P-type materials, aluminum and boron provide B values of
      about 2j?00 K.<br>
      <br>
      ]+. N-type. This designation relates to silicon carbide in which
      electrical conduction occurs by motion of negative charge
      carriers. The resistivity is low, being in the range from about
      0,01 to 0.1 ohm-cm., and it is characterized by low sensitivity to
      thermal change.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial green silicon carbide contains N-type crystals, the
      presence of nitrogen therein in trace amounts contributing N-type
      characteristics, A B value of about 1250°K, is provided by
      nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Phosphorus^nd arsenic in trace amounts also contribute N-type
      characteristics. Thus the N-type materials include nitrogen,
      phosphorus and arsenic, representing Group VA of the periodic
      chart of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      N-type silicon carbide would be quite useful as a thermistor for
      very low temperature indications in the vicinity of the
      temperature of liquid oxygen. The low resistivity and the low
      temperature sensitivity of resistivity of N-type silicon carbide
      would be an advantage in this range, P-type and N-type silicon
      carbide, of the $ materials contemplated for use in the present
      invention, are of the lowest resistivity, and the resistivity will
      depend upon the concentration of impurities. However, the same
      amounts of impurities of the P-type silicon carbide would be
      higher in resistivity than the N-type silicon carbide. Likewise
      the temperature sensitivity of resistivity for the P-type material
      would be higher than that for the N-type material.<br>
      <br>
      5, Boron solid solution with silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      This material is readily distinguishable from P-type silicon
      carbide. The P-type silicon carbide containing boron is lower in
      resitivity, the boron level being in the range below 0.01$.
      However, the solid solution of boron in silicon carbide, boron
      content above about 1shows an increase in resistivity due to the
      distortion of the silicon carbide lattice.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals of boron solid solution with silicon carbide are
      obviously different from normal silicon carbide crystals; they
      have a definite fish scale appearance, whereas, silicon carbide
      crystals show definite formations of hexagonal crystal faces.
      There is also a definite shift in the X-ray diffraction lines
      produced from the crystals of boron solid solution with silicon
      carbide. This is proof that the normal silicon carbide crystal
      lattice has been distorted and the spacing between individual
      atoms bas been changed.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals of boron solid solution with silicon carbide can be
      formed by two methods. In one method, silicon carbide is
      recrystallized in the presence of boron. In the other method the
      crystals are formed directly from a mix containing silicon
      carbide-forming ingredients, namely SiC^ and carbon, and a desired
      amount of boron.<br>
      <br>
      Thermistors made in accordance with the present invention, from
      boron solid solutions with silicon carbide have generally
      displayed B values in the range from about 1200°K. to about
      l800°K.<br>
      <br>
      A thermistor of boron solid solution with silicon carbide is
      advantageous because the electrical properties are not sensitive
      to minor fluctuations of boron content. For example, when boron in
      the range from about 1 to about 10$ is added to the mix before the
      crystals are formed by reorystallization, there is verly little
      difference in the resistivity of the resultant crystals at room
      temperature, A boron content from about 1 to about 2&gt;f° by
      weight is provided by the above additions of boron.<br>
      <br>
      The following specific examples illustrate and highlight the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE I<br>
      <br>
      A pair of tungsten lead wires approximately 0.005 inch in diameter
      were supported at their ends by spot welding to the ends of larger
      diameter nickel "wires and a crystal of compensated silicon
      carbide approximately 0.05 inch square by 0.01 inch thick was
      positioned therebetween with the opposite major surfaces of the
      crystal contacting the leads. The crystal was held by the spring
      tension of the leads.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter alternating current at 2,5 amperes and i<br>
      <br>
      6-8 volts was run through the leads until they were heated i to a
      temperature of about 1950GC,, which was maintained for a period of
      about 5 seconds to weld the leads to the crystal. The assembly was
      then cooled and globules of ceramic cement were applied to the
      lead wires adjacent the crystal to strengthen the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The thermistor so produced had a B value of 1860°K,<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE II<br>
      <br>
      A pair of tungsten lead wires approximately 0*005 inch in diameter
      were supported at their ends by spot welding to the ends of larger
      diameter nickel wires and a crystal of boron solid solution with
      silicon carbide containing about yfo by weight of boron,
      approximately 0,05 inch square by 0,01 inch thick was positioned
      therebetween with the opposite major surfaces of the crystal
      contacting the leads. The crystal was held by the spring tension
      of the leads.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter alternating current at 2,5 amps and 6-8 volts was run
      through the leads until they were heated to a temperature of about
      1950°C,, which was maintained for a period of about 5 seconds to
      weld the leads to thecrystal. The assembly was then cooled and
      globule* of ceramic cement were applied to the lead wires adjacent
      the crystal to strengthen, the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The thermistor so produced had a B value of 1500°K.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of the Groups IIIA and VA elements to be Included
      within siltoon carbide crystals of the present invention will be
      in the range of a significant amount of up to about 5$ by weight
      of the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical leads adapted to use In the present invention are of a
      selected number. It has been found that those made of
      substantially pure tungsten and substantially pure tantalum are
      preferred. However, it is to be included Within the scope of the
      invention to utilize leads made of j tungsten-tantalum alloys and
      of alloys of tungsten and tanta-j lum with other alloying metals.
      Rhenium, molybdenum and iridium are also definite possibilities.
      Other metals such as iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium and platinum
      can be used. However, when the lattër metals are used, some free
      silicon should be added at the interface, otherwise a graphite
      layer tends to form at the interface between the metal and the
      crystal which weakens the bond.<br>
      <br>
      The lead wires can be placed on opposite faces of the crystal to
      form a thermistor, and this is a conveniènt way to form the
      device. Also the lead wires can be attached to opposite edges of
      the crystals or to isolated points on one face of the crystal. In
      forming the thermistor, the crystal is preferably supported
      between leads by the spring tension of the leads so that no
      extraneous supporting |structure is present to contaminate the
      finished thermistor»<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been described in connection with specific
      embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of
      further modification, and this application is intended to cover
      any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention following,
      in general, the principles of the invention and including such
      departures from the present disclosure as come within known or
      customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains and
