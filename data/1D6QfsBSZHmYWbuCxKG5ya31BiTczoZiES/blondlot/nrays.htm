      <p>During the period 1903-1906, some 120 trained scientists
        published almost 300 articles on the origins and characteristics
        of a spurious radiation, the so-called N rays. Some new
        explanations are advanced for the extensive false observations
        and the deductions made from these observations. These are based
        on visits to Nancy, France, where the purported discovery was
        first announced and after which the rays were named, on an
        interview with a former assistant who knew some of the
        principals involved in the case, and on new archival
        information. Some of the misleading statements in the subsequent
        literature and oral history dealing with N rays are challenged,
        and additional information is provided on the original
        discoverer, Rene Blondlot. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Mistakes in the process of discovery are not rare in physics
        and the other sciences. Of special interest to physicists is the
        purported discovery of N rays in 1903 by Rene Blondlot, a
        professor of physics at the University of Nancy, France. Here is
        a case unequalled in the number of scientists actively involved
        and the number of notes and papers published in the scientific
        journals of the day by scientists qualified by education,
        academic appointment, and reputation to belong to the community
        of scholars. Some 120 scientists published almost 300 articles
        on the topic during the years 1903-1906, and the original
        discoverer himself published 26 articles and a book (Ref. 1)
        before halting, while one of his colleagues published no fewer
        than 38 reports in the same three-year period -- all on "rays"
        which have never since been observed. (Ref. 2) </p>
      <p>American physicists, if aware of the case at all, are usually
        limited in their knowledge to the information found in an
        account by de Solla Price (Ref. 3) and a popular biography of
        the American physicist, R.W. Wood (Ref. 4). It is the purpose of
        this present contribution to correct certain notions about this
        case presented in that biography, add information gathered
        during visits to the city where the first experiments took
        place, and provide a bibliography, especially of references not
        likely to be discovered by or available to US physicists. </p>
      <p><b>The Purported Discoveries</b> </p>
      <p>That such a protracted series of publications could be possible
        is largely explicable from the fact that the observations of the
        alleged radiation consisted of subjective viewing by the eye of
        very feeble and often flickering sources of light, with all the
        attendant physiological effects and difficulties of reproducing
        observations (Ref. 5). In his first experiments (Ref. 6), when
        he thought that x-ray tubes were a source of N rays, Blondlot
        used as a detector a small spark whose increased brightness was
        thought to be an indicator of the impinging rays (see Fig. 2).
        Later he used a low-intensity gas flame as a detector. He soon
        found additional sources of N rays besides x-ray tubes: (1) Auer
        and Nernst burners (mixtures of rare earth salts heated to
        incandescence), (2) the flame of an annular gas burner (but not
        of a Bunsen burner), 3) a piece of sheet iron or silver heated
        to dull redness, and (4) the Sun. He found new detectors: (1) a
        small flame of gas flowing from a small orifice which in turn
        could be better observed by noting its reflected image from a
        ground-glass plate, and (2) surfaces covered with a properly
        prepared deposit of calcium sulfide, which having first been
        made phosphorescent by sunlight, revealed increased light
        emission upon exposure to N rays. The difficulty of making
        uniform films of calcium sulfide mixed with collodion and ether
        led to confusion in observation, or so it was thought, and in
        his book Blondlot provided instructions and a sheet bearing 25
        calcium sulfide deposits for the reader to use to observe N
        rays. To observe spectral lines of N rays, he packed a narrow
        slit with calcium sulfide, moved the slit along in the region of
        the expected dispersed beams, and when the sulfide showed
        increased phosphorescence, a line was pronounced present. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, he found that N rays could be stored in certain
        materials. They traversed platinum 4 mm thick, but not rock slat
        3 cm thick. They passed through dry cigarette paper but not
        through the wetted paper. Certain solids in compression emitted
        the rays, as when a walking cane was bent by the hand and held
        near the eyes, and the "strengthening action" of the N rays on
        the retina allowed faintly luminous objects to be seen better. A
        file of tempered steel held near the eyes allowed surfaces and
        contours to be seen, as for instance the dial of a clock in a
        darkened room. He discovered N1 rays, which lessened the
        luminosity of glowing sources. He found the "heavy emission",
        which was claimed to consist of streams of minute particles
        ejected form metals and certain liquids and to be subject to
        gravitational attraction. </p>
      <p>The Professor of Biophysics in the School of Medicine, Augustin
        Charpentier, became especially adept at seeing the new rays. In
        a single month (May 1904) he published seven papers on the
        subject. He found that rabbits and frogs gave off the rays,
        Tendons stretched by muscles gave no effects, but the biceps
        muscle did. N rays increased the sensitivity of the human to
        vision, smell, taste and hearing. Soon he found the rays from
        living matter were somewhat different from the N rays, and he
        called them "physiological rays". These latter could even be
        transmitted along wires. Thus a small copper plate is fixed at
        the end of a copper wire 90 cm long. At the other end is the
        phosphorescent screen. When the human body is opposite the
        plate, the screen lights up, indicating transmission of the
        radiation through the wire. Both the physiological rays and the
        N rays were transmitted in this way, he claimed. A long list of
        medical and biological effects were chronicled in a book
        published at the time (Ref. 7). </p>
      <p>We have described only some of the findings claimed by two of
        the many investigators. So extensive were the supposed
        properties that G.F. Stradling required 59 pages simply to
        enumerate or briefly describe the claims made over a 3-year
        period (Ref. 8). At the same time there were those who could not
        reproduce the effects claimed. Such recognized physicists as
        Rayleigh, Langevin, Rubens, and Drude, for example, reported
        failure. Indeed, within a month after Blondlot’s first
        announcement, there appeared the first report of failure. But it
        is the nature of scientific discovery for the world of science
        to accept the findings of trained, reputable scientists until
        such time as their results may be disproven by others. Blondlot
        was a physicist of experience and accomplishment. At the time he
        was one of 8 physicists who were corresponding members of the
        French Academy of Science (Ref. 9). He had acquired a doctorate
        in physics from the Sorbonne in 1881 with a thesis on electric
        cells and laws of polarization of such cells. He had joined the
        faculty at Nancy in 1882. In 1893 and again in 1899, he had
        received prizes from the Academy (Ref. 10). </p>
      <p>Similarly, P.M. Augustin Charpentier was a scientist of good
        reputation, with the title of Professor of Medical Physics at
        the University of Nancy. His thesis for the M.D. degree had been
        entitled "Vision with the Different Parts of the Retina", and he
        had numerous publications in the field of ophthalmology and
        physiology, including one, for example, on "Physiological
        Conditions Influencing Photometric Measurements" (Ref. 11).
        Here, if anyone, was a man who should have been wary of the
        mistakes that would be possible during observations of
        flickering, low-intensity luminous sources. Many other observers
        who reported success were as experienced as Blondlot and
        Charpentier. </p>
      <p><b>Wood’s Exposure</b> </p>
      <p>The purported finding of a new radiation had, of course, been
        discussed at meetings of physics societies. There the reaction
        was almost uniformly one of disbelief, based often on futile
        attempts made sometimes with specific instructions furnished by
        Blondlot himself. It was while attending such a meeting in
        Europe, after having failed to obtain positive results in his
        own laboratory at John Hopkins, that the American physicist R.
        W. Wood decided to visit Nancy during the summer of 1904 and ask
        the discoverer to show him the experiments. The story of his
        visit is told in various places (Ref. 12). It suffices to say
        here that during one demonstration, while Blondlot was finding
        spectral lines in a refracted beam of N rays, he was doing so
        with an essential part of the apparatus missing. At the
        beginning of the observations and in the darkness, Wood had
        placed the necessary prism in his pocket and then replaced it
        before the room lights were turned back on. Wood’s report
        signaled the end of the N-ray affair. </p>
      <p><b>Some Explanations</b> </p>
      <p>When it became evident that some physicists could not observe
        the rays, Blondlot invited a few to visit his laboratory, and in
        the appendix of his book he made suggestions for successful
        observations. These instructions, themselves not easily
        followed, provided insufficient aid in observing a phenomenon
        which did not in fact exist. Hoping the provide objective,
        convincing evidence, Blondlot took photographs (see Fig. 3) of
        light sources both when exposed and not exposed to the action of
        N rays and found those exposed to N rays to have produced a
        darker negative. But when the nonreality of the rays became
        apparent, the photographic evidence was explained by his
        detractors as caused by nonuniform photographic emulsions and
        poorly controlled exposure time and development. Pierret (Ref.
        13) implies that the exposure and development of the plates for
        equal conditions were not performed by Blondlot but were left to
        the assistants. In brief, the difficulties introduced by
        subjective observation of low-intensity sources, whose energy
        output varied with time, led to spurious results. But this was
        compounded by the failure of the observers to perform what today
        we call the controlled experiment, and to apply the classical
        method of difference and the method of agreement (Ref. 14). Even
        such psychological factors as can be grouped under
        suggestibility and hypnosis, and such motivational factors as
        national pride and the quest for prestige, could have been
        eliminated or their importance reduced if reproducibility of
        results and control of the conditions of comparison had been
        better effected. </p>
      <p>Recognition of the inherent difficulty of observation does not
        alone explain the widespread observations. Deliberate fraud can
        be ruled out, both because so many different scientists were
        involved and because they had nothing to gain from reporting
        findings which could be subjected to confirmation by others.
        What of deceit on the part of Blondlot’s colleagues and
        assistants? The two other physicists at Nancy themselves made
        announcements of N ray discoveries and could not, therefore, be
        thought to be deceiving or encouraging Blondlot (Ref. 15). And
        as for his chief assistant, according to Wood, and Pierret, he
        was not learned enough in science to perpetrate such a deception
        (Ref. 16). At any rate Blondlot retained his services afterward,
        and certainly any such deception cannot explain why others in
        distant laboratories "saw" the effects. For explanations of the
        involvement of so many persons one might profitably turn to the
        phenomena of suggestion, hypnosis, and mass hysteria. Such a
        psychological study waits to be done. </p>
      <p><b>Some New Aspects</b> </p>
      <p>A few new aspects to the case have, however, been uncovered by
        the present writer during visits to the city of Nancy that shed
        some light on the reasons for the announcement of the original
        observations by Blondlot. In his book, Seabrook states that
        "only Frenchmen could observe the phenomena", a minor
        exaggeration he must have heard from the flamboyant Wood (Ref.
        17). But for the record it should be mentioned that J.S. Hooker
        (Ref. 18), an Englishman, and F.E. Hackett (Ref. 19), a student
        at the Royal University of Ireland, reported that they had
        observed the rays. And another non-Frenchman who observed the
        rays was Leslie Miller, an instrument-maker of London, who so
        believed in their reality, or at least in the commercial
        exploitation of the rays, that he made apparatus for observing
        them which he sold for L. 1,1,0 (Ref. 20). Seabrook is wide of
        the mark, on the other hand, when he writes: "The tragic
        exposure eventually led to Blondlot’s madness and death".
        Actually, Blondlot continued in his post of Professor of Physics
        for six years after Wood’s disclosure. He retired in 1910
        (Ref.21) at the age of 61, before the usual age of retirement.
        He lived for 20 years in retirement, until his death in 1930 at
        the age of 81 (Ref. 22). During that period he held the title
        Professor Honoraires (i.e., emeritus) and continued to live in
        his large home at 16-18 Quai Claude le Lorrain. He continued to
        have associations with others at the University, as when for
        example, in 1909, on the occasion of the unveiling of a monument
        of his friend, Ernest Bichat, Blondlot made one of the speeches.
        In 1923, a third edition of his book on thermodynamics appeared,
        and in November 1927, he wrote a new preface for a third edition
        of his textbook on electricity (Ref. 23). Certainly his long
        will, frequently revised to accommodate changing conditions,
        which was duly accepted and probated upon his death, is one
        prepared by a sane man (Ref. 24). </p>
      <p>Nor is there any evidence that he committed suicide, as is
        sometimes inferred by those who read Seabrook. Blondlot lived
        some 26 years after Wood’s exposure. Had he taken his own life,
        he probably could not have been buried in a Catholic cemetery
        with the full rites of the Church, as was indeed the case
        according to newspaper accounts. Cemetery records show he is
        buried in the Cimetiere de Preville, the central one of the
        city. </p>
      <p>Modern scientists at the University of Nancy know little or
        nothing about the history of N rays, and those who do are
        usually reluctant to speak of the mater. Two, however, freely
        expressed themselves on the impressions they had acquired from
        colleagues who had been alive at the time or who in turn had
        known such. One I interviewed was Josef Bolfa, Prof. of
        Mineralogy and Crystallography, who has long had an interest in
        the history of the University. His view is that a prominent, but
        little recognized factor in the discovery was the national and
        regional pride of the Nancy professors, who were aware of the
        recent discovery of the cathode rays, x rays, and canal rays by
        their counterparts in other countries wanted to bring fame to
        France and exploited the original observations without due
        regard to firm evidence. Moreover, he said, Nancy has for a long
        time been a garrison city in the French military system.
        Repeatedly he used the words, "C’est une erreur". </p>
      <p>E. Pierret, with whom I talked, probably has more direct
        knowledge of the case than anyone else. Retired now from his
        post of chief assistant in the Department of Physics, he told me
        he had known the assistants who worked with Blondlot and
        Charpentier, and he showed me the very prisms and lenses (Ref.
        25) used by Blondlot in his investigations. He had talked with
        Blondlot in 1926, at which time Blondlot did not appear to have
        lost his intellectual powers. Blondlot, he said, continued to
        believe in the existence of N ryas after he stopped his active
        study of them in 1906, and continued to teach for a few years
        afterward. He never blamed his former assistant for any
        deception (Ref, 26), but, at the same time, Pierret noted, in
        the days prior to the N rays studies, one of the assistants had
        received from Blondlot part of the prize money won by Blondlot
        for discoveries made in the laboratory and doubtless welcomed
        the prospect of new awards for the finding of this new,
        extraordinary radiation, a prospect which might have influenced
        his observations. It was the custom of the day for an
        experimentalist to give but general instructions to an
        assistant, who would be expected to build or assemble apparatus
        and make many of the observations. This was Blondlot’s custom.
        Pierret felt also that the assistant responded to the
        suggestions and authority of the professor and sawmore than the
        evidence warranted. </p>
      <p>A useful summary of the case, entitled "A la Poursuite des
        Rayons N", was published in 1965 by C. Gelain and H. Geoffrey,
        who include photographs of some of the prisms and lesnes used by
        Blondlot as well as a photograph of Blondlot’s laboratory of
        about 1900 (Ref. 27). Another interesting summary is that of
        Jean Rosmorduc (Ref. 28). A brief treatment of the case is given
        by Jean Rostand (Ref. 29), while some of the psychological
        aspects have been discussed by Y. Galifret (Ref. 30). </p>

        those associated with the early observations of radioactivity by
        Henri Becquerel and others, but of course the N rays were
        spurious, while the rays of radioactivity were not. See L.

      <p>(10) Rene Prosper Blondlot was born on 3 July 1849 in Nancy,
        France, and died in the same city on 24 November 1930. He was
        the son of Nicolas Blondlot (b. 1808), who held an M.D. degree
        and was for a long time Prof. of Toxicology in the Faculty of
        Medicine. In 1893, the French Acad. Awarded him the Gaston
        Plante prize, in 1899 the LaCaze prize, and in 1904 (with the N
        ray controversy at its height), the Le Conte prize. He had been
        elected a correspondent of the Academy in 1894, taking the place
        of Helmholtz. </p>

      <p>(14) These methods are much used by physicists who, on the
        whole, are often not aware of their formalization by J.S. Mill
        and others. However, much as Mill’s canons have been criticized,
        they would have been useful guides to N ray students. </p>
      <p>(15) In 1905, at the height of the N ray controversy, there
        were two professors of physics at Nancy, Rene Blondlot and
        Ernest Bichat. This unusual arrangement (of more than one) was
        brought about by Bichat’s added duties as Doyen (Dean) of the
        Faculty of Sciences. Bichat died in 1905; a life-size statue of
        him presently stands before a science building of the
        University. A third scientifically trained member of the
        department was Camille Gutton, who at the time was Maitre de
        Conferences (in charge of the teaching duties of the
        department). Upon Blondlot’s retirement, Gutton was made Prof.
        of Physics, and upon Bichat’s death he was made Dean, upon the
        condition that he not persist in expressing a belief in the
        reality of N rays. </p>
      <p>(16) During my interview with him, Pierret declined to reveal
        the name of Blondlot’s assistant. </p>
      <p>(17) Seabrook also has Blondlot announcing his discovery "in
        the late autumn of 1903", whereas in his paper of 23 March 1903,
        <i>C.R. Acad. Sci</i>. 136: 735 (1903), the discoverer used the
        words "n-rays", which were later changed to "N-rays". </p>

      <p>(21) Pierret, in Ref. 13, states that in November 1909,
        Blondlot chose to retire from his University post. "It has been
        said", writes Pierret, "that he [resigned] at the instance of a
        committee of inquiry". Probably the retirement became effective
        about September 1910. </p>

        Departmentales/Archives Historiques/Centre de Documentation
        Administrative/Service Educatif in Nancy. Blondlot never married
        and at his death had no close living relatives. A portion of his
        estate was divided among servants and friends, but the largest
        part, his house and garden of about 1.65 acres, was given to the
        city of Nancy to serve, in the case of the garden, as a place of
        rest for the townspeople and, in the case of the house, as a
        place where young people could come to obtain advice about job
        and educational opportunities. They are in use today for the
        purposes intended. The entire estate was valued at over one
        million francs. As a consequence of his beneficence, the city
        bestowed on him a special title. The park adjacent to his former
        home bears the inscription Pac Blondlot above the entrance. A
        street in the city is also named after him. </p>
      <p>(25) The writer saw and handled these items. There were 5
        prisms which appeared to be made of aluminum, silver, clear
        (transparent) quartz, smoky quartz, and wood. The height of each
        was about 6 cm. The faces of each approximated squares. One
        prism (Ag?) of which I drew the base by drawing a pencil along
        the edges as I held it on a piece of paper, had a prism angle of
        about 29*. The others appeared to the eye to be somewhat
        smaller, all with a prism angle of perhaps 22*. A metal
        plano-convex lens of aluminum measured 7 cm in diameter. I
        estimated the curvature of its convex face to be about 30 cm
        radius. Pierret did not show me, if indeed they were in his
        possession, the 60* and 90* aluminum prisms used by Blondlot.
        Pierret became an assistant in the department about 1928. One
        day while taking an inventory of the contents of a laboratory,
        he came upon the materials used in the N-ray work. Another
        assistant, said Pierret, warned him not to touch them or to
        speak of the subject to the professor in charge. In 1962, when
        he retired from the post of Maitre de Conferences, the materials
        came into his possession. </p>
      <p>(26) This belief is also expressed in Pierret’s article on the
        subject. See Ref. 13, p. 254. </p>

      <p><b>(a) Preliminary Notice</b> </p>
      <p>The present volume contains the memoirs on the subject of "N"
        rays, communicated to the Academy of Sciences by Prof. R.
        Blondlot. The papers have been reprinted exactly as they were
        originally published in the Comptes Rendus of the Academy. The
        notes at the end were added later, with the object of throwing
        light on certain points which were obscure at the time the
        papers were communicated to the Academy. </p>
      <p>The title of the first memoir in this collection, "On the
        Polarization of X-Rays", will hardly cause astonishment when it
        is realized that the study of the X rays led the author to
        recognize the existence of radiations of a totally different
        character. To these he gave the name of "N" rays. Before the
        distinction of these two kinds of radiation was made, some
        confusion was bound to arise between the phenomena appertaining
        to each. In particular, the preliminary researches which the
        author had made on the velocity of propagation of X rays apply
        in reality not to X rays, but to N rays. He had found that the
        velocity of propagation was the same as that of Hertzian waves,
        and consequently of light. Since the properties of N rays, taken
        in their entirety, do not leave any doubt that these rays are a
        variety of light, this determination of their velocity is
        nothing more than a verification of an assured fact.
        Nevertheless, this verification seemed not altogether
        superfluous; it proves at least that the experiments have been
        carried out with care. </p>

      <p><b>(1) On the Polarization of X Rays (Feb. 2, 1903)&nbsp;</b><a
          name="1"></a> </p>
      <p>Hitherto the attempts made to polarize X rays have remained
        fruitless. I asked myself whether X rays emitted by a focus tube
        are not polarized as soon as emitted. I was led to put to myself
        this question by considering that the conditions of asymmetry
        which should exist for the polarization of such rays are in this
        case exactly satisfied. For each ray is generated from a cathode
        ray, and the two rays define a plane; thus, through each ray
        emitted by the tube a plane passes, in which, or normally to
        which, the ray may well have special properties, this being, in
        fact, an asymmetry characteristic of polarization. Now, if this
        polarization exists, how can the fact be ascertained? It struck
        me that a small spark, such as I used in my researches on the
        velocity of propagation of X rays, might perhaps in this case
        play a part of analyzer, inasmuch as the properties of a spark
        may be different in the direction of its length, which is also
        that of the electric forces producing it, and in directions
        normal to its length. Starting from this, I arranged an
        apparatus as shown in the accompanying diagram, so as to obtain
        a small spark during the emission of X rays. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="0blo1.gif" height="193" width="346"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A focus tube is connected to an induction coil by wires BH,
        B’H’, covered with gutta percha (Fig.1). Two other wires, also
        covered with gutta percha, AIc and A’I’c’, terminate at A and A’
        in two loops, which surround BH and B’H’ respectively; a bit of
        glass tubing, not shown in the figure, keeps each loop separate
        from the wire which it surrounds. The wires AI, A’I are then
        twisted together, and their sharply pointed end, c and c’, are
        fixed opposite each other, at a very small distance, adjustable
        at will, so as to form a small spark gap. By virtue of this
        disposition, the electrostatic influence exercised by the wires
        BH and B’H’ on the loops A and A’ produces at each break of the
        current in the coil a small spark at the gap cc’, at the same
        time as X rays are being emitted by the tube. Owing to the
        flexibility of wires, AIc, A’I’c’, the straight line cc’, along
        which the spark occurs, can be set in any direction we please. A
        sheet of aluminum foil, 40 cm square, is interposed between the
        tube and the spark, so as to prevent any direct influence of the
        electrodes of the tube on cc’. </p>
      <p>In order to define easily the relative positions of the tube
        and the spark cc’, take three rectangular axes, of which one,
        Oz, is vertical. </p>
      <p>Fix the focus tube so that its length, and consequently, the
        pencil of cathode rays, coincides with OY, the anticathode being
        placed near the origin, and sending X rays in the positive
        direction of OX. </p>
      <p>Place the gap cc’ at a point on the positive side of OX, so
        that its direction is parallel to OY. The spark being properly
        regulated one observes that the X rays act upon it in such a way
        as to increase its luminosity, for the interposition of a sheet
        of lead or glass manifestly diminishes the brightness. </p>
      <p>Now, without altering the position of the gap, turn it so that
        it comes parallel to OZ, i.e., normal to the cathode rays. The
        influence of the X rays on the spark is then seen to disappear,
        and the interposition of a lead or glass plate causes no change
        in its brightness. </p>
      <p>X rays have therefore a plane of action, which is the one
        passing through each X ray and the cathode ray which gives rise
        to it. If the direction given to the spark gap is intermediate
        between the two above mentioned, the action is seen to diminish
        from the horizontal position to the vertical. </p>
      <p>The following is another experiment, still more striking: if
        the spark is made to turn about OX, parallel to plane YOZ, the
        spark is seen to pass from a maximum brightness when horizontal
        to a minimum when vertical. These variation of brightness are
        similar to those observed when a pencil of polarized rays
        traverse a rotating Nicol’s prism, the small spark playing the
        part of analyzer. The pencil of X rays presents the same
        asymmetry as a pencil of polarized light. According to Newton’s
        definition, it has sides differing from each other; in other
        words, it is polarized in the complete sense of the term. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon is easy to observe when the spark is well
        regulated; this means that the spark must be very small and
        faint. </p>
      <p>If the focus tube is made to turn about its axis, which is
        parallel to the cathode rays, the observed phenomena do not
        change, so long as X rays reach the gap. The plane of action is
        thus independent of the orientation of the anticathode, being
        always in the plane passing through the X rays and the
        generating cathodic rays. </p>
      <p>The spark being kept in this plane, and turned round from the
        position in which it is at right angles to the X rays to that in
        which it is parallel to them, we observe that the effect of the
        X rays on the brightness of the spark is a maximum in the first
        position, and diminishes to nothing in the second. </p>
      <p>Now, an X ray and its generating cathodic ray only determine a
        plane when their directions are different. Again, amongst the
        emitted X rays, some are in a direction very nearly the same as
        that of the cathode rays, being those which graze the cathode.
        One should expect these to be every incompletely polarized; and,
        indeed the small spark enabled me to confirm this. </p>
      <p>I noted several important facts, which, however, I will merely
        allude to in the present paper. Quartz and lump-sugar rotate the
        plane of polarization of X rays in the same sense as that of
        light. I obtained rotations of 40 degrees. </p>
      <p>Secondary rays, styled "S" rays, are also polarized. Active
        substances rotate the plane of polarization of these rays in a
        sense contrary to that of light. I observed rotations of 18
        degrees (Note 2). </p>
      <p>It is extremely likely that magnetic rotation also exists for X
        rays as well as for S rays. Once can also surmise hat the
        properties of these rays, with reference to polarization, extend
        to tertiary rays, etc. I intend shortly to publish the results
        at which I have arrived concerning these different points. </p>
      <p><b>(2) On a New Species of Light (March 23, 1903)&nbsp;</b><a
          name="2"></a> </p>
      <p>The radiations emitted by a focus tube are filtered through a
        sheet of aluminum foil or a screen of black paper, in order to
        eliminate the luminous rays which might accompany them. While
        studying these radiations by means of their action on a small
        spark, I discovered that they are plane-polarized as soon as
        emitted. I further proved that when these radiations traverse a
        plate of quartz in a direction at right angles to its axis, or a
        lump of sugar, their plane of action undergoes a rotation just
        like the plane of polarization of a pencil of light. </p>
      <p>I then asked myself if a rotation could also be obtained by
        passing the radiations of the focus through a pile of Reusch
        mica sheets. I observed, in fact, a rotation of from 25° to 30°
        in the same direction as that of polarized light. This action of
        a pile of micas made me at once infer that a single sheet of
        mica must act, and that this action must be depolarization, or,
        rather, the production of elliptic polarization; this is indeed
        what occurs. The interposition of a sheet of mica, set so that
        its axis makes an angle of 45° with the pane of action of the
        radiations emitted by the tube, destroys their rectilinear
        polarization, for their action on a small spark remains sensibly
        the same, whatever be the direction of the spark gap. If a
        second sheet of mica is interposed, identical with the first, so
        that the axes of the two sheets are perpendicular to each other,
        rectilinear polarization is reestablished. This result can also
        be obtained by the use of a Babinet’s compensator. Consequently
        we are dealing with elliptic polarization. </p>
      <p>Now, if the sheet of mica changes rectilinear into elliptic
        polarization, such a sheet must be doubly refractive for the
        radiations thus formed. But if double refraction exists, a
        fortiori simple refraction must exist; and I was thus led to
        examine whether, in spite of the fruitless attempts to discover
        the refraction of X rays, I could not obtain a deviation by a
        prism. I then arranged the following experiment: a focus tube
        sends through an aluminum screen a pencil of rays, limited by
        two vertical slits cut in two parallel sheets of lead, 3 mm
        thick. The small spark is placed on one side of the pencil at
        such a distance that it cannot be reached, even by the penumbra;
        this is ascertained by proving that the interposition of a sheet
        of lead causes no diminution of its brightness. Now let us
        interpose in the pencil an equilateral quartz prism, with
        refractive edge on the side away from the spark. If the prism is
        properly set, the spark becomes much more brilliant; when the
        prism is removed, the spark reverts to its former faintness.
        This phenomenon is certainly due to refraction, for if the
        setting of the prism is altered, or if the prism is replaced by
        a plate of quartz, no effect is observed. The experiment may
        also be carried out in a different manner: the pencil is first
        made to impinge directly on the spark, then it is deviated by
        means of the prism, and the brightness of the spark wanes. If,
        now, the spark is moved laterally towards the base of the prism,
        it recovers its previous brightness, proving that the rays in
        question have been deviated in the same sense as rays of light.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Refraction being thus proved, I at once sought to
        concentrate the rays by means of a quartz lens. The experiment
        is unattended with difficulty. An image of the anticathode is
        obtained, extremely well-defined as to size and distance by a
        heightened glow of the small spark. </p>
      <p>The existence of refraction rendered that of regular reflection
        extremely probable; as a matter of fact, regular reflection does
        take place. By means of a quartz lens, or a lens formed by a
        very thin horn envelope filled with turpentine, I produce a
        conjugate focus of the anticathode; then I intercept the
        emerging pencil by a sheet of polished glass, placed obliquely;
        I then obtain a focus exactly symmetrical, in respect to the
        plane of reflection, with the one which existed before the glass
        was interposed. With a plate of ground glass there is no regular
        reflection, but diffusion is observed. </p>
      <p>If one half of a lamina of mica is roughened, the polished half
        lets pass the radiations, and the other half stops them (note 3)
      </p>
      <p>This allows of the repetition of the refraction experiments
        under much more precise conditions, by the use of Newton’s
        arrangement for obtaining a pure spectrum. </p>
      <p>From all that precedes, the fact results that the rays which I
        have thus studies are not Roentgen rays, since these undergo
        neither refraction nor reflection. In fact, the little spark
        reveals a new species of radiations emitted by the focus tube,
        which traverse aluminum, black paper, wood, etc. These are
        plane-polarized from the moment of their emission, are
        susceptible of rotary and elliptic polarization, are refracted,
        reflected and diffused, but produce neither fluorescence nor
        photographic action. </p>
      <p>I had expected to find that amongst these rays some existed
        whose refractive index for quartz is about 2; but probably quite
        a spectrum of such rays exists, for in the refraction
        experiments with a prism, the deviated pencil appears to cover a
        broad angle. The study of this dispersion remains to be pursued,
        as well as that of the wavelengths of the rays. </p>
      <p>By progressively diminishing the intensity of the current
        actuating the induction coil, one still gets these new rays,
        even when the tube no longer produces any fluorescence, and is
        itself absolutely invisible in the dark. They are fainter,
        however, in this case. They can also be produced continuously by
        means of an electric machine giving a spark a few millimeters in
        length. </p>
      <p>At first I had attributed to Roentgen rays the polarization
        which in reality belongs to the new rays, a confusion which it
        was impossible to avoid before having observed the refraction,
        and it was only after making this observation that I could with
        certainty conclude that I was not dealing with Roentgen rays,
        but with a new species of light. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to collate these remarks with the view
        expressed by M. Henri Cecquerel, that in certain of his
        experiments "manifestations identical with those giving
        refraction and total reflection of light may have been produced
        by luminous rays which had traversed aluminum" (see Comptes
        Rendus, t. xxxii, March 25, 1901, p. 739). </p>
      <p><b>(3)&nbsp; On the Existence, in the Rays Emitted by an Auer
          Burner, of Radiations which Traverse Metals, Wood, etc. (May
          11, 1903)&nbsp;</b><a name="3"></a> </p>
      <p>A focus tube emits, as I have already proved, certain
        radiations susceptible of traversing metals, black paper, wood,
        etc. Amongst these, there are some for which the index of
        refraction of quartz is nearly 2. On the other hand, the index
        for quartz of the rays remaining from rock-salt, discovered by
        Prof. Rubens, is 2’18. This similarity of indices led me to
        think that the radiations observed in the emission of a focus
        tube would very likely be near neighbors of the rays discovered
        by Rubens, and that, consequently, they would be met with in the
        radiation emitted by an Auer burner, which is the source of such
        rays. I accordingly made the following experiment: an Auer
        burner is enclosed in a kind of lantern of sheet-iron,
        completely closed on all sides, with the exception of openings
        for the passage of air and combustion gases, which are so
        arranged that no light escapes; a rectangular orifice, 4 cm wide
        and 6.5 cm high, cut in the iron at the same height as the
        incandescent mantle, so that the emerging luminous pencil is
        directed on the aluminum sheet. Outside the lantern, and in
        front of this sheet, a double-convex quartz lens is placed,
        having 12 cm focal length for yellow light, behind which is a
        spark gap of the kind already described, giving very small
        sparks. The spark is produced by a by a small induction coil,
        provided with a rotating make and break device, which works with
        perfect regularity. </p>
      <p>The distance <i>p</i> of the lens from the slit being 26.5 cm,
        one notes, by help of the spark, the existence of a focus of
        very great sharpness at a distance, <i>p’</i>, of about 13.9
        cm. For at this point the spark exhibits a notably greater glow
        than at the neighboring points, whether in front or behind,
        above or below, to the right or to the left. The distance of
        this focus from the lens can be determined within 3 or 4 mm. The
        interposition of a sheet of lead or glass 4 mm thick causes this
        action to disappear. By varying the value of <i>p</i>, other
        values of <i>p’</i> are obtained, and substituting these values
        in the lens formula, the number 2.93 is obtained for the
        refractive index, being the mean value derived from a series of
        determinations as concordant as the precision of such
        observations could entitle one to expect. Similar experiments,
        made with another quartz lens, having a focal length of 33 cm
        for yellow light, gave for the index the value 2.942. </p>
      <p>While pursuing these experiments, I ascertained the existence
        of three other species of radiations, for which the index of
        quartz has values 2.62, 2.436, and 2.29 respectively. These
        indices are all greater than 2, which explains the following
        fact: if in the path of the rays emerging from the lens a quartz
        prism of 30 degrees refractive angle is placed, in such a way as
        to receive these rays in a direction sensibly normal to one of
        the refracting faces, no refracted pencil is obtained. </p>
      <p>The radiations from an Auer burner, transmitted through an
        aluminum sheet, are reflected by a polished plate of glass in
        conformity with the laws of regular reflection, and are diffused
        by a plate of ground glass. </p>
      <p>These radiations traverse all the substances whose transparency
        I tested, with the exception of rock-salt 3 mm thick (note 4),
        platinum 4 mm thick, and water. A slip of cigarette paper, which
        is completely transparent when dry, becomes absolutely opaque
        when wetted with water. Figs. 2 and 3 are reproductions of the
        impression made in four seconds on a sensitive plate, without
        any photographic apparatus, before and after wetting the sheet
        of paper interposed between the lens and the spark. The
        photoengraving, produced from a paper print, shows in the first
        case the spark is notably brighter. </p>
      <p>These photographic prints are produced by the spark influenced
        by the rays, and not by the rays themselves, these latter
        producing no appreciable photographic effect after an hour’s
        exposure. </p>
      <p>Amongst the bodies which are traversed, I may mention tin foil,
        sheets of copper and brass 0.2 mm thick, a sheet of aluminum 0.4
        mm thick, a steel lamina 0.05 mm thick, a silver leaf 0.1 mm
        thick, a paper booklet, containing 21 gold leaves, a glass sheet
        0.1 mm thick, a sheet of mica of 0.15 mm, a plate of Iceland
        spar of 0.4 mm, a block of paraffin of 1 cm, a beech board 1 cm,
        a plate of ebonite of 1 mm, etc. Fluorspar is but slightly
        transparent with a thickness of 5 mm, similarly sulfur 2 mm
        thick, and glass 1 mm thick. These results I give only as a
        first indication, for when they were obtained, the co-existence
        of four different species of radiations, which may have very
        different properties, was not taken into account (note 5). </p>
      <p>It will be highly interesting to investigate whether other
        sources, and in particular the sun, do not emit analogous
        radiations to those we are dealing with in the present
        communication, and also whether the latter produces any
        calorific action (note 6). </p>
      <p>Now, ought these radiations in reality to be considered as akin
        to the large wave length radiations discovered by Prof. Rubens?
        Their common origin in the emission of an Auer burner is
        favorable to such a view, as is also the opacity of rock-salt
        and of water. But on the other hand, for Auer rays, the
        transparency of metals and other substances opaque to Ruben’s
        rays constitute an apparently radical difference between the two
        sorts of radiations (note 7). </p>

      <p><b>(4)&nbsp; On New Sources of Radiations Capable of Traversing
          Metals, Wood, etc., and on New Actions Produced by These
          Radiations (May 25, 1903)</b><a name="4"></a> </p>
      <p>While investigating whether radiations analogous to those whose
        existence I mentioned in the emission of an Auer burner are not
        to be met also in other sources of light and heat, I established
        the following facts: the flame of an annular gas-burner emits
        such radiations; the chimney, however, should be removed, on
        account of the absorption of the rays by glass. A Bunsen burner
        scarcely produces any. A piece of sheet-iron or silver, heated
        to dull redness by a Bunsen burner, placed behind them, gives
        off rays at about the same rate as an Auer burner. </p>
      <p>A plate of polished silver was arranged so that its plane made
        an angle of 45° with the horizontal plane. This plate having
        been heated to cherry-red by a Bunsen burner, its upper face
        emitted rays analogous to those of an Auer burner. A horizontal
        pencil of these rays, after traversing two sheets of aluminum of
        0.3 mm total thickness, sheets of black paper, etc., was
        concentrated by a quartz lens; with the aid of the small spark,
        the existence of four focal regions was ascertained. I further
        found that the action on the spark was much more pronounced when
        the spark was arranged vertically -- that is, in the plane of
        emission -- than when it was normal to this plane. The new
        radiations emitted by the polished plate are therefore
        polarized, as are the light and heat emitted at the same time.
        The silver plate having been covered with lampblack, the
        intensity of the emission increased, but the polarization
        disappeared. </p>
      <p>The foregoing leads one to think that the emission of
        radiations susceptible of traversing metals, etc., is an
        extremely general phenomenon. First observed in the emission of
        a focus tube, it was also met in that of ordinary sources of
        light and heat. For shortness, I will henceforth designate these
        rays by the name of "N" rays. </p>
      <p>[ From the name of the town of Nancy, these researches having
        been made at Nancy University. ] </p>
      <p>I would draw attention to the fact that these N rays comprise a
        very large variety of radiations; for while those which issue
        from an Auer burner have refractive indices greater than 2,
        there are others, amongst those emitted by a Crookes tube, whose
        index is inferior to 1.52, for if a pencil of these rays is made
        to impinge on an equilateral quartz prism, parallel to the edges
        and normal to one of the faces, an emerging pencil is obtained
        which is very much spread out. </p>
      <p>Up to this time the only means of detecting the presence of N
        rays was by their action on a small spark. I asked myself if the
        spark should in this case be considered as an electric
        phenomenon, or only as producing incandescence like a small
        gaseous mass. If this latter supposition were correct, the spark
        could be replaced by a flame. I then produced a quite small
        flame of gas at the extremity of a metal tube having a very
        small orifice. This flame was entirely blue. I ascertained that
        the flame could be used to reveal the presence of N rays just
        like the spark; for when it receives these rays, it becomes
        whiter and brighter in just the same way. Its variations in glow
        allowed of four foci being found in a pencil which had passed
        through a quartz lens; these foci are the same as those detected
        with the small spark. The small flame behaves therefore, in
        regard to N rays, just like the spark, save that it does not
        allow of the observation of polarization phenomena. </p>
      <p>In order to study more easily the variations in glow, whether
        of flame or spark, I examine them through a plate of ground
        glass, about 25 or 30 mm distant. In this way one obtains,
        instead of a very small, brilliant point, a luminous patch of
        about 2 cm diameter, of much less luminosity, whose variations
        can be far better appreciated by the eye. </p>
      <p>The action of an incandescent body on a flame, or that of a
        flame on another flame, is certainly a common phenomenon. If it
        has remained unnoticed up to the present, it is because the
        light of the source prevented the observation of the variations
        in glow of the receiving flame. </p>
      <p>Quite recently I observed another effect of the N rays. It is
        true that these rays are unable to excite phosphorescence in
        bodies which can acquire this property under the action of
        light, but when such a body --- calcium sulfide, for example ---
        has previously been rendered phosphorescent by exposure to
        sunlight, if it is then exposed to N rays --- for instance, to
        one of the foci produced by a quartz lens --- the phosphorescent
        glow is observed to increase in a very marked fashion; neither
        the production nor the cessation of this effect appear to be
        absolutely instantaneous. Of all the actions producing N rays,
        this is the one which is most easily observed. The experiment is
        an easy one to set up and to repeat. This property of N rays is
        analogous to that of the red and infrared rays discovered by
        Edmond Becquerel. It is also analogous to the action of heat on
        phosphorus. Nevertheless, I have not noticed as yet an increased
        rate of exhaustion of the phosphorescent capacity under the
        action of N rays. </p>
      <p>The kinship of N rays with known radiations of large wavelength
        seems a certain fact. As, on the other hand, the property
        possessed by these rays of traversing metals differentiates them
        from all known radiations, it is very probable that they are
        comprised in the five octaves of the series of radiations,
        hitherto unexplored, between the Rubens rays and electromagnetic
        oscillations of very small wavelength. This is what I propose to
        verify. </p>
      <p><b>(5)&nbsp; On the Existence of Solar Radiations Capable of
          Traversing Metals, Wood, etc. (June 15, 1903)&nbsp;</b><a
          name="5"></a> </p>
      <p>I have recently proved that the majority of artificial sources
        of light and heat emit radiations which are able to traverse
        metals and a great number of bodies, opaque in regard to the
        spectral radiations hitherto known. It was desirable to
        ascertain whether radiations analogous to the former --- which,
        for brevity, I call N rays --- are also emitted by the sun. </p>
      <p>As I have shown, N rays act on phosphorescent substances by
        heightening or stimulating the pre-existing phosphorescence, an
        action similar to that of red and infrared rays discovered by
        Edmond Becquerel. I utilized this phenomenon to find out whether
        the sun sends us N rays. </p>
      <p>A completely enclosed dark room has one window exposed to the
        sun. This is shut by interior, opaque panels of oak, 15 mm
        thick. Behind one of these panels, at any distance -- 1 meter,
        for instance -- a thin glass tube is placed, containing a
        phosphorescent substance, say calcium sulfide, which has been
        previously exposed for a short time to solar rays. If, now, on
        the path of the solar rays, which are supposed to reach the tube
        through the wood, a sheet of lead, or the hand simply, is
        interposed, even at a great distance from the tube, the
        phosphorescent glow is seen to diminish; when the obstacle is
        removed, the glow reappears. The extreme simplicity of this
        experiment will incite many persons, I hope, to repeat it. The
        only precaution one need take is to operate with a feeble
        preliminary phosphorescence (note 9). It is advantageous to
        arrange permanently a sheet of black paper, so that the
        interposition of the screen does not change the background on
        which the tube stands out. The variations in glow are especially
        easy to catch near the contours of the luminous patch formed by
        the phosphorescent body on the dark background; when the N rays
        are intercepted, these contours lose their sharpness, regaining
        the same when the screen is removed. However, these variations
        in glow do not appear to be instantaneous. Interposing between
        the shutter and the tube several sheets of aluminum, cardboard,
        or an oak board 3 cm thick, does not hinder the phenomenon; any
        possibility of an action of radiated heat, as such, is
        consequently excluded. A thin film of water completely arrests
        the rays; light clouds passing over the sun considerably
        diminish their action. </p>
      <p>The N rays emitted by the sun can be concentrated by a quartz
        lens; by means of the phosphorescent substance, the existence of
        several foci is ascertained. I have not yet determined their
        positions with sufficient precision to speak of them here. The N
        rays of sunlight undergo regular reflection by a polished plate
        of glass, and are diffused by ground glass. </p>
      <p>The N rays issuing from the sun increase the glow of a small
        spark and a small flame in the same manner as those emitted by a
        Crookes tube, by a flame, or by an incandescent body. These
        phenomena are easy to observe, especially is use is made of an
        interposed sheet of ground glass, as indicated by me in a
        preceding communication. The use of a small flame is by far the
        most convenient and precise of all processes for determining the
        position of the foci. Operating with the small spark is much
        harder, because the spark is rarely very regular. </p>
      <p>I feel bound to reproduce, textually, here a passage in a
        letter which M. Gustave le Bon had done me the honor of writing:
      </p>
      <p>"M. Gustave le Bon had indicated, as far back as 7 years ago,
        that flames emit, independently of the radioactive emanations
        observed by him, radiations of large wavelength, capable of
        traversing metals, and to which he had given the name of black
        light; but while assigning these a place intermediate between
        light and electricity, he had not exactly measured their
        wavelength, and the method he had employed to reveal their
        presence was very uncertain." </p>
      <p>The method referred to was the photographic method. Personally,
        I have not been able to obtain any photographic effect of the
        rays I have studies. </p>

          Facts Connected with These Radiations (July 20,1903)&nbsp;</b><a
          name="6"></a> </p>
      <p>The action of N rays on a small flame gave me the idea of
        trying whether they did not exercise an analogous action on a
        solid incandescent body. For this purpose a platinum wire, about
        0.1 mm diameter and 15 mm long, was heated to dull redness by an
        electric current. A pencil of N rays, emitted by an Auer burner,
        was directed through wood and aluminum screens on this wire, and
        was concentrated by a quartz lens. </p>
      <p>The wire was observed through a plate of ground glass, fixed to
        the same support as the wire itself, and about 3 cm in front of
        it. On displacing the wire, several foci were found, just as
        with other processes employed to detect N rays. The wire being
        placed at one of these foci, the luminous patch on the ground
        glass is seen to diminish in brightness when a lead screen, or
        merely the hand, is interposed; when the obstacle is removed,
        the light resumes its former brightness. These actions do not
        appear instantaneous. </p>
      <p>I have generalized the former experiments by employing, instead
        of a wire heated by an electric current, a sheet of platinum 0.1
        mm thick, inclined at 45° on the horizontal plane, partially
        heated to a dark red by a small gas flame placed underneath. A
        horizontal pencil of N rays, concentrated by a lens, was made to
        impinge on the under face of the sheet, so as to produce a focus
        at the heated spot; on the upper face the incandescent patch was
        observed without interposing ground glass. The variations in
        brightness are exactly analogous to those of the wire. When
        observing, through ground glass, the intensity of illumination
        of the bottom face of the sheet, due to the rays and the flame
        together quite similar variations are found. Further, the same
        results are obtained if, instead of making the rays fall on the
        lower face, or the side on which the flame acts directly, they
        are directed on the upper face. </p>
      <p>The different effects produced by N rays, viz. their action on
        a spark or flame, and on phosphorescent or incandescent bodies,
        would lead to the supposition that they might also have a
        heating effect on the bodies subjected to their action. To test
        the matter experimentally, I installed a thermopile of Ruben’s
        connected to an enclosed galvanometer. The action of N rays on
        this apparatus was absolutely nil, even in the most favorable
        conditions, though a candle placed 12 meters away gave a
        deflection of about 0.5 mm on the scale. I conducted the
        experiment not only with N rays proceeding from an Auer burner,
        but also with those from the sun on July 3, 1904 [?], at midday.
        The rays were very intense, for when I placed in front of the
        thermopile a tube containing calcium sulfide, which had been
        feebly excited by exposure to the sun, its glow was greatly
        increased, but was diminished by the interposition of a lead
        screen or the hand. M. H. Rubens made the same observation, as
        he was kind enough to write me, his apparatus being much more
        sensitive even than mine. I nevertheless thought it useful to
        determine directly whether the incandescent platinum wire was
        not heated by the action of N rays. To this end, I had recourse
        to the study of its electric resistance. The current flowing
        through the wire is produced by 5 accumulators; with the aid of
        high-resistance rheostats, the intensity is adjusted to make the
        platinum wire a dull red. The wire is stretched between two
        massive brass pliers, A&nbsp; and B, which are connected to the
        terminals of a capillary electrometer; on one of the connecting
        wires an adjustable electromotive force is inserted, obtained by
        shunting a portion of the circuit of an auxiliary battery. This
        electromotive force is regulated so that the electrometer is at
        zero. Every variation in resistance of the platinum wire
        produces a deviation of the electrometer. Now, with N rays
        playing on the wire, no deviation of the meniscus was observed.
        The interposition of a lead or wet-paper screen remained without
        effect on the electrometer, though the wire underwent the usual
        variations in brightness. This certainly proves that N rays do
        not raise its temperature. I assured myself moreover that the
        method was sufficiently sensitive by the following experiment;
        by means of a wire rheostat, an assistant varied the resistance
        of a circuit containing the platinum wire and the accumulators,
        and consequently the strength of the current, but not
        sufficiently for the observer to perceive a variation in the
        glow of the wire. In spite of this, the electrometer was
        deflected three divisions of the micrometer in the eye-piece.
        The following is another verification: raising the temperature
        of the wire one degree would alter its resistance in the ratio
        of about 1.004 to one; the difference of potential between A and
        B would alter in about the same ratio, since the resistance
        external to the wire being very great, the current strength does
        not change. In my experiments this variation would deflect the
        electrometer by 15 divisions. As absolutely no deviation
        occurred, and as, moreover, a quarter of a division could have
        been easily observed, the rise in temperature is certainly very
        inferior to 1/15 x 1/4 = 1/60 of a degree, and, consequently,
        quite insufficient to produce the observed increase in glow. It
        is thus superabundantly established that the increase in glow
        produced by the rays is not due to a rise in temperature. </p>
      <p>In the experiments with a plate of platinum, mentioned above,
        the increase in glow was apparent on the two faces of the sheet,
        Given that there is no rise in temperature, this seems
        paradoxical; for since N rays do not go through platinum, it
        seemed as if the action should only appear on the side exposed
        to these rays. To reconcile these results, it was necessary to
        suppose that N rays, which do not traverse cold platinum,
        traverse it when incandescent. I then reverted to the apparatus
        which was destined to show the action of N rays on a small
        flame, and behind the quartz lens I arranged a platinum sheet
        larger than the lens. The interposition of a lead screen between
        the platinum and the source produced no effect on the small
        flame, and the source produced no effect on the small flame,
        which verifies the opacity of platinum. The plate being then
        heated to redness, interposing the screen was seen to diminish
        the glow of the small flame. N rays issuing from an Auer burner
        traverse therefore incandescent platinum. </p>
      <p><b>(7)&nbsp; On New Actions Produced by N Rays --
          Generalization of the Phenomena Already Observed (November 2,
          1903)&nbsp;</b><a name="7"></a> </p>
      <p>When a pencil of N rays is directed either on a small spark,
        flame, or a phosphorescent substance previously exposed to the
        sun’s rays. Or, again, to a platinum plate heated to dull
        redness, the light emitted by these various sources is seen to
        increase in glow. In these experiments, one operates on sources
        emitting light spontaneously. I asked myself whether one could
        not generalize these experiments by using a body not emitting
        light itself, but reflecting that which reaches it from an
        external source. I consequently carried out the following
        experiment: a slip of white paper, 15 mm long and 2 mm broad, is
        fixed vertically to a wire holder; the room being made dark, the
        slip is dimly lit b projecting laterally on it a pencil of
        light, emitted by a small flame shut up in a box, in which a
        vertical slit is pierced. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the rays are produced by the following
        contrivance: an Auer burner, provided with a sheet-iron chimney,
        in which a rectangular orifice, 60 mm high and 25 mm broad, has
        been cut, is enclosed in an iron lantern pierced with an opening
        placed in front of the chimney orifice, and stopped by a plate
        of aluminum. In front of this window the small slip of paper is
        placed, illuminated in the manner indicated above. If, now, the
        rays are intercepted by interposing a sheet of lead or the hand,
        the small paper rectangle is seen to darken, and its contours to
        lose their sharpness; the light diffused by the slip of paper is
        thus increased by the action of N rays. </p>
      <p>The following idea then presented itself: the diffusion of
        light is a complex phenomenon, in which the elementary fact is
        regular reflection, and consequently there is reason for
        ascertaining experimentally whether the reflection of light is,
        or is not, modified by the action of N rays. For this purpose, a
        polished steel knitting needle was fixed vertically in place of
        the slip of paper of the former experiment; at the same time, in
        a box completely closed, with the exception of a vertical slit
        cut at the same height as the Auer burner, and stopped up by
        transparent paper, a flame was disposed so as to light up the
        slit.. By suitably placing the eye and the slit, the image of
        this latter is seen formed by reflection on the steel cylinder,
        and simultaneously the reflecting surface is receiving the N
        rays. It is then easy to observe that the action of these rays
        reinforces the image, for if they are intercepted, the image
        darkens, and turns to a reddish hue. I repeated this experiment
        with the same success by employing, instead of the knitting
        needle, a plane mirror of bronze. </p>
      <p>The same result is again obtained by reflecting the light on
        the polished face of a block of quartz. However, when the N rays
        fall normally on the refracting face, their action on the
        reflected light disappears, whatever be the incidence of this
        light, whether it be that their action becomes zero, or simply
        inappreciable. In order that the light reflected by the quartz
        may be reinforced by the N rays, it is not necessary that the
        rays should be directed towards the interior of the quartz; the
        action still occurs when the N rays traverse the reflecting
        surface from the inside towards the outside. </p>
      <p>All these actions of N rays on light require an appreciable
        time-interval for appearing and disappearing. I was unable,
        although I varied the experiment in a great many ways, to
        observe any action of N rays on the refracted light. </p>
      <p>I will here make the following general remark concerning the
        observation of N rays. The aptitude for catching small
        variations in luminous intensity is very different in different
        persons; some see from the outset, and without any difficulty,
        the reinforcing action produced by N rays on the brightness of a
        small luminous source; for others, these phenomena lie almost at
        the limit of what they are able to discern, and it is only after
        a certain amount of practice that they succeed in catching them
        easily, and in observing then with complete certainty. The
        smallness of the effects and the delicacy of their observation
        must not deter us from a study which puts us in possession of
        radiations hitherto unknown. I have recently observed that the
        Auer burner can be advantageously replaced by the Nernst lamp,
        without a glass, this lamp giving more intense N rays. With a
        200-watt lamp, the phenomena are marked enough to be, in my
        belief, easily visible to any one at the first trial. </p>
      <p><b>(8)&nbsp; On the Storing-up of N Rays by Certain Bodies
          (November 9, 1903)</b><a name="8"></a> </p>
      <p>In the course of my researches on N rays, I had occasion to
        note a very remarkable fact. The N rays were produced by an Auer
        burner enclosed in a lantern, and after passing through one of
        the sides of the lantern, formed by a sheet of aluminum, were
        concentrated by a quartz lens upon phosphorescent calcium
        sulfide. </p>
      <p>This sulfide was tightly packed into a slit cut into a sheet of
        cardboard 0.8 mm thick; the width of the slit was 0.5 mm and its
        length was 15 mm. After exposure to sunlight, a small luminous
        source is thus obtained, which is very sensitive to N rays. </p>
      <p>An Auer burner having been extinguished and removed the
        phosphorescent glow, to my great surprise, remained almost as
        strong as ever, but was darkened by the interposition of lead,
        or wet paper, or the hand, between the lantern and the sulfide.
        Nothing was altered by the suppression of the Auer burner,
        except that the observed actions grew progressively weaker. At
        the end of 20 minutes they still existed, but were scarcely
        noticeable. </p>
      <p>Studying closely the circumstances of the phenomenon, I was not
        long in recognizing that the quartz lens had itself become a
        source of N rays; for when this was removed, all action on the
        sulfide ceased, whereas if it was brought nearer the sulfide,
        even laterally, the latter would become more luminous. I then
        took a quartz plate 15 mm thick, whose surface formed a square
        of 5 cm sides, and exposed this to the N rays emitted by an Auer
        burner through two sheets of aluminum and some black paper. It
        became as active as the lens; when brought nearer the sulfide,
        it seemed, according to Bichat’s expression, as if a veil
        darkening was being removed. A still more marked effect was
        obtained by interposing the quartz plate between the source and
        the sulfide, quite close to the latter. </p>
      <p>In these experiments, the secondary emission by the quartz is
        added to the N rays directly emanating from the source. This
        secondary emission has, indeed, its origin in the whole mass of
        the quartz, and not at the surface only, for if several plates
        of quartz be successively placed on top of each other, the
        effect is seen to increase with each added plate. Iceland spar,
        fluorspar, barite, glass, etc, behave like quartz. The filament
        of a Nernst lamp remains active for several hours after the lamp
        is extinguished. </p>
      <p>A piece of gold, laterally brought near to the sulfide while it
        is being subjected to N rays, increases its glow (note 10).
        Lead, platinum, silver, zinc, etc. produce the same effects.
        These actions persist after the extinction of the N rays, as in
        the case of quartz. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the property of secondary ray emission only
        permeates slowly through a metallic mass. Thus, if one of the
        faces of a sheet of lead 2 mm thick has been exposed to N rays
        for several minutes, this face alone shows activity; an exposure
        of several hours is necessary for the activity to reach the
        opposite face. </p>
      <p>Aluminum, wood, dry or wet paper, and paraffin do not enjoy the
        property of storing N rays. Calcium sulfide, on the other hand,
        does possess this property. When I put a few grams of sulfide in
        an envelope, and then exposed the envelope to N rays, I found
        that its proximity was sufficient to reinforce the
        phosphorescence of a small mass of previously excited sulfide.
        This property explains a constant peculiarity that I have
        previously set forth, viz., that the increase of phosphorescence
        under the action of N rays takes an appreciable time to appear
        or to disappear. For, thanks to the storing-up of the N rays,
        the different parts of a mass of sulfide mutually reinforce
        their phosphorescence; but since, on the one hand, this
        reinforcing is progressive, as I have proved, and since, on the
        other hand, the stored-up provision is not immediately
        exhausted, the result is that when N rays are made to fall on
        phosphorescent calcium sulfide, their effect must increase
        slowly, and that when they are suppressed, their effect can only
        disappear slowly. </p>
      <p>I repeat here that, as a rule, when experimenting with N rays,
        it is advantageous to replace the Auer burner by a Nernst lamp
        absorbing about 200 watts. </p>
      <p>Pebbles picked up at about 4 p.m. in a yard where they had been
        exposed to the sun, spontaneously emitted N rays; bringing them
        near a small mass of phosphorescent sulfide was sufficient to
        increase its luminosity. Fragments of calcareous stone, brick,
        etc., picked up in the same yard, produced analogous actions. </p>
      <p>The activity of all these bodies still persisted after 4 days,
        without any sensible diminution. It is, however, necessary for
        the manifestation of such actions that the surface of these
        bodies be quite dry; for we know that the thinnest layer of
        moisture is sufficient to arrest N rays. Vegetable earth was
        found to be inactive, doubtless on account of its moisture;
        pebbles taken from several centimeters underneath the surface of
        the soil were inactive, even after being dried. </p>
      <p>The phenomena of the storing-up of N rays, which are the object
        of the present note, ought naturally to be compared with those
        of phosphorescence; yet they present a quite distinct feature,
        as I intend to show shortly. </p>
      <p><b>(9)&nbsp; On the Strengthening Action of a Beam of Light on
          the Eyes, When the Beam is Accompanied by N Rays (November 23,
          1903)&nbsp;</b><a name="9"></a> </p>
      <p>While studying the storing-up of N rays by different bodies, I
        had occasion to observe an unexpected phenomenon. My eyes were
        fixed on a small slip of paper, dimly lit, about 1 meter distant
        from me; a brick, one of whose faces had been sun-exposed,
        having been brought nearly laterally to the luminous pencil,
        with its sun-exposed face turned towards me, and a few
        decimeters distant form my eyes, I saw the slip assume a
        heightened glow; when the brick was removed, or when its
        non-exposed face was turned towards me, the paper grew darker.
        To remove all possibility of illusion, I arranged permanently a
        box closed by a cover and wrapped in black paper; in this
        completely enclosed box the brick was placed, the dark
        background on which the slip stood out remained rigorously
        invariable, but the observed effect remained the same. The
        experiment can be varied in different ways. For instance, the
        laboratory shutters being almost closed, and the dial of the
        clock fixed to a wall which was just sufficiently lighted for
        the dial, at a distance of 4 meters, to be just perceived as a
        grey patch with no defined contour, if the observer, without
        changing his place, directs towards his eyes the N rays emitted
        by a previopusly exposed brick or pebble, he sees the dial
        whiten; he can trace distinctly its circular contour, and even
        succeed in seeingthe hands. When the N rays are suppressed, the
        dial again grows dark. Neither the production nor the cessation
        of the phenomenon are instantaneous. </p>
      <p>As in these experiments the luminous object is placed very far
        away from the source of N rays, and as, on the other hand, in
        order that the experiment may succeed, the rays must be
        directed, not towards the object, but towards the eye, there can
        be no question here of an increase in emission of a luminous
        body influenced by N rays, but indeed of a strengthening of the
        effect upon the eye, due to the N rays which are superposed on
        the luminous rays. </p>
      <p>This fact astonished me all the more because, since the
        slightest film of water arrests N rays, it seemed unlikely that
        they could penetrate into the eye, whose humours contain more
        than 98.6% of water (Lohmeyer). The small quantity of slat
        contained in these humours must have rendered them transparent
        to N rays. But then, in all probability, salt water must itself
        be transparent. Experiment shows that this is the case, for
        while a sheet of wet paper completely arrests the N rays, a vase
        of Bohemian glass, 4 cm thick, filled with salt water and placed
        in their path, lets them pass without sensible weakening. A very
        small quantity of sodium chloride is sufficient to render water
        transparent. What is more, salt water is capable of storing-up N
        rays, and in the above-described experiments the brick can be
        replaced by a vase of thin glass, filled with salt water, and
        previously exposed to the sun’s rays; the effect is very marked.
        It is certainly due to the salt water, for the empty vase is
        without effect. This is a unique example of a phosphorescence
        phenomenon in a liquid body. It is true that the wavelengths of
        N rays are very different from those of luminous rays, as
        results from measurements which it is my intention to describe
        very soon. </p>
      <p>The eye of an ox, killed the day before, rid of its muscles and
        the tissues adhering to the sclerotic, proved to be transparent
        to N rays in all directions, and became itself active by
        sun-exposure; it is the storing-up of the N rays by the media of
        the eye which causes the retardation observed in the appearance
        and cessation of the phenomena which are the subject to the
        present note. </p>
      <p>Sea water and the stones exposed to solar radiation store up N
        rays which they afterwards restore. Possibly these phenomena
        play some hitherto unperceived part in certain terrestrial
        phenomena. Perhaps, also, N rays are not without influence on
        certain phenomena of animal and vegetable life. </p>
      <p>The following are further observations concerning the
        strengthening action of N rays on luminous rays. </p>
      <p>It is sufficient for the production of the phenomenon that the
        N rays reach the eye, no matter how, even laterally. This seems
        to indicate that the observer’s eye behaves like an accumulator
        of N rays, and that it is these rays accumulated in the eye
        which act on the retina, jointly with luminous rays. </p>
      <p>It matters little whether in these experiments the rays are
        emitted by a body previously exposed to the sun, or are primary
        rays, produced for instance by a Nernst lamp. </p>
      <p>Sodium hyposulfite, whether solid or dissolved in water,
        constitutes a powerful accumulator of N rays. </p>

          name="10"></a> </p>
      <p>Prof. A. Charpentier kindly undertook to keep me informed with
        regard to the progress of certain researches of a physiological
        nature which he is conducting in connection with N rays,
        unpublished researches which (note 11) promise highly
        interesting results. These experiments led me to the idea of
        examining whether certain bodies did not acquire, by
        compression, the property of emitting N rays. For this purpose I
        compressed, by means of a carpenter’s press, bits of wood,
        glass, rubber, etc., and I immediately observed that these
        bodies had in fact become, during the compression, sources of N
        rays; brought neat a mass of phosphorescent calcium sulfide,
        they increased its luminosity; and they can also be used for
        repeating the experiments which show the strengthening of the
        action on the retina by light when N rays are acting
        simultaneously on the eye. </p>
      <p>These last experiments may be made in a very simple manner. The
        shutters of a room should be closed so as to leave just enough
        light for a white surface standing on a dark background -- for
        instance, the dial of a clock -- to appear, before an observer 4
        or 5 meters distant, like a grey patch with ill-defined
        contours. If a can stick placed before the eyes is bent, the
        grey surface is seen to whiten; if the cane is allowed to
        straighten, the surface grows dark again. Instead of the cane, a
        slip of plate-glass can be used. If this is bent wither with the
        press employed in lectures for showing the doubly refractive
        property of glass acquired by flexure, or simply with the hands.
        With a suitable amount of light, which may be obtained after a
        few trials, these phenomena are easily visible. They are not
        instantaneous, as I have already explained. It is of the utmost
        importance that this retardation be taken into account when one
        wishes to study these phenomena; to this may doubtless be
        ascribed the fact that they have remained so long undetected. </p>
      <p>I was then led to ask myself whether bodies which are
        themselves in a state of strained internal equilibrium would not
        emit N rays. That they do so in indeed confirmed by experiment.
        Rupert’s drops, hardened steel, hammer-hardened brass, melted
        sulfur of crystalline structure, etc., are spontaneous and
        permanent sources of N rays. One can, for instance, repeat the
        experiments with the clock dial, employing, instead of a
        compressed body, a hardened steel tool, such as a chisel or
        file, or even a pocket-knife, without in any way bending or
        compressing them; similarly, bringing near to a small mass of
        phosphorescent calcium sulfide a knife-blade or a bit of
        unannealed glass is sufficient to increase the phosphorescence
        Non-hardened steel is without action; a chisel which is
        successively hardened and softened in turn is active when hard
        and inactive when the temper is taken out of it. These actions
        traverse, without any notable weakening, a plate of aluminum 1.5
        cm thick, an oak board 3 cm thick, black paper, etc. </p>
      <p>The emission of N rays by tempered steel seems to last
        indefinitely. Some lathe tools and a stamp for leather of the
        18th century, which have been preserved in my family, and have
        certainly not been rehardened since the date of their
        manufacture, emit N rays like freshly tempered steel. A knife,
        found in a Gallo-Roman tomb, situated in the district of
        Craincourt (Lorraine), and dating from the Merovingian epoch, as
        is attested by the objects found there (glass and earthenware
        jars, fibulae, belt buckles, etc.), emits N rays just kike a
        modern knife. These rays originate exclusively from the blade; a
        test with a file showed that the blade alone is tempered, and
        that the tailpiece intended to be fixed in a handle is not
        tempered. </p>
      <p>The emission of N rays by this steel blade has thus persisted
        for more than 12 centuries, and does not appear to have abated.
      </p>
      <p>The spontaneity and the indefinite duration of the emission by
        steel suggests the idea of assimilating it to the radiant
        properties of uranium, discovered by M. H. Becquerel, properties
        which the bodies since discovered by M. and Mme. Curie, viz.
        radium, polonium, etc., exhibit with so much intensity.
        Nevertheless, N rays are certainly spectrum radiation; they are
        emitted by the same sources as spectrum radiation; they are
        reflected and polarized, and possess well-defined wavelengths,
        which I have measured. The energy which their emission
        represents is most likely borrowed from the potential energy
        corresponding to the strained state of tempered steel; this
        expenditure is doubtless very slight, since the effects of the N
        rays are likewise slight, which explains the apparently
        unlimited duration of the emissions. </p>
      <p>An iron plate, bent so as to impress on it a permanent
        deformation, emits N rays; but the emission ceases after a few
        minutes. A block of aluminum, fresh-hammered, behaves in an
        analogous manner; but the time of emission is even shorter. In
        these two cases the state of molecular strain is transitory, as
        is also the emission of N rays. </p>
      <p>Torsion produces effects analogous to compression. </p>
      <p><b>(11) On the Dispersion of N Rays and on their Wavelength
          (January 18, 1904)&nbsp;</b><a name="11"></a> </p>
      <p>To study the dispersion and the wavelengths of N rays, I used
        methods quite similar to those employed for light. In order to
        avoid complications which might have resulted from the
        storing-up of N rays, I used exclusively prisms and lenses of
        aluminum, a substance which does not absorb their rays. </p>
      <p>The following is the method employed to study dispersion. The
        rays are produced by a Nernst lamp, enclosed in a lantern of
        sheet-iron, pierced with an opening, which is shut by aluminum
        foil; the rays from the lamp which pass through this opening are
        sifted by a deal board 2 cm thick, a second sheet of aluminum,
        and two leaves of black paper, so as to eliminate radiations
        foreign to N rays. In front of those screens, and at a distance
        of 14 cm from the lamp filament, a large screen of wet cardboard
        is arranged, in which a slit has been cut 5 mm wide and 3.5 cm
        high, exactly opposite the lamp filament. In this way I obtain a
        well-defined pencil of N rays; this pencil is received on an
        aluminum foil prism whose refractive angle is 27° 15’, placed so
        that one of its faces is normal to the incident pencil. </p>
      <p>It is, then, possible to prove that from the other refractive
        face of the prism several pencils of N rays, horizontally
        dispersed, emerge. For this purpose a slit 1 mm broad and 1 cm
        high, cut in a sheet of cardboard, is filled with calcium
        sulfide rendered phosphorescent; by displacing this slit, the
        position of the dispersed pencils is determined without
        difficulty, and the deviations being known, their refractive
        indices are deduced. This is the method of Descartes. I thus
        established the existence of N radiations, whose indices are
        respectively 1.04, 1.19, 1.29, 1.36, 1.40, 1.48, 1.68, and 1.85.
        In order to measure with more exactness the first two indices I
        made use of another aluminum prism having an angle of 60°, I
        again found for one of the indices the same value, 1.04; and for
        the other, 1.15 instead of 1.19. </p>
      <p>In order to control the results obtained by the prisms, I
        determined the indices by producing, by means of an aluminum
        lens, images of the lamp filament, and measuring their distances
        from the lens. The lens, which is plano-convex, has a radius of
        curvature of 6.63 cm, and an aperture of 6.89 cm. The slit of
        the wet screen is widened so as to form a circular opening 6 cm
        in diameter; the lens is placed at a known distance ( <i>p</i>
        cm) from the incandescent filament, and by means of the
        phosphorescent sulfide, the position of the conjugate images of
        the filament is determined. The following table gives the values
        of the indices found, both with the prism and the lens: --- </p>

        1.36 ~ 1.31 ~ " <br>
        1.20 ~ " ~ " </p>
      <p>Here is another verification of these results: if for the
        fourth index the mean value 1.42 is adopted, one works out that
        for an aluminum prism of 60°, the incidence giving the minimum
        deviation is 45° 19’, and that this deviation is 30° 38’; the
        observed deviation was 31° 10’. With the same incidence, the
        calculated deviation of the radiation, whose index is 1.67, is
        57° 42’; the observed deviation was 56° 30’. </p>
      <p>I now pass on to the determination of wavelengths. </p>
      <p>By means of the above-described arrangement for studying
        dispersion by the prism of 27° 14’, refracted pencils are
        obtained, each of which is sensibly homogeneous. If we make the
        pencil we wish to study impinge on a second screen of wet
        cardboard, pierced with a slit 1.5 mm wide, we can isolate a
        narrow portion of this pencil. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, a piece of aluminum foil is fixed to the
        moving radial arm of a goniometer, so that its plane is normal
        to the arm; in this foil a slit is cut only 0.07 mm wide, and
        filled with phosphorescent calcium sulfide; the goniometer is
        arranged so that its axis is exactly underneath the slit of the
        second wet cardboard. By turning the arm, the path of the pencil
        is exactly marked out, and one can verify that it is quite
        unique, and is accompanied by no lateral pencil, such as
        diffraction could eventually produce in the case of large
        wavelengths. </p>
      <p>A grating is then placed in front of the slit of the second wet
        cardboard (for instance, a Brunner grating of 200 lines per mm).
        If, now, the emerging pencil is explored by turning the arm
        which bears the phosphorescent sulfide, the existence of a
        system of diffraction fringes is confirmed, just as with light,
        only these fringes are much closer together, and are sensibly
        equidistant. This already indicates that N rays have much
        shorter wavelengths than luminous radiations. </p>
      <p>The angular distance of the fringes, or what amounts to the
        same thing, the rotation of the arm corresponding to the passage
        of the phosphorescent slit from one luminous fringe to the next,
        is very small. It is therefore determined by the method of
        reflection, with the aid of a divided scale and telescope, a
        plane-mirror being fixed to the arm. Moreover, one measures, not
        the distance between tow consecutive fringes, but that between
        two symmetrical fringes of a high order -- for example, that
        between the tenth fringe on the right, and the tenth fringe on
        the left. From these measures of angle, and from the number of
        lines per millimeter of the grating, the wavelength can be
        deduced by the known formula. </p>
      <p>Each wavelength has been determined by three series of
        measurements, effected with three gratings, having respectively
        200, 100, and 50 lines per millimeter. </p>
      <p>The following table exhibits the results of these measures: </p>
      <p><i>Wavelengths:</i> <br>
        Indices ~ 200 lines/mm ~ 100/mm ~ 50/mm ~ Probable Values </p>
      <p>1.04 ~ 0.00813 ~ 0.00795 ~ 0.00839 ~ 0.00815 <br>
        1.19 ~ 0.0093 ~ 0.0102 ~ 0.0106 ~ 0.0099 <br>
        1.4 ~ 0.0117 ~ " ~ " ~ 0.0117 <br>
        1.68 ~ 0.0146 ~ " ~ " ~ 0.0146 <br>
        1.85~ 0.0176 ~ 0.0171 ~ 0.0184 ~ 0.0176 </p>
      <p>Being desirous of controlling these determinations by the use
        of a quite different method, I had recourse to Newton’s rings.
        These being produced, in yellow light, for instance, of one
        passes from one dark ring to the following, the variation of
        optical retardation in air is one wavelength of yellow light.
        If, now, with the same apparatus and the same incidence, rings
        are produced by means of N rays, and the number of these rings
        comprised between two dark rings in yellow light is counted, we
        shall obtain the number of times which the wavelength of N rays
        is contained in the wavelength of yellow light. This methods,
        applied to rays of index 1.04, gave the values of 0.0085 instead
        of 0.0081 found by the gratings; and for the index 1.85, the
        value 0.017 instead of 0.0176. Though the ting method is
        inferior to the grating method, on account of the uncertainty
        attending the exact position of the dark rings in the
        experiment, an uncertainty which is due to the necessity of
        rendering these rings very wide, the concordance of the numbers
        obtained by the two methods constitutes a valuable control. </p>
      <p>In the tables given above I have retained all the decimals
        occurring in the calculation of the numbers deduced from
        observation. Although I cannot with certainty indicate the
        degree of approximation of the results, I believe, nevertheless,
        that the relative errors do not exceed 4 percent. </p>
      <p>The wavelength of N rays are much smaller than those of light.
        This is contrary to what I had imagined for a moment, and
        contrary to the determinations which M. Sagnac thought he had
        deduced from the position of the multiple images of a source,
        obtained with a quartz lens, images attributed by him to
        diffraction. I had previously observed that while polished mica
        lets N rays pass, roughened mica stops them, and also that
        whereas polished glass reflects them regularly, ground glass
        diffuses them. These facts were already an explanation that N
        rays could not have large wavelengths. If we desire to study the
        transparency of a body, we must take care that the surface is
        well polished. Thus I had at first classed rock salt amongst
        opaque substances, because the specimen I used, having been sawn
        from a large block, had remained unpolished; in reality, rock
        salt is transparent. </p>
      <p>The radiations of very small wavelength, discovered y M.
        Schumann, are to a very great extent absorbed by air; N rays are
        not. This implies the existence of absorption bands between the
        ultraviolet spectrum and N rays. The wavelength of N rays
        increases with their refractive index, contrary to what occurs
        with luminous radiations. </p>
      <p>If the increase in brilliancy of a small luminous source by the
        action of N rays is to be attributed to a transformation of
        these radiations into luminous radiations, this transformation
        is in conformity with Stokes’law. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;(12) Registration by Photography of the Action
          Produced by N Rays on a Small Electric Spark (February 22,
          1904)&nbsp;</b><a name="12"></a> </p>
      <p>Though N rays have no intrinsic action on the photographic
        plate, it is nevertheless possible to utilize photography to
        reveal their presence and study their action. This object is
        attained, as I showed as long ago as May 11, 1903, by making a
        small, luminous source act for a determined period on a
        sensitive plate, whilst this source is subjected to the action
        of N rays, and then repeating the experiment for the same
        interval of time and under the same conditions, save that the N
        rays are suppressed. The impression produced is notably more
        intense in the first case than in the second. As an example of
        the application of this method, I gave at the time two
        photoengravings, whose comparison shows that water, even when
        used in very thin films, arrests N rays issuing from an Auer
        burner. Since then I have extended the experiments to the
        registration of actions produced by N rays from various sources,
        and I have perfected the process, as will be shown. </p>
      <p>A small, luminous spark is the most appropriate luminous source
        for this kind of investigation: for, on the one hand, it is very
        actinic, and, on the other, it can be maintained as long as
        necessary at the same intensity. Although it is impossible to
        obtain absolute steadiness of glow in the spark, since these
        variations are not produced symmetrically, their influence
        should disappear in the total impression received by the plate,
        even after a very short exposure. I contrived, besides, to
        eliminate even still more completely this cause of perturbation,
        by repeatedly alternating the experiments, as I will proceed to
        show. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 represents a horizontal section of the apparatus
        employed. AB is the photographic plate, 13 cm wide; E is the
        spark enclosed in a cardboard box, FGHI, open only on one side
        facing the plate, and allowing the spark to act on one half, OB,
        of the plate only; CD is a lead screen wrapped in wet paper,
        rigidly connected with the frame which holds the plate. The N
        rays, proceeding from any source, form a pencil, having the
        direction NN’. With this arrangement the N rays are arrested by
        the screen CD; the spark, while it acts on half-plate OB, is
        sheltered from the rays. </p>
      <p><b><i>Figures 4, 5 ~</i></b> </p>
      <center><img src="0blo3.gif" height="410" width="307"></center>
      <p>Now impart to the frame containing the plate a translation to
        the right equal to half its length (Figure 5); the other half,
        AO, of the plate takes the place formerly occupied by OB; and
        this time the screen CD, carried along with the frame in this
        movement, is no longer interposed in the path of the rays. The
        half-plate AO therefore receives the action of the spark while
        subjected to the rays. </p>
      <p>This being understood, the experiment is as follows: first the
        plate is kept in the first of the above-indicated positions
        during 5 seconds, then in the second position also for 5
        seconds; it is then brought back to the first position, and the
        double operation just described is repeated several times. </p>
      <p>After an interval of time equal to an even multiple of 5
        seconds -- for instance, 100 seconds -- each of the half-plates
        has been exposed to the spark for an equal period, only, while
        AO was exposed, N rays were in action, and while OB was exposed
        there were none. </p>
      <p>Thanks to an arrangement of guides and buffer-stops, the
        to-and-fro motion of the frame can be executed with perfect
        certainty and regularity, in spite of the darkness. A metronome
        is used to regulate the action. </p>
      <p>The spark is produced by a small induction-coil, known as du
        Bois-Reymond’s chariot apparatus; it strikes between two blunt
        points of platinum-iridium, carefully machined and polished.
        These are fixed to the two jaws of a pair of wooden pliers which
        tend to close by elasticity, and are kept apart by a micrometer
        screw. At a distance of about 2 cm from the spark, and facing
        the plate, a plate of ground glass is fixed. As I have
        previously mentioned, the light of the spark produces on this
        plate an extensive luminous patch, much easier to observe than
        the naked spark, and giving on the photographic plate
        impressions of much more regular form. The regulating of the
        spark is the delicate part of the experiment. The induced
        current must first be adjusted, by modifying the primary current
        on the one hand, and the position of the secondary coil on the
        other, till the spark becomes very small. The points are washed
        in alcohol, then a slip of dry paper is drawn between them, for
        the purpose of drying and repolishing their surface; then the
        micrometer screw s turned so as to make the spark as short as
        possible, yet without incurring any risk of the points touching
        by any chance vibration, which would make it disappear
        intermittently. By a methodical process of trial and error,
        which sometimes demands much time and patience, one succeeds in
        getting a spark both regular and very feeble; it is then
        sensitive to the action of N rays. If one directs on it a pencil
        of these radiations, proceeding from any source, one sees the
        patch on the ground glass increase in size and glow; at the same
        time its central part becomes more luminous, appearing wrapped
        in a kind of nimbus. One can then proceed with the photographic
        experiment. I made about 40 such experiments, employing in turn,
        as sources of N rays, a Nernst lamp, compressed wood, hardened
        steel, Rupert’s drops, etc. I have varied the experiments in
        different ways -- for example, by changing the side of the
        screen CD, by using a zinc screen transparent to N rays, etc.
        Several eminent physicists, who have been good enough to visit
        my laboratory, have witnessed them. Of these 40 experiments, one
        was unsuccessful: the rays were produced by a Nernst lamp, and
        instead of the expected unequal impressions, two sensibly
        identical images were obtained. I believe this failure, unique,
        be it remarked, to be due to an insufficient regulation of the
        spark, which, doubtless, was not sensitive. Figure 6 is a
        photo-engraved reproduction of the prints obtained with and
        without N rays issuing from a Nernst lamp. </p>

      <p>Figure 7, similarly, shows the result of an experiment with N
        rays, produced by two large files. </p>
      <p>Though the photogravures are far from rendering in a
        satisfactory manner the aspect of the originals, they
        nevertheless show the influence of N rays on a photographic
        impression. </p>
      <p>I give further (Figures 8 and 9) the reproduction of
        photographs, showing that N rays, issuing from a Crooke’s tube,
        are polarized. </p>
      <p>These photographs date from the month of April 1903. They were
        not obtained by the method of reiterated alternation of
        exposure, as this method is difficult to apply to this case; but
        the experiments have been repeated a great number of times with
        the most minute precautions, and the constancy of the results is
        an absolute guarantee of their worth. </p>
      <p>From my communication of May 11, 1903, and from what precedes,
        it is clear that from the beginning of my researches on N rays,
        I had succeeded in recording their action on the spark by an
        objective method. </p>

        to Dr. Th. Guidloz, led me to suspect the existence of a variety
        of N rays, which, instead of increasing, on the contrary,
        diminished the glow of a feeble luminous source. I undertook to
        search for rays of this type amongst those emitted by a Nernst
        lamp. While previously studying the spectrum of this emission,
        produced by an aluminum prism, I had not met with such
        radiations. I consequently thought that there were reasons for
        studying anew, and still more minutely, the feebly deviated part
        of the spectrum. On exploring this region, by means of a narrow
        slit filled with phosphorescent calcium sulfide, I ascertained,
        without any difficulty, that, in certain azimuths, the glow of
        the spark diminished under the action of the rays, and
        increased, on the contrary, when they were intercepted by a wet
        screen. These were, in fact, the looked-for radiations; I will
        call them N<sub>1</sub> rays. </p>
      <p>Although the aluminum prism of 27° 15’ I used previously is
        suitable for these experiments, nevertheless, in order to
        increase the dispersion, I used an aluminum prism of 60°, and
        afterwards another of 90°. With the help of the latter, I very
        carefully studied the feebly deviated part of the spectrum. The
        prism was arranged so that the angle of incidence was 20°; for
        each radiation, the deviation was measured and the refractive
        index deduced; then the wavelength was determined by means of a
        Brunner grating of 200 lines per millimeter, by the process
        already described. The following table gives the numbers which
        result from this study, and were used for constructing the
        diagram (Figure 10), in which the abscissae stand for the
        wavelengths and the ordinates for the indices diminished by
        unity. </p>
      <p><i>Nature of Rays ~ Indices ~ Wavelengths</i> </p>
      <p>N1 ~ 1.004 ~ 0.003 <br>
        N ~ 1.0064 ~ 0.0048 <br>
        N1 ~ 1.0096 ~ 0.0056 <br>
        N ~ 1.011 ~ 0.0067 <br>
        N1 ~ 1.0125 ~ 0.0074 <br>
        N ~ 1.029 ~ 0.0083 <br>
        N ~ 1.041 ~ 0.0081 </p>
      <p>Each of the divisions marked on the axis of abscissae
        corresponds to 0.001, and each of the divisions marked on the
        ordinate axis corresponds to an excess over unity equal to 0.01.
      </p>
      <p>In spite of all the care with which the experiments were
        executed, the deviations are so small, and, consequently, the
        indices so near to unity, that the table and diagram can only be
        regarded as a preliminary indication of the behavior of the
        dispersion in the very slightly deviated part of the spectrum.
        An important consequence arises from these measures, viz. points
        corresponding to N rays, and those corresponding to N<sub>1</sub>
        rays, are all situated on the same curve, within the limits of
        experimental error. The study of radiations still less
        refrangible than those I have dwelt on appeared to me
        impracticable. To avoid confusion, I was obliged to adopt a very
        large scale for the ordinates; this is why I could not plot on
        the diagram the results of my former measurements of the more
        refrangible N rays. These results give points situated on a
        branch of the curve, starting from the topmost point on the
        right, and rising almost vertically, with a feeble inclination
        from bottom to top, and from right to left, and a slight
        convexity turned upwards. </p>
      <p>Certain sources seem to emit N<sub>1</sub> rays exclusively,
        or, at least, these rays predominate in the emission. This is
        the case with copper and silver wire, and with hard-drawn
        platinum wire. M. Bichat has observed that ethylic ether, when
        brought to the state of forced extension, by the process
        discovered by M. Berthelot, emits N<sub>1</sub> rays. When this
        state of strain ceases, whether spontaneously or under the
        action of a slight blow, the emission of N1 rays immediately
        disappears. </p>
      <p>N<sub>1</sub> rays can be stored up like N rays. For instance,
        one need only bring a bit of stretched copper wire in proximity
        to a lump of quartz to make the quartz emit N<sub>1</sub> rays
        for some time after. </p>

      <p><b>(14)&nbsp; On Peculiarities Presented by the Action
          Exercised by N Rays on a&nbsp; Dimly Lighted Surface (February
          2, 1904)&nbsp;</b><a name="14"></a> </p>
      <p>Consider a phosphorescent screen, or, more generally, a dimly
        lighted surface. If this surface is viewed normally, one notices
        that the action of N rays is to render it more luminous; if, on
        the contrary, the surface is viewed very obliquely, nearly
        tangentially, the action of N rays is to render it less
        luminous. In other words, the action of N rays increases the
        quantity of light normally emitted, while it diminishes the
        light emitted in a very oblique direction. If one looks at it in
        an intermediate position, no appreciable effect is observed.
        This explains the fact, observed in all N ray experiments, that
        only the observer placed exactly in front of the sensitive
        screen perceives the effect of these rays. It also shows how
        illusory it would be to try to make an audience witness these
        experiments; the effects perceived by different persons,
        depending as they do on their positions with regard to the
        screen, would certainly be contradictory or imperceptible. The
        rays I have called N<sub>1</sub> rays have an inverse action on
        all cases to that of N rays; they diminish the light emitted
        normally, and increase the light emitted tangentially. M. Mace
        de Lepinay (see C.R. cxxxvii, p. 77, January 11, 1902) has found
        that sound vibrations increase the glow of a phosphorescent
        screen as seen by an observer viewing it normally. I have
        noticed that if the screen is viewed tangentially, the
        phosphorescence is seen to decrease under the action of the
        sound waves. The action of a magnetic field or of an
        electromotive force on a feebly luminous surface, discovered by
        M. C. Gutton (see C.R., cxxxviii, p. 268, February 1, 1904),
        presents the same particularities. </p>
      <p>To sum up, in all the above-mentioned&nbsp; actions, the
        modification undergone by the luminous emission consists in a
        change in its distribution along the different directions
        comprised between the normal and the tangent plane to the
        luminous surface. </p>
      <p><b>(15)&nbsp; On the Comparative Action of Heat and N Rays on
          Phosphorescence (March 14, 1904)&nbsp;</b><a name="15"></a> </p>
      <p>I have recently indicated that, whilst the action of N rays
        increases the quantity of light emitted by a phosphorescent
        screen in a normal direction, it diminishes the quantity of
        light emitted very obliquely. As is well known, heat also acts
        on phosphorescence, whose brilliance it temporarily increases.
        When investigating whether this action of heat offered the same
        peculiarities as that on N rays, with regard to the direction of
        the emitted light, I found that, on the contrary, heat produces
        an increase in brilliancy in all directions comprised between
        the normal and the tangent plane. Hence we are in a position to
        distinguish between the effects produced on phosphorescence by
        heat on the one hand, and by N rays, sound waves, magnetic and
        electric fields on the other. </p>
      <p>The following is another case in which the effects are
        different. Take a rectangular cardboard screen, 5 cm high and 12
        cm long, for instance, coated very uniformly with calcium
        sulfide, and rendered very feebly phosphorescent. If the
        temperature of a portion of the screen is raised, this part
        becomes more luminescent than the rest. If, instead of this, we
        let fall on one half of the screen a pencil of N rays,
        proceeding, for example, from a Nernst lamp, we find no sensible
        increase in its glow; but if in front of this half-screen a
        small opaque object is placed, for instance, a small key or a
        bit of metal foil, cut off by daylight, this is seen to come out
        very strongly on the luminous background, while if it is placed
        on the half not receiving the N rays, its outline is vague and
        indeterminate, and seems even to disappear at times. By shifting
        slowly the object on the screen, its passage from one
        half-screen to the other is rendered visible by changes in the
        boldness of its outline. If instead of viewing the object
        normally, we observed it very obliquely, the phenomena are
        reversed. </p>
      <p><b>(16)&nbsp; Complementary Notes&nbsp;</b><a name="16"></a> </p>
      <p>(1) As mentioned in the Preliminary Notice, and as will be seen
        in the later communication, the properties attributed in the
        present paper to X rays, belong not to these rays, but to a new
        kind of rays, to which I have given the name of N rays. The
        experiments are correct, and the rectification only applies to
        the nature of the rays which have been studied. </p>
      <p>(2)&nbsp; What I attributed then to S rays is, in reality, die
        to diffused N rays. The rotation of the plane of polarization of
        N rays by active substances is perhaps very great, since their
        wavelengths are very small. It may be, then, that the angles I
        have observed are merely the remainders obtained by subtracting
        360° once or several times from the real rotations. For the same
        reason, the rotations in a contrary direction could be apparent
        only. Investigation on this point remains still to be carried
        out; the operations should be conducted successively on each of
        the homogeneous pencils resulting from the dispersion of a
        pencil of N rays by an aluminum prism. The existence of magnetic
        rotary polarization has recently been shown by M. H. Bagard,
        whose investigations are still in progress (C.R., cxxxviii). </p>
      <p>(3) Unpolished mica arrests a pencil of N rays; these are not,
        however, absorbed, but only diffused, as in the case of light. </p>
      <p>(4) Rock salt is in reality transparent. What has at first
        misled me was that the plate of salt I used, having been sawn
        out of a large block, had remained unpolished. In this state it
        was only translucent, whether for N rays or for light. When
        polished with wet paper, it becomes transparent both for N rays
        and light; when the polish disappears, it becomes translucent
        again. </p>
      <p>(5)&nbsp; As I state in the text, these rough data on the
        transparency of different substances will have to be completed
        by new experiments methodically conducted. I have since found
        that copper continues to transmit N rays emitted by a Nernst
        lamp, even when used in thickness of 65 cm; that, similarly,
        glass is very transparent, etc. M. Bichat has studied the
        transparency of various bodies; in particular, he has
        ascertained that the opacity of a sheet of lead is due to the
        fact that it is superficially covered with oxide and carbonate.
        Metallic lead lets pass certain of the N radiations (see C.R.
        cxxxviii, p. 548, February 29, 1904). </p>
      <p>(6)&nbsp; See the communication of May 25 and June 15, 1903. </p>
      <p>(7)&nbsp; I have since found that, on the contrary, N rays have
        much shorter wavelengths than those of light (See my
        communication of January 18, 1904). </p>
      <p>(8)&nbsp; See note (7) above. </p>
      <p>(9)&nbsp; The phosphorescence may be intense, provided it be
        not at its maximum. </p>
      <p>(10) The piece of gold must of course be also receiving the N
        rays. </p>
      <p>(11)&nbsp; These researches have since been communicated to the
        Academy of Sciences (See C.R. cxxxvii, p. 1049, December 24,
        1903). </p>
      <p>(12)&nbsp; According to some experiments which I have made with
        an aluminum lens on rays issuing from a knife-blade, these
        should have very large indices. M. Charpentier has found that
        wet cardboard transmits these rays. These questions remain to be
        studied. </p>
      <p><b>(17)&nbsp; Instructions for Making Phosphorescent Screens
          Adapted for the Observation of N Rays&nbsp;</b><a name="17"></a>
      </p>
      <p>(1) If one proposes only to ascertain the production of N rays
        in given circumstances, a phosphorescent screen, made as
        follows, may be used with advantage: some powdered calcium
        sulfide is mixed with collodion, diluted with ether, so as to
        form a very thin paste; then, with a water-color brush, drops of
        this paste are painted on blackened cardboard, so as to produce
        stains several millimeters in diameter, close to each other. The
        screen then presents the aspect of a spotted fabric. If, after
        being exposed to light, it is examined in a dark room, and in
        perfect silence, some of the spots will appear less luminous
        than the others. Usually, some will not seem to be sharply
        separated from their neighbors, but will form a sort of confused
        nebula less visible than the rest. Now, if one speaks aloud... </p>

      <p><b>(18)&nbsp; How the Action of N Rays Should be Observed&nbsp;</b><a
          name="18"></a> </p>
      <p>It is indispensable in these experiments to avoid all strain on
        the eye, all effort, whether visual or for eye accommodation,
        and in no way to try to fix the eye upon the luminous source,
        whose variations in glow one wishes to ascertain. On the
        contrary, one must, so to say, see the source without looking at
        it, and even direct one’s glance vaguely in a neighboring
        direction. The observer must play an absolutely passive part,
        under penalty of seeing nothing. Silence should be observed as
        much as possible. Any smoke, and especially tobacco smoke, must
        be carefully avoided, as being liable to perturb or even
        entirely mask the effect of the N rays. When viewing the screen
        or luminous object, no attempt at eye-accommodation should be
        made. In fact, the observer should accustom himself to look at
        the screen just as a painter, and in particular an
        "impressionist" painter, would look at a landscape. To attain
        this requires some practice, and is not an easy task. Some
        people, in fact, never succeed. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">"Photographic Records of the Action of
              N-Rays"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The much discussed problem of the existence of N rays could be
        settled only by an objective demonstration of their effects. As
        these rays exert no immediate action on photographic plates,
        Prof. Blondlot some time ago endeavored to obtain indirect
        photographic records, by taking a view of the same spark first
        without N rays, and afterward with N rays. In the latter case a
        more intense impression on the photographic plate was observed.
        Opponents of the French scientist contended that the electric
        sparks were not of sufficient constancy to warrant him drawing
        any definite conclusions from these experiments. Prof. Blondlot
        therefore continued his efforts in this direction, and in a
        memoir published in a recent issue of the Revue Generale des
        Sciences describes a few further experiments where every care
        has been takes to avoid any uncertainty. These experiments
        really demonstrate the objective existence of the radiations.
        The process used was practically the same as that employed
        previously, but for a telephone inserted in the secondary
        circuit of the induction coil. The assistant, by keeping the
        telephone receiver close to his ear, was in a position to check
        the regularity of the spark throughout the duration of the
        experiments. If the spark was extinguished owing to an excessive
        distance of the points, the sound in the telephone was also
        discontinued. If, on the contrary, the points touched each
        other, the sound became much more intense. Any irregularities in
        the spark might thus be detected, and if any were observed
        during a photographic experiment, the photographs were rejected.
      </p>
      <p>In a series of 35 experiments carried out with every care, 23
        tests showed a most striking difference between the images
        obtained with and without N rays, while 8 tests gave a rather
        noticeable contrast, and 4 tests a contrast still visible though
        less marked. All the plates did show the action of N rays, and
        if the difference between the two photographic impression was
        not always of the same intensity, this must be ascribed to the
        impossibility of obtaining an absolutely exact regulation of the
        small spark. </p>
      <p>It is of great importance that exceedingly feeble sparks should
        be employed, the brilliancy of which be little more than the
        minimum luminous intensity capable of producing some impression
        on the plate. Under these conditions a small variation in
        luminous intensity will result in a great variation in the
        intensity of the photographic image, while in the case of a
        stronger illumination only a very small variation is obtained. </p>
      <p>In the experiments referred to, the N rays were produced by a
        Nernst lamp enclosed in a sheet-metal lantern. The N rays
        traversed successively an aluminum foil constituting the front
        wall of the latter, a pinewood plank 2 cm in thickness, another
        aluminum foil, an aluminum lens, a zinc foil, a piece of
        whitewood 2 cm in thickness, an aluminum foil, constituting an
        electric screen to protect the spark, and finally the wall of
        the pasteboard box inclosing the spark. </p>
      <p>With all these experiments one second or more has been allowed
        for the total duration of the exposure made without N rays so as
        to make sure that this exposure was somewhat longer than the
        other. Instead of simply taking two successive exposures with
        and without N rays, another method, consisting in cross-wise
        fractional photography, has been chosen in some instances. The
        exposure with N rays was made either before or after the other,
        and the experiments were varied in many other ways. Metal
        screens were used so as to eliminate any disturbances likely to
        be produced by electrical influence. Checking experiments were
        made, from time to time either by withdrawing the moist paper or
        by moistening it with salt water, when equivalent images were
        obtained in each case. </p>
      <p>These experiments seem to be free from any objection. While the
        results practically agree with those obtained in connection with
        former researches, the following interesting fact was discovered
        incidentally: </p>
      <p>If N rays be made to strike the primary spark of a Hertz
        oscillator, the secondary spark will decrease in brilliancy.
        This shows that N rays modify the electric phenomenon itself,
        and the intimate alteration of the spark is doubtless the cause
        for which the photographic experiments on the action of N rays
        is used as illuminant, whereas no result is obtained with other
        sources of light. </p>

        <p><b>by William Seabrook</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Excerpted from: "Random Walk through Physics"; condensed from
        "Dr. Wood: Modern Wizard of the Laboratory", by William Seabrook
        (Harcort Brace, 1941). </p>
      <p>In the last autumn of 1903, Professor R. Blondlot, head of the
        Department of Physics at the University of Nancy, member of the
        French Academy, and widely known as an investigator, announced
        the discovery of a new ray, which he called N ray, with
        properties far transcending those of the x-rays. Reading of his
        remarkable experiments, I attempted to repeat his observations,
        but failed to confirm them after wasting a whole morning.
        According to Blondlot, the rays were given off spontaneously by
        many metals. A piece of paper, very feebly illuminated, could be
        used as a detector, for, wonder of wonders, when the N rays fell
        upon the eye they increased its ability to see objects in a
        nearly dark room. </p>
      <p>Fuel was added by a score of other investigators. Twelve papers
        had appeared in the Comptes rendus before the year was out. A.
        Charpentier, famous for his fantastic experiments on hypnotism,
        claimed that N rays were given off by muscle, nerves, and the
        brain, and his incredible claims were published in the Comptes,
        sponsored by the great d'Arsonval, France's foremost authority
        on electricity and magnetism. </p>
      <p>Blondlot next announced that he had constructed a spectroscope
        with aluminum lenses and a prism of the same metal, and found a
        spectrum of lines separated by dark intervals, showing that
        there were N rays of different refrangibility and wave length.
        He measured the wavelengths. Jean Becquerel claimed that N rays
        could be transmitted over a wire. By early summer, Blondlot had
        published twenty papers, Charpentier twenty, and J. Becquerel
        ten, all describing new properties and sources of the rays. </p>
      <p>Scientists in all other countries were frankly skeptical, but
        the French Academy stamped Blondlot's work with its approval by
        awarding him the Lalande prize of 20000 francs and its gold
        medal for the discovery of the N rays'. </p>
      <p>In September (1904) I went to Cambridge for the meeting of the
        British Association for the Advancement of Science. After the
        meeting some of us got together for a discussion of what was to
        be done about the N rays. Professor Rubens, of Berlin, was most
        outspoken in his denunciation. He felt particularly aggrieved
        because the Kaiser had commanded him to come to Potsdam and
        demonstrate the rays. After wasting two weeks in vain attempts
        to duplicate the Frenchman's experiments, he was greatly
        embarrassed by having to confess to the Kaiser his failure.
        Turning to me he said, Professor Wood, will you not go to Nancy
        immediately and test the experiments that are going on there?'
        Yes, yes', said all of the Englishmen, that's a good idea, go
        ahead.' I suggested that Rubens go, as he was the chief victim,
        but he said that Blondlot had been most polite in answering his
        many letters asking for more detailed information, and it would
        not look well if he undertook to expose him. Besides,' he added,
        you are an American, and you Americans can do anything ...' </p>
      <p>So I visited Nancy, meeting Blondlot by appointment at his
        laboratory in the early evening. He spoke no English, and I
        elected German as our means of communication, as I wanted him to
        feel free to speak confidentially to his assistant. </p>
      <p>He first showed me a card on which some circles had been
        painted in luminous paint. He turned down the gas light and
        called my attention to their increased luminosity, when the N
        ray was turned on. I said I saw no change. He said that was
        because my eyes were not sensitive enough, so that proved
        nothing. I asked him if I could move an opaque lead screen in
        and out of the path of the rays while he called out the
        fluctuations of the screen. He was almost 100 percent wrong and
        called out fluctuations when I made no movement at all, and that
        proved a lot, but I held my tongue. He then showed me the dimly
        lighted clock, and tried to convince me that he could see the
        hands when he held a large flat file just above his eyes. I
        asked if I could hold the file, for I had noticed a flat wooden
        ruler on his desk, and remembered that wood was one of the few
        substances that never emitted N rays. He agreed to this, and I
        felt around in the dark for the ruler and held it in front of
        his face. Oh, yes, he could see the hands perfectly. This also
        proved something. </p>
      <p>But the crucial and most exciting test was now to come.
        Accompanied by the assistant, who was by this time casting
        rather hostile glances at me, we went into the room where the
        spectroscope with the aluminum lenses and prism were installed.
        In place of an eyepiece, this instrument had a vertical thread,
        painted with luminous paint, which could be moved along in the
        region where the N ray spectrum was supposed to be turning a
        wheel having graduations and numerals on its rim. Blondlot took
        a seat in front of the instrument and slowly turned the wheel.
        The thread was supposed to brighten as it crossed the invisible
        lines of the N-ray spectrum. He read off the numbers on the
        graduated scale for a number of the lines, by the light of a
        small, darkroom red lantern. This experiment has convinced a
        number of skeptical visitors, as he could repeat his
        measurements in their presence, always getting the same numbers.
      </p>
      <p>I asked him to repeat his measurements, and reached over in the
        dark and lifted the aluminum prism from the spectroscope. He
        turned the wheel again, reading off the same numbers as before.
        I put the prims back before the lights were turned up, and
        Blondlot told his assistant that his eyes were tired. The
        assistant had evidently become suspicious, and asked Blondlot to
        let him repeat the reading for me. Before he turned down the
        light I had noticed that he placed the prism very exactly on its
        little round support, with two of its corners exactly on the rim
        of the metal disk. As soon as the light was lowered, I moved
        over towards the prism, with audible footsteps, but I did not
        touch the prism. The assistant commenced to turn the wheel, and
        suddenly said hurriedly to Blondlot in French, I see nothing;
        there is no spectrum. I think the American has made some
        derangement.' Whereupon he immediately turned up the gas and
        went over and examined the prism carefully. He glared at me, but
        I gave no indication of my reactions. This ended the seance. </p>
      <p>Next morning I sent off a letter to Nature giving a full
        account of my findings, not, however, mentioning the
        double-crossing incident at the end of the evening, and merely
        locating the laboratory as `one in which most of the N-ray
        experiments had been carried out'. La Revue scientifique,
        France's weekly semipopular scientific journal started an
        inquiry, asking French scientists to express their opinions as
        to the reality of the N rays. About forty letters were
        published, only a half dozen backing Blondlot. The most scathing
        one by Le Bel said, `What a spectacle for French science when
        one of its distinguished savants measures the position of the
        spectrum lines, while the prism reposes in the pocket of his
        American colleague!' </p>
      <p>The Academy at its annual meeting in December, when the prize
        and medal were presented, announced the award as given to
        Blondlot for his life's work, taken as a whole.' </p>

      <p><i>Expectation Bias and Seeing Things</i> </p>
      <p>Here is a short account of a famous instance of expectations
        bias, or just plain jumping to conclusions. In 1903, during a
        time of major discoveries of many new forms of radiation,
        Professor Rene Blondlot of the University of Nancy reported the
        discovery of a remarkable new radiation he labeled N-rays10. He
        claimed these rays were emitted by all things except green wood
        and some treated metals, and had similar penetrating properties
        akin to X-rays. A number of other French scientists had
        corroborated his findings by duplicating his experiments. In one
        experimental arrangement, the N-rays were said to refract
        through a metal prism, and that a spectrum of dark and light
        N-ray bands could be cast. Instead of an eyepiece the
        spectrometer had a vertical thread treated with luminous paint.
        N-ray bands were detected by Blondlot, determining by eye the
        faint glow of the string as an assistant called out angles and
        rotated the prism through a set of intervals. </p>
      <p>The journal Nature sent American physicist James Wood to
        investigate the amazing claims of the N-ray experiments. Wood
        was invited into Blondlot’s lab for a demonstration, and while
        waiting in the dark for Blondlot’s eyes to adjust, Wood quietly
        removed the metal prism from the apparatus. Although the prism
        was in Wood’s pocket, thus completely disabling the apparatus,
        Professor Blondlot nevertheless called out the presence and
        absence of N-rays exactly where he had reported and expected
        them to be (Ref. 11). </p>
      <p>The detection mechanism of Blondlot’s experiment had an
        unfortunately large subjective aspect, that of visually
        distinguishing a very feeble illumination, literally on the
        threshold of detection. Could Blondlot’s strong expectation to
        see the string glow really manifest in his perception, so that
        he really saw a glow when none were present? Many have come to
        this conclusion. </p>
      <p>In the case of Blondlot, perhaps the expectation came from his
        considerable investment in his own hypothesis, or was reinforced
        by his lab assistants not wanting to contradict their esteemed
        professor. Whatever the case, the lesson for the students is
        that his experimental procedure screamed out for the application
        of a blinded test. If Blondlot had asked his assistant to do in
        a controlled fashion what Wood had imposed on him, N-rays may
        never have seen the printed page. </p>
      <p>There are other instructive and entertaining incidents in the
        annals of physics, one of which I highly recommend is the story
        of Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons' announcement of cold
        fusion in 1989.&nbsp; The account as told in Robert Park's book
        Voodoo Science13 gets to the very heart of the problem: signal
        on the threshold of detection above noise, subversion of peer
        review, lack of use of control samples (what is the result if
        you do not use heavy water in your vessel?), and of course a
        wide berth for expectation bias. </p>
      <p>The human pitfall of expectation bias is sometimes referred to
        as wishful thinking, and plays a role in the acceptance of many
        questionable beliefs including N-rays, cold fusion, ancient
        astronauts, claims of perpetual motion ("over unity") devices,
        and many alternative healing claims, to name a few. </p>

      <p>Sir Isaac Newton failed to report absorption lines in the
        prismatic solar spectrum, though they would have been clearly
        visible with the apparatus he was using. The most likely
        explanation for his failure to see them is that he held
        theoretically based expectations that such phenomena should not
        exist. Because he believed they did not exist, he failed to see
        them, or at least to note their presence. </p>
      <p>While Newton failed to see something that did exist, scientists
        of the early twentieth century saw something that did not exist.
        First reported by Rene Blondlot in 1903, "N-rays" appeared to
        make reflected light more intense. So long as they were believed
        to exist, the effects of N-rays were "observed" by many
        scientists. Of course, once it was determined that N-rays did
        not exist, their effects ceased to be observed. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b>http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~corse/2100/Chapter2.html</b> </p>
      <p>Let us take another example, this time from the history of
        science. At the turn of the century, Blondlot, a physicist from
        Nancy, in France, made a major discovery like that of X-rays.3
        Out of devotion to his city he called them N-rays'. For a few
        years, N-rays had all sorts of theoretical developments and many
        practical applications, curing diseases and putting Nancy on the
        map of international science. A dissenter from the United
        States, Robert W. Wood, did not believe Blondlot's papers even
        though they were published in reputable journals~ and decided to
        visit the laboratory. For a time Wood was confronted with
        incontrovertible evidence in the laboratory at Nancy. Blondlot
        stepped aside and let the N-rays inscribe themselves straight
        onto a screen in front of Wood. This, however, was not enough to
        get rid of Wood, who obstinately stayed in the lab asking for
        more experiments and himself manipulating the N-ray detector. At
        one point he even surreptitiously removed the aluminium prism
        which was generating the N-rays. To his surprise, Blondlot on
        the other side of the dimly lit room kept obtaining the same
        result on his screen even though what was deemed the most
        crucial element had been removed. The direct signatures made by
        the N-rays on the screen were thus made by something else. The
        unanimous support became a cacophony of dissent. By removing the
        prism, Wood severed the solid links that attached Blondlot to
        the N-rays. Wood's interpretation was that Blondlot so much
        wished to discover rays(at a time when almost every lab in
        Europe was christening new rays) that he unwittingly made up not
        only the N-rays, but also the instrument to inscribe them. Like
        the manager above, Wood realised that the coherent whole he was
        presented with was an aggregate of many elements that could be
        induced to go in many different directions. After Wood's action
        (and that of other dissenters) no one 'saw' N-rays any more but
        only smudges on photographic plates when Blondlot presented his
        N-rays. Instead of enquiring about the place of N-rays in
        physics, people started enquiring about the role of
        auto-suggestion in experimentation! The new fact had been turned
        into an artefact.... </p>
      <p>Wood, who did not believe in N-rays, also tried to shake the
        connection between Blondlot and his rays. Unlike the former
        dissenter he succeeded. To dislocate the black boxes assembled
        by Blondlot, Wood did not have to confront the whole of physics,
        only the whole of one laboratory.... </p>
      <p>It is crucial to grasp that these two adjectives ('objective',
        'subjective') are relative to trials of strength in specific
        settings. They cannot be used to qualify a spokesperson or the
        things he or she is talking about once and for all. As we saw in
        Chapter 1, each dissenter tries to transform a statement from
        objective to subjective status, to transform, for instance, an
        interest in N-rays inside physics into an interest in
        self-suggestion in provincial laboratories. </p>

      <p>Elsewhere in Europe Wilhelm Rontgen discovered X-rays in 1895,
        and a year later Antoine Becquerel identified radioactivity. By
        1900 alpha, beta and gamma rays had been found. More were
        expected. In 1903 a distinguished physicist called Rene
        Blondlot, who was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and
        a senior figure at Nancy University, announced his discovery of
        another ray. In honour of his city he called it the N-ray. </p>
      <p>Blondlot had found the new form of radiation while looking at
        the behaviour of polarised X-rays. He had seen that the new
        rays, which penetrated aluminium, increased the brightness of an
        electric spark. The rays were also refracted by a prism and it
        was known that X-rays could not be refracted in this way. Since
        the scientific community expected new rays to be found,
        Blondlot's work immediately attracted dozens of young graduates
        keen to make their name in this new field. </p>
      <p>Within three years three hundred papers had been written on the
        subject, and doctoral theses were being prepared. Not only did
        the rays traverse material opaque to light, but,
        extraordinarily, they were given off by the muscles of the human
        body. Moreover, N-rays heightened perception and they were
        produced by the human nervous system particularly during
        intellectual exertion. Was there a relationship between the
        mysterious N-rays and the psyche? In 1904 Blondlot was awarded
        the prestigious Prix Lecomte by the Academy of Sciences. </p>
      <p>The crucial stage in the experiment proving the existence of
        N-rays was the brightening of the spark, which Blondlot always
        insisted had to be feeble. The trouble was that nobody outside
        the city of Nancy could see differences in the brightness. In
        September 1904 an American Professor of Physics, R. W. Wood,
        arrived in Nancy and Blondlot demonstrated the effect for him.
        Wood, too, was unable to see changes in the spark. He had
        previously noted that with the equipment currently available the
        minimum natural variation to which any spark's brightness could
        be controlled was as much as 25 per cent. Spark brightness was
        obviously a dubious criterion of measurement. It was when
        Blondlot used a prism to refract and split the N-rays so as to
        show the spread of their wavelength that Wood decided to act.
        While his French hosts were busy in the dark, Wood removed the
        prism. The demonstrators continued to see the N-rays. Wood
        published his story the same month. No more N-rays were
        observed. The discipline collapsed as quickly as it had
        appeared. </p>
      <p>There was never any suggestion that Blondlot was a charlatan.
        He and his colleagues were victims of the expectation that
        N-rays would be discovered and when they built instruments to
        see the rays, they saw them. For a short time this non-existent
        phenomenon resisted the most stringent tests and methods known
        to science. </p>

      <p><b>N-Rays.</b>&nbsp; One of the best-known examples of esteemed
        scientists acting like pseudoscientists is found in the career
        of the French physicist, René Blondlot, around the turn of the
        20th century.&nbsp; On the heels of the discovery of X-rays by
        the German, Roentgen, French scientists felt pressured to catch
        up by scoring a breakthrough of their own.&nbsp; Blondlot, who
        already had several important discoveries to his name, believed
        he had observed yet another form of radiation which he named
        "N-rays" in honour of his institution, the University of
        Nancy.&nbsp; Blondlot's "observations" were eventually shown by
        the American physicist, Robert Wood to have been the joint
        result of wishful thinking and some subtle distortions that
        normally occur in visual perception.&nbsp; These visual
        aberrations tend to be ignored under ordinary viewing conditions
        but they stood out against the backgrounds of Blondlot's viewing
        apparatus.&nbsp; The discoverers of N-Rays had allowed their
        hopes and expectations to colour their observations.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately, they had failed to include a simple experimental
        control that would have saved them much embarrassment.&nbsp;
        Wood made his point by surreptitiously inserting this control
        condition into a demonstration provided for him during a visit
        to Blondlot?s laboratory.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that
        there had been a number of independent "replications" of N-rays
        by respected laboratories; the fact that some others had failed
        to find the new radiation had piqued Wood?s interest.&nbsp; His
        exposé highlights the need for mechanized recording of data,
        wherever possible, to minimize the all too human tendency to
        ?see? what we are predisposed to see.&nbsp; It is this tendency
        to find what we expect that makes tight experimental controls,
        independent replication, and careful statistical analyses an
        absolute necessity in all research.&nbsp; If honest,
        well-trained scientists occasionally fall prey to such foibles,
        it is not hard to understand why pseudoscientists are such
        frequent victims. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;There is a very interesting article published in the
        October 1989 issue of <i>Physics Today </i>[86]&nbsp; The
        article is titled "PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE" and the abstract reads:
        "Certain symptoms seen in studies of 'N rays' and other elusive
        phenomena characterize 'the science of things that aren't so. '
        " </p>
      <p>The introduction to the article starts: </p>
      <p>"Irving Langmuir spent many productive years pursuing
        Nobel-caliber research (see the photo on the opposite page).
        Over the years, he also explored the subject of what he called
        "pathological science."&nbsp; Although he never published his
        investigations in this area, on 18 December 1953 at General
        Electric's Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, he gave a colloquium
        on the subject that will long be remembered by those in his
        audience. This talk was a colorful account of a particular kind
        of pitfall into which scientists may stumble. </p>
      <p>Langmuir begins his presentation with: </p>
      <p>The thing started in this way.&nbsp; On 23 April 1929,
        Professor Bergen Davis from Columbia University came up and gave
        a colloquium in this Laboratory, in the old building, and it was
        very interesting.... </p>
      <p>Langmuir then gives the details of the Davis and Barnes
        controversial experiment that produced a beam of alpha rays from
        polonium in a vacuum tube with a hot cathode electron emitter
        and a microscope for counting alpha induced scintillations on a
        zinc sulfide screen.&nbsp; Then Langmuir described the results
        of a visit he and a colleague, C. W. Hewlett, made to Davis's
        laboratory at Columbia University.&nbsp; With regard to the
        experiment Langmuir states: </p>
      <p>And then I played a dirty trick. I wrote out on a card of paper
        ten different sequences of V and 0. I meant to put on a certain
        voltage and then take it off again.&nbsp; Later I realized that
        [trick wouldn't quite work] because when Hull took off the
        voltage, he sat back in his chair??there was nothing to regulate
        at zero so he didn't. Well, of course, Barnes saw him whenever
        he sat back in his chair. Although the light wasn't very bright,
        he could see whether [Hull] was sitting back in his chair or
        not, so he knew the voltage wasn't on, and the result was that
        he got a corresponding result. So later I whispered, "Don't let
        him know that you're not reading," and I asked him to change the
        voltage from 325 down to 320 so he'd have something to regulate.
        I said, "Regulate it just as carefully as if you were sitting on
        a peak."&nbsp; So he played the part from that time on, and from
        that time on Barnes's readings had nothing whatever to do with
        the voltages that were applied. Whether the voltage was at one
        value or another didn't make the slightest difference. After
        that he took 12 readings, of which about half were right and the
        other half were wrong, which was about what you would expect out
        of two sets of values. I said: "You're through.&nbsp; You're not
        measuring anything at all.&nbsp; You never have measured
        anything at all." </p>
      <p>"Well," he said, "the tube was gassy. The temperature has
        changed and therefore the nickel plates must have deformed
        themselves so that the electrodes are no longer lined up
        properly." </p>
      <p>"Well," I said, "isn't this the tube in which Davis said he got
        the same results when the filament was turned off completely?" </p>
      <p>"Oh, yes," he said, "but we always made blanks to check
        ourselves, with and without the voltage on." </p>
      <p>He immediately -- without giving any thought to it -- he
        immediately had an excuse.&nbsp; He had a reason for not paying
        any attention to any wrong results.&nbsp; It just was built into
        him. He just had worked that way all along and always would.
        There is no question but [that] he is honest: He believed these
        things, absolutely.... </p>
      <p>At the end of that section, Langmuir states: </p>
      <p>To me, [it's] extremely interesting that men, perfectly honest,
        enthusiastic over their work, can so completely fool
        themselves.&nbsp; Now what was it about that work that made it
        so easy for them to do that?&nbsp; Well, I began thinking of
        other things. I had seen R. W. Wood and told him about this
        phenomenon because he's a good experimenter and doesn't make
        such mistakes himself very often -- if at all. [Wood was a
        physicist from Johns Hopkins University.] And he told me about
        the N rays that he had an experience with back in 1904.&nbsp; So
        I looked up the data on N rays.[87] </p>
      <p>Then Langmuir gave a detailed account of N rays, and how they
        were discovered in 1903 by a respected French physicist, Rene
        Prosper Blondlot, at the University of Nancy. The N-rays were
        supposed to be generated by a hot wire inside an iron tube that
        has an 1/8 inch aluminum window in it, and the rays are detected
        by a calcium sulfide screen which gave out a very faint glow in
        a dark room.&nbsp; One of the experiments involved a large prism
        of aluminum with a 60 degree angle.&nbsp; Wood visited
        Blondlot's lab and Langmuir recounts the following trick Wood
        played on Blondlot: </p>
      <p>Well, Wood asked him to repeat some of these measurements,
        which he was only too glad to do. But in the meantime, the room,
        being very dark, R. W. Wood put the prism in his pocket and the
        results checked perfectly with what [Blondlot] had before. Well,
        Wood rather cruelly published that.[88]&nbsp; And that was the
        end of Blondlot... </p>

      <p>The story of the "discovery" of N-rays in France in 1903
        reveals how physics, the "hardest" of the sciences, could be led
        astray by subjective evaluation. This "new" form of X-rays
        supposedly could be detected by the human eye in a nearly
        darkened room. The best physical scientists in France accepted
        this breakthrough. Within a year of its original "discovery" by
        Professor R. Blondlot, the French Academy of Science had
        published nearly 100 papers on the subject. </p>
      <p>However, in 1904 the American physicist Robert Wood visited
        Blondlot's laboratory and discovered, by secretly changing a
        series of experimental conditions, that Blondlot continued to
        see the N-rays under circumstances that Blondlot claimed would
        prevent their occurrence. When Wood published his findings, it
        became clear that the French scientists had believed so strongly
        in N-rays that they had virtually hallucinated their existence.
        Good research can disconfirm theories, subjective judgment
        rarely does. </p>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Henry H. Bauer</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>N-rays have been referred to innumerable times, but the best
        scholarly discussions are by Derek de Solla Price (1975) and
        Mary Joe Nye (1980). </p>
      <p>René Blondlot, in France, at the University of Nancy (hence
        N-rays), announced his discovery of N-rays in 1903: a new form
        of radiation, emitted by both living and inanimate bodies, able
        to penetrate aluminum but not lead, able to be refracted by
        aluminum prisms as light is refracted by glass. For several
        years, N-rays were studied by scores of scientists in France and
        hundreds of papers were published. Yet scientists in other
        countries were not able to reproduce the radiation. An American
        physicist, Robert Wood, observed the experiments in Blondlot’s
        lab: in darkness, visual observation was used to detect on
        measuring scales the spots of light that N-rays produced.
        Surreptitiously in the darkened room, Wood removed the aluminum
        prism. The measurements continued to be read out as before.
        Evidently optical illusion was causing spots of light to be
        imagined at expected values along the scales. This demonstration
        convinced almost all the scientific community that N-rays do not
        exist; but Blondlot and a few others persisted in their belief
        that N-rays were real. </p>
      <p>So presumably what was pathological here was a reliance on
        visual observation under conditions -- a darkened room -- where
        optical illusions readily occur. (One modern test for glaucoma
        is to note over what field of view one can detect flashes of
        light on a dark background. Anyone who has taken such a test
        knows that one ‘sees’ some number of flashes that are not
        actually there.) But Blondlot was a distinguished member of the
        French scientific establishment. He had been particularly
        praised for showing that X-rays moved at the speed of light
        which he had established by the same method of visual
        observation, in that case variations in the apparent intensity
        of electric sparks. Blondlot was therefore very unfortunate; but
        how can he be blamed for continuing to use a technique that had
        been so successful? "The curious error of N-rays is much more a
        sort of mass hallucination, proceeding from an entirely
        reasonable beginning" (Price 1975, p. 159). </p>
      <p>Moreover, the facts Blondlot reported were confirmed by a
        number of his fellow scientists, not only in his laboratory but
        also elsewhere in France; which gave Blondlot good reason to
        think his discovery a genuine one. And early in the 20th
        century, Blondlot was far from alone in looking for new types of
        radiation. X-rays and radioactivity had been discovered just a
        decade earlier, and some years before that Hertz had discovered
        radio waves. </p>
      <p>If pathological science is to be regarded as scientific
        misconduct, then there would need to be some indication that
        there had been willful deception, or at least quite egregious
        incompetence. The record does not support indictment of Blondlot
        on either of those scores. In point of fact, if anyone behaved
        unethically during this episode, it would seem to be Robert
        Wood, who deliberately and surreptitiously interfered with the
        experiments in order to deceive the experimenters; yet I know of
        no discussion of the case that does anything but praise Wood for
        his demonstration that N-rays are not real phenomena. </p>

      <p>There's the famous episode of the N-rays in France at the turn
        of the century. It is the great classic in bad science -- really
        intriguing. It's sort of horribly fascinating to watch a René
        Blondlot, who had been a reasonably good scientist in his time,
        claim he had discovered these N-rays. The evidence mounted that
        there was no such thing as an N-ray -- he was, in fact,
        observing nothing. But year after year he developed more
        elaborate and comically sad reasons why N-rays were nevertheless
        there but only he, and nobody else, could see them. </p>

      <p>The so-called N rays (or N-rays) were a phenomenon described by
        French scientist René-Prosper Blondlot, subsequently shown to be
        illusory. </p>
      <p>In 1903, Blondlot, a distinguished physicist working at the
        University of Nancy, perceived changes in the brightness of an
        electric spark in a spark gap which he attributed to a novel
        form of radiation, naming it the N-ray, for the University of
        Nancy. Blondlot, Augustin Charpontier, Arsène d'Arsonval and
        many others claimed to be able to detect rays emanating from
        most substances, including the human body. Physicists Gustave le
        Bon and P. Audollet and spiritualist Carl Hunter even claimed
        the discovery as their own, leading to a commission of the
        Académie des sciences to decide priority. </p>
      <p>The "discovery" excited international interest and many
        physicists worked to replicate the effects. However, notable
        physicists Lord Kelvin, William Crookes, Otto Lummer and
        Heinrich Rubens all failed to do so. Following his own failure,
        US physicist Robert W. Wood was prevailed upon to travel to
        France to investigate further. His thorough investigations,
        published in the September 29 1904 edition of Nature, showed
        that these were a purely subjective phenomenon, with the
        scientists involved having recorded data that matched their
        expectations. The incident is used as a cautionary tale among
        scientists on the dangers of error introduced by experimenter
        bias. </p>

      <p>René-Prosper Blondlot (July 3, 1849 - November 24, 1930) was a
        French physicist, best remembered for his mistaken
        identification of N rays, a phenomenon that subseqeuntly proved
        to be illusory. Born in Nancy, France, he spent most of his
        early years there, teaching physics at the University, being
        awarded three prestigious prizes of the Académie des Sciences
        for his experimental work on the consequences of Maxwell's
        theory of electromagnetism. In order to demonstrate, in
        collaboration with Ernest Bichat, that a Kerr cell responds to
        an applied electric field in a few 10s of microseconds, he
        adapted the rotating-mirror method that Léon Foucault had
        applied to measure the speed of light. He further developed the
        rotating mirror to measure the speed of electricity in a
        conductor, photographing the sparks emitted from two conductors,
        one 1.8 km longer than the other and measuring the relative
        displacement of their images. He thus estabished that the speed
        of electricity in a conductor is very close to that of light. In
        1903, Blondlot announced that he had discovered N rays, a new
        species of radiation. The "discovery" attracted much attention
        over the following year until Robert W. Wood showed that the
        phenomena were purely subjective with no physical origin.
        Blondlot lived the rest of his life in comparative obscurity in
        Nancy where he died. </p>

        Toolbox in Eugene in August of 1998. </p>
      <p><b>Rene Blondlot’s N-Rays</b> </p>
      <p>One of science’s most famous hoaxes revealed that a newly
        discovered form of electromagnetic radiation was in fact a
        figment of its discoverer and his followers imaginations. </p>
      <p>In 1903 physicist Rene Blondlot, a member of French Academy of
        Sciences and an expert in electromagnetic radiation, published
        his discovery of N-rays in the scientific journal Comptes
        rendus. By the following year, more than 50 papers appeared
        describing the curious properties and sources of N-rays. </p>
      <p>N-rays had quite remarkable properties. They passed through
        materials opaque to visible light, such as metal, wood and
        paper, yet were blocked by water, which transmits light.
        Blondlot used an aluminum prism to bend the N-rays and
        water-soaked cardboard to block them. N-rays were found to
        emanate from the sun and the typical gas burner, but not from
        Bunsen burners. Augustin Charpentier, a medical physicist, found
        that the human body emitted N-rays, especially the nerve and
        muscle cells. He suggested they could be used in medicine to
        detect the outlines of organs. </p>
      <p>Other researchers challenged Blondlot’s right to be noted as
        the discoverer of this new ray. Gustave le Bon, also a
        physicist, wrote Blondlot to say he had discovered a similar
        radiation seven years earlier. P. Audollet claimed that he, not
        Charpentier, had been the first to find N-rays were emitted from
        the body; and a spiritualist, Carl Huter, challenged both
        Audollet and Charpentier for this credit. </p>
      <p>Several laboratories outside of France, however, reported
        difficulty detecting this new radiation. One physicist having
        trouble was Robert Wood, a well-respected researcher in the
        field of optics and electromagnetic radiation from Johns Hopkins
        University. The British journal Nature sent Wood to France to
        observe Blondlot’s methods. Wood was an interesting choice
        because not only was he a noted physicist, he was also
        well-known as a showman and prankster with a wide range of
        interests. He had investigated spiritualists for fraud and
        pursued an interest in using scientific methodologies for
        solving crimes. </p>
      <p>In the first experiment Wood observed, N-rays concentrated by
        an aluminum lens were said to brighten an electric spark if a
        hand was passed between the spark and the N-ray source. Wood
        said could not see any increase in brightness, but Blondlot
        attributed this to Wood’s lack of visual sensitivity. Wood
        noted, however, that Blondlot couldn’t correctly identify when
        Wood’s hand was or was not present. </p>
      <p>In Blondlot’s second demonstration, a photographic plate,
        rather than the eye, was used to detect the increased
        brightness. Unfortunately, Wood noted, the conditions under
        which the plate was exposed were subject to "many sources of
        error." The most serious being that the plate was moved back and
        forth by hand for five-second exposures under first one
        condition and then the other. Wood pointed out that unconscious
        bias by the experimenter, who knew the conditions, could account
        for the increased exposure clearly visible on the plate
        subjected to the intensified N-rays. He suggested a series of
        blinded experiments which would eliminate this source of error.
        Blondlot dismissed such precautions as unnecessary. </p>
      <p>In the third and most famous experiment, Wood was shown how an
        aluminum prism bent and spread the N-rays into a spectrum.
        Again, this was detected visually, this time by an increase in
        brilliancy at certain points along a strip of phosphorescent
        paint. Wood made a conclusive judgement about the reliability of
        Blondlot’s observations by surreptitiously removing the prism.
        Blondlot, not realizing the prism had been removed, continued to
        report seeing the expected changes. </p>
      <p>Wood writes, "I was unable to see any change whatever in the
        brilliancy of the phosphorescent line...and I subsequently found
        that the removal of the prism (we were in a dark room) did not
        seem to interfere in any way with the location of the maxima and
        minima in the deviated (!) ray bundle". </p>
      <p>After a couple lesser tests yielding similar results, Wood left
        the lab convinced that N-rays were "purely imaginary". Wood’s
        report was published in Nature on September 29, 1904. Wood
        carefully avoided naming Blondlot in his report, although it was
        widely known by researchers in the field whose lab Wood had
        visited. </p>
      <p>Following its publication Blondlot was encouraged to conduct a
        definitive test to settle the N-ray issue once and for all.
        Blondlot did not respond to these requests until 1906 when he
        wrote,"Permit me to decline totally your proposition to
        cooperate in this simplistic experiment; the phenomena are much
        too delicate for that. Let each one form his personal opinion
        about N-rays, either from his own experiments or from those of
        others in whom he has confidence". Blondlot continued his work
        on N-rays until his retirement in 1909. </p>
      <p>When Blondlot published his discovery of N-rays, the X-ray,
        alpha and beta "rays", and gamma rays had all recently been
        discovered. Scientists were primed to expect more discoveries
        and, initially, most embraced N-rays with excitement. Skepticism
        set in only when other labs were unable to repeat Blondlot’s
        observations. Although many French scientists helped debunk
        N-rays, a small group clung to their belief in the authenticity
        of N-rays long after the evidence warranted. Personal attachment
        and French nationalism seemed to motivate this belief. Some
        French defenders were known to claim that only Latins had the
        intellectual and visual "sensitivities" to detect N-rays. </p>

      <p>"I want to close this presentation with some parallel examples
        of scientific claims that turned out to be so much nonsense.
        Let's go back to 1903 in France. You may have heard of this, if
        not it really is something you should look up. A prominent
        scientist - a physicist named Rene Blondlot - startled the world
        of science with his announcement of the discovery of N-rays. A
        very well respected man who had won many prizes in science and
        justifiably so, he was doing experiments by today's standards
        that were very simple - such as finding the speed of electricity
        in a conductor. It sounds easy today, but in those days it was a
        very sophisticated experiment and not all that easily done.
        Blondlot was in his 70s at the time when he discovered N-rays,
        named after the town of Nancy, where he was head of the
        Department of Physics at the University of Nancy." </p>
      <p>"What were N-rays? N-rays were allegedly radiation exhibiting
        impossible properties emitted by all substances with the
        exception of green wood (wood not dried out) and anesthetized
        metal. (Metal that had been dipped in ether or cholorophorm did
        not give out N-rays!) Within a matter of six to eight months of
        the announced discovery of N-rays, 30 papers had come in from
        all over Europe confirming the existence of N- rays. Reports
        were published in journals despite the fact that there were many
        laboratories reporting failure after failure in replicating the
        results. Such acceptance was understandable considering that
        X-rays, which also exhibited unsuspected properties, were by
        then firmly established." </p>
      <p>"What Blondlot had was a basic spectroscope with a prism (not
        glass, but aluminum) on the inside, and a thread. The narrow
        stream of N-rays was refracted through the prism and coming out
        produced a spectrum on a field. The N-rays were reported to be
        invisible, except when viewed when they hit a treated thread
        (for example, treated with calcium sulfide). They moved the
        thread across the gap where the N-rays came through and when it
        was illuminated that was reported as the detection of the N-
        rays." </p>
      <p>"Before long N-rays were established as factual. Nature
        magazine was skeptical of the N-rays since laboratories in
        England and Germany were unable to find them. (Germany had just
        discovered X-rays the decade before and the French were annoyed
        that they didn't have a ray.) Nature sent an American physicist
        named Robert W. Wood from Johns Hopkins University to
        investigate. Now, I've been accused of skulduggery in my time,
        but what Wood did was brilliant. When no one was looking he
        removed the prism from the N-ray detection device and put it in
        his pocket. Without the prism the machine could not possibly
        work because it was dependent on the refraction of N-rays by the
        aluminium-treated prism. Yet, when the assistant conducted the
        next experiment he found N- rays! He swore they were there." </p>
      <p>"When the experiment was over Wood knew it was really over. He
        was prepared to make his report, and when he went to replace the
        prism back in the machine, one of the other assistants saw him
        do this and thought he was actually removing it, and he decided
        to show Wood up. Thinking Wood had removed the prism (when he
        had actually put it back), he set up the experiment, could find
        no lines, and opened the box to show that the prism was not
        there and to his dismay, there it was! The whole incident blew
        up. Papers were withdrawn, those that were in the mail were
        retracted, and N-rays disappeared from the scene." </p>
      <p>"How did this happen? How did over 30 papers get published? Not
        because the scientists who wrote the papers were stupid. Not
        because they were lying. But because they were deceiving
        themselves. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Dr. Blondlot was a French physicist who, in 1903, was convinced
        he had discovered a new type of ray, similar to X-rays. He named
        them N-rays after his home town of Nancy, where he worked in the
        university of the same name. He claimed that these rays were
        emitted by every material, except green wood, and believed he
        could generate large amounts of N rays by heating a wire and
        refracting the combination of rays through an aluminum prism,
        enclosed in the apparatus. The rays could be detected by
        swinging a metal filament up and down across the invisible
        spectrum until it glowed slightly. This glow could not be
        detected by instruments, but required a human's experience to
        confirm a positive result. Other scientists failed to repeat the
        experiment. </p>
      <p><i>Debunking</i> </p>
      <p>Well, things went from bad to worse as Blondlot hypothesized
        that Germanic and American physiology was not as sensitive as
        latins like himself and his Italian assistant, who found no
        trouble detecting the rays, and Nature magazine dispatched Dr.
        Robert Wood from Johns Hopkins University to observe Blondlot's
        technique. During a pre-demonstration examination of the
        instrument, Wood secretly removed the prism. Blondlot and his
        assistants proceeded to spend several hours repeatedly finding
        N-rays. </p>
      <p>Satisfied that the rays were a delusion, Wood was caught
        replacing the prism, although he managed to place it inside the
        instrument. Wood picked up a second prism from its storage below
        the instrument and pretended to have removed the original.
        Blondlot, thinking the prism was now removed, demonstrated how
        its absence generated negative results by failing to find the
        rays for several tries. The original prism, of course, was back
        inside the instrument. Several of the visiting scientists had
        been informed of the prism's removal earlier and now knew of its
        replacement. The results had obviously been entirely in
        Blondlot's imagination, and he was very embarassed when all was
        revealed. </p>
      <p><i>Lesson learned?</i> </p>
      <p>Generally, scientists prefer to have several things in place
        for an experiment to have high confidence: falsifiability,
        repeatability, independant verification, control groups, and
        double-blindedness. Other factors are important, but failure of
        these four are problematic. The N-rays ran into trouble almost
        immediately when only French laboratories could repeat the
        experiment, complicating independant verification. The
        experiment was falsifiable and repeatable, but it was certainly
        not double-blinded: the observer simply had to wave the filament
        around until he believed he felt a heat increase or saw a glow,
        but he knew in advance the ray was there somewhere, it was
        simply a matter of reinterpreting natural variations in
        perception of light and heat as evidence for their effects on
        the filament. </p>
      <p>What I want to impress on readers is that neither intelligence
        nor education is protection from deception or self-deception: we
        can only avoid these types of problems in our lives by being
        aware of our own mental limitations, since not everybody is like
        Dr. Blondlot and accidentally making false claims: some people
        do it on purpose to our disadvantage. Awareness of this is the
        purpose of skepticism. </p>

      <p>The Blondlot Case and N-rays - famous case in which scientist
        Rene Blondlot announced the discovery of N-rays, which could be
        detected by the human eye and were emitted by metals. They
        apparently increased the brightness. Blondlot claimed that this
        type of radiation was blocked by lead. Scientists could not
        reproduce his results because the experiments were entirely
        subjective. Another scientist named Wood challenged Blondlot
        while participating in a test of N-rays. He told Blondlot that a
        lead sheet was in place when it was not, and Blondlot claimed to
        see the rays. Wood then placed the lead sheet in front of the
        source of N-rays and Blondlot claimed to see the N-rays.
        Blondlot's observations depended entirely on his beliefs, and
        were not correlated to when the sheet was actually in place. </p>

      <p>René Prosper Blondlot (1849-1930) was a French physicist who
        claimed to have discovered a new type of radiation, shortly
        after Roentgen had discovered X-rays. He called it the N-ray,
        after Nancy, the name of the town and the university where he
        lived and worked. Blondlot was trying to polarize X-rays when he
        claimed&nbsp; to have discovered his new form of&nbsp;
        radiation. Dozens of other scientists confirmed the existence of
        N-rays in their own laboratories. However, N-rays don't exist.
        How could so many scientists be wrong? They deceived themselves
        into thinking they were seeing something when in fact they were
        not. They&nbsp; saw what they wanted to see with their
        instruments, not what was actually there (or, in this case, what
        was not there). </p>
      <p>The story of&nbsp; Blondlot is a story of self-deception among
        scientists. Because many people have the misguided notion that
        science should be infallible and a fount of absolutely certain
        truths, they look at the Blondlot episode&nbsp; as a vindication
        of their excessive skepticism towards science. They relish
        accounts such as the one regarding Blondlot and the phantom
        N-rays because it is a story of a famous scientist making a
        great error. However, if one properly understands science and
        scientists, the Blondlot episode indicates little more than the
        fallibility of scientists and the self-correcting nature of
        science. </p>
      <p>Blondlot claimed that N-rays exhibit impossible properties and
        yet are emitted by all substances except green wood and certain
        treated metals. In 1903, Blondlot claimed he had generated
        N-rays using a hot wire inside an iron tube. The rays were
        detected by a calcium sulfide thread that glowed slightly in the
        dark when the rays were refracted through a 60-degree angle
        prism of aluminum. According to Blondlot, a narrow stream of
        N-rays was refracted through the prism and produced a spectrum
        on a field. The N-rays were reported to be invisible, except
        when viewed as they hit the treated thread. Blondlot moved the
        thread across the gap where the N-rays were thought to come
        through and when the thread was illuminated it was said to be
        due to N-rays. </p>
      <p>Nature magazine was skeptical of Blondlot's claims because
        laboratories in England and Germany had not been able to
        replicate the Frenchman's results. Nature sent American
        physicist Robert W. Wood of Johns Hopkins University to
        investigate Blondlot's discovery. Wood suspected that N-rays
        were a delusion. To demonstrate such, he removed the prism from
        the N-ray detection device, unbeknownst to Blondlot or his
        assistant. Without the prism, the machine couldn't work. Yet,
        when Blondlot's assistant conducted the next experiment he found
        N-rays. Wood then tried to surreptitiously replace the prism but
        the assistant saw him and thought he was removing the prism. The
        next time he tried the experiment, the assistant swore he could
        not see any N-rays. But he should have, since the equipment was
        in full working order. </p>
      <p>According to Martin Gardner, Wood's exposure of Blondlot led to
        the French scientist's madness and death (Gardner, 345 n.1). But
        were those who verified Blondlot's N-ray experiments stupid or
        incompetent? Not necessarily, since the issue isn't one of
        intelligence or competence, but of the psychology of perception.
        Blondlot and his followers suffered "from self-induced visual
        hallucinations" (ibid.). </p>
      <p>What is the lesson from the Blondlot episode? James Randi
        writes: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;...science does not always learn from these mistakes.
        Visiting Nancy recently and speaking on the subject of
        pseudoscience, I discussed this example and though I was in the
        city that gave the name to N-rays, no one in the audience had
        ever heard of them, or of Blondlot, not even the professors from
        the University of Nancy!&nbsp; --James Randi at Cal Tech </p>

      <p>Rays that never were: a form of radiation discovered in 1903
        that affects light sources and the human mind. </p>
      <p><i>Rene Blondlot's N-Rays</i> </p>
      <p>In 1903, René-Prosper Blondlot was studying the polarization of
        X-rays, a new form of radiation recently "discovered" by a
        German Scientist. He was using a hot platinum filament enclosed
        in an iron tube. A thin aluminum window allowed radiation to
        escape. He found that radiation escaping his apparatus increased
        the luminosity of a nearby gas flame. Further investigation
        showed that the radiation caused a dimly illuminated screen
        painted with calcium sulfide to brighten visibly. He named the
        new radiation "N rays" for Nancy, the name of his town and the
        university he worked at. </p>
      <p>Dozens of other Scientists confirmed the existence of N rays.
        Over 300 papers were published on the subject over the next
        three years. Aluminum lenses and prisms were used to focus N
        rays, which were stopped by thin folds of iron. Most things were
        found to emit N rays: iron, most metals, even human bodies. A
        brick wrapped in black paper and left in the sunshine became an
        intense, long-life emitter of N rays, although two bricks
        produced the same amount of radiation as a single brick.
        Interestingly, only specially treated metals and wood did not
        emit N rays. Wood, in fact, absorbed N rays. </p>
      <p><i>Inexplicable and Astounding Properties</i> </p>
      <p>N rays themselves, like X rays, are not perceivable to the
        unaided eye. Most experiments used a screen painted with calcium
        sulfide to visualize the rays (the CaS would glow ever so
        slightly). Through these experiments, N rays were found to have
        a number of peculiar effects. They enhanced vision especially in
        dimly lit areas. When focused on a flame or spark, the light
        source glowed brighter. Loud noises made them dissipate while
        heat made them more effective. They even had a documented effect
        on the human brain! </p>
      <p>The most tantalizing property of their complex structure was
        that they retained a level of exactness through wide openings
        not seen with normal radiation, such as visible light or X rays.
        For instance, a 1/8 inch hole in a pin-hole camera would cause
        the resulting image to be blurred by about 1/8 of an inch all
        over. However, N rays passing though openings and prisms
        separated into spectra with much greater resolution than would
        be expected. </p>
      <p><i>Prologue</i> </p>
      <p>The beginning of the century marked a crack-down on
        "unauthorized science" by the Technocracy. The American
        Scientist Wood was sent to France to unravel N rays and tear
        them, ripping and screaming, from the scientific paradigm. Some
        say that the choise of executioners shows how warped the humor
        of our once-comrades is. Wood claimed that Blondlot and his
        assistant saw what was not there and that the experiments worked
        even when Wood removed essential equipment. He even claimed
        that, at one point, the assistant could not see the effects of
        the rays when the apparatus was in working condition. He
        blatantly suggested that the assistant was lying and that
        Blondlot was deceived. Wood's debunking (<i>Nature, </i>1904)
        led to Blondlot's madness and death. Papers on N rays were
        published after 1904, but they quickly trickled to nothingness.
        This is one of the many tragedies that lead to the entire
        defection of the Electrodyne Engineer Convention to the
        Traditions. </p>
