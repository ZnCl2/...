      <br>
      <b>George Washington Crile</b> (November 11, 1864, Chili, Ohio ñ
      January 7, 1943, Cleveland, Ohio) was a significant American
      surgeon. Crile is now formally recognized as the first surgeon to
      have succeeded in a direct blood transfusion.[1] He also
      contributed to other procedures, such as neck dissection. Crile
      designed a small haemostatic forceps which bears his name; the
      Crile mosquito clamp. He also described a technique for using
      opioids, regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia which is a
      concept known as balanced anaesthesia. He is known for co-founding
      the Cleveland Clinic in 1921.<br>
      Biography<br>
      <br>
      Crile graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1884,[2] and in
      1887 received his M.D. from Wooster Medical College which merged
      to form modern day Case Western Reserve University School of
      Medicine.[3][4][5] He did further study at Vienna, London and
      Paris. He taught at Wooster from 1889 to 1900. He was professor of
      Clinical Medicine at Western Reserve University from 1900 to 1911,
      and was then made professor of Surgery.[2] He was Chair of Surgery
      at University Hospitals Case Medical Center from 1910 to 1924,[6]
      and established its Lakeside Hospital.[6]<br>
      <br>
      During the Spanish-American War, he was made a member of the
      Medical Reserve Corps and served in Puerto Rico (1898). He was
      made an honorable F.R.C.S. (London) in 1913. After America entered
      World War I, he became major in the medical O.T.C., and
      professional director (1917-8). He served with the B.E.F. in
      France and was senior consultant in surgical research (1918-9). He
      was made lieutenant-colonel in June 1918 and colonel later in the
      year.[2]<br>
      <br>
      He made important contributions to the study of blood pressure and
      of shock in operations. Realizing that any strong emotion, such as
      fear before operation, produced shock, he attempted to allay dread
      by psychic suggestion, also endeavouring to prevent the subjective
      shock which affects the patient, even when under general
      anaesthesia, by first anaesthetizing the operative region with
      cocaine for several days, if necessary, before operating. Thus
      nerve communication between the affected part and the brain was
      already obstructed when the general anaesthetic was administered.
      For his work in shockless surgery he received a gold medal from
      the National Institute of Social Sciences in 1914.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Crile is the author of A Mechanistic View of War and Peace,
      published in 1917.[7] He also wrote Surgical Shock (1897), On the
      Blood Pressure in Surgery (1903), Hemorrhage and Transfusion
      (1909), Surgical Anemia and Resuscitation (1914), The Origin and
      Nature of the Emotions (1915), Man an Adaptive Mechanism (1916)
      and The Fallacy of the German State Philosophy (1918).[2]<br>
      <br>
      In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS George Crile
      was named in his honor. The lunar crater Crile is also named after
      him. He is buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.[8]<br>
      <br>
      His son George Crile, Jr. was also a surgeon. His grandson George
      Crile III was a journalist, author, and CBS producer. His
      Great-Grandson is Rip Esselstyn, a former triathlete and
      firefighter and the author of The Engine 2 Diet.<br>

            Life as Manifestation Of "Radiant-Electric Energy''</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      DR. GEORGE CRILE, a surgeon and scientist of international
      reputation, gives us the chance to find out a lot about ourselves
      we probably had never suspected in his "The Phenomena Of Life,"
      which is the current choice of the Scientific Book Club and a
      volume that will undoubtedly receive serious treatment at the
      hands of the pundits.<br>
      <br>
      It is not a book to be hastily recommended to the general reader,
      because its distinguished author makes no concessions to the
      average understanding. His scientific vocabulary alone calls for
      the free use of an unabridged dictionary, and the words one learns
      about will not be of much use in ordinary conversation, I fear.<br>
      <br>
      For those who have the patience to read it as it deserves to be
      read, however, there will be rewards. Even for an unscientific
      reviewer there were momentary glimpses of strange and exciting new
      worlds in Dr. Crile's picture of the human body; brain included,
      as a mass of infinitely tiny ó ultrafurnaces in protoplasm, which
      he calls Herschel Brickeii microscopic ó units of radiogens and in
      which combustion is constantly taking place, in other words, we
      are water-cooled combustion engines for the manufacture of
      electric energy, in the opinion of this seeker after truth, and I
      hope he will forgive me if I have oversimplified his theory.<br>
      <br>
      At any rate, this is what he writes about the operation of the
      protoplasm of which we are made, the substance of our physical
      beings: Since all matter is electrical in nature and since in the
      final analysis all energy is radiant and electric energy, we
      conceived that proptoplasm must be generated and operated by
      radiant and electric energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Radio-Electric</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Then he goes on ó I am quoting from the General Summary, "The
      Radio Electric Theory of Living Processes" ó to outline the
      logical steps from the statement just quoted: In accordance with
      this conception, protoplasm would be a system of generators,
      conductance lines, insulators and infinite numbers of infinitely
      thin films for holding electric charges. Lightning and terrestrial
      electricity which fix nitrogen form the nitrates. The nitrates in
      the soil represent a pre-plant phase of living things. Solar
      radiance added to the nitrates generates plants. Plants generate
      animals. This solar radiation generates man.<br>
      <br>
      The generation of radiant and electric energy in animals is made
      through oxidation of the organic compounds of the plant; that is,
      solar radiance is released in the animal by oxidation. Animals are
      adapted to oxidation, just as a combustion engine is adapted to
      oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      Much of the body of animals, the lungs and the circulatory system,
      is related to the fact that It is through oxidation in animals
      that the sun's radiance is re-radiated in protoplasm; that is,
      oxidation causes the sun to "shine" again in protoplasm. Animals,
      like plants, grow by virtue of solar radiation and reradiate solar
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Sun Our Father</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This sounds as if Dr. Crile had got around to saying
      scientifically what the ancients decided without benefit of test
      tubes and other laboratory apparatus, namely, that My Lord Sun is
      really the source of all life. Poets and other people who never
      had to prove anything have often hit upon truths that science will
      be a long time establishing to its satisfaction, and one of the
      most striking features of Dr. Crile's book is its record of a
      painstaking scientific search for proof of the validity of a
      theory.<br>
      <br>
      His conclusions represent thousands of experiments over a ten-year
      period, although he began work on his quest much longer ago than a
      mere decade. More than 2,500 animals were used and the best
      resources of physics, chemistry, biology, histology, cystology,
      biophysics and so on were called upon.<br>
      <br>
      What was learned in the various laboratories was then checked, Dr.
      Crile explains, in the clinic, because the work has not been done
      In the field of "pure" science; its results were meant to be
      useful , to human beings as quickly as they could be determined
      and made available. i Dr. Crile's own curiosity was I originally
      aroused by the death of a medical student who was killed by the
      shock of an accident, the trauma, and much of what he has learned
      has been made 1 use of in helping to avoid "surgical shock" in
      operations, another name for the curious deenergizing of the body
      under certain abnormal conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Thyroid</b><br>
      <br>
      In addition to this important development, Dr. Crile points out
      that his researches and those of hii colleagues have also been
      instrumental in putting into practice "the principle of
      resuscitation by adrenalin and blood transfusion not only in the
      treatment Of hemorrhage and shock but as a preventive against
      shock in patients handicapped by old age, infection, anemia,
      malignant tumors, degenerative disease, by the crisis of
      hyperthyroidism, ttc."<br>
      <br>
      The thyroid, about which we hear so much these days when
      everybody's glands seem to be popular topics of conversation,
      receives its due attention in Dr. Crile's book, and he even
      remarks upon the brilliance of people whose thyroid works
      overtime: So high is the scholastic record among patients with
      hyperthyroidism and so many individuals of Phi Beta Kappa are to
      be found among them that, although hyperthyroidism may appear
      years after graduation, in a certain sense we may say that even
      Phi Beta Kappa is a disease. Certainly there is no record of an
      individual with myxedema (hypothyroidism, or subactivity of the
      gland) attainingPhi Beta Kappa rank.<br>
      <br>
      The thyroid, in Dr. Crile's scheme of things, is one of the three
      principal regulators of reradiation of "sunshine" in the
      protoplasm, the brain and the adrenal sympathetic system being the
      other two; the control centers of health or illness.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Dr. George Crile and his Radiogen
            Theory</b></big></div>
      <br>
      We have only one more point to make which might further elucidate
      the subject of biological transmutation. That point is taken from
      the work of Dr. George Crile, years before Kervran's famous study
      of Biological Transmutations. Dr. Crile carried out research into
      the Bi-Polar phenomena of Life, specifically involving the
      production of electrical currents in protoplasm by oxidation and
      radiant energy. He came to believe that the living organism is
      specifically adapted to the formation, storage and specific use of
      electric energy and that the genesis of electric energy is due to
      RADIANT ENERGY emitted (by ultra- microscopic units or FURNACES in
      protoplasm. These furnaces he called RADIOGENS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Crile postulates that the COMBUSTION OF THE PROTEINS is effected
      by these microscopic units and that the SHORT WAVE RADIATION
      EMITTED by this continuous combustion has two primary and
      fundamental effects:<br>
      <br>
      1) Short wave radiation knocks off electrons and thus disturbs the
      electrical state of the protoplasm, especially of the infinitely
      intricate network of the nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      2) Short wave radiation so DISTURBS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ATOM
      as to make atoms CHEMICALLY ACTIVE, thereby forming the basis for
      the SYNTHESIS OF PROTOPLASM.<br>
      <br>
      RADIOGEN is the descriptive term which Crile adopted to denote the
      theoretical units of protoplasm in which oxidation occurs and from
      WHICH RADIATION IS EMITTED. He believed that LITTLE OR NO
      OXIDATION tooks place in the great mass of protoplasm outside of
      these infinitesimal units or RADIOGENS. The RADIOGEN unit is
      patterned after the Solar System or the atom; that the nucleus or
      sun of this infinitely small solar system is an atom of IRON; that
      these atoms of iron, bearing a sign of like charge, REPEL EACH
      OTHER as do metals in colloidal suspension, and that by this
      radiogen, ENERGY IS CONTINUOUSLY RELEASED AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
      ARE CONTINUOUSLY BUILT UP.<br>
      <br>
      The element iron, in the position of a miniature sun, would be in
      continuous oscillation thus producing a temperature of not less
      than 5,000 degrees Centigrade, just as the element iron in the sun
      is in continuous oscillation. The degree of this temperature is
      indicated by the genesis of Ultraviolet, visible and infra-red
      radiation; in other words, a RE- RADIATION OF THE SOLAR ENERGY
      originally put into the organic molecule in the plant takes place
      in the radiogen.<br>
      <br>
      Enzymes are organic compounds able to accelerate in a pronounced
      manner a number of chemical reactions. Enzymes are credited with
      having NO ENERGY, but nevertheless with CONTRIBUTING VAST AMOUNTS
      OF ENERGY. Enzyme activity increases in the springtime or as a
      result of stimulation, or from a rise in temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Here we can clearly see the analogy between the solar process
      which provides for an interior fissioning on an extremely small
      scale. We suggest you read anything you can find by Dr. Crile,
      specifically; "The Phenomena of LIfe" published in 1936 by Norton
      &amp; Company. Try Health Research as they probably have a

      <b>Selected excerpts pertaining to radiant energy power generation</b><br>
      <br>
      Of high electric significance are the exquisitely thin,
      low-conducting lipoid structures which surround each of the
      trillions of cells which compose the body. It is a well known
      physical fact that an oil film has a high capacity for the
      accumulation of electric charges and that the thinner the film the
      higher its electric capacity. While the other essential
      constituents of the organism might play a role in an organism
      operated by some other form of energy, these lipoid structures are
      of the highest significance in an organism which is operated by
      electrical forces.<br>
      <br>
      The animal organism as a whole is enmeshed in a network of highly
      specialized electric conductorsónamely, the nervous system. In its
      physical composition, therefore, the body is not only highly
      adapted to electrical processes but its constituents in their
      inter-relations within the organism could not be of any
      conceivable value in a mechanism operated by any other form of
      energy. -- p. 48<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism by which oxidation within the protoplasm of the cell
      generates the electric charges that operate the cell and the
      organism we postulate is due to the short wave radiation generated
      and emitted by oxidation within protoplasm. According to this
      conception this short wave radiation knocks off electrons. These
      moving electrons charge up the intricate network of the nervous
      system as well as the infinitely thin membranes that separate the
      various units of structure and network within the cells. -- p.
      48-49<br>
      <br>
      The nucleus of the cell is comparatively acid. The cytoplasm of
      the cell is comparatively alkaline. The nucleus and the cytoplasm
      are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore the cell is a bipolar mechanism or an electric battery,
      the nucleus being the positive element, the cytoplasm the negative
      element. The rate of oxidation in the nucleus is greater than the
      rate of oxidation in the cytoplasm; and therefore as the electric
      tension increases in the nucleus, the electricity passes through
      the nuclear membrane; the electric potential in the nucleus falls
      and in consequence the current is interrupted. Since the potential
      is again immediately restored by oxidation, radiation and other
      chemical activity, we conceive that an interrupted current passes
      continually from the positive nucleus to the negative cytoplasm
      and in consequence a charge is accumulated on the surface
      membranes. As we have stated, these membranes of infinite thinness
      and of high dielectric capacity are peculiarly adapted to the
      storage and adaptive discharge of electric energy. -- p. 49<br>
      <br>
      It was apparent that the variations in that form of radiant energy
      which we call heat followed closely the variations in electric
      conductivity, electric capacity and electric potential observed
      under like conditions, thus indicating the fundamental nature of
      these electric and radiant forces.<br>
      <br>
      But it is not the long wave heat radiation but the short or
      ionizing wave radiation that has hitherto escaped detection as the
      energy that builds up protoplasm and generates the electric
      changes and currents that operate protoplasm.--&nbsp; p. 78<br>
      <br>
      The long wave or heat radiation affects molecules but does not
      affect atoms as far as the structure of the atom is concerned. To
      build an organic compound it is necessary to have such a powerful
      short wave radiation that it can affect or modify the structure of
      the atom by knocking off electrons or by changing their paths,
      thus altering the charge of the atom. When an electron is knocked
      from an atom, the balance of charge is shifted toward the positive
      side. Thus making the atom more positive and giving it a greater
      affinity for other atoms. In other words, short wave radiation
      gives chemical affinity to the atoms. Therefore to build such
      organic compounds as those which make up plants and animals,
      radiation of certain short wavelength is essential. -- p. 78-79<br>

      Since the interior of an animal receives no radiance directly from
      the sun, an animal necessarily must use the sunís radiance that is
      stored in the atoms and molecules of the protoplasm of the plant.
      Just as non-living, for example in coal and oil, the stored
      radiance of the sun is present in the atoms of the carbon
      compounds and is released as light and heat which in turn effect
      mechanical activity, so in animals solar radiation is released
      from the atoms of the plant food and produces light and heat
      animal activity. Einsteinís Law of Equivalence should be cited
      here, viz., that energy of an atom is given out in the same quanta
      as those received by the atom, so it is not a figure of speech but
      a fact that the sun shines again in the protoplasm of animals,
      endowing them with the unique power of the sun.<br>
      <br>
      Is radiation merely a waste product or is this radiation and
      essential function of protoplasm? This question is answered in
      part, for the nitrifying bacteria at least, by the following
      quotation from a report of the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and soils:
      1<br>
      <br>
      ìThere are various ways of rendering the inert nitrogen molecule
      chemically active. Heat and electricity are effective when
      properly applied, and results obtained in this bureau have
      indicated that ultraviolet light having very short wavelengths is
      an agency to this end. Ö Spectroscopy has recently furnished
      detailed knowledge of the structure of the nitrogen molecule, and
      it is now possible by means of ultraviolet light to alter the
      structure, so as to render this exceedingly inert substance
      chemically active.î -- p. 79<br>
      <br>
      Since the energy that constructs and operates animal protoplasm is
      derived directly from plant protoplasm and since the energy that
      constructs and operates plant protoplasm is directly from solar
      radiation, lightning, terrestrial electricity, and the nitrifying
      bacteria, what the animal specifically obtains in his food is the
      radiation or quanta of energy which has been packed into the atoms
      of the plant protoplasm by sunlight, by lightning, by terrestrial
      electricity, and by the nitrifying bacteria. -- p. 79-80<br>
      <br>
      Thus modern physics has given us a simple conception of the source
      of energy in animal protoplasm, since only short wave radiation
      can knock off electrons and hence confer chemical affinity of the
      high order demanded for synthesis and growth.<br>
      <br>
      Short wave radiation accounts also for the origin of the electric
      charges and currents in protoplasm. The same short wave radiation
      which confers chemical affinity detaches electrons in infinite
      numbers, thereby charging up the innumerable membranes and nerve
      and electric circuits which are present everywhere in protoplasm.
      This is the origin of the electric charges by which protoplasm is
      operated. This is as simple as the operation of the photo-cell in
      which short wave radiance falls upon an electrode and detaches
      electrons, which in turn charge up the available circuits which
      operate robots. In protoplasm are present compounds whose
      electrons are detached with facility by ultraviolet, visible and
      short infra-red wave radiation. It would thus seem that protoplasm
      has the properties of a photo-electric cell. -- p. 80<br>
      <br>
      In the animal battery as in the man-made battery, when as the
      result of continuous action the contra-electric current equals the
      primary current, then the electric circuit is inactive and dead;
      the electric potential within the circuit and within the cells
      coincidentally falls to zeroóand the animal is dead. Such a death
      is unique in that there is no struggle, there is only a continuous
      loss of energy, until the animal or man stops living as
      inconspicuously as a battery fades to zero. Just as a battery runs
      down by virtue of polarization and is restored by opening the
      circuit, so is the case of the billions of brain cells that run
      down by virtue of polarization as the result of adequate
      stimulation of the senses, if the stimuli are reduced below the
      threshold of action, the nerve circuits are opened and
      depolarization occurs. This is sleep. -- p. 126<br>
      <br>
      The possession by protoplasm of a mechanism that can generate and
      emit ionizing radiation interprets most simply that hitherto
      unexplained phenomenon, the ionization of oxygen, since it
      explains by what means oxygen is ionized, hence made chemically
      active. It is the short wave radiation emitted by the radiogens
      that ionizes oxygen. The atmospheric oxygen at the low level of
      energy in the alveoli of the lungs, in solution in the blood
      stream, in the hemoglobin, in the plasma that bathes the cells of
      the body, in the electrolytic solutions within the cells
      themselves, indeed throughout its journey from the atmosphere
      until it reaches the ionization radiation emitted by the
      radiogenóthis atmospheric oxygen remains at its primary low energy
      level and is incapable of performing its elementary fundamental
      role of energizing the organism by oxidation. Ionization of this
      element, oxygen, is accomplished instantaneously by the radiation
      emitted from the molecular unit, the radiogen, just as the
      ionization of the oxygen in the air is accomplished
      instantaneously by lightning. -- p. 127<br>
      <br>
      In between the long infra-red and ultraviolet rays comes the
      visible by Dr. Glasser. He has found that when sodium chloride and
      other crystalline salts are irradiated by radium and the x-ray,
      they emit ultraviolet radiation and that this emission is
      increased by exposure of the irradiated salt to visible light. --
      p. 129-130<br>
      <br>
      It would appear that the specific form of energy that builds and
      operates protoplasm is radiant and electric energy; that radiant
      end electric energy is released by oxidation; that radiant and
      electric energy fabricates growth. It follows, therefore, that
      excitation, depression and death can be measured in physical
      terms.--&nbsp; p. 167<br>
      <br>
      There is evidence that in age and senility there is a lowering of
      the oxidation, radiation and electric potential of the organism;
      therefore it would be reasonable to expect that the one agent that
      can control oxidation, radiation and electric potential, that is,
      the thyroid hormone, if administered in suitable cases would tend
      to ameliorate the feebleness and inertia of declining years. -- p.
      174<br>
      <br>
      As has already been stated, a cell can function only when under a
      certain electrical strain, and this electrical strain is
      constantly being regenerated by the radiant energy produced by
      oxidation; in other words, oxidation, radiation, and electric
      potential go hand in hand. Whatever interferes with oxidation
      interferes with radiation and its consequent electric potential.
      -- p. 189<br>
      <br>
      Several types of photo-electric cells known to respond to
      ultraviolet light have been employed as detectors. An improved
      method of detection is a combination of the photo-electric cell
      with the principle of the Geiger-M¸ller counter. Rajewsky, Frank
      and Rodionow, Audubert, and Barth, who used this type of detector
      for mitogenetic radiation, claimed that various materials,
      including onion bulb, cancer tissue, frog sartorius muscle in
      contraction, the peptic digestion of fibrin, and the oxidation of
      FeSO4, gave an increase in the counts, indicating the emission of
      rays. -- p. 346-347<br>
      <br>
      Sodium chloride crystals previously irradiated with roentgen rays
      have been found to release stored energy in the form of
      ultraviolet light in the presence of visible light. Although this
      radiation with an emission maximum at 2,450 A is extremely weak,
      it can be detected easily with the photo-electric Geiger counter.
      -- p. 348-349<br>
      <br>
      Since all matter is electrical in nature and since in the final
      analysis all energy is radiant and electric energy, we conceived
      that protoplasm must be generated and operated by electric energy.<br>
      <br>
      The generation of radiant and electric energy in animals is made
      through oxidation of the organic compounds of the plant; that is,
      solar radiance is released in the animal by oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      Animals are adapted to oxidation, just as a combustion engine is
      adapted to oxidation. Much of the body of animals, the lungs and
      the circulatory system, is related to the fact that it is through
      oxidation in animals that the sunís radiance is radiated in
      protoplasm; that is, oxidation causes the sun to ìshineî again in
      protoplasm. Animals, like plants, grow by virtue of solar
      radiation and re-radiate solar radiation. -- p. 360<br>
      <br>
      The intensity of the re-radiation of solar energy in animals is
      increased by thyroxin, by adrenalin, by nerve impulses. The sunís
      radiance is dimmed at night and in the winter but the identical
      solar radiation in animals shines as brightly at night as in the
      day; as brightly in the winter as in the summer. -- p. 360-361<br>
      <br>
      These considerations would lead our physicist to investigate the
      chemical and physical nature of protoplasm and he would first note
      that the surface films could not generate adaptively the intense
      energy of radiation, and would consider what would be the physical
      nature of a hitherto un-described molecular furnace.<br>
      <br>
      Short wave radiation results from oxidation of nitrogen and carbon
      compoundsóan oxidation at high speeds as in the detonation of
      explosives. It would be evident that there is in the protoplasm
      the constant re-radiation of the energy put into the nitrogen and
      carbon compounds; but the temperature of the protoplasm is at
      almost a cold level, though higher than the environment.--&nbsp;
      p. 363<br>
      <br>
      Our physicist therefore would ask himself what would become of the
      intense heat of combustion since it is not manifested in the
      organism as a whole? He would see clearly that it is the great
      preponderance of water which dissipates it. The physicist would
      then see what the fuel that energizes protoplasm is. He would see
      that protoplasm is water- cooled. He would see how it is made to
      flare up adaptively. He would consider the number and size of
      these generators of radiationóthese radiogens. It would be clear
      that if the radiogens should coalesce they would either extinguish
      each other or would fail to be water-cooled. Therefore, the
      radiogens would be spaced by some form of energy analogous to that
      which spaces colloidal particles. The physicist, knowing that
      animal protoplasm contains a constant but small amount of
      ironóbound ironóand knowing that iron promotes oxidation, would
      think that while cold iron like cold oxygen, cold nitrogen, cold
      carbon, from the standpoint of energy is one thing, on the other
      hand a molecule of iron at a temperature of from 3,000 to 6,000
      degrees Centigrade would be ìexcitedî iron and a vastly different
      thing. Our physicist would then glimpse the fundamental role of
      iron; namely, in the ìexcitedî state the molecule of iron would be
      the luminous sun of the radiogenóthe center of the protein fire
      which would hold the atoms of the proteins in its ìenergy fieldî
      as the primary radiogen, the sun, holds in its ìenergy fieldî the
      planets. And so the physicist would consider that these theoretic
      radiogens would space themselves through the ìenergy fields,î thus
      making a uniform distribution for the genesis of energy; and also
      a uniform division of the water-cooled system.-- p. 363-364<br>

      <br>
      At the very time we were first assembling the material for this
      lecture, there came an announcement in the daily press of a
      discovery by a modern physicist, Dr. George W. Crile, of the
      Cleveland Laboratories, which practically fixed the seal of truth
      upon every word we have uttered or shall utter in this lecture. It
      was most startlingly corroborative of our exegesis. He announced
      that he had discovered at the heart of every living organism a
      tiny nucleus of energy, all aglow, with temperatures ranging from
      3000 to 6000 degrees of heat, which he called "radiogens" or "hot
      points." These, he said, were precisely akin to the radiant energy
      of solar matter. He affirmed, in short, that a tiny particle of
      the sun's power and radiance was lodged within the heart of every
      organic unit! The light and energy that has life. What would be
      Crile's surprise, however, if he were to be shown a sentence taken
      from Hargrave Jennings' old book on the Rosicrucians, written over
      sixty years ago: "Every man has a little spark (sun) in his own
      bosom?" For this was one item in the teaching of the Medieval
      Fire-Philosophers, and the reason they were styled such. They knew
      what Crile has discovered, as likewise did the ancient
      Bible-writers. They based their Sun-god religions upon it. Our
      souls are composed of the imperishable essence of solar light! We
      are immortal because we are Sun-gods.<br>

      Eyes, fingers, blood emit rays which kill cells. As living things
      die, they produce "necrobiotic" rays. All this several
      investigators have demonstrated, and from their demonstrations
      drawn a theory that all living matter radiates energy (TIME, July
      4, et ante). But how does this go on? Cleveland's ingenious
      Surgeon George Washington Crile, who long has been studying the
      electronics of living things, last week offered his theory to the
      Central Association of Science &amp; Mathematics Teachers meeting
      in Cleveland.<br>
      <br>
      Every bit of protoplasm is loaded with multitudes of "hot points"
      or "radiogens" which produce the rays, according to him.
      Temperature of those points must be between 3,000∞ and 6,000∞ C.
      "If one could look into protoplasm with an eye capable of infinite
      magnification," he elaborated, "one might expect to see the
      radiogens spaced like stars, as suns in infinite miniature." The
      "interstellar" spaces absorb the intense heat of his radiogens, he
      reasons. The nucleus of his theoretic radiogen "would
      theoretically be a molecule of iron." Dr. Maria Takles, a Crile
      associate, figures four billion radiogens in a cubic centimetre of
      muscle.<br>
      <br>
      The great importance of radiogens in Dr. Crile's mind is that, if
      they really exist, they may explain how plants add oxygen &amp;
      hydrogen to carbon dioxide to make sugar, how animals add oxygen
      to sugar to form carbon dioxide ó chemical reactions which require
      access of considerable energy.<br>

      <br>
      The famous physician who was one of the founders of the famous
      Cleveland Clinic, worked for nine years formulating the all but
      forgotten bipolar theory of living processes. The works he did on
      the body's bioelectrical energies were truly monumental as was his
      work on the cause of surgical shock. He established the technique
      and value of the blood transfusion. During his long search for the
      underlying causes of fatigue, exhaustion and death at work in the
      University College of London, war hospitals in France, and the
      Western Reserve University Medical School, his data made it
      apparent that in order to understand the cause of surgical shock
      and death, it was necessary to understand the body as an electric
      potential.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the maintenance of the acid medium of the nucleus and the
      alkaline medium of the cytoplasm. His histological findings
      concluded that the&nbsp; lipoidfilms surrounding the nucleus and
      the cytoplasm offered a definite resistance to the positive
      hydrogen ions and that in death this resistance is lowered.<br>
      <br>
      Crile believed that the animal organism as a whole is enmeshed in
      a network of highly specialized electric conductors - namely, the
      nervous system. In its physical composition, therefore, the body
      is not only highly adapted to electrical properties but its
      constituents in their interrelations within the organism could not
      be of any conceivable value in a mechanism operated by other forms
      of energy... We may consider then that electricity keeps the flame
      of lifeùburning in the cell; and that the flame (oxidation)
      supplies the electricity which is the vital force of the animal...
      We may therefore consider the cell as a bipolar mechanism, the
      nucleus being positive element, the cytoplasm the negative
      element. The oxidation in the nucleus appears to be on a higher
      scale than the oxidation of the cytoplasm; and therefore as the
      electric tension increases in the nucleus, the current breaks
      through; the potential in the nucleus falls and in consequence the
      current is interrupted. Since the potential is again immediately
      restored by oxidation, we conceive that the interrupted current
      passes continually from the positive nucleus to the negative
      cytoplasm and in consequence a charge is accumulated on the
      surface films. These films of infinite thinness and of high
      dielectric capacity are peculiarly adapted to the storage and
      adaptive discharge of electric energy... There is no more energy
      per mass in the living than in the non-living. In the living,
      energy is captured and stored and made to run the organism - in
      the non-living the same amount of energy exists, but is balanced;
      equalized; inert; non-living.ù<br>
      <br>
      His works and perceptions were nothing short of genius. What he
      called the Quest in his book THE PHENOMENA OF LIFE, A RADIO
      ELECTRIC INTERPRETATION (1936) was to find the cause and
      correction of death by surgical shock. After ten years of
      experimentation his states: According to our findings, the
      maintenance of the acid-alkali balance between the nucleus and
      cytoplasm of the cells - the electric potential - is essential to
      life and furnishes the immediate driving energy of the living
      process itself. Its reduction to zero or equilibrium is death...
      In structure and function the unit cells which drive the organism
      must be adapted to generate and to release radiation and
      electricity... The mechanism by which oxidation within the
      protoplasm of the cell generates the electric charges that operate
      the cell and the organism we postulate is due to the short wave
      radiation generated and emitted by oxidation within the
      protoplasm. <br>

      oxidation produces radiant energy. Radiant energy generates
      electric currents in the protoplasm. The normal and pathological
      phenomena of life are manifestations of protoplasm. Therefore the
      phenomena of life must be due to radiant and electrical energy.<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Into this book the author has put most of the biologic
      investigations and speculations that have interested him over a
      third of a century. It is interesting reading, coming from a busy
      surgeon, but not easy reading. Some doctors take to golf, others
      to bridge, while Dr. Crile seeks his stimulation and recreation in
      the profundities of biology. The radio-electric interpretation of
      living processes may not appear very convincing to the biologists,
      but the tale of Dr. Crile's quest "Why did William Lyndman die?"
      is a charming one, and human even in its in compatibles and
      contradictions. The basal metabolic rate does not drop 50 per cent
      during sleep (p. 163). The human infant has no natural weapons for
      attack, yet he seems to experience both fear and anger (p. 187).
      It may worry the thoughtful to find worry defined as "interrupted
      stimulation" (p. 189). ..<br>
