      <br>
      In the essay Workings of the Stars in Earthly Substances,
      published a few months ago, the attempt was made to show by means
      of scientific experiments that the stars in the heavens play a
      very real part in happenings on Earth. The experiments were
      carried out with the metallic salts of silver, iron and lead. The
      workings of these metals, in normal conditions, both by day and by
      night, in full daylight and also in a dark chamber, were
      illustrated by a series of pictures. We were then able to show
      that fundamental changes occur at the time of a conjunction of
      Saturn and Sun. Indeed the activity of salts of lead appears to be
      wholly suspended at the time of the conjunction.<br>
      <br>
      In this present essay, we shall show, again by means of pictures
      painted by the Cosmos itself, how the total eclipse of the Sun on
      June 29th, 1927, was mirrored in the metallic salts of gold,
      silver and tin.<br>
      <br>
      Gold, the physical representative on Earth of the Sun, and silver,
      the physical representative on Earth of the Moon, are obviously
      the sub-stances most suited to present in picture form, the
      darkening of the Sun by the Moon.<br>
      <br>
      Once again we must emphasize that his essay represents merely a
      tiny fragment of extensive work. Unbroken study of many years has
      enabled us to create a basis which justifies us now in placing the
      results of our research before the world. May the minds and hearts
      of men be open in order that the Sun may shine into them when the
      physical Sun is darkened.<br>

      Before we can speak of the reflection of the solar eclipse in
      earthly substances, it is necessary to say something about the
      particular substances that were used as a basis for the
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>EXPERIMENTS WITH GOLD</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      It is curiously interesting to experiment with gold. The first
      experiments we carried out with gold some years ago, consisted in
      dissolving it in aqua regia (nitric acid / hydrochloric acid
      mixture) and evaporating the superfluous acid so that we finally
      had gold in solution as chloride of gold. This solution of
      chloride of gold was rhythmically diluted — that is to say, raised
      to a higher potency — and then the different potencies were
      sprinkled on grains of wheat. For a fortnight, the wheat
      germinated and grew under the in-working forces of the gold
      potencies and the result of the measurements was a wonderfully
      harmonious curve. To begin with, then, we investigated the effect
      of gold on the growth of plants. Simultaneously, we tried to
      produce evidence of the effect of very highly diluted substances
      by means of the capillary-analytical method, inserting strips of
      filter paper in small glass vessels each containing one of the
      different potencies. Through the course of the year we
      investigated in this way different plant extracts and metallic
      salt solutions of silver, quicksilver, copper, gold, iron, tin,
      lead, antimony and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from the study of the effect of the potency, we observed the
      pictures produced by gold, silver, copper, iron and how the
      pictures changed in the course of a month, a year and, finally, in
      the course of several years. The results of these investigations
      will have to be dealt with in greater detail in an essay devoted
      entirely to the subject of gold.<br>
      <br>
      For the sake of explaining the experiments described in this
      present book, however, we add these few very brief remarks about
      gold.<br>
      <br>
      We use chloride of gold (aurum chlor. cryst. fuscum) as applied by
      E. Merck of Darmstadt for industrial purposes, dissolving 1 gramme
      in 100 ccm. of distilled water. Gold dissolves very rapidly and
      the water becomes at once a golden-yellow colour. We pour 10 ccm.
      of this solution into a glass vessel and insert a strip of filter
      paper.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the pictures of silver we find that the wealth of
      forms is so great that it is impossible to present one picture
      only of silver. Hundreds of pictures would have to be shown before
      any conception can be gained of the wealth of the forms. In the
      case of gold, the colours are so rich that many pictures must be
      observed before we can realise the nature and character of the
      metal. The colours that make their appearance vary between pure
      yellow and dark violet. We find every shade of yellow up to brown,
      also shades of rosy pink, purple, blue, light to dark violet.
      Plate I is a coloured picture of gold in so far as the colour can
      be reproduced.* It was taken on December 25th 1926, in a dark
      chamber, and proves that light has no direct influence upon the
      manifestation of the colours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plate I -- Gold Chloride, 25.12.26</b><b><br>

      <br>
      When we have gold in a state of solution, the Sun — according to
      the indications given by Rudolf Steiner — is working in it. The
      time of a solar eclipse is therefore highly favourable for
      observing the changes appearing in gold.<br>
      <br>
      For Stuttgart, the time of the eclipse was given as 5.19 a. m.,
      June 29th. I decided, therefore, to insert filter paper in a
      solution of gold on June 29th at 5.19 a. m. and to allow the
      picture to form under the influence of the solar eclipse. The
      usual picture of a solution of gold was familiar to us as the
      result of many experiments. In order, however, to discover the
      appearance presented by gold immediately before the solar eclipse,
      it was necessary to carry out experiments with chloride of gold
      several days before, at 5. 19 a. m. — that is to say, at the same
      moment when the eclipse would occur on June 29th. On account of
      the high cost of reproduction it has unfortunately been impossible
      to print in colour all the pictures of gold. Plate II shows the
      gold on June 27th and 28th.<b><br>

      On June 27th we have a normal picture of gold, whereas on June
      28th it has become somewhat cloudy. Various specks and strokes
      have made their appearance and the picture looks almost dirty.<b>

      Plate IV shows the gold on June 29th at 7 a. m., and again at 5.
      19 p. m., after the eclipse. The picture obtained at the time of
      the eclipse manifests the above-mentioned phenomenon still more
      strongly. A large number of specks have appeared. The colours are
      not so luminous as on other occasions; their tones are mostly
      brownish-red dirty violet. It is altogether an unpleasing picture.<br>
      <br>
      On June 29th at 5. 19 p. m. the picture of the gold has become
      quite clean again; the colours are more luminous but they have not
      yet assumed their natural, inherent beauty and purity.<br>

      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>EXPERIMENTS WITH SILVER</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      We have chosen, from a continuous series, pictures of silver taken
      two days before the eclipse, on the actual day of the eclipse and
      the two following days. in the first publication — Workings of the
      Stars in Earthly Substances — we included a picture of silver,
      referring to an essay dealing entirely with silver which will
      shortly be published. The pictures in this present work are
      obtained in the following way: Between 8 a.m. and 9. a.m. a
      solution of nitrate of silver (1 gramme in 100 can. of distilled
      water) is poured into a glass vessel into which the filter paper
      is dipped. The silver rises, attaining its maximum height after
      two or three hours and is coloured by the light and air. According
      to whether the Sun shines more or less strongly, the tones of the
      colour vary from light to dark brown. No matter how much silver is
      contained in the vessel, when the maximum height is attained, the
      surplus silver remains stationary in the vessel and the filter
      paper is worked upon simply by the light and the air. Towards
      evening, when the Sun is setting, the fluid begins to rise still
      higher and oversteps the boundary set up during the day. The
      extent to which the fluid’ rises by night is dependent upon the
      general weather conditions and the resulting temperature and
      moisture of the air. When the air is moist and the night cold, the
      fluid rises higher than when the air is dry and the temperature
      warm. At night, therefore, there is a second ascent of the fluid
      in the filter paper and when the second boundary has been reached,
      a second picture is formed — the night picture.<br>
      <br>
      Plate V is a picture taken by day and Plate VI shows the night
      picture placed with it. These pictures cannot be obtained in the
      laboratory but only in the open air, under a glass bell or glass
      frame.<br>

      The facts speak for themselves and there is no need to waste many
      words about them. On June 29th, the silver is not at all the same
      as at other times in the month of June. The pictures must be
      allowed to tell their own story and we must give ourselves up
      simply to the effect they produce. Each single picture portrays a
      definite force that is regulating the substance and is working in
      accordance with definite law in the inner structure of the
      picture. On June 29th, one gets the impression that something has
      fallen into disorder. Chaos is reigning; different forces are
      struggling together for the mastery. It seems to me that this
      arises as an entirely objective impression if, without any
      preconceptions whatever, one allows the pictures to work upon one.
      The impression of course is all the stronger when one has been
      able to observe the pictures not only on the two days immediately
      preceding and following the solar eclipse but a long series,
      taken, say, on the thirty days before and the thirty days
      following the eclipse. The impression made by this curious silver
      formation on June 29th is then much stronger. These sixty pictures
      of silver have all been reproduced and we should at any time be
      able to publish them. Some at any rate will certainly be able to
      be brought out.<br>

      <br>
      We have now considered gold by itself and silver by itself, in
      normal conditions and at the time of the solar eclipse. The
      eclipse comes about because the Moon passes between the Earth and
      the Sun. In the Cosmos, therefore, there is a very special
      relation and interworking between Sun and Moon. This interworking
      of the two heavenly bodies is also expressed when the two earthly
      substances representing Sun and Moon are combined. We must
      therefore unite chloride of gold and nitrate of silver at the time
      of the eclipse. Here again it would need a separate essay to speak
      in detail of the combined working of silver and gold but once more
      we must unfortunately limit ourselves to a minimum. Most wonderful
      forms arise when gold and silver unite — the form-building force
      of silver, of the Moon, working in the wealth of colour inherent
      in gold!<br>
      <br>
      Plate XII is the coloured reproduction of a picture of silver and
      gold together, taken on March 21st, 1927, at the beginning of
      Spring. The same concentration of both silver and gold — 1 gramme
      in 100 ccm. —is used and the solutions are mixed in equal
      quantities.<br>

      It is really awe-inspiring to see from a study of Plate XIII how
      utterly differently silver and gold work on the Earth when up in
      the heavens the Moon is covering the Sun! The picture has no
      particular form or colour. The colours are washed out, a greyish
      violet. The experiment was repeated many times on June 29th. The
      relation of gold and silver was practically normal at 2.30 p.m. on
      this day.<br>
      <br>
      Intimate knowledge of the working of these two substances enables
      us to say that the picture which arose at this hour still
      indicates a slight preponderance of silver.<br>
      <br>
      As a rule, the reaction of silver and gold brings about an
      immediate sediment golden-yellow in colour. At 5.19 a.m. on June
      29th this sediment was not golden-yellow but brown, soon darkening
      to black. The silver was working more strongly than the gold and
      to a certain extent this phenomenon was still apparent at 2.30
      p.m.<br>
      <br>
      At 5.19 p. m. the reaction became quite normal and the picture had
      assumed its ordinary appearance. Plate XIV is a picture of silver
      and gold’ taken on June 29th at 7.16 a. m. towards the end of the
      eclipse. We have also added the picture taken on the same day at
      5.19 p.m.<br>

      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>EXPERIMENTS WITH GOLD AND
            TIN</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      We were of course also interested to study the behaviour of gold
      in relation to other metallic salts during the time of the
      eclipse. As well as the experiments with silver, gold and the two
      together, we carried out a long series of others, with gold and
      lead, gold and tin, gold and iron, gold and copper, gold and
      mercury, etc. The relation of the gold to lead was the least
      disturbed, the longest and most intense disturbance being manifest
      in its relation to tin. At some future time more will be said
      about this experiment.<br>
      <br>
      When solutions of gold and tin are united, they give rise to a
      highly interesting combination, well-known to chemists. This
      combination produces the so-called ‘gold-purple of Cassius’ but —
      I merely mention this in passing — not always. There are times
      when the most wonderful gold purple appears, immediately solutions
      of tin and gold are poured together and again there are times when
      absolutely nothing is to be seen. The golden-yellow changes into a
      light green but there is no purple. Now we observed that during
      the month of June, 1927, there was no purple reaction from gold
      and tin. The colour of the sediment was only light green and after
      some hours there was a slightly darker precipitation. On June 27th
      the reaction of gold-tin was more vivid and after five minutes a
      light purple appeared. On June 28th the reaction set in very
      rapidly; the colour at once became violet and the whole picture
      changed considerably. Plate XV -- is a normal picture of tin-gold
      in coloured reproduction.<br>

      In order to show more or less the general character of the
      pictures of tin and gold during the month of June, we show in

      Plate XVII shows gold and tin at 5. 19 a. m. on June 28th after
      the strong reaction described above, also gold and tin at 5. 19 a.
      m. on June 29th at the time of the solar eclipse. The gold and the
      tin have scarcely contacted each other and the golden-yellow has
      changed into a blackish hue. At the same moment there is a strong
      precipitation. The solution becomes thick and appears as though
      coagulated.<br>

      According to the picture, the gold is not working. The fluid
      ascends to a comparatively high level. (Taking the experiments as
      a whole, the height attained by the fluids on the day of the
      eclipse was greater than usual, a fact which is probably explained
      by the stronger influence of the Moon.) The strip of filter paper,
      however, remains perfectly white. At the bottom there appears a
      dark violet line, practically horizontal.<br>
      <br>
      The pictures of tin and gold have, as a rule, something
      extraordinarily pure and delicate about them. To find this sudden
      abnegation of gold was, therefore, an event of great significance,
      for it can only be described as an abnegation of the gold. Instead
      of a beautiful picture with tones of yellow and violet produced by
      the gold in which are inscribed the workings of the tin-forces,
      there is merely an upward suction of empty water, as it were. The
      gold has been dragged down to the bottom and appears as a thick,
      black precipitation showing a thick black line. What is the
      explanation? We can only understand it if we avert our gaze from
      the glass containing the solutions of gold and tin and look out
      into the Cosmos, where we see that the Sun cannot send its rays to
      the Earth and it is dark even by day. The whole world experiences
      this cosmic event. Human beings were under mighty influences. Even
      the unsensitive felt themselves strangely affected. At this moment
      the whole of Nature changed. Shadows assumed lunar forms. A livid
      light fell upon everything. All living beings were in some way
      affected by the eclipse of the Sun. What wonder that dead
      substances too changed in their inner texture?<br>
      <br>
      The Sun’s strength waned at the time of the eclipse. The working
      of gold on Earth was also weakened — weakened’ to such a degree
      that tin effaced it.<br>
      <br>
      This experiment with gold and tin was also repeated, hour after
      hour, and we have reproduced a number of pictures. Unfortunately
      we cannot give the whole series for the number is too great.
      Already by noon, a few forms had appeared (Plate XVIII).<br>

      These forms gradually increased in number as the picture taken at
      2.30 p.m. shows. And so it goes on slowly (Plate XIX) as shown in
      the pictures taken at 4 p. m. and 5.19 p.m. The reaction was
      invariably very strong. The colour is black from the front, in
      perspective a magnificent dark reddish purple.<br>

      We said before that the disturbance between gold and tin was the
      most persistent. It is absorbingly interesting to look at the
      pictures and to follow this disturbance by stages until it ceases.
      On the day following the eclipse, June 30th, the forms below begin
      to break up to a certain extent; the gold emerges in a faint pink
      colouring of the paper and a contour appears higher up. Already by
      the afternoon of July 1st we find the appearance of rich forms, of
      a light purple colour mixed with yellow and violet (Plate XX).<br>

      The pictures in Plate XXI were taken on July 2nd and 3rd. The
      reaction of the two solutions has abated to such an extent that
      after ten minutes a blue purple appears.<br>

      Plate XXII shows tin and gold on July 4th, by day and at twilight.
      The reaction on this date was a beautiful light purple. The
      picture taken by day is extraordinarily harmonious and gaily
      coloured. The form appearing at the bottom is of a rich
      reddish-violet colour. We have also given the picture taken at
      twilight because it is a beautiful illustration of the transition
      to the fully normal condition.<br>

      On July 5th no reaction set in when the solutions of gold and tin
      were poured into each other. The colour merely changed to light
      green and there was no subsequent appearance of purple. The
      picture is normal and absolutely identical with those taken on
      June 12th and 24th.<br>

      <br>
      On July 6th the working of the gold is still stronger. In the
      photograph this is to be observed in the dark tones of the upper
      part of the picture, whereas down below there is a negative form
      in the place where, on June 29th, the dark horizontal strip
      appears and on the following days the blackish forms. It is like a
      white erasion. Thus seven days after the solar eclipse, the
      ordinary relationship of gold and tin exists again.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plate XXIII, bottom</b><b><b> -- </b> Gold Chloride &amp; Tin

      </div>
      The forces of tin overcame the gold at the time of the eclipse. It
      was to be expected that a re-arrangement of the proportions of the
      two sub-stances in favour of the gold would set up the balance. I
      tried the experiment and found that by using six parts of gold, a
      picture was obtained on July 1st, resembling one taken on July
      5th.. That is to say, six parts of gold and one of tin on July
      1st, work just as one part of gold and one of tin on June 12th and
      July 5th. On July 6th one part of gold was a match for one part of
      tin because the Sun was able to pour more force into the gold.<br>
      <br>
      And so with these experiments too we have again been able to show
      how cosmic forces work into the realm of the Earth. The gold on
      Earth and the Sun in the heavens belong to each other. When the
      physical Sun is darkened in the heavens, the spiritual Sun may
      shine in our hearts with all the greater strength if we are able
      to realise how the heavens live and move in the earthly world, as
      the “golden vessels, upward and down-ward climbing”. If the Sun is
      shining in our hearts, we need have no fear of the outer darkness.
      For the path to the Spirit is in very truth a passage through
      darkness to light.<br>
