      <br>
      Frankincense, also called olibanum, is an aromatic resin obtained
      from trees of the genus Boswellia, particularly Boswellia sacra,
      B. carteri, B. thurifera, B. frereana and B. bhaw-dajiana
      (Burseraceae). The English word is derived from Old French "franc
      encens" (i.e., high quality incense)[1] and is used in incense and
      perfumes.<br>
      <br>
      There are four main species of Boswellia that produce true
      frankincense and resin from each of the four is available in
      various grades. The grades depend on the time of harvesting. The
      resin is hand-sorted for quality.<br>
      <br>
      Frankincense is mentioned in the Bible as one of the three gifts
      the wise men gave to the young child Jesus.<br>

      Frankincense is tapped from the scraggly but hardy trees by
      slashing the bark, which is called striping, and allowing the
      exuded resin to bleed out and harden. These hardened resins are
      called tears. There are several species and varieties of
      frankincense trees, each producing a slightly different type of
      resin. Differences in soil and climate create even more diversity
      of the resin, even within the same species. Boswellia Sacra trees
      are considered unusual for their ability to grow in environments
      so unforgiving that they sometimes grow out of solid rock. The
      initial means of attachment to the rock is unknown but is
      accomplished by a bulbous disk-like swelling of the trunk. This
      growth prevents it from being ripped from the rock during violent
      storms. This feature is slight or absent in trees grown in rocky
      soil or gravel. The trees start producing resin when they are
      about eight to 10 years old.[2] Tapping is done two to three times
      a year with the final taps producing the best tears due to their
      higher aromatic terpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene content.
      Generally speaking, the more opaque resins are the best quality.
      Fine resin is produced in Somalia and along the northern coast of
      Somalia, from which the Roman Catholic Church draws its
      supplies.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Recent studies have indicated that frankincense tree populations
      are declining, partly due to over-exploitation. Heavily tapped
      trees produce seeds that germinate at only 16% while seeds of
      trees that had not been tapped germinate at more than 80%. In
      addition, burning, grazing, and attacks by the longhorn beetle
      have reduced the tree population.[4] Conversion (clearing) of
      frankincense woodlands to agriculture is also a major
      threat.[5]...<br>

      <b>Traditional medicine</b><b><br>

      Boswellia sacra tree, from which frankincense is derived, growing
      inside Biosphere 2<br>
      <br>
      Frankincense resin is edible and is used in traditional medicines
      in Africa and Asia for digestion and healthy skin. For internal
      consumption, it is recommended that frankincense be translucent,
      with no black or brown impurities. It is often light yellow with a
      (very) slight greenish tint. It is often chewed like gum, but it
      is stickier.<br>
      <br>
      In Ayurvedic medicine frankincense (Boswellia serrata), commonly
      referred to in India as "dhoop," has been used for hundreds of
      years for treating arthritis, healing wounds, strengthening the
      female hormone system and purifying the air. The use of
      frankincense in Ayurveda is called "dhoopan". In Somali,
      Ethiopian, Arabian, and Indian cultures, it is suggested that
      burning frankincense daily in the house brings good health.[17]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Frankincense essential oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Frankincense (Boswellia carteri) essential oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The essential oil of frankincense is produced by steam
      distillation of the tree resin. The oil's chemical components are
      75% monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenoles, sesquiterpenols,
      and ketones. It has a good balsamic sweet fragrance, while the
      Indian frankincense oil has a very fresh smell. Steam or hydro
      distilled frankincense oil does contain a number of boswellic
      acids (triterpenoids) which represents a method of validating the
      authenticity of the essential oil. The chemistry of the essential
      oil is mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with small amounts
      of diterpenoid components being the upper limit in terms of
      molecular weight.[18][19][20] Frank A, Unger M. J Chromatogr A.

      </b><br>
      Olibanum is characterized by a balsamic-spicy, slightly lemon,
      fragrance of incense, with a conifer-like undertone. It is used in
      the perfume, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medical research</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For therapy trials in ulcerative colitis, asthma and rheumatoid
      arthritis there are only isolated reports and pilot studies from
      which there is not yet sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy.
      Similarly, the long-term effects and side effects of taking
      frankincense has not yet been scientifically investigated.
      Nonetheless, several preliminary studies have been published.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Frankincense</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 2008 study reported that frankincense smoke was a psychoactive
      drug that relieves depression and anxiety in mice.[21][22] The
      researchers found that the chemical compound incensole acetate[23]
      was responsible for the effects.[21]<br>
      <br>
      In a different study, an enriched extract of "Indian Frankincense"
      (usually Boswellia serrata) was used in a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of patients with
      osteoarthritis. Patients receiving the extract showed significant
      improvement in their arthritis in as little as seven days. The
      compound caused no major adverse effects and, according to the
      study authors, is safe for human consumption and long-term
      use.[24]<br>
      <br>
      In a study published in 2009, it was reported that "Frankincense
      oil appears to distinguish cancerous from normal bladder cells and
      suppress cancer cell viability."[25]<br>
      <br>
      A 2012 study in healthy volunteers determined that exposure to
      11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), a lead boswellic acid in the novel
      solubilized frankincense extract Boswelan, is increased when taken
      with food. However, simulations based on a two-compartment
      pharmacokinetic model with single first-order absorption phase
      proposed that the observed food interaction loses its relevance
      for the simulated repeated-dose scenario.[26]<br>
      <br>
      In a 2012 study, researchers found that the "behavioral effect [of
      insensole actetate] was concomitant to reduced serum
      corticosterone levels, dose-dependent down-regulation of
      corticotropin releasing factor and up-regulation of brain derived
      neurotrophic factor transcripts IV and VI expression in the
      hippocampus. These data suggest that IA modulates the
      hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and influences
      hippocampal gene expression, leading to beneficial behavioral
      effects supporting its potential as a novel treatment of
      depressive-like disorders."[27]<br>
      <br>
      In 2013, Leicester University researchers announced findings that
      AKBA (acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid), a chemical compound in
      the resin, has cancer-killing properties and has the potential to
      destroy ovarian cancer cells. The lead researcher from the
      University's Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine
      announced the findings after a year studying the AKBA compound
      with ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro that showed it is
      effective at killing late stage cancer cells. Kamla Al-Salmani
      noted that among surprising findings were that some cells that had
      become resistant to chemotherapy were killed during the in vitro
      study. The efficacy of AKBA as a potential medicine for treatment
      of cancers(colon, breast and prostate) has been tested. The
      results are based on the preliminary and unverified findings of
      the laboratory study, which marked the first study to identify an
      ability to fight ovarian cancer. It is in early stages and, as of
      2014, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.[28][29][30]<br>

      <b>Cancer hope</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      But immunologist Mahmoud Suhail is hoping to open a new chapter in
      the history of frankincense.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have observed that there is some agent within
      frankincense which stops cancer spreading, and which induces
      cancerous cells to close themselves down. He is trying to find out
      what this is.<br>
      <br>
      "Cancer starts when the DNA code within the cell's nucleus becomes
      corrupted," he says. "It seems frankincense has a re-set function.
      It can tell the cell what the right DNA code should be.<br>
      <br>
      "Frankincense separates the 'brain' of the cancerous cell - the
      nucleus - from the 'body' - the cytoplasm, and closes down the
      nucleus to stop it reproducing corrupted DNA codes."<br>
      <br>
      Working with frankincense could revolutionise the treatment of
      cancer. Currently, with chemotherapy, doctors blast the area
      around a tumour to kill the cancer, but that also kills healthy
      cells, and weakens the patient. Treatment with frankincense could
      eradicate the cancerous cells alone and let the others live.<br>
      <br>
      The task now is to isolate the agent within frankincense which,
      apparently, works this wonder. Some ingredients of frankincense
      are allergenic, so you cannot give a patient the whole thing.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Suhail (who is originally from Iraq) has teamed up with medical
      scientists from the University of Oklahoma for the task.<br>
      <br>
      In his laboratory in Salalah, he extracts the essential oil from
      locally produced frankincense. Then, he separates the oil into its
      constituent agents, such as Boswellic acid.<br>
      <br>
      "There are 17 active agents in frankincense essential oil," says
      Dr Suhail. "We are using a process of elimination. We have cancer
      sufferers - for example, a horse in South Africa - and we are
      giving them tiny doses of each agent until we find the one which
      works."<br>
      <br>
      "Some scientists think Boswellic acid is the key ingredient. But I
      think this is wrong. Many other essential oils - like oil from
      sandalwood - contain Boswellic acid, but they don't have this
      effect on cancer cells. So we are starting afresh."<br>
      <br>
      The trials will take months to conduct and whatever results come
      out of them will take longer still to be verified. But this is a
      blink of the eye in the history of frankincense. <br>

      <br>
      “Frankincense ‘fights cancer’,” is the festive health headline
      from the Mail Online. The “aromatic substance from the Nativity
      story could help treat ovarian tumours,” it says.<br>
      <br>
      The news is based on a University of Leicester press release
      entitled “Christmas gift brings treatment hope for cancer
      patients”. Unfortunately, many more Christmases are likely to pass
      before anyone is treated with frankincense for ovarian cancer.<br>
      <br>
      This is because the news is based on positive early findings from
      research carried out on the AKBA compound found in frankincense
      and ovarian cancer cells in a lab.<br>
      <br>
      The press release says the researchers have been able to show the
      ability of the compound to combat cancer cells in late-stage
      ovarian cancer.<br>
      <br>
      This is festive news, and the press team at the University of
      Leicester should be congratulated for their ingenuity. However,
      limited conclusions can be drawn from the preliminary findings of
      this laboratory study as it is yet to be published in a
      peer-reviewed journal. And some of the claims should not be taken
      at face value; in particular the press release’s claim that
      frankincense has no known side effects. Such claims would need
      rigorous scientific evaluation before they could be verified.<br>
      <br>
      This research is still at a very early stage and as the press
      release points out, frankincense is yet to be studied for the
      treatment of ovarian cancer in humans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is ovarian cancer?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year
      and is the fifth most common cancer among women. As the symptoms
      of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other conditions, it
      can be difficult to recognise, particularly in the early stages of
      the disease. However, there are early symptoms to look out for,
      such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach,
      and difficulty eating.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Why is this in the news?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The story is based on a press release from the University of
      Leicester about the findings of a study carried out by researchers
      from the University. The researchers looked at a compound derived
      from frankincense called acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA)
      and ovarian cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The study has not yet been published in a peer reviewed scientific
      journal, so the findings reported should be treated with caution.
      With only the press release available it is not possible to fully
      appraise the design and methods of this study.<br>
      <br>
      The study appears to have been carried out in the laboratory for
      about a year and was funded by the Omani government. No other
      study methods are provided.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible that the press release is being issued now because
      of the link between frankincense and Christmas.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<b>What is frankincense?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Frankincense is a fragrant plant resin that comes from the
      Boswelllia sacra tree found across Africa and the Arabian
      peninsula, including Yemen and Oman. It is one of the famous gifts
      said to have been given by the Wise Men when they visited newborn
      Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      Frankincense has been used as a folk medicine for centuries due to
      its anti-inflammatory properties. Previous studies have linked the
      AKBA compound as a potential treatment for other cancers as well
      as osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<b>What are the reported study findings?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the press release and accompanying audio interview, Dr Mark
      Evans from the University of Leicester, who supervised the
      research, says: “We have shown that this frankincense compound is
      effective at killing ovarian cancer cells at realistic
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      “What has been most surprising is that the cells we have tested
      which are resistant to chemotherapy have shown to be more
      sensitive to this compound, suggesting frankincense may indeed be
      able to help overcome drug resistance, and lead to an improved
      survival rate for patients with late-stage ovarian cancer”.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Very little can be said, based on the preliminary and unverified
      findings of this laboratory study. The study is yet to be
      published in a peer-reviewed journal and until this happens, it is
      worth exercising a little healthy scepticism about the claims
      being made and the time of year they are being made in. This
      research is still at a very early stage and as the press release
      points out, frankincense is yet to be studied for the treatment of
      ovarian cancer in humans.<br>
      <br>
      The findings of this preliminary research do not affect the
      current methods for treating ovarian cancer.<br>

          Oklahoma Health Sciences Center it was reported
          that"Frankincense oil appears to distinguish cancerous from

          <b>Study: Frankincense may fight some cancers</b><b><br>

          </b><b><br>
          </b>A Virginia Tech scientist says frankincense oil might be
          useful in treating malignant melanoma -- an aggressive cancer
          that attacks humans and equines.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 54,000 malignant melanoma cases are diagnosed
          annually, according to the American Cancer Society, and there
          are many similarities between malignant melanoma in horses and
          malignant melanoma in people.<br>
          <br>
          Recognizing the opportunity for translational research, John
          Robertson, a professor in the Virginia-Maryland Regional
          College of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech, has been
          studying the disease and an experimental treatment involving
          frankincense oil.<br>
          <br>
          Frankincense is a botanical oil distillate made from fermented
          plants that contains boswellic acid, a component known to have
          anti-neoplastic properties.<br>
          <br>
          During a recent presentation before a regional meeting of the
          American Cancer Society in Roanoke, Va., Robertson -- director
          of the college's Center for Comparative Oncology -- said he's
          found the oil has fairly selective anti-tumor activity and
          doesn't appear to disrupt normal cells."I think this research
          on frankincense oil suggests that this ancient medicine may
          have significant modern uses for chemotherapy of
          non-resectable malignancies," said Robertson.<br>

          </b>Muscat: Omani researchers at the University of Nizwa have
          succeeded in producing a medicinally important compound from
          Omani frankincense, luban, for breast cancer treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Ahmad Sulaiman Al Harrasi, holder of the University’s Chair
          of Oman’s Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, said
          researchers have succeeded in isolating and enhancing the
          percentage of AKBA found in the resin of Omani frankincense.<br>
          <br>
          AKBA (beta-boswellic acid, keto-beta-boswellic acid, and
          acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid) has been indicated in
          apoptosis, or death of cancer cells, in particular brain
          tumours and cells affected by leukaemia or colon cancer.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Al Harrasi pointed out that the research was done under the
          chairmanship of Oman Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural
          Products at the Nizwa University and was funded jointly by the
          Oman Research Council and Nizwa University,<br>
          <br>
          This discovery, the Nizwa University scientist says, will play
          a vital medicinal as well as economic role. “AKBA is very
          costly,” he said, explaining the economic benefits to the
          country.<br>
          <br>
          Omani media have claimed that a “cure” for cancer had been
          found, which Al Harrasi denies.<br>
          <br>
          “We would like to dispel certain misgivings regarding our
          discovery,” Dr Al Harrasi told Gulf News over the phone from
          Nizwa, about 160km northwest of Muscat.<br>
          <br>
          “We have not discovered a breast cancer cure and it is not
          from oil as reported in some media and being circulated on
          WhatsApp as well as social media,” he added<br>
          <br>
          The Assistant Dean for Scientific Studies and Research in
          Nizwa University also clarified that the compound had not been
          tested on humans. “We experimented on various cancer cell
          alliances for our research,” he clarified, adding that their
          experiments on several cancer cells showed positive results.<br>
          <br>
          He also revealed that patent registration process was under
          process and 60 to 70 per cent of work was done. “The draft
          [for patent] has been accepted,” he said<br>

          <b>Frankincense oil - a potential treatment option for bladder
            cancer</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          An enriched extract of the Somalian Frankincense herb
          Boswellia carteri has been shown to kill off bladder cancer
          cells. Frankincense oil is prepared from aromatic hardened gum
          resins obtained by tapping Boswellia trees. One of the main
          components of frankincense oil is boswellic acid, a component
          known to have anti-neoplastic properties. Research presented
          in the peer reviewed journal, BMC Complementary and
          Alternative Medicine found that&nbsp; Frankincense oil might
          represent an alternative intravesical agent for bladder cancer
          treatment.<br>
          <br>
          HK Lin and his team, from the University of Oklahoma Health
          Sciences Center and Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, set out
          to evaluate frankincense oil for its anti-tumour activity in
          bladder cancer cells. The authors investigated the effects of
          the oil in two different types of cells in culture: human
          bladder cancer cells and normal bladder cells. The team found
          that frankincense oil is able to discriminate between normal
          and cancerous bladder cells in culture, and specifically kill
          cancer cells.<br>
          <br>
          Within a range of concentration, frankincense oil suppressed
          cell viability in bladder transitional carcinoma J82 cells but
          not in UROtsa cells. Comprehensive gene expression analysis
          confirmed that frankincense oil activates genes that are
          responsible for cell cycle arrest, cell growth suppression,
          and apoptosis in J82 cells. However, frankincense oil-induced
          cell death in J82 cells did not result in DNA fragmentation, a
          hallmark of apoptosis.<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0002] Inflammation is a critical protective biological
          process triggered by irritation, injury or infection,
          characterized by redness and heat, swelling, loss of function
          and pain. In addition to the foregoing induced conditions,
          inflammation can also occur due to age related factors. Life
          expectancy of general population has increased dramatically
          during the past few decades due to efficient control of
          infectious diseases and better access to nutritious food. This
          positive enhancement in life span coupled with changing
          environmental conditions elevated the incidence of chronic
          age-related diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, cancer,
          cardiovascular diseases, etc. Chronic inflammatory condition
          and cancer have become emerging health concerns in a number of
          countries across the globe and for people among all cultures.
          Arthritis is one of the most debilitating diseases of modem
          times. The quality of life for sufferers of these two diseases
          and their families is severely affected. Non-steroidal
          anti-inflammatory drugs are most commonly used remedies for
          rheumatic diseases. Presently, there has been a tremendous
          surge in demand for natural non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
          drugs (NSAIDs) because of their established safety and
          efficacy, through decades of usage by various cultures.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] The inflammatory and carcinogenesis processes are known
          to be triggered by increased metabolic activity of arachidonic
          acid. Arachidonic acid diverges down into two main pathways
          during this process, the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase
          (LOX) pathways. The COX pathways lead to prostaglandin and
          thromboxane production and the LOX pathways leads to
          leukotrienes (LTS) and hydroxyl eicosatetetraenoic acid
          (HETEs). These classes of inflammatory molecules exert
          profound biological effects, which enhance the development and
          progression of human cancers,<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Leukotrienes and 5(S)-HETE are important mediators for
          inflammatory, allergic and obstructive process. Leukotrienes
          increase micro vascular permeability and are potent
          chemotactic agents. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase indirectly
          reduces the expression of TNF-[alpha] (a cytokine that plays a
          key role in inflammation). 5-Lipoxygenase is therefore the
          target enzyme for identifying inhibitors, which have potential
          to cope with a variety of inflammations and
          hypersensitivity-based human diseases including asthma,
          arthritis, bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and
          circulatory disorders such as shock and ischaemia.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Similarly prostaglandins are intercellular messengers
          that are produced in high concentration at the sites of
          chronic inflammation and are capable of causing vasodilation,
          increased vascular permeability and sensitizing pain
          receptors. The pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE2) are
          produced by inducible isoform cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The
          prostaglandins that are important in gastrointestinal and
          renal function are produced by the constitutively expressed
          isoform, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). COX-1 is the protective
          housekeeper isoform and it regulates mucosal cell production
          of mucous that provides a barrier between the acid and pepsin
          present in gastric secretions. Non-selective COX inhibitors
          thus produce serious side effects. Scientists around the world
          are thus investing a major effort in identifying non-steroidal
          anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and
          cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes. As both COX-2 and 5-LOX are commonly
          expressed in any kind of inflammatory condition, efforts are
          currently being focused to obtain the so called dual acting
          anti-inflammatory drugs that are able to inhibit both COX-2
          and 5-LOX enzymes. Unfortunately, the odds of finding a new
          dual acting natural NSAID that can truly alleviate the
          symptoms of inflammatory diseases are very thin. Hence, the
          researchers conceived the idea that using a combination of
          drugs, one having the COX-2 inhibitory activity and the other
          having 5-LOX inhibitory activity, as the next best option.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory
          condition that affects the lubricating mechanism and
          cushioning of joints. As a result of this autoimmune disease
          the bone surfaces are destroyed, which leads to stiffness,
          swelling, fatigue and crippling pain. Osteoarthritis is the
          common form of arthritis and results primarily from
          progressive degeneration of cartilage glycoaminoglycons. The
          damage is often compounded by a diminished ability to restore
          and repair joint structures including cartilage. The smooth
          surface of the cartilage becomes hard and rough creating
          friction. As a result of this the joint gets deformed, painful
          and stiff. Studies have indicated that over 40 million
          Americans have osteoarthritis, including 80% of persons over
          the age of 50. The major focus for osteoarthritis treatment,
          should therefore involve agents that not only stimulate the
          production of biological substances necessary for regeneration
          of cartilage cells and proper joint function but also diminish
          pain inflammation.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
          provide a salt or ion pair complex as a dietary supplement,
          that exhibits anti-arthritic properties without deleterious
          side effects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0008] Boswellic Acids</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0009] Gum resin of Boswellia species known as Indian
          frankincense has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in
          Traditional Ayurvedic Medicine in India. Ancient Ayurvedic
          texts described its therapeutic use. Clinical trails performed
          by CSIR laboratories in India have shown fair to excellent
          results in 88% of the patients, with no adverse side effects
          (Singh, G. B., Status report, anti-inflammatory drugs from
          plant sources, 1982). A randomized, double blind, placebo
          controlled clinical trials on patients with osteo-arthritis of
          knee exhibited statistically significant improvement in the
          pain, decreased swelling and increased knee flexion etc.
          (Kimmatkar, Phytomedicine, 2003, 10, 3-7), The therapeutic
          effects shown by Boswellia serrata extract were comparable to
          those exhibited by sulfasalazine and mesalazine in patients
          with ulcerative colitis. (Gupta, I., et al., Eur. J. Med.
          Res., 1998, 3, 511-14 and Gerhardt, H., et. al.,
          Gastroenterol., 2001, 39, 11-17). The source of
          anti-inflammatory actions has been attributed to boswellic
          acids (Safayhi, H., et al., Planta Medica, 1997, 63, 487-493
          and J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1992, 261, 1143-46, both the
          journals published from USA), a group of triterpene acids
          isolated from the Boswellia resin (Pardhy, R. S., et al.,
          Indian J. Chem., 1978, 16B, 176-178). These compounds exert
          anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase
          (5-LOX). The boswellic acids also gained prominence recently
          for their antiproliferative actions. Boswellic acids inhibited
          several leukemia cell lines in vitro and inhibited melanoma
          growth and induced apoptosis (Hostanska, K., et al.,
          Anticancer Res., 2002, 22(5), 2853 -62). The acetyl boswellic
          acids were found to be unique class of dual inhibitors of
          human topoisomerases I and II a (Syrovets, T. et al., Mol.
          Pharmacol., 2000, 58(1), 71-81). Immunomodulatory activity of
          boswellic acids had been reported by Sharma et al. in
          Phytotheraphy Research, 1996, 10, 107-112, published from USA.
          A detailed study on the structural requirements for boswellic
          acids indicated that of all the six acids,
          3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid, hereinafter
          referenced as AKBA shows most pronounced inhibitory activity
          against 5-LOX (Sailer, E. R., et al., British J. Pharmacology,
          1996, 117, 615-618). AKBA acts by unique mechanism, in which
          it binds to 5-LOX in a calcium-dependent and reversible manner
          and acts as a non-redox-type, non-competitive inhibitor
          (Sailer, E. R., et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1998, 256, 364-368).
          The AKBA or a plant extract or composition containing it was
          reported to be effective for topical application, as an agent
          to soften lines and/or relax the skin (Alain, M., et. al.,
          U.S. patent application No. 2004/0166178, dated Aug. 26,
          2004). AKBA has thus become the subject of intensive research
          for its potential for the treatment of chronic inflammatory

          <b>[0010] Glucosamine</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0011] Glucosamine is a natural substance found in high
          quantities in joint structures. The main function of
          glucosamine in joint structures is to produce cartilage
          components necessary for maintaining and repair joint tissue.
          Glucosamine stimulates the formation of joint structural
          components such as collagen, the protein of the fibrous
          substances that holds the joints together and helps to
          build-up the cartilage matrix, Collagen is the main component
          of the shock-absorbing cushion called articular cartilage. It
          is also a necessary nutrient in the production of synovial
          fluid. Some people may lose the ability with age to produce
          glucosamine, thereby inhibiting the grpwth of cartilage
          destroyed during wear and tear in osteoarthritis patients
          (Towheed, T. E., Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2003, 49, 601-604).
          When taken orally as a dietary supplement in the form of
          glucosamine sulfate, it has been shown to exert protective
          effect against joint destruction and is selectively used by
          joint tissues to promote healthy joint function and show
          potential therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis (Perry, G. H.,
          et al., Ann. Rheum. Dis., 1972, 31, 440-448).<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Several double-blind studies with glucosamine sulfate
          showed therapeutic effects comparable to or even better than
          non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in relieving the
          symptoms of osteoarthritis (Vaz, A. L., Curr. Med, Res. Opin.,
          1982, 8, 145-149; D'Ambrosia, E. D., et al.,
          Pharmatherapeutica, 1982, 2, 504-508 and Tapadinhas, M. J., et
          al., Pharmatherapeutica, 1982, 3, 157-168). The NSAIDs offer
          only symptomatic relief, whereas glucosamine addresses the
          root cause of osteoarthritis disease. It support body's
          natural ability to tackle the disease on its own by providing
          the building blocks to many structural components such as
          glucosaminoglycons to repair the damage caused by
          osteoarthritis. Glucosamine hydrochloride is used for this
          study.<br>

          <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0013] The organic solvent extract of the gum resin of
          Boswellia serrata contain a total of six boswellic acids and
          two timcallic acids. These acids are shown in FIG. 1, and are
          represented by B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, T1, T2 and T3. Studies
          have indicated AKBA as the most potent an anti-inflammatory
          agent among all the boswellic acids. The concentration of
          AKBA, indicated as B2 in the FIG. 1, amounts only in the range
          of 1-10% in the extract, but most often it is in the range of
          2-3%. The potential usefulness of boswellic acids in general
          and AKBA in particular can be a great incentive to take-up
          further development of these compounds in all possible
          aspects.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The present invention is aimed at selective enrichment
          of active compounds, KBA and AKBA to a therapeutically useful
          range such as 30% to 100% from natural Boswellia extract using
          a new improved process and then converting the enriched
          compounds to a salt or ion pair complex with enhanced
          solubility and improved therapeutic efficacy for use as an
          anti-arthritic dietary supplement. The salt or ion pair
          combination may be accomplished by using an acid function of
          the boswellic acid and an amine function from amino organic
          compounds, especially glucosamine.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The enrichment of AKBA from natural Boswellia extract
          was already described in international patent application (PCT
          #WO 03/074063, dated. 12th September 2003) and also in US
          patents (application #20030199581, publication dated 23 Oct.
          2003 and application #20040073060, publication dated 15 Apr.
          2004). The processes described in these patents involve
          multi-step procedures and requires tedious work-up and
          chromatographic purifications. The present invention is an
          improved method, where in the acetylation and allylic
          oxidation steps are conducted in a single pot. This process
          eliminates the need for labor-intensive work-up following
          acetylation and time consuming product drying before
          proceeding to the oxidation step, as required by the processes
          reported in the patents and journal articles. This process
          also efficiently utilizes the un-reacted pyridine and acetic
          anhydride from the acetylation step to form highly active
          oxidizing systems such as CrO3/pyridine and CrO3/acetic
          anhydride. The present invention effectively reduces the
          overall reaction time for peracetylation and the oxidation
          steps. The new process eliminates the presence of possible
          chromium impurities in the KBA/AKBA enriched (30-40%) product
          by acid/base treatment without any need for chromatography.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] A fraction enriched to 30-40% 11-keto-[beta]-boswellic
          acid (KBA), can be accomplished by subjecting the crude
          mixture to basic treatment, followed by filtration and
          acidification of the mother liquor, and then separation of the
          white solid by filtration and drying, It was then reacetylated
          to obtain 30-40% AKBA enriched fraction, The fractions
          enriched to higher percentage (40-100%) of KBA and AKBA can be
          obtained by applying chromatographic methodology on hydrolysis
          mixture and re-acetylation mixture, respectively.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] An ionic salt or ion pair complex of boswellic acids
          containing AKBA in the range of 5 to 100% can be obtained by
          using appropriately enhanced boswellic compound and a suitable
          amine compound and adopting the representative procedure given
          in the examples.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] This invention relates to novel salts or ion pair
          complexes of boswellic acid and keto boswellic acid and acetyl

          <br>
          [0025] We have disclosed a simple method by which salts or
          ion-pair complexes of boswellic acids with hetero-atom bases
          (also referred to as 'organic base') can be made for their
          inclusion in dietary or pharmaceutical compositions that
          provide reduction in inflammation and other health benefits.
          These salts or ion pair complexes are made by simple acid-base
          reaction, as shown in eq, 1, between an organic acid (RCOOH)
          and an organic base (NR4R5R6).<br>
          <br>
          RCOOH+NR4R5R6-&gt;RCOO&lt;-+&gt;NHR4R5R6 (equation 1)<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The new composition according to this invention may be
          prepared by the following processes:<br>
          <br>
          (a) By reacting boswellic acids or ketoboswellic acid or
          acetyl ketoboswellic acid with organic base.<br>
          (b) By in situ generation of organic free base and reacting
          with boswellic acids or ketoboswellic acid or acetyl
          ketoboswellic acid.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] In the first process, stoichiometric equivalents of the
          reactants are mixed to obtain the desired salts or ion pair
          complexes. Preferably, the reaction is initiated by the slow
          addition of organic free base, particularly, glucosamine free
          base to an aqueous methanolic solution of boswellic acids.
          Boswellic acids (48% by HPLC) may be obtained by a known
          process of extraction from the gum resin of Boswellia serrata.
          Glucosamine free base may be liberated from glucosamine
          hydrochloride by anionic exchange resin treatment. The
          enriched 11-ketoboswellic acid or 3-O-acetyl-11-ketoboswellic
          acid (30%-100%) was obtained from the gum-resin of Boswellia
          serrata using an improved method described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] The salts or pair complexes prepared by this process
          may contain between 10 to 70% of boswellic acids. 5-40% of
          glucosamine.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] According to the second process of preparing the
          compounds of this invention, stoichiometric quantities of
          boswellic acids, potassium hydroxide and organic base salts,
          particularly, glucosamine hydrochloride are reacted in aqueous
          methanol medium.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] A further aspect of the present invention is a
          pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound as described
          above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an
          aqueous or a non aqueous carrier).<br>
          <br>
          [0033] A still further aspect of the present invention is a
          method of treating inflammatory diseases, comprising
          administering to a human or animal subject in need thereof a
          treatment effective amount (e.g., an amount effective to
          treat, slow the progression of, etc.) of a compound as
          described above.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] Preferred embodiments relating to the improved process
          of enriching AKBA in natural Boswellia extract and making the
          salts or ion pair complexes are presented in examples 1 to 6.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] Though the following examples describe a specific
          embodiment of this invention, obvious equivalents and
          modifications known to persons skilled in the art are not
          excluded from the scope of the appended claims.<br>

          [0036] 1a). Single Pot Conversion of Boswellia Extract into
          AKBA Enriched Fraction:<br>
          <br>
          [0037] To a solution of Boswellia serrata extract (85%, 10
          kg,) in pyridine (5.4 L), in a 100 L all glass reactor
          equipped with a water-cooled reflux condenser, was added
          acetic anhydride (4.2 L) at room temperature and the mixture
          was subjected to heating at 60-65[deg.] C. under stirring.
          After 3 h, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and
          diluted with acetic acid (24 L) and acetic anhydride (24 L).
          The contents were cooled and treated slowly with chromium
          trioxide (6.4 kg) while maintaining the temperature under
          40[deg.] C. The stirring was continued for another 2 h after
          the addition, and then the mixture was poured into ice water
          and the contents were mixed thoroughly. The solid was
          filtered, washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven to
          obtain a residue (14 kg). The HPLC analysis of the crude
          product showed complete conversion of boswellic acids B1, B4
          and B6 to B2 (AKBA).<br>
          <br>
          [0038] 1b). Isolation of 30-40%
          3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid: The above crude
          reaction mixture (5 kg) was added to 4N hydrochloric acid (45
          L) and heated at 60[deg.] C. for 4 h. The mixture was cooled
          to ambient temperature and filtered. The precipitate was
          washed with 4N HCl, followed by water and dried in a vacuum
          oven to obtain AKBA enriched to 30-40% (2.8 kg).<br>
          <br>
          [0039] 1c). Isolation of 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic
          acid: The above, enriched compound (500 g) was subjected to
          silica column chromatography using 5% to 30% ethyl
          acetate/hexane mixtures. The fractions were monitored by TLC
          and those containing AKBA (30%-60%) were combined and
          subjected crystallization in hexane and ethyl acetate mixtures
          to obtain fractions enriched up to 85% AKBA, Repeated
          crystallization in the same solvent system yielded AKBA
          enriched up to 100%.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] 1d). Isolation of 11-keto-[beta]-bowellic acid:
          Alternatively, the crude mixture was dissolved in methanol and
          subjected to base treatment (8N KOH), The precipitate was
          separated by filtration and discarded. The mother liquor was
          acidified and the off-white precipitate was filtered, washed
          with water and dried under vacuum to obtain 30-40%
          ketoboswellic acid (KBA). The 11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid
          mixture (200 g) obtained was adsorbed on 250 g of silica gel
          and subjected column chromatography over 500 g of silica. The
          column was eluted with hexane, 10% ethyl acetate/hexane, 20%
          ethyl acetate/hexane and 30% ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures.
          The fractions were monitored by TLC and the fractions
          containing 11-keto-p-boswellic acid were combined and
          evaporated and the residue was subjected to repeated
          crystallization from ethyl/hexane mixtures to obtain pure
          11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid (45 g, 95-100%. purity).<br>
          <br>
          [0041] 1e). In a further variation of the process mentioned in
          example 1a, the addition of acetic anhydride was eliminated.
          Instead the peracetylated mixture was diluted with 20 L of
          acetic acid and treated with CrO3 (6.4 kg) in 100 L of acetic
          acid. The reaction mixture was quenched with excess water
          after 24 h, and processed as described in example 1a,<br>

          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0003] Boswellia serrata is a large, branching, deciduous
          tree, which grows abundantly in the dry, hilly parts of India.
          The gum resin exudate of this tree, known in the vernacular
          as"Salai guggal", has been used in the Ayurvedic system of
          medicine for the management of arthritis, respiratory
          diseases, and liver disorders.<br>
          <br>
          The major use of Boswellia serrata in modern medicine is as an
          anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory pharmacological agent.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The active principles found in the gum resin,
          specifically a combination of boswellic acids, have emerged as
          effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAID's)
          with broad biological activities and also a low ulcerogenic
          index. Compared experimentally with the anti-inflammatory drug
          phenylbutazone, boswellic acids did not produce injury to the
          gastrointestinal mucosa. The most popular NSAID, aspirin,
          although much better tolerated than its parent compound
          salicylates, still has serious side effects, e. g.
          gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding which limit its
          long-term use. In addition, aspirin is contraindicated in
          patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria (in general
          allergic reactions), and should be administered with caution
          in children and teenagers due to the risk of Reye syndrome.<br>
          <br>
          [00005] One way in which to explain how boswellic acids
          function as NSAIDs in the treatment of inflammatory conditions
          is to compare these natural compounds to aspirin without the
          typical gastrointestinal irritation. Similar to aspirin,
          boswellic acids inhibit the pathway leading from arachidonic
          acid (a derivative of our body's phospholipids) to its
          metabolic derivatives called leukotrienes and prostaglandins.<br>
          <br>
          An excess of leukotrienes and prostaglandins may be
          responsible, directly or indirectly, for the classic signs of
          inflammation ; redness (due to dilated vessels), swelling (due
          to the blood vessels leaking out), pain (due to activation of
          the pain receptors) and increased heat over the affected part
          of the body. The specific biochemical mechanism of boswellic
          acids differs from that of aspirin, however both compounds
          result in the diminishment of the mediators of inflammation,
          leukotrienes or prostaglandins, and the inflammation is
          subdued.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Studies designed to determine the anti-inflammatory
          mechanism of boswellic acids indicate that their primary mode
          of action involves the inhibition of 5lipoxygenase, the key
          enzyme responsible in the formation of leukotrienes.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, boswellic acids do not appear to impair the
          peroxidation of arachidonic acid by iron and ascorbate. These
          results suggest that boswellic acids are safe, specific,
          non-redox inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis that operate
          through a well defined mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] One of the most interesting properties of boswellic
          acids is their anticomplementary activity. In in vitro
          experiments boswellic acids prevented a wellknown
          inflammatory"chain-reaction"involving several protein
          compounds collectively known as"complement". This is due to
          the inhibition of an enzyme that activates one of the
          components of complement, C3 convertase. The domino effect of
          the complement in the course of rheumatoid arthritis (or a
          similar chronic inflammatory process) leads to a subsequent
          elevation of the enzymes (e. g. cathepsins, glucuronidase and
          human leukocyte elastase (HLE)) causing excessive catabolism
          (wasting) of the joint-forming glycoproteins and
          glycosaminoglycans.<br>
          <br>
          This tissue destructive process leads to continuously
          worsening joint disfigurement, pain, and limited mobility. As
          a consequence of complement-mediated tissue destruction, there
          is an increased release of markers (metabolites) of the
          connective tissue, e. g. hydroxyproline, hexosamine and uronic
          acid. Boswellic acids have been found to decrease the levels
          of tissue destructive enzymes and also of the levels of
          urinary hydroxyproline, hexosamine and uronic acid in the
          acute and chronic phases of experimental arthritis.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] There are four major b-boswellic acids involved in the
          inhibition of 5lipoxygenase and related anti-inflammatory
          events. These are: b-Boswellic Acid (BBA), Acetyl-b-Boswellic
          Acid (ABBA), 11-keto-b-Boswellic Acid (KBBA), Acetyl-11-
          keto-b-Boswellic (AKBBA), listed here in the order of
          increasing anti-inflammatory properties.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Boswellic acids have been found to be effective in
          alleviation of numerous inflammatory conditions, including,
          rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] A standardized extract of boswellic acids (200 mg tid)
          was evaluated in a four week double blind, cross-over trial in
          30 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The mean
          arthritic score (sum of symptoms) and the biochemical index of
          inflammation in the group receiving boswellic acids came down
          significantly after the treatment. However, when the placebo
          was substituted (crossover), the subjective and objective
          indices of arthritis rose again. (See Majeed, M, Badmaev, V,
          Gopinathan, S, Rajendran, R, Norton, T. Boswellin The
          Anti-inflammatory Phytonutrient. Nutriscience Publishers, Inc.
          Piscataway, N. J. 1996. pp. 78.) [0011] In another 20 patient,
          double blind, crossover study a boswellia gum resin extract
          (200 mg tid) combined in an herbomineral formula was evaluated
          in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and separately in
          osteoarthritis. Active and placebo treatments were given for a
          period of three months. After a washout period of two weeks,
          the regimens were crossed-over. The three month active therapy
          resulted in a significant decrease in severity of pain,
          morning stiffness, improved joint mobility score, grip
          strength score and the overall disability score compared to
          the placebo group. The biochemical index of inflammation was
          also significantly improved due to the treatment. (See

          example of a chronic inflammatory process in the bowel, which
          may be caused and/or aggravated by excessive leukotriene
          production.<br>
          <br>
          Effects of Boswellia serrata gum resin (350 mg thrice daily
          for 6 weeks) vs. the NSAID sulfasalazine was studied in
          patients with ulcerative colitis. The tested parameters,
          including stool properties, istolopathology of rectal
          biopsies, and blood biochemistry improved after treatment with
          the gum resin. As a result of the treatment, 82% of patients
          went into remission, as compared to a 75% remission rate
          obtained with sulfasalazine. (See Gupta, 1, Parihar, A,
          Malhotra, P, Singh, GB, Ludtke, R, Safayhi, H, Ammon, HP.
          Effects of Boswellia serrata gum resin in patients with
          ulcerative colitis. Eur J Med Res. 1997 Jan; 2 (1) : 37-43.)
          [0013] Boswellic acids were also tested in the management of
          asthma, since a new generation of anti-asthmatic drugs is
          based on the premise of being leukotriene inhibitors. In a
          double blind, placebo-controlled study 40 patients with a
          several years'history of bronchial asthma were treated with
          300 mg tid of boswellia gum resin for a period of six weeks.
          Seventy percent of the patients responded to the treatment as
          evidenced by a reduction in dyspnea, ronchi, and number of
          attacks, improvement in lung tests and blood biochemistry.
          Only 27% of the patients receiving placebo showed clinical
          improvement. (See Gupta, 1, Gupta, V, Parihar, A, Gupta, S,
          Ludtke, R, Safayhi, H, Ammon, HP. Effects Of Boswellia Serrata
          Gum Resin In Patients With Bronchial Asthma: Results Of A
          Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, 6-Week Clinical Study. Eur J
          Med Res. 1998; 3: 511-514.) [0014] Finally, boswellic acids
          also have use in the veterinary field. Several veterinarians
          found success using boswellic acids in the treatment of
          chronic inflammatory conditions in horses such as stifle
          problems, sore backs, bowed tendons and bone spurs. In
          addition, a preliminary study of boswellic acids in aging pet
          dogs and cats showed beneficial effects in alleviating
          arthritic conditions. (See Majeed, M, Badmaev, V, Gopinathan,
          S, Rajendran, R, Norton, T. Boswellin The<br>
          Anti-inflammatory Phytonutrient. Nutriscience Publishers, Inc.
          Piscataway, N. J. 1996. pp. 78.) [0015] Sabinsa Corporation
          manufactures different grades of Boswellic acids known under
          the trademark Boswellin@, two of these are Boswellin
          (standardized for 25% boswellic acids) and Boswellin Forte
          (standardized for 40% boswellic acids).<br>
          <br>
          More specifically, the minimum amount of each boswellic acid
          that must be present in these grades is:<br>
          Boswellin Forte Boswellin BBA min. 11.0% 6.0% ABBA min. 8.0%
          4.0% KBBA min. 7.0% 3.0% AKBBA min. 4.0% 1.5% [0016] Please
          note that, of course, every acid may not be present in its
          minimum amount as the required total percentages of boswellic
          acids (40% and 25%) would not be met if this occurred.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] Such non-water soluble mixtures of BBA, ABBA, KBBA, and
          AKBBA boswellic acids can be used as a pharmaceutical. Since
          the ancient times, frankincense has been used in the
          preparation of cosmetics and perfumes, and also as a fixative
          in perfumes, soaps, creams, lotions and detergents.
          Frankincense is a common name for Boswellia gum resin, and
          Boswellia gum resin is a raw source from which boswellic acids
          are extracted. The stabilizing effect of frankincense in
          cosmetic preparations is directly related to the biological
          properties of boswellic acids. The anti-inflammatory
          properties of boswellic acids can also yield an interesting
          applications for topical and cosmetic use of the extract of
          Boswellia serrata. Boswellia cream for the management of
          inflammatory conditions has been available for several years
          in the US market. Its therapeutic composition includes,
          roughly 5 wt. % boswellic acids, 0.025 wt. % capsaicin, an
          extract of Capsicum annum fruits, and 10 wt. % methyl
          salicylate.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] However, a problem associated with these formulations
          is that they are not soluble in water. Therefore, there is a
          great need in the field for water soluble boswellic acid
          mixtures and salts.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0019] The new water-soluble composition can be formed through
          a method comprising the steps of: (a) dissolving mixtures of
          boswellic acids in a water and alcohol solution to form a
          mixture; (b) adding one or more alkali salts to the mixture to
          form a salt solution; (c) filtering the solution to separate
          un-reacted alkali salt from a filtrate; and (d) recovering the
          soluble boswellic acid mixture from the filtrate.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Additionally, the new composition can be formed by
          using super critical carbon dioxide. The new composition can
          be used to alleviate numerous inflammatory conditions,
          including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis and
          osteoarthritis, colon cancer, prostate cancer and breast
          cancer, and a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions,
          such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It can
          also be used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
          conditions such as stroke, coronary artery disease or
          thrombophlebitis. The composition can be administered

          <br>
          [0022] Preferably, though, the method involves (a) dissolving
          boswellin forte in a water and 5% methanol solution to form a

          (d) recovering the soluble boswellic acid mixture from the
          filtrate, (e) drying the filtrate with a vacuum drier at a
          temperature of no more than 50 C, and (f) powdering the
          filtrate.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] More preferably, the filtrate can be dried through
          concentrating the filtrate free of the solvent to obtain a
          solid, wherein this step also further comprises dissolving the
          obtained solid in water to obtain a secondary mixture,
          charcoalizing the secondary mixture, filtering the
          charcoalized secondary mixture and spray-drying the resulting
          product.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Additionally, it is also possible to use the super
          critical carbon dioxide method of obtaining the boswellic acid
          mixture. Such a process would comprise the steps of (a)
          dissolving a mixture of boswellic acids, preferably boswellin
          forte, in a water and alcohol solution to form a mixture, (b)
          adding one or more alkali salts to the mixture to form a salt
          solution, (c) treating the salt solution with supercritical
          carbon dioxide, (d) allowing the supercritical carbon dioxide
          to evaporate to leave an oleoresin, (e) passing an alcohol
          solution of the oleoresin through a column packed with an
          anion exchange resin, and (f) collecting the soluble boswellic
          acid mixture from the eluent. Furthermore, it is preferred
          that the treatment of the salt solution take place for at
          least 10 hours and that the alcohol solution be 5% methanol
          and 95% water. Suitable resins include Amberjet 4200 (cl),
          Amberlite IRA 410, Amberlite IRA 900, Dowex 1x2-100, Dowex
          22cl, Dowex Marathon A2, Dowex MSA 1, Dowex 550 A, all of
          which are Rohm-Haas or Dow products. The oleoresin is
          preferably passed through the resin at a rate of 20-50 L per
          hour.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] The processes described above produce a water soluble
          composition, preferably comprising at least 12.5% by weight of
          the alkali salt of BBA, at least 9.57% by weight of the alkali
          salt of ABBA, at least 8.15% by weight of the alkali salt of
          KBBA, and at least 3.72% by weight of the alkali salt of
          AKBBA, the remainder of the water soluble composition being
          organic acids or matter, and the alkali salts thereof. This
          composition of boswellic acids is suitable for the treatment
          of many inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis
          and osteoarthritis, colon cancer, prostate cancer and breast
          cancer, and a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions,
          such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It can
          also be used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
          conditions such as stroke, coronary artery disease or
          thrombophlebitis.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The composition may be administered to the subject
          orally, parenterally, or topically. For preparing
          pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the
          invention, inert, pharmaceutical acceptable carriers are used.
          The pharmaceutical carrier can be either solid or liquid.
          Solid form preparations include, for example, powders,
          tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, creams, and cachets.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] A solid carrier can be one or more substances which can
          also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers,
          lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet
          disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating
          material. In powders, the carrier is generally a finely
          divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided
          active component. In tablets, the active compound is mixed
          with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in
          suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size
          desired.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Powders and tablets preferably contain between about 5%
          to about 70% by weight of the active ingredient. Suitable
          carriers include, for example, magnesium carbonate, magnesium
          stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch,
          tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,
          a low-melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The
          pharmaceutical compositions can include the formulation of the
          active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier
          providing a capsule in which the active component (with or
          without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier, which is
          thus in association with it. In a similar manner, cachets are
          also included. Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be
          used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Liquid pharmaceutical compositions include, for
          example, solutions suitable for oral or parenteral
          administration, or suspensions, and emulsions suitable for
          oral administration. Sterile water solutions of the active
          component or sterile solutions of the active component in
          solvents comprising water, ethanol, or propylene glycol are
          examples of liquid compositions suitable for parenteral
          administration.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Sterile solutions can be prepared by dissolving the
          active component in the desired solvent system, and then
          passing the resulting solution through a membrane filter to
          sterilize it or, alternatively, by dissolving the sterile
          compound in a previously sterilized solvent under sterile
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be
          prepared by dissolving the active compound in water or other
          appropriate solvents and adding suitable flavorants, coloring
          agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous
          suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely
          divided active component in water together with a viscous
          material such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methyl
          cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other
          suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.
          Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage
          form. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses
          containing appropriate quantities of the boswellic acid
          mixtures. The unit dosage form can be a-packaged preparation,
          the package containing discrete quantities of the preparation,
          for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials
          or ampules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule,
          cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number
          of any of these packaged forms.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] The specific dosages employed, however, can be varied
          depending upon the requirements of the patient, and the
          severity of the condition being treated. The preferred dosage
          of the alkali boswellic acid salts given is 50-800 mg per day.
          More preferably, the dosage is 100-600 mg per day. Even more
          preferred is a dosage of 150-300 mg per day. Most preferred is
          a dosage of about 200 mg per day, which is preferably
          administered by doses of 200 mg of the boswellic acid salt
          composition 3 times a day. The determination of optimum
          dosages for a particular situation is within the skill of the
          art.<br>

          </b><br>
          An initial batch of 1 kg Potassium Boswellin was prepared
          using 40% Boswellin Forte material (see Figure 1).<br>
          <br>
          Potassium Boswellin and Boswellin 40% were then orally
          administered to two human volunteers who had spent the
          previous 16 hours fasting. 1 gram of Potassium Boswellin was
          given to Individual A and 1 gram of Boswellin 40% was given to
          Individual B. Both the Potassium Boswellin and the Boswellin
          40% were suspended in 35 mi of milk and given to the subjects
          to consume. 5 ml of blood was withdrawn from the volunteers at
          intervals of 5,10,20,40,80, and 160 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          The blood samples were collected into sterile centrifuge tubes
          and left for 120 minutes to retract the clot. The samples were
          then centrifuged to separate the serum. The serum was
          transferred to sterile 2 mi vials and stored at 0 C-4 C
          overnight.<br>
          <br>
          The serum samples were then brought to room temperature. 1 ml
          of the serum was placed into a 10 ml stoppered volumetric
          flask and 1 ml of 3 N HCI was added to it. This mixture was
          then sonicated for 20 minutes to free the boswellic acid. The
          volume of the mixture was then brought to 10 ml with methanol
          and the resulting solution was sonicated for 10 minutes to
          extract the boswellic acids and to precipitate the serum
          proteins. This prepared sample was then transferred into
          capped centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10
          minutes. The serum proteins were precipitated as sediment and
          the clear supernatant was filtered through No. 1 filter paper.<br>
          <br>
          The clear supernatants were then subjected to a HPLC assay,
          the results of which are shown in Figures 2-5. As can be
          plainly seen, the serum with Potassium Boswellin shows that a
          greater amount of boswellic acids have been absorbed by the
          subject's bloodstream, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of
          the present invention.<br>

          The invention relates to a novel and improved nanoparticulate
          form of a frankincense gum extract, containing, inter alia,
          Boswellic acids and/or their derivatives. The nanoparticles
          have advantageous properties for use in the treatment of
          inflammatory diseases. Surprisingly, these advantages are
          obtained both in topical application and oral administration.
          When used in topical formulations, the nanoparticles are
          better absorbed by the skin than are known, tacky extracts,
          and they are thus suitable for the treatment, for example, of
          neurodermatitis and/or actinic keratosis and/or basal cell
          carcinoma and/or epithlioma and/or squamous cell carcinoma of
          the skin. For example, in soft gel capsules that dissolve in
          the small intestine, the nanoparticles have much improved
          bioavailability, which also considerably improves oral
          administration for treatment of inflammatory conditions.
          Finally, the nanoparticles can also be used for coating stents
          and implants.<br>

          thereof.<br>

          The so-called nanoparticles have advantageous properties in
          terms of a use for treating inflammatory diseases.<br>
          Surprisingly these advantages are obtained both for a topical,
          an oral administration as well as a surface coating of
          implants.<br>
          <br>
          The nanoparticles are absorbed better when used in topical
          formulations of the skin known as sticky extracts and thus
          suitable for the treatment of, for example, atopic dermatitis
          and / or actinic keratosis and / or basal cell carcinoma and /
          or squamous and / or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.<br>
          <br>
          For example, in enteric softgels show the olibanum
          nanoparticles significantly improved bioavailability, which
          also improves oral use in the treatment of inflammatory
          conditions significantly.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, Olibanum nanoparticles can also be used for coating
          of implants (vessel joint, bone, tooth) and surgical sutures.<br>

          [0004] state of the art early in oriental folk medicine is the
          use of incense, primarily in India and in the Near East, for
          the treatment of various diseases, especially inflammation and
          rheumatic joint diseases known.<br>
          Even in recent times several medical applications have been
          found for incense or Olibanumextrakte and especially for
          boswellic acids and their derivatives.<br>
          <br>
          Inflammatory responses are measures of the organism, which
          serve to remove the damaging tissue damages by causing foreign
          bodies or the damaged part of the tissue repair and replace
          tissue.<br>
          <br>
          Hence, inflammation is a physiological process.<br>
          <br>
          However, there are a number of situations in which functions
          of organs are disturbed by inflammatory processes, especially
          when they are shooting or chronic.<br>
          <br>
          Inflammation is triggered by the release of so-called
          biochemical mediators of inflammation.<br>
          <br>
          There are two types of different inflammatory mediators that
          are involved in the formation and maintaining inflammatory
          prostaglandins and leukotrienes.<br>
          <br>
          The current therapy of inflammation occurs with drugs that are
          predominantly in a position called the arachidonic acid
          cascade, namely to block the part of the leads to the
          formation of Prostaglandiene.<br>
          <br>
          The drugs used are among the steroidal and non-steroidal
          anti-inflammatory drugs.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs is associated
          with significant side effects.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The anti-inflammatory effect of boswellic acids has
          been repeatedly published (Safayhi, H., et.<br>
          AI, Planta Medica 63, 487-493, 1997. J. Pharmacol. And Exp
          Ther, 261, 1143-46, 1992). Sashwati et al investigated by
          screening the human genome, the genetic basis of the
          anti-inflammatory effect of Boswellia in microvascular
          endothelial cells and found an inhibition of 5 -lipoxygenase,
          a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes. The research
          revealed that 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid is the most
          potent as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor among the boswellic acids.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, the boswellic acids prevented the
          TNF-alpha-induced expression of metalloproteinases and of
          mediators of apoptosis.<br>
          <br>
          It was also the expression of&nbsp; VCAM-1 and ICAM-1
          suppresses Olibanumextrakte.<br>

          This research showed that Olibanumextrakt by influencing the
          mechanisms of inflammation Signalmecha anti-inflammatory
          effect (Sashwati, R., et al, DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY:. VoI 24,

          <br>
          [0010] EP 552 657 A1 discloses that pure boswellic acid, the
          physiologically compatible salts borrowed, derivatives thereof
          and salts of derivatives or a herbal preparation containing
          boswellic acid can fight inflammation, caused by increased
          leukotriene formation.<br>
          <br>
          It is suggested in the treatment of inflammatory joint
          diseases, epidermal lesions, allergic and chronic asthma,

          <br>
          [0017] In summary it can be said that incense and
          Olibanumextrakte is known as a traditional natural remedies or
          medicines to treat various physical and mental conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Because of the versatility of the applicability of the good
          effect coupled with reduced side effects, there is a great
          need to provide Olibanumextrakte in an improved form, and this
          improved formulation for as many applications, such as topical
          and oral administration as well as for coating implants and
          should be suitable for surgical sutures.<br>
          To skin diseases<br>
          <br>
          [0018] In the case of eczema (including atopic dermatitis,
          eczema atopic, eczema diffusa, eczema disseminated, eczema
          constitutionalis, endogenous eczema Besnier-prurigo) is a
          chronic or chronically relapsing, in their morphological
          aspect and overall process quite different types of
          inflammatory skin disease which is accompanied by severe
          itching.<br>
          <br>
          The eczema is hereditary and often occurs together with other
          atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic
          conjunctivitis and allergic bronchial asthma on.<br>
          <br>
          Biochemically is neurodermatitis a fault in the humoral and
          cellular immunity, the infection is associated with a high
          activity of the skin.<br>
          <br>
          The current treatment of these inflammatory skin disorder is
          often performed by means of the external application of
          glucocorticoids in the form of ointments or creams.<br>
          <br>
          This inflammatory activity is indeed reduced, but the
          treatment is associated with significant side effects with
          cortisone.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] The incidence of "light skin cancer," meaning
          Kanzerosen as actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinomas,
          squamous cell carcinomas and squamous fall, takes explosively
          in the temperate latitudes.<br>
          <br>
          The "light skin cancer" is ten times more common than
          melanoma, the skin cancer known as black. Every seven years,
          double the number of cases. One of the causes is sun exposure
          and skin damage caused by UV radiation and the frequent use of
          tanning beds.<br>
          <br>
          The actinic keratoses are now no longer classified as a
          precancerous condition, but as an early cancer.<br>
          Approximately every second German has over 60 years due to
          many years of UV light exposure to actinic keratoses.<br>
          <br>
          Most actinic keratoses persist as long Carinoma in situ,
          whereas 20% show spontaneous remission or develop into
          invasive carcinomas spinozelläre.<br>
          <br>
          There are now following therapeutic options: 1 Surgical
          removal (eg As excision, curettage, cryosurgery), with mostly
          100% remissions are obtained. However, there remain scars and
          surrounding skin areas that were indeed exposed to the same UV
          exposure, remain untreated.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;2 Chemotherapies (eg As 5-fluorouracil or podophyllin)
          reach up to 85% remissions and can be applied areally.<br>
          However, they must be carried out over weeks, are painful and
          can leave scars and pigmentation.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] 3 Photodynamic Therapy: After photosensitization by 5 -
          aminolevulinic acid cream light to destroy the tumor cells.
          Remissions and good cosmetic results can be achieved. For
          this, the procedure is painful phototoxic reactions are
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] 4 Immunomodulators: For example, with imiquimod or
          diclofenac as a cream or gel remissions in up to 80% of cases
          can be achieved and the actinic keratoses can be removed
          without leaving any scars. The treatment is repeated, but it
          takes at least 12 weeks and requires a high level of patient
          compliance.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] In the above-mentioned skin diseases is a high
          inflammatory activity with activation of inflammatory
          mediators, such as prostaglandins and the 5-lipoxygenase. In
          the skin lesions can be as in the basal cell carcinoma,
          squamous and squamous skin cells degenerate prove. By
          antiphlogistic drugs that interfere with the prostaglandin,
          such as diclofenac, remission can be achieved, but these drugs
          are known side effects.<br>
          <br>
          Boswellic acids that occur from Olibanumharz in the extract
          have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and cytostatic
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-inflammatory action based on inhibition of
          5-lipoxygenase, in an essential enzyme for the synthesis of
          leukotrienes (see, for B. Safayhi et al., Mol Pharm 47,
          1212-1216, 1995. Sailer et al, Arch Pharm 329, 54-56, 1996)
          and the inhibition of leukocyte elastase, as described in EP
          854 709th<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, boswellic acids have a cytostatic effect.<br>
          <br>
          It is reported more recently, of chemopreventive and
          therapeutic effects of acetyl-keto-boswellic acids in the
          treatment of various cancers.<br>
          <br>
          This seems to be the inhibition of topoisomerase-1, alpha
          TopoisomeraseIl and induction of apoptosis through activation
          of caspase-3 and -8 play a key role by boswellic acids
          (Jian-Jun Liu, et. AI., Intern. J. of Molecular Medicine 10:.
          501-505, 2002, Shao et al, Planta Medica 64, 328-331, 1998).
          These effects appear to be suitable as boswellic acids for
          treatment of tumors, as described in EP 871 437<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Treatment of inflammatory and malignant skin diseases
          Olibanumextrakten and / or boswellic acids and derivatives
          thereof is generally known in the prior art. However, arises
          with the topical use of the extracts, the problem that they
          are typically sticky and thus have the property not to be
          absorbed by the skin and therefore can not operate in the
          deeper skin layers.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] There is therefore a need, extracts of frankincense in
          a form more available for topical applications to provide that
          optimally penetrate into the skin to the skin in order to be
          pharmacologically active either topically or systemically.<br>
          <br>
          <b> Vascular disease</b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b><br>
          [0026] Atherosclerosis is the cause of heart attacks, strokes
          and peripheral vascular occlusive disease of the extremities
          and is a chronic inflammatory fibroproliferative disease of
          the arterial wall, which is associated with an impaired immune
          response.<br>
          <br>
          Inflammatory processes, the inner wall of arteries, the
          intima, disturbed in their integrity and particularly loaded
          vessel sections, for example on vessel bifurcations occur
          injuries and lacerations of the intima.<br>
          Inflammatory cells in the lesions themselves are deposited as
          monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and
          neutrophils.<br>
          Mast cells are transformed by taking up oxidized low-density
          lipoproteins (LDL) in foam cells and to form the "lipid core"
          of the so-called plaques, inflammatory ulcers in the vessel
          wall.<br>
          Reduce by chronic inflammation with activation of
          metalloproteinases, enzymes, connective tissue and collagen,
          the connective tissue sheath layer of the plaques is injured
          and the lipid-containing core of the plaques come in contact
          with the coagulation system of the blood, it forms very
          quickly Gerinnungspfropf which closes the vessel .<br>
          This process occurs in a coronary artery that supplied by the
          vascular portion of the heart muscle dies from lack of oxygen.
          A heart attack is the result. Atherosclerotic processes in the
          brain that trigger strokes.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] The inflammation of the vessel wall are activated by
          inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and
          leukotrienes released. Leukotrienes are formed via the
          5-lipoxygenase cascade of inflammation. It has been shown that
          5-lipoxygenase expressed in increasing concentrations at
          various stages of atherosclerosis in the arterial wall
          (Spanbroek, R.; PNAS, Vol 100, No. 3, 1238-1243, 2003). The
          authors proposed a new model of atherosclerosis in which
          mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase inflammatory activity in the
          vessel wall is the cause of the progression of atherosclerotic
          lesions.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Inflammatory markers in the blood of patients with
          atherosclerosis have elevated levels of C-reactive protein,
          interleukin 116, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a
          reduced antioxidant capacity, increased lipid peroxidation and
          increased homocysteine ??concentrations.<br>
          In the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease with
          statins, that lipid-lowering drugs, in addition to a reduction
          of the anti-inflammatory effects LDLCholesterinspiegels a
          reduction was observed with the C-reactive protein
          concentration.<br>
          This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in the
          risk of sudden cardiac death and stroke and the significant
          decrease in the lipid core forming lipoproteins (LDL) and
          inflammatory activity has been attributed.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] The treatment of atherosclerosis, coronary heart
          disease is classically with medications such as statins,
          beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and acetylsalicylic acid, which
          all require considerable side effects.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Olibanumextrakte point, as explained in detail above,
          anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects on cytostatic,
          which is also known from the prior art.<br>
          These effects make the extracts useful in the treatment of
          inflammatory processes and vascular proliferative diseases,
          arteriosclerosis, and side effects of conventional drugs can
          be avoided.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] However, there is a need, extracts of frankincense in a
          more bioavailable form for oral administration to provide.
          implants<br>
          <br>
          [0032] As an example, stents: percutaneous transluminal
          angioplasty (PTA) of blood vessels, especially the coronary
          artery angioplasty (PTCA) is a very common way to eliminate
          strictures or stenoses, which obstruct the blood supply of
          human organs.<br>
          <br>
          Endovascular stents are used as a scaffold in order to prevent
          a sudden arterial occlusion in the angioplasty.<br>
          Stents may also reduce the restenosis rates as compared with a
          conventional balloon angioplasty.<br>
          <br>
          Restenosis after stent implantation, however, provide at rates
          20-30% remains a Problern in coronary arteries dar.<br>
          Restenosis is the result of massive blood vessel damage with
          induction of inflammation and endothelial cell proliferation
          stimuli for the use of a stent.<br>
          <br>
          Rates of restenosis following stent implantation are also from
          the stent design and material dependent.<br>
          From WO 90/13332 and WO 91/12779 stent has become known, which
          are coated with anti-inflammatory drugs gerinnungsund to
          reduce restenosis rates.<br>
          <br>
          The erfolgversprechensten drugs that may reduce restenosis
          rates effective agents include rapamycin (sirolimus (R)) and
          paclitacel (Taxol (R)).<br>
          <br>
          [0033] Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic which has both
          anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties.<br>
          It prevents smooth muscle cell proliferation and reduces the
          inflammatory response induced by stent implantation by
          inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (Suzuki et al.,
          Circulation 104 (10), 1188-1193, 2001).<br>
          <br>
          [0034] One of the disadvantages of the currently discussed
          eluting stents is the delayed epithelialization of the stent
          inner surface, so that the antithrombotic therapy to prevent
          must be in-stent thrombosis significantly prolonged time.
          There is thus a need to provide an alternative means which is
          suitable to coat stents.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] The object of the invention is therefore to provide
          Olibanumextrakt in a form which can be used in pharmaceutical
          and / or cosmetic and / or for the coating of the implant
          surface, and thereby improves the corresponding means.<br>
          <br>
          This improvement should be guaranteed for different
          application forms such as topical and oral administration.<br>
          In the area of ??topical application is to be achieved in that
          the or can be absorbed by the skin, the active compounds of
          the Olibanumextrakts better.<br>
          <br>
          In the oral administration of Olibanumextrakt the active
          ingredient to be more bioavailable.<br>
          <br>
          In the application for the coating of surfaces of implant
          treatment of vascular disease is to be provided for example by
          means of a stent in the form Olibanumextrakt within which
          makes the coating of the stent with the active compound or
          compounds of Olibanumextrakt possible.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] These objects are achieved by the subject matter of the
          claims.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] Surprisingly it was found that Olibanumextrakte in
          nanoparticulate form are perfectly suitable, on the one hand
          in formulations for topical administration and the other in
          formulations for oral administration significantly improve
          their properties.<br>
          <br>
          When applied topically, the active ingredient (or active
          ingredients) is much better absorbed by the skin than is the
          case with the use of conventional extracts.<br>
          <br>
          For oral administration, preferably in enteric soft gel
          capsules, the bioavailability of the active substance (or
          substances) is considerably improved.<br>
          <br>
          It was also found that Olibanumextrakte in nanoparticulate
          form are an excellent way to coat implants such as stents or
          other (port system, joint prostheses, Herzschrittmaeher,
          dental pins, screws, plates, Kirschner wires).<br>
          <br>
          Also has been found out that surgical sutures (eg As
          polyethylene), and indwelling indwelling, vascular catheters
          can be coated with Olibanumextrakt-Nanopartikenl.<br>
          <br>
          The devices mentioned can cause foreign body reactions in the
          human body, which may be associated with inflammation and even
          with Granulombildungen.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, it has been found that the coating of the device
          with OlibanumNanopartikeln prevent foreign body reaction or
          can be counteracted.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, it has proved advantageous to add as additive to
          Olibanumextrakt storage solutions for biological materials in
          nanoparticulate form.<br>
          <br>
          These can be used in transport solutions for organs, as used
          for example in organ transplantation.<br>
          [0038] Olibanumextrakt can be obtained by, for example,
          ethanol, methanol, ether or chloroform extraction extraction
          of resin of olibanum. Preferably, such extracts are
          lipophilic.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention

          Optionally, the hydrogenation of incense, and the
          physiologically acceptable salts and derivatives, as well as
          hydrogenated Olibanumextrakte can be used.<br>

          salts of the boswellic acids, derivatives of boswellic acids,
          herbal preparations containing boswellic acid or
          acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid ss-containing plant extracts.<br>
          Also suitable are hydrogenation products of other ingredients
          of the incense, such as from the other Tirucallensäure or
          triterpenoid compounds, salts or derivatives thereof as well
          as plant extracts containing these compounds.<br>
          According to the invention are suitable as an additive
          continue the hydrogenation of acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid or
          ss-ss-11-keto-boswellic acid or ss-boswellic acid, the latter
          may contain small amounts of alpha or gammaBoswelliasäure.<br>
          <br>
          Also suitable are hydrogenation of ss-boswellic acid,
          Boswelliasäureformiat ss, ss-boswellic acid,
          acetyl-ss-boswellic acid, but also of the boswellic acids and
          derivatives of boswellic acids, which are described in DE-A 42
          01 903, of which reference is made to the will.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] boswellic acids, in particular acetyl-11-keto-boswellic
          ss can, in a known manner to be obtained from boswellic
          acid-containing plants.<br>
          <br>
          Suitable Boswelliaarten are: Boswellia serrata, Boswellia
          carteri, Boswellia sacra, Boswellia papyrifera, Boswellia

          The compounds useful according to the invention can be
          obtained by hydrogenation, preferably by catalytic
          hydrogenation.<br>
          <br>
          The hydrogenation of these compounds is carried out in a
          manner known in the art, preferably so that the backbone of
          the compound is selectively hydrogenated.<br>
          <br>
          Such a method is described for example in WO 02 / 15916th<br>

          extraction, ether extraction, or obtained may be used.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] The Olibanumextrakte used in the invention include, in
          particular ss-boswellic acid and / or acetyl-ss-boswellic acid
          and / or acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and / or
          11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and optionally with acetyl-11-
          beta.-keto-boswellic acid at levels higher than the natural
          content enriched.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] In accordance with the invention physiologically
          acceptable salts, especially the sodium, potassium, ammonium,
          magnesium and calcium salts of the above compounds are
          understood.<br>
          <br>
          Derivatives such as in particular Ci-C6 - alkyl esters of
          Dihydroboswelliasäure understood, in which the carboxyl group
          of the Dihydroboswelliasäure was esterified with a
          corresponding alcohol.<br>
          <br>
          Such Dihydroboswelliasäurealkylester are for example the
          methyl ester, ethyl ester, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl,
          iso-butyl esters and the tertButylester
          Dihydroboswelliasäuren.<br>
          <br>
          It is also possible that the hydroxyl group of the
          Dihydroboswelliasäure is esterified with a physiologically
          acceptable carboxylic acid, for B. a dbis C2o, in particular
          having a CRC8 carboxylic acid, in particular formic acid or
          acetic acid.<br>
          <br>
          Herbal preparations that can be used for the preparation of
          the novel Olibanumextrakte are commercially available, for
          example from the company PL-Thomas, New Jersey under the name
          5-Loxin (TM).<br>
          This is a standardized Olibanumextrakt of Boswellia serrata,
          at least 30% of the acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid contains.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] According to the invention, however, can also
          Olibanumextrakte and their hydrogenation products are used by
          other preparations, in particular according to the invention
          can also hydrogenation synthetically manufactured or natural
          way derived ingredients of incense, especially
          acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and / or 11 -
          beta.-keto-boswellic acid and / or ss-boswellic acid,
          optionally in admixture with a-und/oder yBoswelliasäure and /
          or several of the derivatives according to the invention are
          preferably used the boswellic acid, as described above, to

          <br>
          [0048] According to the invention, the medicament in addition
          to the herein defined, based on incense ingredients or other
          active ingredients, especially other herbal ingredients
          contained.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] According to the invention is brought into a
          nanoparticulate form with one or more of the optional
          additives described above, the Olibanumextrakt.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the nanoparticles have a size in the range of 30
          to 400 nm, preferably 60 to 200 nm, more preferably from 100
          to 200 nm.<br>

          Those skilled in the art will vary depending on use of the
          medicine anvisierter known per se and suitably produce
          nanoparticles.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] Since the Olibanumextrakt, especially the hydrogenated
          Olibanumextrakt and especially the hydrogenated boswellic
          acids and their derivatives and salts have a very low
          toxicity, their compatibility is generally good.<br>
          Your dosage can be easily selected by the treating physician
          according to the severity of the condition being treated and
          other factors such as the duration of the disease, possible
          known incompatibilities of the patient's general condition of
          the patient, etc..<br>
          <br>
          The drug according to the invention can be formulated so that
          it is in unit doses one or more times daily, in particular
          mono-to four times a day can be administered.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] For topical application, the inventive nanoparticles
          can be incorporated into dermatocosmetic ointment bases, which
          can be applied several times daily to the affected skin.<br>
          <br>
          The inventive pharmaceutical compositions may be, for example,
          in solid, semisolid, or liquid form.<br>
          Suitable creams, ointments, gels, lotions, etc.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] For oral administration come into consideration
          tablets, granules, capsules, solutions, etc., which include
          pharmaceutically acceptable additives in addition to the
          invention nanoparticles.<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, the pharmaceutical compositions may be in a
          manner known in the art as liquid compositions for oral
          administration.<br>
          <br>
          Preference for oral administration enteric softgels are thin.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] The invention is not to be bound by the following
          statement, but probably have the novel nanoparticles of the
          active substance (or substances) in enteric softgels to a
          significantly improved bioavailability, since the
          nanoparticles probably similar transport mechanisms in the
          intestine as the Phosphatidylcholinmatrix triglycerides are
          absorbed via chylomicrons.<br>
          <br>
          Other examples of suitable formulations and methods for their
          preparation can be found in DE-A 44 44 288 and DE-A 44 45 728,
          to the extent fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>

          According to the international medical literature, it comes
          with the conventional stent within the first six months in 30%
          of cases a stent closure or to an in-stent stenosis.<br>
          <br>
          For nanoparticles coated with the inventive stent is a high
          probability that this closure rate can be significantly
          reduced.<br>
