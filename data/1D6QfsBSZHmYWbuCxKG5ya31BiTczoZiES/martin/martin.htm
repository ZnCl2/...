      To the great consternation of the scientific world, Morley Martin
      succeeded in creating organic life forms in inert Precambrian
      azoic rock! He proved that there is no death, only latency, and
      that life is not special to this planet but is a spontaneous
      universal phenomenon. Dr. Littlefield demonstrated life-forming
      activity in the mineral realm, with life actually emerging from
      ‘dead’ rock! While crystallizing inorganic substances, he
      described many organic forms imprinted into ‘inert’ substances.
      Includes documentation on Andrew Crosse’s extraordinary
      experiments where spider-like insects were created from ‘inert’
      volcanic pumice, after being treated with galvanic currents. Learn

      <br>
      A New concept appears in physics, the most important invention
      since Newton's time: The field. It needed great scientific
      imagination to realize that it is not the charges nor the
      particles but the field in space between the charges and the
      particles which is essential for the description of physical
      phenomena....<br>
      <br>
      In the beginning, the field concept was no more than a means of
      facilitating the understanding of phenomena from the mechanical
      point of view.... The recognition of the new concept grew
      steadily, until substance was overshadowed by the field. It was
      realized that something of great importance had happened in
      physics. A new reality was created, a new concept for which there
      was no place in the mechanical description. Slowly and by a
      struggle the field concept established for itself a leading place
      in physics and has remained as one of the basic physical concepts.
      The electromagnetic field is, for the modern physicist, as real as
      the chair on which he sits.(1)&nbsp; --ALBERT EINSTEIN.<br>
      <br>
      AGAIN, physics has pointed out the way to biology. "Field
      physics," Dr. H. S. Burr, anatomist of Yale University, told the
      National Academy of Sciences in an address in April of last year,
      "centers theory and experimentation upon the medium in which the
      system as a whole is imbedded and upon its structure." The
      physical doctrine of the field, together with certain facts of
      embryology, Dr. Burr said, caused him and his colleague, Dr. F. S.
      C. Northrop, Yale professor of Philosophy,(2) to formulate the
      "electro-dynamic theory of life." In 1935, the anatomist, Dr.
      Burr, working with a physicist, Dr. Cecil T. Lane, and a
      physiologist, Dr. Leslie F. Nims, all of Yale, developed an
      instrument capable of measuring electrical changes in the body as
      small as five-millionths of a volt. With this sensitive device
      they studied the subtle electrical variations which accompany all
      growth processes and physiological changes. In November, 1936,
      Waldemar Kaempffert, science editor of the New York Times,
      reported on the early experiments with the "vacuum-tube
      microvoltmeter," as the measuring instrument is called. He wrote:<br>
      <br>
      Thousands of tests already made show that living creatures all
      generate electricity in measurable amounts and that each species
      has its characteristic, rather stable electrical pattern. The
      pattern changes minutely and thus reflects variations in the
      process of living....<br>
      <br>
      They [Drs. Burr and Northrop] saw that living things are amazingly
      constant. Flesh is cut open and bleeds and heals; tissues fall a
      prey to disease but cure themselves. Somehow the integrity of the
      whole organism is never lost.<br>
      <br>
      No one knows why this should be so. In the field, thinks Prof.
      Burr, may lie the causative factor that gives meaning to the unity
      of nature and that explains why wholes tend to remain wholes and
      atoms to form wholes, whether bits of wood or men....<br>
      <br>
      Some years hence it may turn out that this instrument has revealed
      a crucial element or pattern in the design of living things. So it
      will be possible to explain how an animal grows from a single egg
      into a complex man with arms, legs, a brain and heart, and
      possible, also, to explain how the chromosomes in the cell
      determine why our faces are what they are and why eyes are blue,
      brown or black. In a word, "animal electricity," scoffed at since
      Galvani's time, may manifest itself as life.(3)<br>
      <br>
      In April, 1939 -- something less than three "years hence" -- Drs.
      Burr and Northrop presented the epoch-making results of their
      research, and the conclusion: "The simplest assumption with which
      to explain all the evidence so far gathered is that of the
      existence in the living organism of an electro-dynamic field."
      This field, Dr. Burr added, is the "true" architect of the
      organism.(4) Following are some of the findings of the Yale
      experiments, as reported in the press:<br>
      <br>
      In the growing embryo, the electrical pattern develops hand in
      hand with the development of the whole organism. All else in the
      body undergoes constant change; the individual cells of which the
      body is made, excepting the germ cells, grow old and die, to be
      replaced by other cells, but the electrical architect remains the
      only constant throughout life, building new cells and organizing
      them after the same pattern of the original cells, and thus, in a
      literal sense, recreating the body....<br>
      <br>
      The experimental evidence shows, according to Dr. Burr, that each
      species of animal and very likely also the individuals within the
      species have their characteristic electrical field, analogous to
      the lines of force in a magnet. This electric field, having its
      own pattern, fashions all the protoplasmic clay of life that comes
      within its sphere of influence after its image, thus personifying
      itself in the living flesh as the sculptor personifies his idea in
      stone....<br>
      <br>
      The Yale scientists have succeeded in revealing the master
      architect at work, and even to catch the first outlines of his
      configuration in space, showing him to be in absolute control of
      the organism as a whole and of its parts, and at all times
      correlating the workings of the parts with the whole.(5)<br>
      <br>
      According to another account of the Yale investigations:<br>
      <br>
      Electrical potentials in the living body build up at an extremely
      rapid rate when it is in the embryonic state and during the first
      third of the life span. Measurements made on mice indicated, Dr.
      Burr said, that the electrical potentials increased during the
      first third of life, remained stationary during the middle third
      and then declined during the latter third.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical potentials are found in the human body as well as
      in the lower animals and their alterations from normal indicates
      fundamental changes taking place in the body.(6)<br>
      <br>
      In the light of these researches, it is safe for the theosophist
      to conclude that the "field" concept will one day replace
      altogether the mechanical theories of modern biologists in their
      attempts to solve the mystery of form. Particle physics is now
      subordinated to field physics. We may look forward to a future
      time when the "particle" biology of chemo-physical theory will
      yield to concentrated study of the "fields" of life.<br>
      <br>
      The vital forces which become manifest within these fields are but
      the tools and final means for the accomplishment of the purposes
      of Nature, acting periodically, and apparently mechanically in
      some respects, through an inward impulse mixed up with, but beyond
      their material nature. The key to understanding biological field
      phenomena is given by H. P. Blavatsky. She wrote in The Secret
      Doctrine in 1888:<br>
      <br>
      There is a purpose in every important act of Nature, whose acts
      are all cyclic and periodical. But spiritual Forces having been
      usually confused with the purely physical, the former are denied
      by, and therefore, have to remain unknown to Science, because left
      unexamined. Men of science will say: We deny, because nothing of
      the kind has ever come within the scope of our experience. But, as
      argued by Charles Richet, the physiologist: "So be it, but have
      you at least demonstrated the contrary? ... Do not, at any rate,
      deny a priori. Actual Science is not sufficiently advanced to give
      you such right."(7)<br>
      <br>
      While "spiritual Forces," scientists may say, are beyond our ken,
      it is impossible for modern biology to deny, in the face of its
      own data, that abundant evidence of the forces called astral in
      Theosophy is now within the scope of scientific experience. A
      statement from William Q. Judge will be found to integrate the new
      biological knowledge of form far better than any of the current
      scientific hypotheses. According to The Ocean of Theosophy,
      published in 1893:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;...the astral body precedes the material one.<br>
      <br>
      The astral body is made of matter of very fine texture as compared
      with the visible body, and has a great tensile strength, so that
      it changes but little during a lifetime, while the physical alters
      every moment.... The matter of which it is composed is electrical
      and magnetic in its essence,...<br>
      <br>
      The astral body is the guiding model for the physical one, and all
      the other kingdoms have the same astral model. Vegetables,
      minerals, and animals have the ethereal double, and this theory is
      the only one which will answer the question how it is that the
      seed produces its own kind and all sentient beings bring forth
      their like. Biologists can only say that the facts are as we know
      them, but can give no reason why the acorn will never grow
      anything but an oak except that no man ever knew it to be
      otherwise....<br>
      <br>
      ...the model for the growing child in the womb is the astral body
      already perfect in shape before the child is born. It is on this
      the molecules arrange themselves until the child is complete, and
      the presence of the ethereal design-body will explain how the form
      grows into shape, how the eyes push themselves out from within to
      the surface of the face, and many other mysterious matters in
      embryology which are passed over by medical men with a description
      but with no explanation. This will also explain, as nothing else
      can, the cases of marking of the child in the womb, sometimes
      denied by physicians but well known by those who care to watch, to
      be a fact of frequent occurrence. The growing physical form is
      subject to the astral model; it is connected with the imagination
      of the mother by physical and psychical organs; the mother makes a
      strong picture from horror, fear, or otherwise, and the astral
      model is then similarly affected. In the case of marking by being
      born legless, the ideas and strong imagination of the mother act
      so as to cut off or shrivel up the astral leg, and the result is
      that the molecules, having no model of leg to work on, make no
      physical leg whatever; and similarly in all such cases. But where
      we find a man who still feels the leg which the surgeon has cut
      off, or perceives the fingers that were amputated, then the astral
      member has not been interfered with, and hence the man feels as if
      it were still on his person. For knife or acid will not injure the
      astral model, but in the first stages of its growth ideas and
      imagination have the power of acid and sharpened steel.(8)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking together the discoveries at Yale and the
      facts of development in embryonic growth and in regeneration, it
      seems just to say that modern biology acknowledges an
      electro-magnetic principle of formation which guides the
      differentiation of the organism. This principle, whether it be
      called "morphogenetic field," "organizer," or "metastructure," is
      the astral body of Theosophic teaching. When a biologist speaks of
      the development of organs as "the expression of an already
      existing but invisible structural organization," he describes the
      nature and function of the astral body in almost the same words as
      those used by Mr. Judge.<br>
      <br>
      The next step, obviously, is a recognition of the relation between
      thought and all patterns of form, which would make thorough-going
      Platonic realists of scientific investigators. The phenomena of
      development are scientifically as well as philosophically
      inexplicable without some conception of noumenal forms. The world
      of noumena, however -- the world of Ideas as causes -- is for
      modern scientists unknown, unconsidered, and save in a few
      exceptional instances, wholly unsuspected. That is the reason why
      the facts which support the Theosophical teachings on this phase
      of the subject are ignored by the workers in research. The facts
      are there, but they confirm no current theory and upset
      materialistic preconceptions; hence, they receive no attention.<br>
      <br>
      Mind can, visibly, mold the form of matter, and those desiring to
      investigate thoroughly this occult proposition should read Isis
      Unveiled.(9) Here, as a striking single instance of the power of
      the mother's imagination over the physical form of her unborn
      infant, a recent wonder of the medical world may be cited. In
      Manila, on August 7 of last year, a child was born with its heart
      exposed on the outside of its chest. The heart was abnormal in
      size, and was covered only with a thin, transparent layer of
      pericardial tissue, making the entire organ clearly visible. The
      hope that an operation might place the heart in its normal bodily
      cavity had to be abandoned because X-ray photographs showed that
      no cavity existed. Why was the heart outside the body, and why did
      the growing embryo provide no normal cavity? This extraordinary
      malformation is absolutely without explanation from the medical
      point of view, but is easily understood in the light of Theosophy.
      According to a United Press dispatch, the mother was a devout
      Catholic, a Filipino woman who had been bed-ridden for three
      months prior to the child's birth. During that time she gazed
      constantly at two pictures on the wall, one of the Virgin Mary,
      the other of Jesus Christ with heart exposed!<br>
      <br>
      In Isis Unveiled, H. P. Blavatsky quotes from Dr. Henry More's
      Immortality of the Soul (1659) to show the potency of the human
      mind on the subtle forces of nature. She says:<br>
      <br>
      The author, Dr. More, views the foetus as if it were a plastic
      substance, which can be fashioned by the mother to an agreeable or
      disagreeable shape, to resemble some person or in part several
      persons, and to be stamped with the effigies, or as we might more
      properly call it, the astrograph, of some object vividly presented
      to her imagination. These effects may be produced by her
      voluntarily or involuntarily, consciously or unconsciously, feebly
      or forcibly, as the case may be. It depends upon her ignorance or
      knowledge of the profound mysteries of nature.(10)<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the mother can control the appearance of her unborn
      child was so well known among the ancients that it was the custom
      among wealthy Greeks to place fine statues near the bed, so that
      she might have a perfect model constantly before her eyes. The
      laws governing this process are described in Isis Unveiled. In
      illustration of the principle to be detailed, H.P.B. cites the
      case of a boy who was killed by lightning. Upon stripping his
      body, she says, "there was found imprinted upon his breast the
      faithful picture of a tree which grew near the window which he was
      facing at the time of the catastrophe, and which was also felled
      by the lightning."(11) This electrical photography furnishes an
      analogy by which we may understand how the mental images of the
      mother are transmitted to the unborn child. H.P.B. explains:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;...a pregnant woman is physically and mentally in a highly
      impressible state.... her intellectual faculties are weakened, and
      ... she is affected to an unusual degree by the most trifling
      events.... Her pores are opened; she exudes an odic emanation
      which is but another form of the akasa, the electricity, or
      life-principle,... Magnetic currents develop themselves into
      electricity upon their exit from the body. An object making a
      violent impression on the mother's mind, its image is instantly
      projected into the astral light, or the universal ether,... the
      repository of the spiritual images of all forms, and even human
      thoughts. Her magnetic emanations attract and unite themselves
      with the descending current which already bears the image upon it.
      It rebounds, and re-percussing more or less violently, impresses
      itself upon the foetus, according to the very formula of
      physiology which shows how every maternal feeling reacts on the
      offspring.... As Phidias, gathering together the loose particles
      of clay and moistening them with water, could give plastic shape
      to the sublime idea evoked by his creative faculty, so the mother
      who knows her power can fashion the coming child into whatever
      form she likes. Ignorant of his powers, the sculptor produces only
      an inanimate though ravishing figure of inert matter; while the
      soul of the mother, violently affected by her imagination, blindly
      projects into the astral light an image of the object which
      impressed it, and, by re-percussion, that is stamped upon the
      foetus.(12)<br>
      <br>
      This law explains not only cases of the marking or malformation of
      unborn children, but also the stigmata which sometimes appear on
      the bodies of religious enthusiasts who think much of the
      sufferings of Christ. Nearly one hundred cases of stigmatization
      are reviewed in the Encyclopedia Britannica (11th edition), most
      of which have occurred among residents in religious houses, after
      the austerities of Lent, usually on Good Friday. In modern times
      there is the case of Theresa Neumann, of Konnersreuth, Germany,
      whose wounds on hand, foot, and brow have been acknowledged as
      genuine, and without medical explanation, by such eminent
      physicians as Baron Doctor von Aretin.(13)<br>
      <br>
      If deviations from the normal, as in the case of the malformation
      of children, can thus be shown to be the result of thought, then
      it is natural to conclude that the normal is likewise a reflection
      of idea. This is the universal principle on which Theosophical
      explanation of all forms is based. In the words of H.P.B.:<br>
      <br>
      There can be no objective form on Earth (nor in the Universe
      either), without its astral prototype being first formed in Space.
      From Phidias down to the humblest workman in the ceramic art -- a
      sculptor has had to create first of all a model in his mind, then
      sketch it in one and two dimensional lines, and then only can he
      reproduce it in a three dimensional or objective figure. And if
      human mind is a living demonstration of such successive stages in
      the process of evolution -- how can it be otherwise when NATURE'S
      MIND and creative powers are concerned?(14)<br>
      <br>
      It is at this point that occult science must part company with
      lagging pedestrian follower, modern empirical research, for where
      is the "experiment" that will be accepted as proving the formative
      power of the mind in nature? To the unprejudiced eye, all nature
      itself is such a demonstration, incomprehensible except on the
      theory that every form unfolds from an ideal existence on higher
      planes, but to the scientific mind, schooled in the study of
      minute particulars, this evidence is far too "universal" to be
      admitted. And because the universal proposition is denied, such
      particular instances of the process as are available for
      scientific examination have been uniformly ignored, from the day
      of Paracelsus to the present century.<br>
      <br>
      "Spontaneous generation" is the phrase used by science to describe
      the hypothetical origin of forms of life on earth. Thomas Huxley,
      in an address intended to show that the emergence of living forms
      from so-called "inanimate" matter had not been demonstrated to his
      satisfaction, nevertheless affirmed his own philosophic faith in
      "the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter."(15)
      But whenever a scientist has described experiments which seem to
      demonstrate the reality of this process, he has been totally
      ignored. The Scientific American for August 12, 1868, reported the
      production of acari by Andrew Crosse, of England, in the following
      manner:<br>
      <br>
      Black flint burned to redness and reduced to powder was mixed with
      carbonate of potash, and exposed to a strong heat for fifteen
      minutes; and the mixture was poured into a blacklead crucible in
      an air furnace. It was reduced to powder while warm, mixed with
      boiling water; kept boiling for some minutes, and then
      hydrochloric acid was added to supersaturation. After being
      exposed to voltaic action for twenty-six days, a perfect insect of
      the acari tribe made its appearance, and in the course of a few
      weeks about a hundred more. The experiment was repeated with other
      chemical fluids with like results.(16)<br>
      <br>
      A French scientist of the same period, Antonie Béchamp, on whose
      researches Pasteur rose to fame, described observations of similar
      import, and the English physician, H. Charlton Bastian, performed
      experiments showing that various microscopic organisms -- Bacilli,
      Bacteria, Vibriones, Torulae and other fungus germs -- will appear
      in sterile colloidal solutions after the latter have been
      variously treated.(17) Whence these forms? Either they are
      miracles having no natural explanation or they represent types
      which pre-existed on the astral plane. "Spontaneous generation" is
      simply an expression concealing modern scientific ignorance of the
      process by which astral prototypes pass into objective physical
      existence. According to The Secret Doctrine, "there are precise
      domains wherein the astral merges into physical evolution,"(18)
      and although "spontaneous generation has changed its methods now,
      owing perhaps to accumulated material on hand, so as to almost
      escape detection, it was in full swing in the genesis of
      terrestrial life."(19) H.P.B. says further:<br>
      <br>
      Astral matter, it must be noted, is fourth state matter, having,
      like our gross matter, its own "protyle." There are several
      "protyles" in Nature, corresponding to the various planes of
      matter. The two sub-physical elemental kingdoms, the plane of mind
      (manas, the fifth state matter), as also that of Buddhi (sixth
      state matter), are each and all evolved from one of the six
      "protyles" which constitute the basis of the Object-Universe. The
      three "states," so-called of our terrestrial matter, known as the
      "solid," "liquid," and "gaseous," are only, in strict accuracy,
      SUB-states. As to the former reality of the descent into the
      physical, which culminated in physiological man and animal, we
      have a palpable testimony in the fact of the so-called
      spiritualistic "materializations."<br>
      <br>
      In all these instances a complete temporary mergence of the astral
      into the physical takes place.(20)<br>
      <br>
      Most astonishing of all the modern clues to the "mind" of Nature
      are the discoveries of an English biochemist, Mr. Morley-Martin,
      who died in 1938.(21) He reduced a piece of azoic rock to cinders
      and slag by heating it to 2000-3000 degrees Fahrenheit in an
      electric furnace. This material was then treated further in a
      steam-sterilizer, a new substance being obtained which Mr.
      Morley-Martin called "primordial protoplasm." In crystal form, the
      latter was observed to give off a liquid which spread throughout
      the container. When the container and its contents were exposed to
      X-rays and ultra-violet rays, the crystals condensed, releasing
      numerous organisms of microscopic dimensions. The formation of
      multitudes of tiny fish, insects and plants was watched through a
      microscope of magnifying power of two or three thousand diameters.
      Perfect sterility was claimed by Morley-Martin for the conditions
      of his experiments. The results, in the words of Maeterlinck, led
      the biochemist to believe "that he had proved that life is
      immortal, universal, indestructible, and that the idea, the image
      or the prototype exists prior to that which we know as matter."<br>
      <br>
      It seems evident that Morley-Martin hit upon a means of peering
      into the Anima Mundi,(22) or of establishing under laboratory
      control some transitional state between the astral and the
      physical on a microscopic or germinal scale.(23) The forms
      produced from the piece of azoic rock included tiny replicas of
      creatures of the archaic past, particularly sea animals. Under the
      observer's eye they live, move and consume the mother-protoplasm
      from which they were born, and devour each other. In the one-inch
      circle of microscopic observation, Morley-Martin counted some
      15,000 tiny fish -- apparently the offspring of about forty
      crystals of his "primordial protoplasm." They were indeed
      immortal, for if placed in the electric furnace and reduced to
      ashes they would afterward emerge from the residue and reorganize
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Morley-Martin's philosophical conclusions are summarized by
      Maeterlinck:<br>
      <br>
      According to Morley-Martin, the creatures which he awoke from
      their immemorial slumber are the reincarnations of a specific and
      eternal force. Life is not the expression of the organism, but, on
      the contrary, the organism is the expression of some prior and
      indestructible vital force. Nothing ever dies, and even if it
      should be assimilated by the vegetable kingdom, animal life
      maintains its identity and its capacity for self-resurrection.
      Life's opposite is not death, but latency. Indeed, one is
      compelled to conclude that man himself is latent in the earth's
      rock. The portion of life that manifests itself bodily is
      negligible beside that which remains uncorporeal.... one is
      compelled to ask whether all humanity, past and future is not
      imprisoned in latent form in the rocks and sands of our
      terrestrial sphere.(24)<br>
      <br>
      We have only to quote in comparison a statement from The Secret
      Doctrine to see how curiously exact is this materialized
      reflection of the occult doctrine. H.P.B. wrote:<br>
      <br>
      Everything that is, was, and will be, eternally IS, even the
      countless forms, which are finite and perishable only in their
      objective, not in their ideal Form. They existed as Ideas, in the
      Eternity,(*26) and, when they pass away, will exist as
      reflections. Neither the form of man, nor that of any animal,
      plant or stone has ever been created, and it is only on this plane
      of ours that it commenced "becoming," i.e., objectivising into its
      present materiality, or expanding from within outwards, from the
      most sublimated and supersensuous essence into its grossest
      appearance.(25)<br>

      </b>...In 1927 in his private laboratory in Andover, the
      Englishman Morley martin took a piece of Archeozoic rock and
      subjected it to a process of calcination until it was reduced to
      ashes: from these ashes via a secret and complicated chemical
      process, he extracted a certain quantity of primordial protoplasm.
      Carefully avoiding any contact with the surrounding air, Martin
      subjected the substance to X-rays and slowly witnessed the
      emergence on the optic field of an incredible quantity of living
      microscopic animals and vegetables and above all small fish. In a
      few squared centimetres, the researcher succeeded in counting
      fifteen thousand minute fish.<br>
      <br>
      This obviously meant that these organisms had remained in a latent
      life-state for billions of years from the Archeozoic era until
      1927. This dismaying discovery was published in a pamphlet
      entitled ‘The Reincarnation of Animal and Plant Life from
      Protoplasm Isolated from the Mineral Kingdom‘ (1934). To this
      discovery the writer Maurice Maeterlinck dedicated a chapter of
      his book ‘La Grande Porte‘ (1939). Nowadays, the booklet of Martin
      is almost impossible to find but one is able to read a description
      of this remarkable experiment in the Maeterlinck volume:<br>
      <br>
      Grown in size under the lens of the microscope, one could glimpse
      the appearance of certain globules inside the protoplasm: several
      vertebrae were formed in these globules, these then formed a
      column in which there clearly appears the member, the head and the
      eyes. Usually such transformations took place very slowly
      requiring days but at times they would take place under the eyes
      of the observers. A crustacean, for example, hardly had it
      developed its legs would leave the microscopic field and
      disappear. These living forms move at times and grow as long as
      they find sufficient nutrition in the protoplasm that has given
      birth to them. Afterwards, they either stop growing or else devour
      each other. Morley Martin has, however, succeeded in keeping them
      alive thanks to a secret serum of his...<b><br>

      No form of life is extinguished. Nothing dies and the identity of
      animal life survives even after assimilation in plant where it can
      be awakened. The opposite of life is not death, but latency. The
      man is latent in rock.<br>
      <br>
      Strange character William Morley Martin, whom Maurice Maeterlinck
      devoted a chapter of his book The Great Gate in 1939. After living
      16 Penryn Street, Redruth, in Cornwall, and worked as a chemist
      metallurgist in mining (1), he used the money he reported some of
      its patents (2) to open a pharmacy in Andover, Hampshire County,
      where he consecrated in 1927 most of its leisure to cultivate his
      passion for inorganic chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Morley Martin soon made a sensational discovery. In experimenting
      on azo rocks, it<br>
      claimed to have managed to reincarnate of primitive life forms
      from original protoplasm, and have seen reconstruct and develop
      gradually under a microscope, in through all stages of&nbsp;
      embryonic development.<br>
      <br>
      He published in 1934 a summary of its work in a booklet published
      in The Reincarnation of Animal and Plant Life from Protoplasm
      Isolated from the Mineral Kingdom in which however, it revealed
      nothing of his processes, except for using a furnace high
      temperature electrical furnace and exposure of residues obtained
      to X-rays.<br>
      <br>
      "Life is indestructible, even by fire. There have been no more
      than Birth of life. As time, like space, life has no beginning nor
      end. This is a mistake think that life is a state of the body. The
      truth is that the body is a state of life. "(3)<br>
      <br>
      His first discoveries about life organic were soon to be relayed
      by a series of articles in Theosophical Society, which earned him
      an ephemeral notoriety while contributing mainly to discredit his
      work with the scientific world.<br>
      <br>
      To believe the Jewish Tribune, Mauritius Maeterlinck seems to have
      had knowledge<br>
      Morley works by Martin letters communicated to him one of his
      friends, Mr Genette.<br>
      <br>
      Morley Martin died at South Harrow, to London, in 1938, in near
      obscurity; they say he left behind encrypted notes could not be
      decrypted.<br>

      </b>Creation of&nbsp; life is a problem that, since centuries,
      countless scholars have pondered. Their considerable work been
      very many volumes discussed. During the last century, around 1832,
      the English thought Andrew Cross now be able to produce life
      animal. It was not. The illustrious Michael Faraday, the physicist
      and chemist at which we must discover the current induction,
      attacked as for a time the question without get either result. And
      the French Leduc, among many others, has not happier than his
      predecessors.<br>
      <br>
      But one English, Mr. W. Morley Martin demonstrates through simple
      it advance rapidly towards the solution mystery by means of which
      it is the inventor and he jealously guards the secret.<br>
      <br>
      I came here to see this man Extraordinary and me to explain his
      works. After a meeting that lasted more than three hours, I left
      the astonished at the highest point, marveled that he showed me
      and asking me how, if its discovery is really what says, it is not
      now at highest honors.<br>
      <br>
      But let me introduce Mr. Morley Martin. For many years, this
      scientist has made to science eminent services. metallurgical
      chemist's trade, having wielded the long rays X, he invented, here
      are twenty-five years, a glove protecting operators dermatitis.
      During the war, he has its science to defense provision National.
      But all this does not have it enriched, and as he must live -
      science, as everyone knows, do not paying his man - he became
      pharmacist and holds today, on Market Square, Andover, a
      dispensary in which he prepares orders doctors in the region,
      devoting his rare moments of leisure in pursuit his research on
      animal life.<br>
      <b><br>
        First success<br>
        <br>
      </b>In 1927 he started at last. Tirelessly he worked all night and
      after two years<br>
      for the first time, under the objective of his microscope, he saw
      appear<br>
      Small bubbles are soon coagulated and took the shape of these
      primitive animals and tiny, which appeared like the jellyfish well
      known to all who visit the seaside. Mr. Morley Martin defnies, it
      noted<br>
      immediately, to have created life.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>"I was told by this man in his&nbsp; sixties whose glance
      reflects sincerity, that it is reincarnated life, and that is my
      great discovery.&nbsp; Science is in part, from the beginning,
      based on false data. We are at beginning of the largest of
      controversies that have ever occurred since the world began! "<br>
      <br>
      And as I pressed Mr. Morley Martin, he&nbsp; explained:<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>"It is a serious mistake to think that the Life is a state of
      the body. Well instead, the body is one of the states of life
      because the protoplasm, substance constituting the cell alive, is
      an eternal thing, indestructible, whose time nor the fire can not
      be right. It is why I do not want to be told that I create life. I
      reincarnates, which is quite different, for me, as the basis for
      my works, protoplasm that, by methods chemicals that are personal
      to me, I extract from various minerals, such as chalk or
      limestone, the sponge dust or oil Cod liver. And it is working it
      protoplasm I managed, after countless experiences, to produce Life
      of formations which here examples. "<br>

      </b>And the scholar, setting me before a microscope, scroll under
      my eyes<br>
      number of small glass slides on which he was able to set some
      training who have experienced some hours on other days. It is Then
      I saw, magnified several thousands of times, insects
      infinitesimal, kinds of fish tiny, worms gracefully ringed and
      other engineering marvels of reincarnator Mr. Morley Martin. But
      it did better. He has photographed the evolution of these
      animalculae reincarnating since time, amalgamating simple cells,
      they began to build up one where they took shape, ultimately,
      though very primitive, after passing through all intermediate
      phases.<br>
      <br>
      Examining these series photomicrographs fixing the various
      internship this life protoplasmic renaissance is one of the
      largest wonders he has ever given me to contemplate. Without
      quality appreciate the work of Mr Morley Martin, without being
      able to ensure in the case indeed a reincarnation through a rot
      germ found in the sides of the earth, I do not think too move me
      saying he may well be a discovery truly sensational.<br>

      But like all precursors, Morley Martin has his detractors. He
      fought by the princes of science, because its theories go against
      all those admitted so far. Without let down by numerous setbacks,
      he continues unabated and experiences it expects to produce more
      animal feature yet as I been able to observe for those confused
      who refuse to have faith in him.<br>

      "You have just seen, he said, some something that looks like the
      skeleton of a prehistoric animal whose species is off. You noticed
      that there a spine, ribs and embryos head and feet, while
      surrounded by a kind of jelly. You have also noticed, thanks to
      photomicrographs I just showed how this skeleton is formed. I
      myself grew up starting from the simple protoplasm when small
      cells began to move when the spine is composed while I fed this
      sort of serum, which is the basis of all, by means of which, for
      obvious reasons, I want to keep still secret.<br>
      <br>
      Several of my friends, controls it not to suspect, followed by end
      to end my experiences. They were able to observe the efforts made
      to live by these animals primitive reincarnated. In many cases, we
      noted an attempt to breathing through gills almost normally
      constituted. One day, perhaps be, I can give these animalcules a
      real life, but for that you need me first discover the ideal
      conditions own to achieve this phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      Not going to make of all this I'm about, in the present state of
      my research, produce a be human ! We are at the beginning of an
      era of new science and I do not know you far better than the first
      results of latent life, transformed into manifested life may lead
      me. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that man is latent in that his
      rock body became dust. May the Truth turn out to be on my side. "<b><br>

      <b><br>
        The astonishing theory of an English scholar<br>
        <br>
      </b>This theory is pretty fantastic. I also did not take the
      account. It comes from an English scholar, Mr. Morley W. Martin,
      which to me subject. And instead of "subject," I should say
      rather, exposed the belief, violence and passion that gives
      certainty of the truth!<br>
      <br>
      For Mr. Martin, we do not die, we never die. But there is no
      relationship between this idea and those, Christian or Hindu, for
      survival the soul and reincarnation. No, Mr. Martin does not
      create a new religion; it is a biologist, nothing more; he This
      physical phenomena, it s' based on concrete experiences. And alone
      these experiments, although they provide no evidence Ultimately,
      that are worth speaking of the extraordinary man who carries them
      out.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Morley Martin is a self taught a so very special. The need for
      money forced him to work at his young age to pursue and persist
      fairly expensive studies, but its frenzied individualism prevented
      him from monitor compliance with the most current known and read
      with joy the the least disputed doctrines. Also he said, for the
      physical sciences, the young Pascal had done for mathematics: he
      re-discovered it reinvented what he could have found in books.<br>
      <br>
      We can discuss this form of education, the result is not only Mr.
      Morley Martin succeeds studies extremely bright, but its mind was,
      by habit, continually turned to the discovery. In England, an
      inventor is not necessarily in misery. And Mr. Morley Martin, with
      more than ninety patents Invention sold poorly, arrived in honest
      ease.<br>
      <br>
      What he called "the discovery of his life "brought him there ten
      years ago, an inexpressible happiness at the same time that she
      was the cause of his ruin and his worries.<br>
      <br>
      This had happened before his eyes was a phenomenon so important,
      he saw for him such as extensions scientific and philosophical
      that now sacrificed his time and all its resources to the
      development of a revolutionary and godless system.<br>
      <br>
      The experience that was had struck the next: a mineral medium in
      which everything had been destroyed by germ the "baking" at the
      temperature great electric oven, he created a tiny creature who,
      having passed through all stages of embryonic development, had
      expressed as a living being.<br>
      <br>
      "I have not created this being, I am not a Dr. Frankenstein. And
      only not this "mineral" that spawned this "animal," says Mr.
      Morley Martin.<br>
      <br>
      And an absolutely crazy assumption to eyes of his colleagues
      seized his mind.<br>
      <br>
      "Suppose life (not the soul) is independent of the body; suppose
      that what we call death, at the disintegration of the body, life
      takes refuge to "sleep" at a point of this land where it sits
      dormant. So the phenomenon is explained. the middle I treated
      mineral was the seat of the life of my little animal, dead,
      perhaps be, there are over one hundred thousand years. "<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by a process which he keeps jealously secret, Mr. Morley
      Martin would awake to life and latent would have made him an
      earthly body.<br>
      <br>
      Ten years have passed and conviction of English scientist has only
      strengthen. If it has changed four times residential to always go
      to a cottage more modest, less costly, the walls of these cottages
      have covered documents which are, for the most part, enlargements
      of microphotographs. Some of these have several meters in length
      and can be examined, in every detail, structure animals
      artificially reincarnated.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Morley Martin apologizes for experiment on the infinitely
      small, but what is true of the infinitely little is also the
      infinitely large and the general medium.<br>
      <br>
      "I realized ten thousand similar experiences, if he cries
      violently, and few of them have failed. For a few moments, a few
      minutes, few hours I revived under the microscopic beings that had
      already appeared on earth and whose life eternal, locked in a
      latent state in a grain of sand, salt or a piece of chalk, had
      resisted 3000 degrees centigrade electric oven. "<br>
      <br>
      He said, "Life is indestructible, even by fire. There have been no
      more than Birth of life. As time, like space, life has no
      beginning nor end. This is a mistake think that life is a state of
      the body. The truth is that the body is a state of life. "<br>
      <br>
      This is the conviction of this man, whose experiences, we can not
      deny it, are of extraordinary interest, but scientific findings
      and are philosophical, saying his fellow, full of artifice and
      falseness.<br>
      <br>
      And when we ask him:<br>
      <br>
      "If we were always what we are, if we existed in a latent state
      (With plants and animals that we surround), when the earth was not
      that a melt, what do you the doctrine of Evolution? of the
      doctrine of Darwin? "<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Morley Martin answers the question with magnificent fanaticism
      scholars:<br>
      <br>
      "Darwin is the biggest fool the world has brought! "<br>
      <br>
      Charles Rickard, in Marianne, Vol. 5, No. 252, Wednesday, August
      18, 1937<br>
      <br>
      In the last chapter of his book Great Gate just published (in
      Fasquelle, Paris), Mr. Maurice Maeterlinck wrote:<br>
      <br>
      Last year died in South Harrow, London suburb, a chemist biologist
      named Morley Martin, who made Andover, a small town five to six
      thousand inhabitants, in Hampshire, the most extraordinary
      discovery that science has been recording since the gravitation of
      Newton and the invention of radium.<br>
      <br>
      Driven by an indescribable feeling great, he acquired gradually
      the conviction as plants and animals, at least vertebrates and
      mainly fish continue to live reduction and latent in rocks
      geologists call azo who formed the first crust and the world in
      which we never found traces of organisms.<br>
      <br>
      In short, he believes he has proved that life is immortal,
      universal, indestructible; the idea-mother image or any ProType
      predates it we call matter.<br>
      <br>
      He began his research in 1927, devoted to the installation of
      elementary laboratory small fortune given to him by selling many
      patents; and in indifference and General ignorance, he continued
      his experiences until the end of his life.<br>
      <br>
      Surprised by death, Martin Morley has published a slim pamphlet
      that not reveal its methods. (1) The essential of what is known is
      in a bundle ofletters sent in July 1931 to September 1937 to his
      confidant Mr. Genette (who communicated them to Mr. Maeterlinck).<br>
      <br>
      According to Martin Morley, it forms torn from their sleep are
      immemorial reincarnations of a force specific, fixed and eternal.
      The Life is not an expression of power from the body ; the body is
      the expression of preexisting life force and indestructible. He
      thinks vertebrates existed on our planet before (?) that there
      should be land or sea. He does not say as Thomas Huxley that
      protoplasm is the physical basis of life, but the physical basis
      for life. <br>
      <br>
      This protoplasm is what can perpetuate his physical life. The
      animal loses body but does not lose life. There is nothing
      inanimate. No form of life is off. Nothing dies and identity
      animal life survives even after assimilation in a plant where it
      can be awake. The opposite of life is not death, but latency. The
      man is latent in the rock.<br>
      <br>
      It is arbitrary to consider the still alleged matter and matter
      vibrant and contrast the reigns organic vegetable-mineral animal.
      he Only one universal substance with its purpose, which is
      revealed to us by incessant game of shapes, materials, and we
      perceive with our senses that tiny fraction of the entire process.<br>
      <br>
      One can say that these tests of explanation does not shed a the
      blinding light phenomenon question. But if the experiences of
      Morley and Martin were confirmed classified in science, it would
      assume that everything exists in power, in essence, in idea to the
      state latent for humans.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, this still life, but immortal, who is hiding in all
      places and wait for an opportunity conducive to animate and
      manifest, would be a more fantastic revelations that we would
      never made.<br>
      <br>
      What is the value of experience and Morley Martin findings? At
      first, skeptics and misonéistes professionals, descendants of
      those who snickered around Galileo, William Harvey, Newton,
      Pasteur there will be a huge pseudoscientific fraud. This question
      shall be determined by the facts, when you know the secret of his
      works. If we do not find this secret, Therefore, with the
      indications we put on the road: the oven electrical, ultraviolet
      rays, rocks used, it would be impossible to again what he knew to
      do without help without predecessors, and not yet knowing nothing
      he tells us?<br>
      <br>
      In order to leave nothing in the dark, Mr. Maeterlinck adds that,
      according to the most Recent theories, we would not reached azo
      rocks properly say. All rocks we would know of origin sedimentary,
      that is to say by registered waters, as well as limestone granites
      and gneisses. Waiting azo certainties discovery Morley Martin is
      not less prodigious. What will the physical, scientific
      consequences, practices, metaphysical and moral?<br>
