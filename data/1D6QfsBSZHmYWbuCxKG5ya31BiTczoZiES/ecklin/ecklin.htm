      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A permanent magnet motor in one embodiment
        utilizes a spring-biased reciprocating magnetizable member
        positioned between two permanent magnets. Magnetic shields in
        the form of rotatable shutters are located between each
        permanent magnet and the reciprocating member to alternately
        shield and expose the member to the magnetic field thereby
        producing reciprocating motion. A second embodiment utilizes a
        pair of reciprocating spring-biased permanent magnets with
        adjacent like magnetic poles separated by a magnetic shield
        which alternately exposes and shields the like poles from the
        repelling forces of their magnetic fields. </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the use of energy stored in the
        fields of permanent magnets. This energy is utilized in prime
        movers capab le of producing work without the addition of energy
        from an outside source. </p>
      <p>The world is now confronted with a crisis brought about by a
        shortage of sources of energy. People everywhere are being asked
        to conserve energy in every possible way. And scientists are
        seeking diligently for new sources of energy and for ways to
        utilize conventional sources more efficiently. </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic energy is known and employed throughout the
        world in countless applications. Permanent magnets have played a
        large part in the development and utilization of electromagnetic
        energy, but no significant use as a primary energy source has
        ever been made of the potential energy which exists in the field
        of a permanent magnet. It is an object of this invention to
        provide a permanent magnet motor which produces reciprocating
        motion. The reciprocating motion thus produced may be converted
        to rotary motion by conventional mechanisms as desired. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention utilizes the attraction and repulsion properties
        of the magnetic fields of permanent magnets to produce
        reciprocating motion in a member of magnetizable material. A
        first embodiment of the invention employs a pair of permanent
        magnets positioned in spaced relationship along a common axis. A
        spring-biased magnetizable member is mounted along the common
        axis between the permanent magnets. A rotatable shutter of
        magnetic shielding material is mounted between the spring-biased
        magnetizable member and each permanent magnet. When the shutters
        are rotated to expose and shield, in alternate sequence, the
        magnetizable member from the magnetic fields of the permanent
        magnets, the magnetizable member is caused to reciprocate along
        the common axis between the permanent magnets. The reciprocating
        motion o the member can be converted to useful work by
        conventional mechanisms. </p>
      <p>A second embodiment utilizes a pair of permanent magnets
        mounted for reciprocating movement along a common axis. The
        magnets are spring-biased in adjacent positions with like
        magnetic poles facing each other A magnetic shielding shutter is
        moved in and out from between the facing magnetic poles to cause
        the permanent magnets to repel each other against the spring
        action to produce reciprocating motion. </p>

      <p><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiments</b> </p>
      <p>The invention will be understood more readily by referring to
        Figure 1 which is a diagrammatic view of a first form of the
        invention which may utilize either the attraction or repulsion
        of magnetic fields to produce reciprocating motion in a prime
        mover device. A pair of permanent magnets 1 and 3 are positioned
        in spaced relationship to each other with a magnetizable member
        5 located therebetween. The member 5 is shown with arms 7 and 9
        connected thereto. Arm 7 is also connected to driving link 11
        which is provided to convert the reciprocating motion of member
        5 to rotary motion by means of eccentric connection to circular
        member 13. </p>
      <p>The member 5 is spring-biased in the position shown by means o
        springs 15, 17, 19, and 21. Biasing links 23 and 25 connect arms
        7 and 9 to the spring members. </p>
      <p>A pair of rotatable shutter members 27 and 29 are mounted on
        shaft 31 which is concentric with the common axis of permanent
        magnets 1 and 3 and magnetizable member 5. Shaft 31 is driven by
        a suitable device such as motor 33 shown. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 is a plan view of rotatable shutter 27 show in Figure
        1. The shutter 27 comprises cutout portions 35 and 37 and
        portions 39 and 41 of magnetic shielding material. The positions
        of the magnetic shielding portions of shutters 27 and 29 are
        displaced 90 degrees in rotation from each other so that when
        shutter 27 exposes the pole pieces of permanent magnet 1,
        shutter 29 is shielding the pole pieces of permanent magnet 3. </p>
      <p>In operation the motor 33 turns shaft 31 and the rotatable
        shutters 27 and 29 attached thereto. As the pole pieces of one
        of the permanent magnets are exposed, magnetizable member 5 is
        attracted thereto, since at the same time the pole pieces of the
        other permanent magnet will be shielded. As the shutter
        continues rotation the pole pieces of each magnet will be
        alternately exposed and shielded causing magnetizable member 5
        to reciprocate back and forth between the permanent magnets with
        assistance from the biasing springs, one pair of which will be
        compressed while the other air is tensioned. The circular wheel
        13 serves as a power take-off means and converts the
        reciprocating motion of magnetizable member 5 to circular motion
        for shaft rotation. </p>
      <p>An alternative arrangement could be achieved in the device of
        Figure 1 by substituting a permanent for the magnetizable member
        5. In this case the magnet would have to be oriented so that
        like magnetic poles were always adjacent each other. The device
        would operate by the repulsion properties of like magnetic poles
        with the reciprocating member 5 being repelled by magnetic
        forces as the rotatable shutter uncovered the pole pieces. </p>
      <p>Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a second embodiment o the invention
        employing the property of magnetic repulsion. A pair of
        permanent magnets 45 and 47 are positioned in tubular members 49
        and 51. Springs 53 and 55 bias permanent magnets 45 and 47 in
        position so that like magnetic poles are adjacent. A magnetic
        shutter member 57 separates permanent magnets 45 and 47 when
        they are in their fully-biased position. </p>
      <p>When the magnetic shutter member 57, which acts as a magnetic
        shield between permanent magnets 45 and 47, is removed, as shown
        in Figure 4, the magnets 45 and 47 repel each other and compress
        springs 53 and 55. When the shutter member 57 is again placed
        between magnets 45 and 46, the compressed springs 53 and 55
        force magnets 45 and 47 back into the position shown in Figure
        3. Periodic action of shutter member 57 will produce a periodic
        reciprocating motion which may be converted to useful rotary
        motion by circular wheels 59 and 61. The shutter 57 may be
        mounted for rotary motion in a fashion similar to shutters 27
        and 29 of Figure 1. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A unitized (single unit) motor and flux
        switch alternator having stationary field, armature and motor
        windings which provides a magnetic path for some of the motor
        input power to feed through and increase the alternating current
        (AC) generator output. A rotor formed from a material having a
        high magnetic permeability (solid or laminated soft steel) is
        controlled in speed by controlling the magnitude and timing of
        the pulsed direct current (DC) supplied to the motor windings
        which may be wound on the stationary legs or the rotor. The
        current flow in the motor windings can be controlled by a
        mechanical commutator if the motor windings are on the rotor or
        by a solid-state converter if the motor windings are on the legs
        in a manner normally associated with brushless DC motors. The DC
        windings of the flux switch alternator can be replaced by
        permanent magnets since the reversing field in the AC output
        windings are predominantly time stationary. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Inductor alternators were as popular and efficient as any
        generator before 1900. They had no brushes for high reliability
        but they were slightly larger than other generators and output
        unidirectional pulses. As a result they lost out to other
        generators except in special applications. Later the flux switch
        alternator replaced the inductor alternator as the flux switch
        alternator outputs AC and since all AC coils and DC coils were
        used twice as much, the flux switch alternator output four times
        more than inductor alternator, all else being equal. </p>
      <p>Simple inductor alternators had four legs with AC and DC coils
        wound on each leg and a four lobed steel rotor. The flux switch
        alternator simply wound these same coils between the four legs
        instead of on the legs and cut two opposite lobes from the steel
        rotor. Since only steel rotates with a conservative force, what
        could require four times more input torque to the flux switch
        alternator? </p>
      <p>Because of sags, glitches, brownouts, blackouts and other
        surprises from electric power systems many large electronic
        systems including computers now use a motorgenerator (M-G) for
        back-up or emergency power. Few motors or generators are
        individually over 95 per cent efficient so when their shafts are
        mechanically coupled, the overall efficiency of an M-G with
        separate motors and generators is seldom over 90 percent
        efficient. </p>
      <p>It is commonplace to teach the output of a generator is equal
        to the mechanical input power minus the losses. It is also known
        from Lenz's law (but seldom taught) a generator that is 95
        percent efficient consumes 95 percent of the input to overcome
        torque due to internal forces and 5 percent goes to losses. The
        rotors of most of today's generators are repelled as they
        approach a stator and are attracted back by the stator as soon
        as the rotor passes the stator in accordance with Lenz's law.
        Thus, most rotors face constant nonconservative work forces and
        therefore, present generators require constant input torque. </p>
      <p>Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a more
        compact motor generator. </p>
      <p>It is also an objective of this invention to bias all steel
        above ground by attaching this steel to the positive terminal of
        a power supply or battery and grounding the negative terminal to
        bleed off or gound most free electrons to decrease losses from
        unwanted induced currents. This will also decrease losses in any
        other motor, generator or transformer with armatures. </p>
      <p>It is further an objective of this invention to make a more
        compact and far more efficient motor generator by unitization. </p>
      <p>It is yet another objective of this invention to take advantage
        of a conservative no work force demonstrated by a simple damped
        oscillator consisting of a steel ball bearing released off
        center on a button permanent magnet with magnetic poles on the
        flat surfaces. </p>
      <p>According to this invention, the legs or the rotor of a flux
        switch alternator are provided with motor windings. The steel
        rotor of the unitized flux switch alternator actually aids the
        input torgue for half of each rotation as the rotor is always
        attracted and never repelled. This construction makes it
        possible for some of the current or power fed to the motor
        windings to magnetically feed through a solid magnetic path to
        the AC output windings which does not occur in today's M-Gs as
        they are only mechanically coupled by their shafts and have no
        common magnetic path to share. </p>
      <p>From basic electronic technology we learn a charged condensor
        has few free or conduction electrons on the positive plate and
        an excess of free electrons on the negative or grounded plate.
        Since steel armatures are conductors, there has been
        considerable effort expended in materials research to increase
        resistance to conduction electrons in armature materials to
        thereby reduce hysteresis and eddy current damping losses.
        Another more common approach is to laminate or powder these
        armatures. Accordingly, a further feature of the invention, the
        reduction in hysteresis and eddy current damping losses. </p>
      <p>This invention provides a biased and unitized M-G which is
        smaller, has less loss, and is more efficient than present
        units. </p>
      <p>Since the steel rotor is always attracted to the strongest
        magnetic field regardless of it's polarity, steel gets a
        conservative force or is accelerated to a leg and slowed down or
        decelerated by the magnetic field set up in the legs by the DC
        coils or permanent magnets of the flux switch alternator.
        Moreover, because the flux induced into the two lobed rotor by
        the stationary source of field flux exhibits no reluctance
        change as rotation takes place, there is an essentially lossless
        transfer. </p>
      <p>Well established mechanical or solid-state commutator
        technology allows the pulsing or energizing of the motor coils
        (whether stationary on the legs or on the rotor) to selectively
        provide given magnetic polarities when the rotor gets within 30
        degrees of any leg in the direction of motion of the rotor and
        to deenergize these pulses 10 degrees or so before the rotor
        gets to a leg to take advantage of a large collapsing field. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with a principle of this invention, a unitized
        flux switch alternator is provided whose stationary field of
        flux is established by DC coils or permanent magnets. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another principle of this invention, a solid
        or laminated steel rotor is turned and timed by pulses of
        current fed to either stationary motor coils on the legs or to a
        winding on the rotor to increase given magnetic polarities using
        standard commutating procedures. This pulsed polarized magnetic
        motor flux feeds through to the AC output coils providing a
        fatter appearing sine wave for an increased output power. </p>
      <p>It will also be appreciated from the foregoing description that
        the invention is electrically, magnetically and mechanically
        inexpensive and uncomplicated using only well known and fully
        developed technologies. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a magnetic circuit diagram which is useful for
        illustrating a basic aspect of the invention. A steel ball 19 is
        set on either the North or South pole of a button magnet 20
        which, in turn, is positioned on a steel sheet 23. Magnet 20
        might be one half inch in diameter by three sixteenths of an
        inch thick in which case steel ball member 19 should be five
        sixteenths of an inch in diameter. When steel ball 19 is pushed
        to the edge of button magnet 20 and released under the influence
        of the magnetic field, it has a damped oscillation. If all
        losses could be overcome, the excursion of steel ball 19 would
        be constant and in either case demonstrates a conservative no
        work force. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is a prior art inductor alternator and is shown because
        such sketches are now difficult to locate and also to observe
        the similarity of the motion of the steel rotor 13 and 19 in
        FIG. 1. Stator 10 is provided with pole pieces 11 corresponding
        in number to the teeth projections 12 on toothed iron rotor 13.
        Primary winding 14 on pole pieces 11 are energized through
        rheostat 15 from battery 16 and the AC output to a load 17 are
        taken from secondary winding 9. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b) are of a flux switch alternator. These
        sketches show the rotor 5' in two positions. Stator 40 includes
        a pair of permanent magnets 41 and 42 and a flux guiding
        structure 43 having pole pieces 44-1, 44-2, 44-3 and 44-4 and
        windings 45 and 46 on legs 47 and 48. The flux reversal through
        the AC windings 45 and 46 is demonstrated by rotation of rotor
        5'. Also it can be seen that two rotations of rotor 5' will
        produce four sine waves. To get 60 cycles (hertz) per second
        out, rotor 5' is rotated at 1800 revolutions per minute (RPM)
        with a double lobed rotor. Using a six lobed rotor 5", as
        illustrated in FIG. 5, the speed of rotation can be reduced to
        600 RPM for 60 cycle (Hz) AC out. Similar strategies can be used
        to generate three phase AC. Since rotors 5' turn with a
        conservative force, it is obvious it should be embedded in
        magnetically transparent material MT to make it a better
        flywheel and a smooth surface to reduce windage losses. In FIGS.
        2 and 3(a) and 3(b), a separate drive means coupled to the
        shafts S of rotors 13, 5 and 5' produce the motive force on the
        rotors. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4, stator 70 exemplarily includes four poles 71-1N,
        71-2S, 71-3S and 71-4N and connecting sections 72-1, 72-2, 72-3
        and 72-4 on which are located the DC coils 75 and the AC output
        coils 74, AC output coils 74-1 and 74-3 being wound on stator
        connecting portions 72-1 and 72-3, respectively, and DC coils or
        windings 75-2 and 75-4 being wound on stator connecting portions
        72-2 and 72-4, respectively. These DC windings on the stator
        connecting portions are energized from a DC source, such as a
        battery. Prior art solid-state commutator controls such as shown
        in U.S. Pat. No. 3,569,804 or other DC brushless motor controls
        may be used when the DC motor coils are on the legs or pole
        pieces 1, 2, 3 and 4 as in FIG. 6. The rotor 80 is on shaft 81
        journeled at it's ends for free rotation, or if vertically
        oriented, on magnetic bearings to eliminate further friction
        losses. DC windings 75 and the AC output windings 74 can
        overlap, and in fact be bifilar wound. As noted above, well
        established mechanical or solid state commutator technology
        allows the pulsing or energizing of the motor coils (whether
        stationary on the stator legs as shown in FIG. 6 or on the rotor
        as shown in FIG. 4) to selectively provide given magnetic
        polarities when the rotor gets within 30 degrees of any leg in
        the direction of motion of the rotor and to deenergize these
        pulses 10 degrees or so before the rotor gets to a leg. For
        example, as shown in FIG. 4, brushes B1 and B2 are engaged by
        commutator segments C1 and C2, respectively, when the rotor is
        within 30 degrees of leg 2 and 4 of the stator 82 and leave
        these commutator segments at about 10 degrees before the rotor
        gets to those legs. </p>
      <p>Exemplary dimensions of the four legged stator 70 are 12 inches
        in diameter by one inch thick and wide, as are the pole pieces
        71. </p>
      <p>A battery 90 is shown for bias in FIG. 4 however, a positive
        lead to a DC coil can be attached to the stator in the case
        where permanent magnets are not used instead of the DC coils. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that not only does some of the power to
        the motor coils 82 feed through to the AC output coils 74-1 and
        74-3 but the only power required to the motor coils 82 would be
        that needed in a structure corresponding to FIG. 1 to keep the
        ball at a constant excursion or the rotor 80 at a constant
        speed. Also since the power to the DC coils 75-2 and 75-4
        saturates the stator 70 when the rotor is between two legs
        (71-1N and 71-3S or 71-2S and 72-4N) much less motor power is
        required (as in a variable flux path magnetic amplifier) using a
        mechanical commutator and winding the DC motor coils 82 on rotor
        80. Very little change is required to the input torque as the
        electrical load on the alternator varies. Magnetic lines of
        force always tend to shorten their path so they not only take
        the easiest path, they make the shortest magnetic path. See FIG.
        1. </p>
      <p>As noted above, the direction of the current fed to the motor
        coils can be controlled by a mechanical commutator to give the
        tips of the rotor the opposite magnetic polarity to that of the
        legs the rotor tips approach. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 6, instead of placing the DC motor windings on
        the rotor as shown in FIG. 5, the motor windings 82 can be on
        the pole pieces, such as 71-1N of FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>By unitizing we not only get rid of an external motor but some
        of the pulsed power fed to the motor coils will feed through to
        the AC coils and generate more output. Pulse or energize the
        motor coils to increase given magnetic polarities when the rotor
        gets within 30 degrees or so of any leg in the direction of
        motion and deenergize 10 degrees before 80 gets to a leg to take
        advantage of a large collapsing field. </p>
      <p>Stator losses are caused by current flow either hysteresis or
        eddy current damping. By biasing stator at a positive voltage
        most free or conduction electrons are grounded reducing these
        losses to almost zero. The stator are similar to the electron
        starved plate of a charged condensor. Biasing works better than
        laminated or powdered stator to reduce these losses in
        conductors. </p>
      <p>Except for space applications it is more efficient to use
        brushes and wind the motor coils on the rotor. Since the DC
        coils should saturate the armature when the rotor is between two
        legs it takes much more energy to motor coils on the legs
        compared to rotor. </p>
      <p>Motor windings can be applied to the flux switch alternator of
        FIG. 3a and FIG. 3b incorporating the permanent magnets. </p>
      <p>While illustrative forms of the system in accordance with the
        present invention have been described, it will be understood
        that numerous changes may be made without departing from the
        principles and scope of this invention. </p>
