      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description -- </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention refers to an equipment making it possible to
      amplify the emissions due to the forms, in particular with the
      single geometric forms presenting a minimum of symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that certain geometric forms, for example pyramids,
      are, when they present appropriate proportions, the seat of
      emissions which one could not determine to present the exact
      nature. One noted that such emissions had effects, in particular
      on the living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Until present, it was not possible to obtain with the
      aforementioned emissions due to the forms, of the measurable and
      exploitable effects in industry.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has as an object an apparatus making it
      possible to amplify, according to a said principle of
      “localization”, the emissions due to forms to obtain industrially
      exploitable effects.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, such an apparatus comprises
      essentially a geometric form presenting a minimum of symmetry in
      planar or space, this form being associated a device producing an
      electric and/or magnetic and/or electromagnetic field in
      determined volume by the aforementioned form or in the vicinity
      immediate of this volume, such fields being able to be fixed or
      movable compared to the aforementioned form, and being able to be
      modulated or not.<br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment prefered of the invention, the
      aforementioned form is a substantially regular polygonal frame
      with 16 dimensions and is associated a device producing an
      electric power in the volume delimited by the aforementioned
      frame, this device comprising four electrodes with dimensions
      regularly spaced&nbsp; on the aforesaid frame in their medium, two
      of the aforesaid electrodes having a stable, filtered continuous
      positive potential compared to the ground to which other
      electrodes are connected, the formed angle by the points of the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">two positive electrodes</span> being,
      preferably, of approximately <span style="font-weight: bold;">28
        degrees apart</span>, while that formed by the points of the two
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">negative electrodes is,
        preferably, of approximately 23 degrees</span>.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive
        potential is preferably of at least 45 kilovolts and preferably
        of at least 60 Kv</span>, the aforementioned electrodes having
      the general shape of points directed towards the center of the
      aforesaid frame, the points of the four said electrodes being,
      preferably, in a same plane, which is preferably, the planar
      mediator of the aforesaid polygonal frame, the square dummy one
      delimited by the of the aforesaid points four electrodes being
      concentric by report/ratio to that the frame and having <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">diagonal approximately 400
        millimeters at least for a potential of approximately 45 Kv and
        approximately at least 1 metre for a potential of approximately
        300 Kv</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the diameter of
        the circle circumscribed with the formed polygon by the
        aforementioned frame being at least 200 centimetres for a
        potential of approximately 45 Kv, and at least 280 cm for a
        potential of approximately 300 Kv.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      According to an advantageous characteristic of the invention, the
      frame is made in a material, preferably out of a natural material,
      of which the structure, with the level of fibres or the
      crystalline level, is directed or has itself of remarkable
      symmetries. Preferably, each side of the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">polygonal frame is constructed of a
        small, very dry solid wood plank,</span> the length of the small
      plank being taken preferably in the direction of fibres of the
      wood, the different successive small planks being connected
      between them by glue or using pegs, also made of wood, such pegs
      not having, preferably, to exceed small pieces.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural materials not having any
        coherent or directed structure, such as for example the rubber,
        are to be avoided.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      According to an embodiment prefered of the invention, some of the
      small planks forming the with dimensions ones of the polygonal
      frame are with character of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">right



        Moebius strip</span>, and other with character of a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">left Moebius strip</span>.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, equipment
      comprises two or several regular polygonal concentric frames, each
      one having different numbers of dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      To reinforce the effect of amplification, one can preferably have
      on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">stems supporting the
        electrodes the parts, preferably out of same material that that
        of the frame, having for example round ovoidal or rhomboidal</span>,
      and when several of these forms are laid out on the same stem of
      an electrode, dimensions of these parts are homothetic, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">those having lowest dimensions being
        close to the corresponding electrode, the other parts being laid
        out after, and all the more far away from the first their
        dimensions are larger</span>.<br>
      <br>
      To reinforce the effect of amplification, one can also lay out on
      certain sides of the form or in proximity volumes preferably
      manufactured of same material that the frame, these volumes being
      in general single geometric volumes, for example of the trunks of
      cylinders finishing with the one their ends by a conical point,
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">angle of opening of these
        cones being preferably of approximately 140 degrees</span>.<br>
      <br>
      One can also lay out in the form itself or near inorganic natural
      or synthetic, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">carborundum</span>.<br>
      <br>
      One can also <span style="font-weight: bold;">add systems with
        acoustic resonance</span> in appropriate places, in proximity to
      the frame.<br>
      <br>
      The various&nbsp; additional forms can be made out of separate
      materials, or a single material so their edges can be joined.<br>
      <br>
      The form can also manufactured using a control of appropriate form
      in which one makes fluid circulation fluid possible.<br>
      <br>
      To further increase the effect of amplification of the device of
      the invention, one can fix it on a single or equatorial mounting
      and direct it in an appropriate way.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention will be better understood using the detailed
      description of several taken embodiments like the nonrestrictive
      examples illustrated by the annexed drawings, in which<br>
      <br>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> is a planar

      <br>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4</span> is a schematic
      view of an alternative of the device of Figure 1.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The apparatus of amplification represented on Figure 1 includes
      essentially a geometric form F and four electrodes with their stem
      electrode holders affixed to create an electric field in the
      volume delimited by the aforementioned form, and in the vicinity.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the embodiment prefered of the invention
      represented on Figure 1, the present form F like an hollow
      cylinder lof shallow depth, the wall of this cylinder, or frame,
      having out of radial cut substantially the shape of a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">regular polygon with 16 sides</span>
      with dimensions respectively referred 1 to 16.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is clearly understood that the polygonal hollow
      cylindrical form is not the only one possible, other forms, for
      example pyramidal forms also can be used in the frame of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The sixteen sides of the frame materializing the form F can all be
      substantially identical, and consist each one of a rectangular
      parallelepiped. However, the applicant noted that if some of the
      dimensions are different, and in particular <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">if certain sides have a character of
        left strip of Moebius and other character of straight Moebius
        strip, one obtains good amplification of the emissions</span>
      due to the form F.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment prefered of the invention represented in Figure
      I, with dimensions referred the 1, 3, 7, 8, 12,14 and consisted
      rectangular parallelepipeds, sides 2, 4, 5, 9; 11,13 and 15
      consist of volumes with the character of a right Moebius strip and
      with dimensions the 6 and 10 are left Moebius strips. However, it
      is clearly understood that other different provisions on the
      formed sides by rectangular parallelepipeds, by volumes with
      characters of strip of left and right Moebius can be considered
      while getting an improvement of amplification also of the
      aforesaid emissions. By volumes with character strip of Moebius
      one hears volumes resulting of the<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        twist of 180 degrees</span> of the one of the ends of a
      rectangular cuboid strip compared to the other end (the strip
      being supposed to lend itself to such a torsion), this torsion
      being done around the longitudinal axis of the aforesaid the
      cuboid strip. The strip of Moebius is said right or left according
      to whether it can be comparable with a right or left threading
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the embodiment of figure 1, volumes with <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">the Moebius strips are thicker in
        their middle</span> ( i.e., they would be carried out starting
      from a rectangular strip of which the thickness would be larger
      with the middle than at the ends) in order to allow the drilling
      of holes in their mediums for the insulators and fixing mounting,
      as explained below). In practice, it is preferable not to twist a
      wood small plank, but to cut the aforementioned volumes as Moebius
      strips. Keys volumes are, preferably, regular, i.e. symmetrical
      compared to their respective centers, and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">their total number must be odd</span>.<br>
      <br>
      All with dimensions the 1 to 16 of the form F is made out of very
      dry wood, for example of <span style="font-weight: bold;">poplar,
        of oak</span>, or an exotic wood.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant noted that the natural materials with fibres
      directed such as the wood gave the good results, and that <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">materials such as rubber or the
        plywood, or synthetic products such as plastic did not produce
        any substantial result.</span><br>
      <br>
      When with dimensions the 1 to 16 is manufactured out of wood, they
      are assembled mutually, preferably by assembly of the mortise
      tenon out of wood which can reinforce the assembly, and not
      exceeding the dimensions of the frame.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant noted that industrially to obtain useful results,
      the form F was to be such as the circle circumscribed with the
      formed polygon by <span style="font-weight: bold;">the frame was
        to have a diameter of at least approximately 250 cm</span>, the
      high applied tension, in a way explained below, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">with the electrodes being at least 45
        Kv, preferably from at least 60 kv, low tensions to 45 Kv having
        not very industrially exploitable effects.</span><br>
      <br>
      Sides 5 and 13 of the frame, with right Moebius strips are drilled
      of a hole passing by their center and whose axis merges with a
      radius of the circle circumscribed with the form F. The drilled
      holes in with dimensions the 5 and 13 are used for fixing of the
      form F on a mounting, not represented, for example an equatorial
      or ordinary mounting, making it possible to direct in space the
      form F. However, one could envisage other modes of fixing of the
      form F on its mounting.<br>
      <br>
      With dimensions the 3, 7, 11 and 15 are drilled holes, in the same
      way that sides 5 and 13, in order to allow the fixing of the
      electrodes, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Small wood planks</span>
      constituting the dimensions 1,3,7,8,12,14 16, preferably, have a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">width equal to or greater than 20 cm
        and a thickness equal to or greater than 4 cm, preferably
        between 6 and 10 cm</span>. The sides with right and left
      Moebius strips have, with their extremities 5 preferably, the same
      thickness as the planar sides, their thickness gradually
      increasing ends towards the center, up to a value of approximately
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">at least 8 cm</span>, this, in
      order to allow the drilling from with dimensions the 5 and 13 for
      the fixing of the frame on mounting and the sides 11 and 15 for
      the fixing of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant noted that one could also favorably influence the
      effect of amplification by affixing with ankles, volumes
      manufactured in the same material as frame. In the example of
      realization represented on figure 1, one fixed on the faces,
      turned towards the inner one of the form, the sides 1 and 9,
      volumes 17 and 18 respectively manufactured out of wood.<br>
      <br>
      These volumes 17 and 18 consist of <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">cylinders with cones on their ends, the point angle of
        these cones being preferably approximately 140 degrees</span>,
      the diameter of the cylinders being low to the length of with
      dimensions form, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">height
        of these cylinders being of about size of a few centimetres</span>.<br>
      <br>
      On sides 3, 7, 11 and 15 of the frame constituting the fixed form
      F one the electrodes 19, 20, 21 and 22 respectively, these
      electrodes being supported by stems electrode holders 23.
      Electrodes 19 to 22 are made out of electric conductive good
      material, for example <span style="font-weight: bold;">copper</span>
      and are consisted a circular cone 24 whose base is connected to
      the stem electrode holders 23 by one surface of hemisphere 25.<br>
      <br>
      The point angles of electrodes 20 and 21 are, preferably, of 23
      degrees +/- 30 <span style="font-weight: bold;">' </span>so that
      the point angles of the cones of the electrodes 19 and 22 are
      preferably<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 28 degrees +/- 30 '</span>.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The length of each electrode</span>
      19 to 22, taken in the direction of their axis, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">is approximately 60 to 90 mm</span>.
      However, other shapes of electrodes can to be considered.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The stems 23</span>, which are,
      also, made out of an electric conductive good material, for
      example of <span style="font-weight: bold;">copper</span>, and at
      the ends of which electrodes 19 to 22 are screwed or welded, cross
      with dimensions the 3, 7, 11 and 15 of the frame constituting the
      form F through appropriate insulators 26, for example out of glass
      or porcelain, these insulators drilled with an axial hole having
      substantially the same diameter that that of the stems electrode
      holders 23, the stems electrode holders 23 being attached of
      appropriate way in these insulators 26. <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Insulators 26 have a maximum outer diameter of
        approximately 5 cm</span> corresponding to the bore practised in
      sides 3, 7, 11 and 15, and are attached there of appropriate way,
      for example by joining. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
        axial length of insulators 26 is at least equal with the width
        on the sides which they cross ( i.e. the length of the holes
        bored in these sides), and, preferably of at least twice this
        width.</span><br>
      <br>
      Since with dimensions 3 and 11, and sides 7 and 15 are
      diametrically opposite and that the hollow polygonal volume
      consisted the frame is substantially regular, and that the holes
      bored in these four with dimensions are directed towards the
      center of this volume and are applied to the center on the
      corresponding sides, the four stems electrode holders 23 are
      directed following of the rays of the circle circumscribed with
      the form F and when they are taken consecutively two to two, are
      substantially perpendicular between them. Preferably, one adjusts
      of appropriate way the directions of the stems electrode holders
      23 so that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the points of four
        electrodes 19 to 22 are coplanar</span>, the plane in which are
      located these four points not passing the center of the form out ;
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">distances separating the points
        from electrodes 20 and 22 and electrodes 19 and 21 are
        preferably of at least 400 millimeters when applied potential
        with electrodes 19 and 22 are approximately 45 Kv</span>, and
      from <span style="font-weight: bold;">at least approximately 1
        metre when this potential is approximately 300</span> Kv. [<span
        style="font-style: italic;"> Cubit </span>... ]<br>
      <br>
      On each stem electrode holders 23, one lays out, between the base
      of the corresponding electrode and insulator 26 two volumes 27, 28
      substantially ovoidal, in the same material that the form F, i.e.
      out of wood for the embodiment prefered, the tops with lower angle
      of opening of the ovoid forms 27 and 28 being directed towards the
      center of the form F. One lays out outside the form F, around
      insulators 26, six identical discs 29, being of course that
      insulators 26 exceed sufficiently of the form F towards the outer
      one, if not the discs could be directly attached on the stem of
      electrodes 23. Then, one lays out on the stems 23 two other
      ovoidal volumes 30 and 31 respectively, whose tops of lower angle
      of opening are also directed towards the center of the form F. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The discs 29 and volumes 30 and 31
        are also realized in the same material that volumes 27 and 28.
        However, all the materials suitable with the manufacture of the
        form F can be used to carry out volumes 27 and 28, 30 and 31 and
        discs 29.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discs 29 have, preferably, an
        outer diameter of approximately 32 cm and a thickness from
        approximately 1 cm</span>, and are drilled with an axial hole
      corresponding to the maximum outer diameter of the insulator 26 on
      which they are threaded, and attached in an appropriate way.<br>
      <br>
      As one sees better in figure 2, representing a volume V which is
      any of ovoidal volumes 27, 28, 30 or 31, each one of these volumes
      is drilled of an axial hole T, and axial conical facings 32, 33
      are practised with each end of ovoidal volume V, the points being
      directed one towards the other one.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The angle of the opening 1 of the
        conical facing 32, practised in the top of wider opening of
        ovoidal volume, is, preferably of 28 + 30 ' and that of conical
        facing 33, opening 2, being preferably, of 23 degrees +/- 30'</span>.<br>
      <br>
      P is the depths of conical facings 32 and 33 and L the length,
      taken in the direction of the axis, ovoidal volume V against the
      drilling of facings 32 and 33.<br>
      <br>
      L1, L2, L3 and L4 are the lengths L of volumes 27, 28, 30 and 31
      respectively. These four volumes are <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">homothetic</span>, ratios <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">L4 / L3 , L3 / L2, L2 / L1 giving ratios of homothety</span>.
      In the preferred mode of realization, <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">L1 = 6 cm, L2 = 15 cm, L3 = 24 cm and L4 = approximately
        33 cm</span>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The values of the depths P follow
        the same ratios of homothety that the lengths L. For all ovoidal
        volumes 27 and 28, 30 and 31, conical facings with opening of
        approximately 23 degrees are directed towards the center of the
        form F when these volumes are attached on the stems 23.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the case of the embodiment quoted above, the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">depth P of facings 32 and 33 of
        volume 31 is 12 cm</span>, the P1 depths in P3 of other volumes
      27, 28 and 30 deducing some following the aforementioned ratios of
      homothety.<br>
      <br>
      The stems 23 of the electrodes 19 and 22 are connected both to a
      source (not represented) of filtered and stabilized DC current,
      positive compared to the ground. The stems 23 of electrodes 20 and
      21 are both connected, in a way not represented, with the
      potential of the ground.<br>
      <br>
      It is clearly understood that one can have on the stems electrode
      holders 23 other volumes having forms for example those
      represented on figure 3, these last replacing volumes 27, 28, 30
      and 31 and discs 29. One can add volumes also having other forms,
      or put nothing on these stems 23.<br>
      <br>
      Represented in figure 3 is an alternative of volume which can
      replace the volumes 27, 28, 30 and 31 represented in figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      The volume 34 represented on figure 3 has a general rhomboidal
      form, i.e., a form whose outer surface would be that generated by
      a <span style="font-weight: bold;">round rhombus</span> around
      its large axis, the acute angles of this rhombus being on the
      aforementioned axis. One of the acute angles (#1) of the aforesaid
      rhombus is approximately <span style="font-weight: bold;">57
        degrees 20 ', while the other one (#2) is of approximately 51
        degrees.</span><br>
      <br>
      Form 34 is drilled of an axial hole 35 whose diameter corresponds
      to that of the stems electrode holders 23. In the top of volume 34
      having the angle of practical opening V one an axial conical
      facing having an angle of opening 1 of approximately<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> 23 degrees, while in that having the
        angle of opening 2, one practical an axial conical facing of
        angle of opening from approximately 28 degrees</span>. The
      depths P' of the aforesaid facings conical are equal and are
      determined, just as the length the of the aforesaid rhombus, taken
      according to its large axis, in the same way that in the case of
      the ovordaux volumes represented on figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When one uses the volumes 34
        represented on figure 3, in the place of ovoidal volumes, one
        can remove discs 29 while obtaining an improvement of
        substantially equal or great amplification to that obtained with
        the aforementioned ovoidal volumes.</span><br

      According to an alternative of the embodiment prefered of the
      present invention, <span style="font-weight: bold;">one can
        either insert in the frame, or lay out near this frame, inside
        or outside the volume which it delimits, a natural inorganic
        form, of carborundum</span>.<br>

      It was noted that such inorganics makes it possible to <span

        device and/or to change the nature of the emissions and/or to
        confer to the frame the fractal character</span>, which is a
      known mathematical character.<br>
      <br>
      For the inorganic natural, one can for example use <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">proustite, pyragyrite, obsidian</span>,
      etc…, as well as several of these inorganics simultaneously. It
      was also noted that <span style="font-weight: bold;">natural
        graphite has a strong influence on the fractal character.</span><br>

      volumes, preferably out of natural material, for example out of
      wood, presenting directed fibres, <span style="font-weight:

      <br>
      In Figure 4, one schematically represented another embodiment of
      the according apparatus to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus represented in Figure 4 comprises two concentric F1
      forms and F2 , the F1 form being outside the F2 form.<br>
      <br>
      The <span style="font-weight: bold;">F1 form consists of an
        octagonal frame</span> whose with dimensions ones are
      respectively referred 39 to 46, and form <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">F2 consists of a regular polygonal
        frame with sixteen sides </span>respectively referred 47 to 62.<br>
      <br>
      The frames constituting the forms F1 and F are carried out in same
      way that the frame represented on Figure 1 and have the same
      characteristics, single substantially dimensions of these frames
      are different.<br>
      <br>
      In one mode of realization of the invention, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">circles circumscribed with the frames
        F1 and F2 have respective diameters of 384 and approximately 192
        cm</span>. However, dimensions of these circles, and
      consequently of the frames constituting the forms F1 and F2 can be
      larger. If the diameters of these frames are smaller, it would be
      necessary is to decrease the high applied tension with the
      electrodes carried by these frames, which would have an adverse
      effect on amplification, that is to say to take very large
      precautions of electric insulation.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the forms F1 and F2 are laid out one compared to the other
      one so that with dimension of the form F2 is with respect to the
      top ranging between with dimensions the 39 and 46 of the F1 form.<br>
      <br>
      The forms F1 and F2 are joined together between them using spacers
      63 which are realized, preferably, in same material that the
      frames constituting the forms F1 and F2, for example out of very
      dry wood.<br>
      <br>
      Spacers 63 connect with dimensions the 47, 51, 55 and 59 of the F2
      form at the corresponding tops of the F1 form.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes (not represented) are attached on with dimensions
      the 49, 53, 57 and 61 of the F2 form, in the same way that in the
      case of the apparatus represented on Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      On with dimensions the 47 and 55 of the F2 form one can have
      volumes 65 and 66 respectively, which can be carried out and laid
      out in the same way that the volumes 17 and 18 represented in
      Figure 1, or in a different way.<br>
      <br>
      The axis passing by the centers from with dimensions the 51 and 59
      is referred 64, and one can make turn the two forms F1 and F2 with
      their electrodes and possible volumes associated around this axis
      using an appropriate mounting (not represented).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        To further increase the effect of amplification of the equipment</span>
      of which two of the possible embodiments are described above, one
      can <span style="font-weight: bold;">lay out it in a truncated
        pyramid</span>, which can be constructed as a frame, of which
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">height is approximately 4,5
        m and whose base is square and has approximately 5 metres</span>
      in dimension. The proportions of the regular pyramid from which
      this truncated pyramid is obtained are such as the length L of its
      oblique sides is equal with C.<br>
      <br>
      C being the length on a side of the base of the pyramid and W the
      actual root of the equation: X^3 - X - 1 = O, i.e. approximately
      1,325. The truncated pyramid is obtained while cutting the top of
      the pyramid to the quarter length of its oblique edges, i.e.
      length 1 ' of the oblique edges of the truncated pyramid is equal
      with 3/4.c.y, two bases of the truncated pyramid being thus
      parallel between them.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">One can supplement this truncated
        pyramid</span> while laying out around this small base, which is
      also square, <span style="font-weight: bold;">with a circle</span>,
      for example out of wood, of diameter C '', centered on the axis of
      the pyramid, it being the length of with dimensions of the small
      base of the truncated pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">One can also have on the oblique
        edges of the pyramid the wood hemispheres whose diameter is
        equal with the length of the aforesaid edges, outside the
        truncated pyramid.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">To operate the present invention,
        one applies with electrodes 19 and a 22 positive potential which
        one increases gradually from zero up to a maximum value of at
        least 4r Kv. The effects obtained are all the more substantial
        as its potential is higher.</span><br>
      <br>
      However, for the great ones to approximately 300 Kv, it is
      necessary to take very large precautions of electric insulation,
      and the dangers of manipulation are increased.<br>
      <br>
      The generator producing the aforementioned positive potential will
      have to be able to be capable to deliver <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">a current of approximately 100
        microamperes</span>, and will be able preferably to comprise a
      protective circuit cancelling as soon as possible the high
      produced tension if the output current exceeds a certain value,
      for example 100 microamperes.<br>
      <br>
      It was noted that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the effects
        enumerated below commence at the end of approximately an hour
        the carrying under tension of the equipment of the invention, in
        a ray of approximately 30 metres or more around this equipment</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Among the noted effects, and whose list is not restrictive, one
      can quote:<br>
      <br>
      1 -- Local action on the terrestrial magnetic field -- <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">After approximately half an hour, one
        observes that the magnetic variation moves approximately 60
        towards the west of magnetic north </span>whatever the applied
      tension with the electrodes, above of the aforesaid threshold
      approximately 45 Kv, this rotation of the magnetic variation
      stabilizing itself with the aforementioned value dependent all the
      time on application of the potential, whatever the orientation of
      the frame compared to the ground. However, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">if one directs the axis of the frame
        with 60 degrees west of magnetic </span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">north</span><span style="font-weight:
        bold;">, it was noted that the other effects quoted below
        occurred rapidly and with a more substantial intensity</span>.<br>
      <br>
      It was noted a variation of the magnetic slope, but the value of
      this variation was not fixed.<br>
      <br>
      2 -- Local Action on the gravitation -- With a potential of
      approximately 45 Kv, it was noted that the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">local gravitation passed to 0,9 times
        its usual value</span> to the same location, and that <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">this gravitation decreased further
        when one increased the applied potential</span> with the
      electrodes of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      3 -- Local action on the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> index of
        refraction of the air -- It increases slightly</span>, and more
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">especially if the applied
        positive potential is higher</span>.<br>
      <br>
      4 -- It was noted that in reactions of combustion producing
      blast-furnace slag usually, there was <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">no formation of ash after all the period of operation of
        the apparatus, and same four days after the suspension of the
        application of the elevated positive potential</span> by said
      electrodes 19 and 22.<br>
      <br>
      5 -- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reduction in the quantity
        of fuel necessary in the majority of the reactions of
        combustion, to obtain the same result</span>.<br>
      <br>
      It has been reported that with an high tension of approximately <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">45 Kv, one used approximately 30%
        less coal to obtain same thermal energy, this reduction being
        all the more substantial as the applied positive potential with
        the form is higher</span>. In the case of motors with explosion
      using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">gasoline, it was noted
        a reduction in consumption approximately 50%</span> compared to
      a use, in the same conditions, without the apparatus of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      6 -- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Increase of the coefficient
        of solubility of a salt in water</span>, in particular of sodium
      chloride. Experiments were carried out with dehydrated sodium
      chloride, while varying the temperature of the water in which one
      dissolved salt by increments of l0 C, from 10 C with 100 C, the
      starting water being twice distilled at a pressure above normal
      atmospheric pressure. It was noted that <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">one multiplied by 2,1 to approximately 2,3 the
        coefficient of solubility of sodium chloride with a positive
        potential of approximately 45 kv. </span>[ <span

      <br>
      7 -- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Increases the speed of
        growth of the plants and their size</span>. These increases are
      variable according to plants but are appreciable. In certain
      cases, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the factor of increase is
        at least 2, up to 10.</span><br>
      <br>
      8 -- Possibility of <span style="font-weight: bold;">removing
        partially or completely a catalyst in a chemical reaction</span>
      requiring normally a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of according equipment the
      invention, one associates a main polygonal geometric form, such as
      the geometric form described above, with other geometric forms,
      preferably of single geometric forms such as for example the
      additional forms described above, and <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">preferably one associates to them an electric and/or
        electromagnetic and/or magnetic field, these forms being the
        preference laid out inside a geometric volume which can for
        example be made out of a molded insulating material</span>
      around the said forms.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Without the application of one of
        the aforementioned fields, one obtains effects relatively not
        very exploitable, but the application of the one at least of
        these fields allows one&nbsp; to increase the intensity of the
        effects obtained, especially when the applied field is higher. </span><br

      possible to modify certain physical and chemical properties the
      fluid ones and the solid ones, these last said being then
      activated.<br>
      <br>
      One knows by the FR-A-966735 a process and equipment allowing to
      exert an influence on the modifications of state of the material,
      especially by the action of suitably directed emissive
      apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that there are also phenomena of activation due to the
      presence of forms, fixed or movable, and presenting a minimum of
      symmetry in plane or in space.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, one knows by at-A-113 487, AT-A122 144 and AT-A-134 543
      [ Schauberger ], of the water pipelines of else particular form,
      allowing the regulation of torrents or river.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the invention is to propose a device presenting
      characteristics strongly different from those of the apparatuses
      of the former art, for an effective activation of fluid, as well
      as purification of some of those, like water or smoke. It is a
      question of not subjecting these fluid for a purpose of
      concentration and elimination by density, but <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">with the action of centripetal swirls
        due to the very accurate forms</span> which the different
      process modules of the according device present in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has as an object a device for activation of the
      fluid circulating one between a tank of inlet and a tank of
      extended within an unit of treatment, under the effect of at least
      a compressed gas, in which the unit of treatment includes conduits
      of circulation of fluid appearing itself as a CN layer, with NR
      entire great or equal with 2, CN being defined by the following
      recurring relation<br>
      <br>
      - C<sub>1</sub> is left cycloid in the referential orthonormal
      one,<br>
      <br>
      - for any NR entire great or equal with 1, CN+1 is cycloid left in
      the referential one curves bound with CN.<br>
      <br>
      For left cycloid, it is advisable to use the curve followed by a
      point pertaining to a ray of a circle, when this last rolls on
      straight and turns around this same straight. The cycloid one said
      stringent when the point belongs to the circle, is lengthened when
      the distance between the point and the center of the circle is
      great with the ray, shortened when this distance is low with the
      ray.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor noted that, of surprising manner, if one compels
      fluid <span style="font-weight: bold;">under pressure from 1 to 8
        bars</span> to circulate within the according conduits with the
      invention, this fluid is activated, namely that its physical and
      chemical properties are modified.<br>
      <br>
      This activation persists and is stabilized, same when the fluid
      one does not circulate any more, when <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">the conduits are made out of particular alloys</span>.
      This is why it is beneficial to use as a constituent material of
      these conduits, an alloy between a base metal chosen among <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">copper, chromium, iron, cobalt and
        nickel</span>, with the heavier metals added in very small
      quantity in weight. It is preferable to consider base metal
      copper, and of the heavier metals constituting alloy will be taken
      among those possessing an <span style="font-weight: bold;">atomic
        number Z ranging between 38 and 45</span> or pertaining to the
      rare earths.<br>
      <br>
      The activation is reinforced when the air supplies compressed are
      also appeared as curves CN, since the compressed air being used to
      put the fluid one to treat in movement, is itself activated.<br>
      <br>
      A mode prefered of realization of the invention consists in using,
      for the construction of the final curve CN, of elongated left
      cycloid.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor moreover noted that the bound phenomenon of
      activation to the shapes of the curve CN, present a variable
      effectiveness according to the value of NR. Thus, the activation
      is maximum in the case of conduits in the form of a C<sub>3</sub>
      curve, namely in the case of cycloid left lengthened final C3
      being rolled up around cycloid left lengthened intermediate C<sub>2</sub>
      itself rolled up around cycloid left lengthened C<sub>1</sub>
      departure.<br>
      <br>
      Various other characteristics and benefits of the invention arise
      from the description made below in reference to the annexed
      drawings which show, as nonrestrictive example, an embodiment of
      the object of the invention.<br>

      <br>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3</span> is a view of
      two hemispheres for the invention.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in the Figure 1, the device of activation of fluid,
      includes a tank of inlet 1 of fluid to activate, an unit of
      treatment 2 as well as a tank from extended 3 of fluid treatment.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that these three entities constituting of the
      installation, rest on frames, respectively 41, 42 and 43, with an
      increasingly low height progressively with the circulation of the
      fluid one.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, this last is facilitated by the action of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      The whole of the device includes/understands two conduits 51 and
      52 of circulation of fluid inserted in the unit of treatment 2,
      like three conduits 61, 62 and 63 of compressed gas arrival
      intended to ensure the circulation of fluid along the installation
      and respectively laid out in relation to the tank of inlet 1, the
      unit of treatment 2 and the tank of exit 3.<br>
      <br>
      The specific profile and the nature of these conduits 5, 6 are
      substantial for the invention. As represented on the figure 2b,
      each one of these conduits present in the shape of a C<sub>3</sub>
      curve formed by cycloid left lengthened final rolled up around
      elongated left cycloid intermediate C<sub>2</sub> itself rolled up
      around cycloid C<sub>1</sub> departure.<br>
      <br>
      For the construction of C<sub>3</sub>, it is first of all a
      question of considering cycloid&nbsp; C<sub>1</sub>, such as
      illustrated in Figure 2a.<br>
      <br>
      Within the sense of the invention, cycloid C1 in the orthonormal
      reference mark (x, y, z) results from the movement of a point A
      located on a diameter of circle EC but at a great distance from
      the center to the ray, when this circle rolls on straight D (which
      corresponds in the present case to the axis of the abscissae) in
      the direction of the F<sub>1</sub> arrow and at the same time
      turns around this straight D following the F<sub>2</sub> arrow. On
      the Figure 2a, the features dotted lines are reproduced the parts
      of the curve which are invisible if one considers opaque plane P<sub>1</sub>,
      P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>, whereas the full features
      correspond to visible parts of the curve, namely whose points
      present at the same time a positive abscissa, ordinate and a
      dimension. It will be noted that the period of cycloid is of 2K
      what corresponds then to the A' point and that circle EC carries
      out a full rotation around straight over a length of 2s radians.
      The points A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3 </sub>represent



      the intersection of the curve with respectively planes P<sub>1</sub>,
      P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>.<br>
      <br>
      It is averred that the layout of C<sub>2</sub> involves a slight
      modification of the form of C<sub>1</sub> which is not thus
      celongated ompletely any more left cycloid. I<sub>1</sub> is the
      same when one passes to the development of C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>
      and again C<sub>1</sub> are slightly deformed. There is not thus a
      stringent construction like that which one applique in the theory
      of the said objects fractals but it is to some extent a
      generalization of the concept of fractal object. One is presented
      with a new class of objects.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, about the curves C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>…
      one will keep the denominations of cycloid.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to consider shortened left cycloids, same as
      the periods of complete rotation of the circle around the straight
      one which are different of 2 pi radians, for example ranging
      between pi and 2 pi radians.<br>
      <br>
      As the Figure 2b indicates it, the C<sub>1</sub> curve as built
      above, is used then as support with the curve C<sub>2</sub> which
      is cycloid left lengthened in the referential one curves bound in
      C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>3</sub> being carried out in the form of
      cycloid left lengthened in the referential one curves bound in C<sub>2</sub>.
      The parts of C3 located nearest of the observer are represented in
      thicker feature.<br>
      <br>
      The conduits of circulation are appeared as such a C<sub>3</sub>
      curve and allow a responsive activation of fluid the through one.
      Indeed, each element of fluid being at a given point P<sub>3</sub>
      of C<sub>3</sub>, behaves as if it were at the same time in P<sub>1</sub>,
      P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>
      being far away from the respective origins O<sub>l</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
      from C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> of an equal distance to that
      separating O<sub>3</sub> from P<sub>3</sub>, although the curves C<sub>1</sub>
      and C<sub>2</sub> do not exist materially in the installation.<br>
      <br>
      The conduits of circulation 5 present an hexagonal transverse
      section, or type of a curve of the third degree presenting of the
      points of inflection.<br>
      <br>
      In order to stabilize the phenomenon of activation, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">the conduits are made out of bound
        copper with 2% in weight with for example of indium, molybdenum</span>,
      etc…<br>
      <br>
      Conduits 6 of compressed gas arrival are also formed in a C3
      curve. However, if it is beneficial to carry them out this kind
      since one active the compressed gas which itself active all the
      more the fluid one, it is not a question of an absolute
      requirement.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, these conduits of gas arrival can present a conventional
      profile, such as helical serpentine or straight tube with circular
      section.<br>
      <br>
      The tank of inlet 1 whose capacity is selected according to the
      possibilities of the installation, is fed, via a valve of inlet 7,
      into fluid to treat whose circulation is ensured by compressed gas
      coming of the conduit 6<sub>1</sub> previously described.<br>
      <br>
      The unit of treatment 2 is laid out immediately downstream from
      the tank of inlet 1, and includes, in addition to two conduits 5
      of circulation previously described, an intermediate tank 8 laid
      out between these two conduits 5. This tank is the seat of an
      additional activation conferred by the presence of a system 10 of
      two hemispheres.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in the figure 3, this system 10 includes two thereafter
      half hemispheres 11 and 12, refer respectively inner and outer.<br>
      <br>
      These two half hemispheres are hollow, thus defining four surfaces<br>
      - S1 the outer surface of the outer hemisphere 11<br>
      - S2 the inner surface of the outer hemisphere 11<br>
      - S3 the outer surface of the inner hemisphere 12<br>
      - S4 the inner surface of the inner hemisphere 12.<br>
      <br>
      Each surface Sn, for <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
      of 1 to 4, corresponds to surface truncated with constant curve
      generated by the curve of parametric equation:<br>
      <br>
      x = a<sub>n</sub> ( t - th t )<br>
      <br>
      y = a<sub>n</sub> / cht ; a<sub>n</sub> &gt; 0<br>
      <br>
      rotating around its asymptote yy', for <span style="font-style:
        italic;">n</span> from 1 to 4 and a<sub>4</sub> &lt; a<sub>3</sub>
      &lt; a<sub>2</sub> &lt; a<sub>l</sub><br>
      <br>
      Abscissa <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> will have for
      example like maximum value 5a<sub>n</sub> with 6a<sub>n</sub>.<br>
      <br>
      System 10 is adapted to enter in rotation around its asymptotic
      axis yy', for example under the effect of a power unit 14.<br>
      <br>
      Both half hemispheres 11 and 12 are subjugated by means of two
      cross-pieces 13 sparing a passage making it possible fluid to
      circulate between surfaces<br>
      S<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>3</sub> in the form of a centripetal
      helical movement.<br>
      <br>
      A throat 15 moreover is spared in spiral with the S<sub>3</sub>
      surface level, so that rotation can be generated by the fluid
      arriving one under pressure without the assistance of the group
      14. It is also possible to carry out such a throat on S<sub>2</sub>
      surface, in the place of the throat spared on S<sub>3</sub> or to
      complement of this last.<br>
      <br>
      The thickness of the half hemispheres is selected so as to
      guarantee a sufficient rigidity of the system according to the
      number of revolutions to which this last east compels to turn.<br>
      <br>
      The obstruction of cross-pieces 13 is as reduced as possible, in
      order to domestic a passage between the two hemispheres which
      present of maximum dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      Another possibility consists in using only one half hollow
      hemisphere on the inner surface of which a throat in spiral is
      laid out.<br>
      <br>
      Like stated in Figure 1, a conduit 6 of compressed gas describes
      previously emerges in the vicinity of the system of hemispheres,
      on the side of the section of lower dimension of these last, in
      order to drive back the fluid circulating one between surfaces S<sub>2</sub>
      and S<sub>3</sub>, like inside hemisphere 12.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a single hemisphere, the compressed gas arrival is
      carried out so as to drive back the fluid circulating one inside
      the hemisphere.<br>
      <br>
      Downstream from this last the tank 3 is laid out of extended of
      fluid which is capable to be delivered under pressure via the gas
      63 conduit described previously. The fluid treaty is distributed
      by means of the valve from extended 17.<br>
      <br>
      A tap 16 located at extended of tank 8, makes it possible in
      closed position to prolong the stay of fluid in the tank, and
      allows in open position the passage of fluid in the second conduit
      of circulation 52.<br>
      <br>
      The conformation of the device of activation according to the
      invention is capable different modifications.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the specialist of the profession is capable to provide the
      unit with treatment of conduits of circulation or additional
      systems of hemispheres, or to add another gas arrival compressed
      to the level of the tank of inlet. All these modifications
      contribute to improve the effectiveness of the activation.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the described installation cidessus allows the
      carrying in work of a process aiming at activating the fluid ones.<br>
      <br>
      It is a question of making circulate the fluid one to treat within
      the installation by means of compressed gas, under a pressure
      ranging between 1 and 8 bars. A maximum activation is obtained
      when this pressure is applied of sinusoidal manner or in square
      waves. It is possible to make circulate fluid uninterrupted, by
      leaving tap 16 in open position.<br>
      <br>
      Another possibility consists in turning off this tap 16 as well as
      the valve of inlet 7 and making circulate a quantity limited of
      fluid within tank 8, and in particular between the two half
      hemispheres 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      Then, it is a question of driving back this quantity of fluid per
      opening of tap 16, and of renewing the fluid one to treat by
      opening the valve of inlet 7.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that circulation between the two half
      hemispheres 11 and 12 can be ensured in the two directions, by
      modulating the pressures to which the compressed gas in the
      respective conduits 61 and 62 is delivered.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A more labile activation of fluid
        to treat can be conferred by the action of electromagnetic rays.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Those are applied on different
        portions of the unit of treatment within which circulates fluid,
        pendent the one two hours minimum duration, preferably three
        hours, and present a length of wave belonging to the one of the
        following intervals: 3800 to 3860 A, 4400 to 4480 A, 5500 to
        5600 A and 8000 to 8700 A.</span><br>
      <br>
      The according device and the process with the invention are
      capable numerous applying, in addition to the activation of fluid
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      It is indeed possible to apply the invention to purification and
      in particular, with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">desalination




        of water</span>.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, it is preferably advisable to place, downstream
      from the tank of inlet, a filter intended to eliminate the coarse
      impurities.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, this device allows an <span style="font-weight: bold;">effective
treatment




        of industrial fume</span>s showing a high rate of pollution.<br>
      <br>
      In the two cases mentioned above, the fluid treaty, namely
      respectively <span style="font-weight: bold;">water and smoke</span>,
      is at the same time purified and activated.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also finds its applying in the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">activation of glasses</span>. For
      this making, one uses fluid, preferably oil or oil, activated by
      means of the device and process described above, in which one
      carries out a hardening of glass placed at a temperature of 850 C
      with 1800 C, preferably 900 C with 1000 C.<br>
      <br>
      The activation of glass appears as of hardening, and develops at
      the time of the return to ordinary temperature.<br>
      <br>
      After examination with the electron microscope with scanning, one
      notes the presence, within glass, of microbubbles of which the
      diameter and the distribution characterizes the process of
      hardening thanks to activated material.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to obtain <span style="font-weight: bold;">effects
        of ageing of products of alcohol wine</span> contained in
      containers made out of such activated glasses. Glass bottles
      activated containing of alcohols such as cognac and Armagnac,
      transmit the activation to liquid which lose in some weeks a
      degree of alcohol; their color becomes amber, their ethyl taste
      disappears as in the case of aged alcohol after several years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">These activated microbubble
        glasses transmit their properties to the forms and objects which
        can be associated for them. Thus, microwave furnaces associated
        with such glasses activates the food which they heat</span>. One
      can also apply the invention with the glazings of greenhouses, of
      buildings, with the bezels with colorless and coloured glasses,
      windshields of cars and to bottles intended for containment of
      liquid food, or of the fragrances, or solutions of medical
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      The invention finds moreover its applying in the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">activation of the alloyed pure metals
        or, ceramic, the hard plastic materials and the fired grounds.
        For this purpose, it is advisable to plunge material to be
        treated in fluid activated as a preliminary, preferably of oil
        or oil. Then, it is a question of treating the unit to
        low-temperature, namely - 40 C and preferably with - 80 C, for
        at least 1 hour</span>.<br>
      <br>
      The increase at ordinary temperature by no means affects the
      activation of treated materials. Moreover, these last is capable
      to propagate their properties with their contents, in the through
      case of containers for example, and also with the electromagnetic
      waves these containers or reflecting on their surface.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is not limited to the examples described and
      represented, since various modifications can be brought there
      without leaving its frame. <br>

        The present invention refers to a device of application
        emissions due to the forms to matter in motion, in particular
        with fluids in motion or conductive ones traversed by electrical
        current.<br>
        <br>
        It is known that certain geometric forms are the seat of
        emissions of which we have not been able to determine the
        nature, and one knows that the emissions produced by these forms
        can have a certain influence on matter laid out near the
        transmitting forms.<br>
        <br>
        Until present, one could not put clearly in evidence and
        industrially exploit the effect of the emissions due to the
        forms on material in movement, which constitutes a substantial
        field of application.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention has as an object a device making it
        possible to apply emissions due to the forms to material in
        movement, in particular with the fluid ones in movement, like
        the conductive ones traversed by electrical current.<br>
        <br>
        The according device with the present invention comprises
        essentially a geometric form with symmetry of revolution in the
        axis of which passes the fluid one in movement or the conductive
        one traversed by an electrical current. Preferably, the tube
        making it possible to make pass the fluid one in the geometric,
        or the aforementioned form conductive, is engaged with force in
        the axial hole bored in the aforementioned geometric form, in
        order to ensure the improved possible mechanical contact between
        the form and the tube or the conductive one.<br>
        <br>
        According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
        aforementioned geometric form is <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">a cylinder with one of its ends finishing by a conical
          prolongation being downstream compared to the movement of
          fluid or the electrons of the electrical current, and whose
          point angle is preferably 33 degrees, and the axial length of
          the cylindrical portion of the form is substantially equal
          with 2.3 times its diameter outer. Preferably, the axial bore
          is less or equal with the one-tenth the outer diameter of the
          aforesaid cylindrical portion.</span><br>
        <br>
        According to a feature of the preferred embodiment, one bores in
        the aforementioned cylindrical portion <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">two radial holes located
          substantially on the same generator and having advantageously
          one-tenth the diameter of the axial hole.</span><br>
        <br>
        In a way particularly beneficial, <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">the distance between the planar frontal face of the
          geometric form and the edges of the aforesaid holes close to
          this frontal face is respectively 0.3 and 1.5 times the outer
          diameter of the aforesaid the cylindrical portion.</span><br>
        <br>
        In a beneficial way, one can associate the form of the invention
        other geometric forms laid out near it. One can also associate
        an electric and/or magnetic and/or electromagnetic field the
        form of the invention.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention will be better understood using the
        detailed description of a given embodiment like nonrestrictive
        example illustrated by the annexed drawing of which the single
        figure is an axial cross-section of an according form to the
        present invention.<br>
        <br>
        Form 1 represented on the drawing is a geometric form of
        revolution around an axis 2. Form 1 includes a first part 3
        cylindrical outer diameter D and length L, and a second part 4,
        formed integrally with first part 3, being presented in the form
        of a cone whose base has the same diameter D that the
        cylindrical portion 3 and whose point angle A is advantageously
        of 33 degrees, the base of this cone being confused with one of
        the bases of cylindrical portion 3. Form 1 can be made as well
        out of electrically conductive material as out of insulating
        material, this material being densest possible.<br>
        <br>
        Form 1 is drilled of an axial hole 5 whose diameter is less or
        equal with one-tenth diameter D. In hole 5 one inserts into
        force a tube (not represented) traversed by fluid or conductive
        electric traversed by an electrical current, in order to apply
        has this fluid or with this electrical current the emissions due
        to form 1. Tapered portion 4 of form 1 is located downstream
        from this form have regard at the direction of flow of fluid or
        within the meaning of passage of the electrons of the electrical
        current.<br>
        <br>
        Along a generator of cylindrical portion 3, one bores two radial
        holes, 6 and 7 respectively, these two holes emerging with
        l1exterior and in hole 5. Holes 6 and 7 have substantially the
        same diameter as hole 5. The distances L1 and L2, respectively
        measured since the planar frontal face 8 of form 1 to the edge
        more close to this planar face of holes 6 and 7, are
        substantially equal to 0.3 and 1.5 times respectively diameter
        D. These holes 6 and 7 are mainly intended has to stabilize and
        to increase the level of the emissions due to form 1 and exert
        itself on the fluid one or the electrical current passing
        through this form.<br>
        <br>
        Fluid through form 1 can for example be water for agriculture,
        or fluid incoming in a chemical reaction. The through electrical
        current form 1 is for example the current one supplying the
        electrodes of an apparatus of electromedical care, or the
        current supplying the ignition of a combustion engine. In all
        these applications, the emissions due to form 1 are intended to
        improve the effects produced by these fluid or these electrical
        currents and/or to bring new and beneficial effects.<br>
        <br>
        The diameter D of form 1, and thus its other dimensions, which
        all are function of this diameter according to defined
        relations, must, like be specified above, great or equal with 10
        times the of the aforesaid diameter tubes in which fluid or of
        the aforesaid the conductive electric one passes. This <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">diameter D is at least 1 cm, and
          can be advantageously of 10 cm or more</span>. <br>
