      <b><font size="+1">I. Some Thoughts on GW-Type Communications and
          Energy Extraction Systems</font></b>
      <p><b>A. Background</b> </p>
      <p>It appears that a very large corporation was interested in GW
        communications (as reported on the Internet). Since I have never
        released too much material on this, this Note will indicate that
        I am well aware of the potentials of this mode of communication!
        I will not give details but only mention some of the prospects.
      </p>
      <p><b>B. Some Basics</b> </p>
      <p>The gravitational ‘waves’, GW (G-fields) used in Rhysmonics are
        the infinitely long ‘instantaneous’ impulses due to the
        Rhysmonic structure of our Universe (as described and defined in
        many releases of my work). Some fundamental ‘constants’ in this
        cosmology are repeated here: </p>
      <p>L*: the ‘quantum’ of Length <br>
        T*: the ‘quantum’ of Time <br>
        M*: the ‘quantum’ of Mass <br>
        C*: the ‘quantum’ of Velocity ( L* / T* ) <br>
        E*: the ‘quantum’ of Energy (E* = M*C*<sup>2</sup> ) <br>
        f*: the basic Rhysmonic frequency ( 1 / T* ) <br>
        fo*: a selected Rhysmonic Sub-Frequency (channel) <br>
        G: Rhysmonic Flux (Newton’s G) <br>
        G: Gravity Flux near Earth </p>
      <p>While some of the above ‘constants’ may also be involved in
        Relativity Theory, Rhysmonic Theory is not, in general,
        concerned with many of Einstein’s views, but is much more basic.
        Propagation of gravitation in Relativity is given at the speed
        of light (C*), for example, while in Rhysmonic Theory it is
        given as at a fixed time (T*), for any distance! Thus, it is
        essentially ‘instantaneous’ universe-wide! Without going into
        detail, some advantages of GW communication are now cited. </p>
      <p><b>C. GW Communication Advantages</b> </p>
      <p>1. Greater than 10<sup>40</sup> theoretical resonant frequency
        channels (f<sub>o</sub>*) are possible. <br>
        2. Voice, video, and other pulse-type operations possible using
        digital techniques. <br>
        3. Instantaneous communication <br>
        4. Universe-wide communication <br>
        5. Pulse code operation, i.e., Morse Code. <br>
        6. Security code adaptable <br>
        7. Mechanical and/or electronic modulation techniques usable. <br>
        8. No EM radiation involved. <br>
        9. Very low power operation <br>
        10. Many system designs possible <br>
        11. No cross-talk between channels? <br>
        12. Mind-operable systems are possible (ESP?) </p>
      <p>These are only a few of the many possible advantages of using
        GW communications. </p>
      <p><b>II. Some Disadvantages (?)</b> </p>
      <p>1. Some channels might be ‘swamped’ by strong naturally
        occurring signals, and also possibly by strong man-made signals?
      </p>
      <p>2. Communications may be more useful at the lower resonant
        frequency channels (f<sub>o</sub>*), but the energy extraction
        channels (f<sub>o</sub>*) may be more effective at higher
        frequencies? </p>
      <p><b>III. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>1. The Rhysmonic approach to the structure of our Universe will
        eventually enable an almost unlimited number of ‘instantaneous’
        communication channels, as well as almost unlimited GW-energy
        extraction channels. </p>
      <p>2. The means for all this can be developed by knowledgeable
        experimenters (at low cost) since the systems are essentially
        very low power. It could be there for you if you will enter this
        research. This would be like the early days of radio, when the
        amateur experimenters helped to develop radio. Otherwise, the
        money-rich corporations will try to monopolize the research and
        thus the benefits to mankind! </p>
      <p>Go for it!</p>
