              Some Reflections on Rhysmonic Cosmology</font></b> </p>

      <p><b>A. Background</b> </p>
      <p>Recently I started reading Maxwell’s Theory of Quaternions. IN
        his introductory remarks on the units of mechanics, i.e., mass,
        length and time (MLT), he came up with an interesting remark on
        mass. That was before Planck’s time, so he was unaware of
        Planck’s natural Units. But he did remark that a unit of mass,
        for reasons he gave, would be related to the expression L^3 /
        T^2 . Of course, Maxwell was aware of Newton’s G constant, but
        it immediately struck me that the relation was to G itself! G
        contains that expression as well as grams, which is the unit of
        mass! While Maxwell was only familiar with the arbitrary units
        of mass, length, of time, I used the Rhysmonic (Planck) units
        for length and time. Thus: </p>
      <p>M* = <u>L* / T*</u><sup>2</sup>&nbsp; = 2.17 x 10<sup>5</sup>
        grams. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
G








      </p>
      <p>This is the same as determined in the Planck Relations! Thus,
        if Maxwell had known of Natural Units he would have arrived at
        ‘quantumized’ constants? </p>
      <p><b>B. Remarks</b> </p>
      <p>Planck had ‘quantumized’ initially M*, L*, T*, and temperature,
        K* (?). I have included force, F*, and momentum, P*, but there
        may be others. Planck initially considered all this an
        interesting ‘aside’!! More research is needed here. </p>
      <p><b>C. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic Cosmology may be developing into that long sought
        ‘Theory of Everything’ (TOE)? I have much unrelated material
        yet, and I invite open-minded researchers to join in this
        development. Even you amateur experimenter researchers can help
        as you did in the early days of radio. Go for it!<br>
