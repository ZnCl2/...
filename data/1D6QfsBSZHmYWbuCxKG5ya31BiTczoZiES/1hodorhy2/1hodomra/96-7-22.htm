            &nbsp; I. Some More Speculations on the Mini-MRA</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        Even though I was only able to apply very limited effort on the
        Mini-MRA device, I have released to you many thoughts and
        experiments, some of which could be quite significant for an
        understanding of the operation of this device. The viewpoints
        are from Rhysmonic Cosmology and those of you who are quite
        familiar with some of its premises should be able to understand
        the following discussions: </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
          Figure 1</b> </p>

          A. Simplified Sketch of the Mini-MRA</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        Shown above is a very simple depiction of the peak one-half
        cycle of the 'flow' of scalar flux in the Mini-MRA. In normal
        theory, one considers that when energy is being 'stored' in the
        capacitor's 'field', energy is being 'returned' from the
        inductor's 'field'. Rhysmonic Theory goes well beyond that
        simple statement and speculates that the capacitor 'flux' is
        'exciting' the universe (or some component of it) and that the
        inductor 'flux' is also 'exciting' the universe. That this is so
        has been reported to you in many simple experiments and some
        Notes and papers in the past. However, as depicted above, these
        two flux components are 180° out-of-phase and also a function of
        the resonant frequency. It is also emphasized that good
        sinusoidal waveforms and resistive loads are necessary for this
        circuit to work! </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
          B. Further Remarks on This Operation</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (1) While the <u>intrinsic</u> rhysmonic flux of the universe s
        'instantaneous' and 'omni-directional', there are also many
        other 'directed' fluxes due to various universe and terrestrial
        factors. A few common terrestrial factors are the earth's
        G-field, E-field, magnetic field, as well as the many components
        in the ionosphere and near-earth, due to emissions from the sun,
        and possible <u>other</u> cosmic emissions. Thus, the universe
        is a vast source of energy, both <u>intrinsic</u> and also '<u>converted</u>'.





        The converted energies are presently being utilized, much of it
        being rapidly exhausted and much of it polluting the earth. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (2) The scalar-type 'flux' being developed by the reactances
        through the action of the driving source, i.e., the generator,
        will be as shown by the solid lines in the depiction above,
        while the interactions possible in the universe will be simply
        depicted by the dotted lines while the orientation of the
        reactances possibly could be directed for enhanced interactions
        (say, with the earth's G- or E-fields), the positioning, in
        general, will be immaterial, since there always will be a <u>substantial</u>
        component of rhysmonic flux in <u>any</u> direction. The
        'driven' reactances will 'pump' the universe (or some component
        of it). Many past rhysmonic experiments have shown this to be
        the case and such 'pumping' was found to 'magnify' the energy
        levels in possible 'resonance' in these interactions. The higher
        the drive level of the 'pump', i.e., the drive, the higher the
        level of interactions. Also, the longer the 'pump' acts, the
        greater the level of interaction up to some <u>limiting level</u>.
        This has also been proven in other simple rhysmonic experiments,
        many of which have been released in the past, and <u>some</u>
        of which <u>were not</u>! Since most of these experiments are
        so simple, one only needs to perform them (which I find many are
        reluctant to do so since they are so unconventional!). </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (3) Due to the nature of some of the 'directed' rhysmonic
        fluxes, the performance of the Mini-MRA could vary with the
        rotation of the earth, i.e., the time of day; but in general,
        the interaction is found to be relatively constant. The
        interaction is essentially between parallel scalar-field
        components and thus one of simple superposition of fields
        (potential) and thus only simple algebraic addition of flux is
        required. While certain 'resonant' frequencies could enhance the
        interaction with certain directed flux components, the long time
        constant of these circuits compared to the <u>very high</u>
        basic rhysmonic (intrinsic) frequencies will ensure at least a
        measure of interaction at <u>all</u> the frequencies of
        operation (provided resonance occurs). </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (4) The flux interaction in the universe (depicted by the dotted
        lines in the sketch) is <u>repetitive</u> at the resonant
        frequency and thus should also complete the reactive circuit
        (perhaps <u>no</u> line return may be needed?). Therefore, the
        sensing resistor, R<sub>S</sub>, could directly determine this
        reactive 'circulating' current. With the proper design of the
        reactive elements and a proper frequency of operation, this
        reactive current could be made <u>many</u>, <u>many</u> times
        greater than the generator line current needed to sustain this
        mode of operation. The reactive voltage across L<sub>1</sub>
        would be i<sub>circ</sub> x X<sub>L1</sub>, and could be vary
        large. However, due to the 90° phase difference between the
        reactive voltages and reactive currents, <u>no</u> appreciable
        dissipation losses will be sustained in this reactive
        'circulating loop'. The high reactive voltage in L<sub>1</sub>
        can be transformer-coupled to L<sub>2</sub>, where this high
        voltage could now drive a large <u>real</u> current (in phase
        with the voltage) and thus develop large <u>real</u> power <u>in






          the load, R<sub>L</sub></u>. This has been confirmed in many
        Mini-MRA tests, but again I must caution you that solid state
        sources can react to the scalar fluxes being developed here and
        thus distort the drive input and even destroy the source! </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
          II. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        As usual, the above speculative remarks on the possible
        operation of the Mini-MRA are primarily aimed at getting more of
        you more actively involved in these simple tests. All
        indications are that the MRA is for <u>real</u> and possibly a
        <u>great new source</u> of space energy which will be both
        inexhaustible and also non-polluting. While these exploratory
        tests are yet at low levels, there is every reason to believe
        that very high levels will be achieved with this technique.
        Witness the Swiss M-L, which to me appears to be but a <u>Super</u>
        MRA device! </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        Rhysmonic Cosmology is basically used in these discussions ---
        it is a <u>real</u> science --- and many experiments have shown
        it to be so. Much has been released to you in past Notes and
        papers, both published and unpublished. Also, there is <u>much</u>
        that has not yet been released --- to use the Swiss M-L group's
        phrase, "Mankind may not be ready for it yet". In any case, I
        wish you all well and continued good experimenting. </p>
