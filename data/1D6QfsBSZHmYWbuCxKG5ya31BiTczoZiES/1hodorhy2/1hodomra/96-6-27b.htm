      <p><b>I. Some Recent Updated Tests of the Original Mini-MRA</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">A
        fresh breadboard was assembled for these tests as shown in
        Figure (1). One change is that the circulating current sensing
        resistor R<sub>S</sub> was placed between the two reactances.
        Since strong scalar-type fields are believed to be generated by
        this circuitry, this position could be more balanced. At
        resonance, the generator line current would normally be
        determined by the remaining resistance in the line, since the
        line reactances are essentially cancelled out. This does not
        means that the reactive voltages and currents are not present
        --- they are! However, since the reactive voltages and currents
        are 90° out-of-phase, there is essentially <u>no</u> power
        losses (dissipation) in this line. Moreover, the reactive
        currents in a series circuit are in-phase and thus should appear
        as the circulatory current in the line. This could be directly
        measured by the sampling resistance R<sub>S</sub>, or also
        calculated from the measured voltage across, say resistance L<sub>i</sub>;
        e.g., </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">I<sub>circ</sub>
        = V<sub>L1</sub> / X<sub>L1</sub> = V<sub>L1</sub> / 2?fL<sub>1</sub>
        <u>~</u> 21.2 / 2545 <u>~</u> 8.3 mA </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">For
        the test of Table (1). The i<sub>circ</sub> as determined by the
        sampling resistor R<sub>S</sub> was about 5.8 mA as given in
        Table (1). The difference seen here might be due to the
        sensitivity of the scope probe to other scalar components
        present here. With a calculated line current (i<sub>G</sub>) of
        about 0.56 mA, it is seen that the circulating line current is
        more than 10X the generator current. Where does this excess
        current come from? It is my belief that the scalar-type flux
        being generated by the capacitance and inductor of this circuit
        may be 'interacting' with the aether (or some other
        aether-related fields) and thus, in effect, 'extracting' this
        additional flux energy. The generator is a source of the voltage
        (potential) to drive this series circuit, and thus the 'drive
        power' would be determined by the power dissipated in the
        generator <u>resistive</u> source impedance of about 5 KOhms,
        i.e., P<sub>in</sub> = V<sub>G</sub> x i<sub>G</sub>. Again,
        remember that there are no real losses in the series circuit
        line due to the 90° phase difference between the reactive terms.
        However, the reactive power (or VAR) <u>exists</u> and it is of
        high magnitude. In this simple circuit, the high reactive
        voltage (potential) developed in L<sub>1</sub> is transformed
        (and stepped down) in the secondary winding, L<sub>2</sub>. This
        stepped down voltage will now drive a <u>real</u> current in
        the 1 KOhm load resistance, R<sub>L</sub>, and thus <u>real</u>
        power is developed at the output. The use of resistive sources
        and loads in this circuitry will enable the calculation of true
        RMS powers since the voltages and currents are in-phase under
        such conditions. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b>II.






          Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">The
        tests as given here continue to indicate <u>real</u> power
        gains for the Mini-MRA, even with calibrated oscilloscope tests.
        The use of digital-type meters (outside of their calibrated
        ranges in these tests) will not measure <u>true</u> RMS
        voltages and currents, but the power gains determined could be
        valid provided the waveforms are truly sinusoidal. Thus, these <u>types






          of tests</u> could be made by researchers with limited
        equipment and means. However, it must be emphasized that if
        phase-shift complications are to be avoided, the source and load
        <u>must</u> be resistive and the waveforms sinusoidal. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">Finally,
while






        the enclosed tests are believed to be valid, only <u>more</u>
        independent testing (possibly using other components) will
        really settle the issue of over-unity operation for MA-type
        devices. In the long run a 'stand-alone' operation will make any
        measurement questions moot! While my efforts are still quite
        limited, I will continue with that quest as time permits. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">Meanwhile,
good






        experimenting to all!</p>
