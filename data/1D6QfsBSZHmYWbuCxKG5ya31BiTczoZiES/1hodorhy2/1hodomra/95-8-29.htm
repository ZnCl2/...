More






          on the Mini-MRA</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        Here are some additional speculations on the operation of the
        MRA (and the Mini-MRA in particular) from the Rhysmonic
        Cosmology viewpoint. Shown in Figure (1) is a simplified and
        idealized depiction of the original Mini-MRA test. The sketch
        has been arranged so as to emphasize the possible 'interactions'
        between the MRA scalar fields and the earth's scalar gravity
        field. These interactions are believed to be the source of the
        'extra power' seen with this device. For these 'space energy'
        interactions to be most effective, it is believed that the
        capacitor must be of the stacked layer type, and the inductor
        must be of the open 'flux circuit' type. To emphasize the
        interactions with the earth's gravity field, the sketch was
        arranged to show the possible orientations needed for maximum
        effect. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>

      </center>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">The
        MRA is basically a series resonant circuit which is 'excited' by
        a low level sine wave signal generator of some sort. It is
        believed that the signal generator should be primarily <u>resistive</u>
        in nature for maximum performance. In essence, the MRA is a <u>parametric</u>
        or 'reactance' type of power amplifier. Each 'pole' or reactance
        is a source and a sink of scalar type field as indicated in
        Figure (1). It is speculated that the returning flux fields in
        each reactance will 'extract' some additional energy from the
        earth's g-field in a simple superposition of scalar fields, and
        thus <u>sum</u> their amplitudes. Using only a very small
        amount of energy from the local signal source (at resonance) the
        circuit will develop high <u>reactive</u> powers which will be
        'exchanged' between the capacitor and inductor. For example,
        when energy is being stored in the capacitor electric scalar
        field, energy will be returning to the circuit from the
        inductor's scalar magnetic field, and vice versa. This is
        normally considered electronic theory. Rhysmonic theory,
        however, also infers that the returning flux to both the
        capacitor and the inductor will be 'augmented' at least two to
        four times (and even more in some special cases) in the scalar
        interaction with the earth's scalar field) or possible some
        other universe scalar fields?). This means that the reactive
        'circulating' current in the series resonant circuit would also
        be at least two to four times the <u>real</u> current being
        drawn from the local generator source. Thus, the reactive powers
        could be increased by the current <u>squared</u>, or at least
        four to sixteen times! This has been verified in some of my past
        coil experiments. The reason for this is that, <u>circuit-wise</u>,
        the reactances of the capacitor and inductor are 180° out of
        phase and thus would 'cancel out', leaving only the residual
        resistance in the series circuit to determine the real current
        level. However, since each reactive voltage is 90° out of phase
        with the reactive current, the reactive powers are essentially
        non-dissipative (or lossless), assuming low loss components are
        used. Thus, the real powers, as a function of EI cos Ø, are
        essentially zero, but the reactive powers, as a function of EI <u>sin</u>
        Ø, are at their highest levels! The reactive powers continue to
        exist at resonance --- they are <u>not</u> cancelled out ---
        and the high reactive voltages can be measured across each
        reactance! The MRA makes use of the high reactive power
        developed across inductor L<sub>1</sub> of Figure (1) available
        to a real load across L<sub>2</sub> through the use of
        transformer action. Some of these reactions and other data are
        summarized also in Figure (1) for your convenience. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
          II. Some Additional Comments</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (1) At resonance, in a <u>properly working&nbsp;</u> Mini-MRA
        circuit, all waveforms are essentially sinusoidal and quite
        similar. Thus, <u>most</u> true RMS reading meters can be used
        to make <u>relative</u> power gain measurements, even somewhat
        outside of their normally calibrated ranges! </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        (2) At slightly off-resonance conditions, some additional
        waveforms may be seen superimposed upon the generator-induced
        waveforms. These were recognized by the writer as quite similar
        to those 'seen' with his gravity wave detector units, which are
        known to interact with cosmic induced 'modulations' on the
        earth's gravity field. While the gravity detectors generally
        have only <u>one</u> active pole, the presence of <u>two</u>
        active poles in the MRA can and does at times complicate these
        interactions. However, the effect seems to increase the
        parametric or reactive amplification --- thus the output powers
        here would be best determined with rectifications and thus as a
        DC power. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">(3)
        In general, the real power developed in the resistive load
        across the secondary, L<sub>2</sub>, is a clean sinusoidal even
        under off-resonance conditions. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
          III. Some Final Remarks</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        The writer feels that the MRA is for real and a potential <u>new






          energy source</u> for mankind. It is free from pollution
        effects and uses a universal energy source which cannot be
        depleted! </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        It is also speculated that the 60 Hz energy source experiments
        using ferrites and coils (per Sweet) are possibly 'tapping' into
        the 50-60 Hz power grids which range over this earth. The long
        wavelengths of the 60 Hz transmission lines essentially generate
        scalar type fields which can 'excite' the universe (or possibly
        only the earth-ionosphere complex). However, this energy is
        normally returned to the power grids --- except for that which
        may be 'tapped' in this manner. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
        It may be hard to convince academia on all this, but you 'hands
        on' experimenters should be able to run these types of simple
        experiments and determine for yourself if this is real or not
        --- go for it! </p>
