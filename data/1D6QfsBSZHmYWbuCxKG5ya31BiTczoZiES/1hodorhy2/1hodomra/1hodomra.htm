        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          The operation of this circuit recently was described by
          McClain and Wootan on the Keelynet BBS and in the January 1995
          issue of <i>New Energy News</i>. Basically, the circuit
          consists of a low-level sine wave generator operating in the
          order of 20 KHz to 40 KHz driving a specially wound 1:1 ratio
          transformer using a barium ferrite <u>magnet</u> as a core.
          The input and output coils had about 150 turns of magnet wire.
          The driving source was coupled to the transformer through a
          large barium titanate (?) piezo element making this in fact a
          series resonant circuit. The output coil was coupled to a
          bridge rectifier to develop a DC output power across an
          external resistive load. You are referred to the original
          releases for more data on this circuit. The important factor
          here is that in the <u>original</u> test the apparent <u>real</u>
          input power may have been only about 0.7 watts, but the DC
          output power developed in the load was about 2.75 watts! If
          these measurements were realm then there was about a 4 times
          power gain developed here! Where did this extra power come
          from? </p>

            II. Crude Test of an MRA-Type Circuit</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          While I did not have the actual circuit elements as used by
          McClain and Wootan, I felt that this circuit was but a <u>specialized





            application</u> of a typical series resonant circuit
          consisting of a capacitance and an inductance having some
          unavoidable series resistance. I had available an old
          tube-style signal generator which ranged from 20 Hz to about
          200 KHz which could develop only about 4 mW of <u>real</u>
          power across its 5 KOhms internal output load (at 100 KHz).
          The unloaded voltage output was about 4.5 volts (AC rms) and
          they short-circuit rms current was about 0.9 ma. I had plenty
          of capacitors (including some 'piezo' type ceramics) to test
          in this circuit. For the transformer, I had some small potted
          transformers in which the coils were wound on a ferrite core
          (unmagnetized) having a 1/4" diameter and a length of 3/4".
          The primary winding appeared to have in the order of 500 turns
          of about #30 magnet wire, while the secondary may have had 1/5
          of this number of turns. The original purpose for these units
          was unknown, but the units were marked as 5.0 mH and a 5:1
          ratio. Since the possible output was expected to be low-level,
          the load in the output was made an LED device rated at 10 ma
          at 1.85 volts DC. The test circuit was thus as follows: </p>

I






          give some test results, lets briefly review some basics of
          series resonant circuits. The current 'flow' in a capacitor <u>leads</u>
          the voltage by 90° in phase, while the current 'flow' in an
          inductor <u>lags</u> the voltage by 90° in phase. Thus in a
          series resonant circuit the voltages across the C and L are
          180° out of phase <u>bu</u>t the currents are equal and
          remain in phase. At resonance, the inductive reactance and the
          capacitive reactance are equal and thus cancel out, leaving
          the current to be determined by the driving source and the
          resistance which remains. However, above resonance the
          capacitive reactance decreases and the inductive reactance
          increases, while the opposite conditions prevail below
          resonance. At resonance, the voltages across the elements are
          greater than the source voltage and depend upon the element
          Q's. Moreover, when energy is being 'stored' in the inductor's
          H-field, energy is being <u>returned</u> to the circuit from
          the capacitor's E-field, and vice versa. The power available
          is 'lossless' power or a purely reactive power in ideal
          reactances, but practical reactances always have some loss
          mechanisms, primarily of a resistive nature. Under such
          conditions we should use the term impedance rather than
          reactance. The reactive power of an inductor can be 'impedance
          matched' to useful <u>real</u> load power by the use of
          transformer action. At the high frequencies, the cores of
          these transformers are generally made of ferrite-type
          materials for reduced 'eddy current' losses and also good
          response to the high frequency changes. </p>

            III. Optimization of MRA-Type Circuits</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          To maintain a high reactive power, the reactance of the
          circuit element must be high compared to any resistive or <u>other</u>
          loss mechanisms. This will be expressed in the quality factor,
          or Q, of that element. Thus, high Q is most desirable in
          series resonant circuits. This will result in 'sharp' resonant
          frequencies and 'high' circulating currents at resonance.
          Since reactive power is equal to i<sup>2</sup>X, high Q
          generally will also mean high reactive powers. Also, the
          voltage across either the inductor or capacitor will be equal
          to QV<sub>g</sub> where V<sub>g</sub> is the voltage of the
          source generator. Thus, the voltage across the reactances can
          be many times the source voltage at resonant conditions. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          So far, we have considered normally accepted reactance and
          transformer theory. In this particular test, the following
          additional observations may also be made. During resonance,
          the capacitor and the inductor are continually being 'charged'
          and 'discharged' at the rate of the resonant frequency, which
          in the case of Figure (1) was in the order off 90 KHz. Now in
          terms of my Rhysmonic theory, the particular reactive elements
          used there can also '<u>interact</u>' with space energy during
          these cycles. It is believed that the prime source of space
          energy in this case may be that of the earth's gravity field,
          although there are probably <u>many</u> other <u>sources</u>
          out there in space. I have used capacitors and inductors as
          'detection' elements in many of my GW (<u>G</u>ravity <u>W</u>ave)






          detectors and gravimeters and have made much of the early data
          on these aspects available to interested researchers. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">To
          emphasize these interactions with space energy, e.g., the
          earth's g-field, the capacitors and inductors should be fairly
          large size and of high Q. The choice for the capacitor <u>probably</u>
          should be planar type piezo elements, and the various coil
          construction probably should contain ferrite-type cores. My
          past experience has been that capacitors are effective in GW
          detectors where high circuit gains make the small signals
          which appear in such capacitors useful, but cols may be more
          effective in terms of power <u>extraction</u> from the latent
          space energy (Ref. 2). For this very reason it was observed
          that the circuit of Figure (1) had higher power gains (more
          efficiency) when the circuit was operated somewhat above
          resonance, or about 100 KHz! Here, X<sub>C</sub> was reduced
          and X<sub>L</sub> was <u>increased</u>. Also, the <u>real</u>
          current being drawn from the source drops sharply. Thus, the
          real power being drawn from the driving source is greatly
          reduced, but the reactive power in coil L<sub>1</sub> is
          increased more than what had been obtained there at <u>peak</u>
          resonance. That reactive power present in coil L<sub>1</sub>
          can then be 'impedance matched' efficiently to a resistive
          load, e.g., the LED, across the secondary coil, L<sub>2</sub>,
          by the use of transformer action, where it becomes useful
          power output. </p>

            IV. Experimental Results</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          By carefully adjusting the frequency of the driving source in
          the circuit of Figure (1), it was possible to <u>brightly</u>
          light the LED device used as a load. The brightness was
          roughly equivalent to that seen when the LED was operated at a
          DC level of 1.85 volts and a current of 10 ma, or about 18.5
          mW DC power level. It was only possible to light the LED <u>directly</u>
          by the signal source only very <u>dimly</u> at 100 KHz.
          Checked against a DC level, that brightness was found to be
          equivalent to 1.85 volts at 1 ma or about 1.85 mW of DC power!
          The <u>real</u> power being expended by the driving source
          was about 4.53 volts (AC rms) at 0.41 ma (rms) and thus the
          driving source was also in the order of 1.84 mW. Thus my
          digital meter here was fairly close in rms readings. It can
          only be concluded here that the MRA-type test performed here
          seems to indicate a real power gain of about <u>10 times</u>!!





          This power is believed to be coming from the aether in a
          process somewhat as expressed here. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Similar type performance was also seen in a test circuit where
          the transformer coils were salvaged from a 120 V to 25 VAC
          transformer. The coils had about a 3/4" square opening into
          which I inserted two barium ferrite <u>magnets</u> which I
          obtained from Radio Shack as part # 64-1877. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            V. Conclusions</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          While this was but a crude test using some materials which I
          had available, it does tend to <u>support</u> the claims of
          McClain and Wootan as reported in their MRA releases on the
          Internet. However, here I have tried to offer some other
          speculative insights into the nature of this circuit and the <u>source</u>
          of the additional energy 'seen' with this circuit. Perhaps
          some of you can help to develop this approach further and thus
          also help to establish the <u>reality</u> of the <u>extraction</u>
          of some of the vast latent energy present in all of space!
          Possibly, winding coils on the ferrite forms found in many AM
          radios (used as antennae) could be a good place to start? In
          any event, good luck with your tests. </p>

          A. The tube-type signal generator used in this test may be
          somewhat different than most recent solid-state units. Since
          this <u>might</u> be a factor in this test, a simplified
          schematic of the setup in the test of 1-30-95 is given: </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">B.
          Since the tube-type generator was capable of less than 4 mW of
          sine wave power at 100 KHz, this test was necessarily
          low-level. The generator in this case was purely resistive and
          thus this may have been a factor in the operation of this
          particular MRA-type circuit. </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          As seen above, this is an extremely simple test, but yet it
          appears to show appreciable power gains. The secret to this
          MRA device may be determined here. It is believed to be an
          interaction of the fields from the capacitor and inductance
          with <u>external</u> scalar-type fields of high energy! </p>

More






            on the Mini-MRA</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Here are some additional speculations on the operation of the
          MRA (and the Mini-MRA in particular) from the Rhysmonic
          Cosmology viewpoint. Shown in Figure (1) is a simplified and
          idealized depiction of the original Mini-MRA test. The sketch
          has been arranged so as to emphasize the possible
          'interactions' between the MRA scalar fields and the earth's
          scalar gravity field. These interactions are believed to be
          the source of the 'extra power' seen with this device. For
          these 'space energy' interactions to be most effective, it is
          believed that the capacitor must be of the stacked layer type,
          and the inductor must be of the open 'flux circuit' type. To
          emphasize the interactions with the earth's gravity field, the
          sketch was arranged to show the possible orientations needed
          for maximum effect. </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">The
MRA






          is basically a series resonant circuit which is 'excited' by a
          low level sine wave signal generator of some sort. It is
          believed that the signal generator should be primarily <u>resistive</u>
          in nature for maximum performance. In essence, the MRA is a <u>parametric</u>
          or 'reactance' type of power amplifier. Each 'pole' or
          reactance is a source and a sink of scalar type field as
          indicated in Figure (1). It is speculated that the returning
          flux fields in each reactance will 'extract' some additional
          energy from the earth's g-field in a simple superposition of
          scalar fields, and thus <u>sum</u> their amplitudes. Using
          only a very small amount of energy from the local signal
          source (at resonance) the circuit will develop high <u>reactive</u>
          powers which will be 'exchanged' between the capacitor and
          inductor. For example, when energy is being stored in the
          capacitor electric scalar field, energy will be returning to
          the circuit from the inductor's scalar magnetic field, and
          vice versa. This is normally considered electronic theory.
          Rhysmonic theory, however, also infers that the returning flux
          to both the capacitor and the inductor will be 'augmented' at
          least two to four times (and even more in some special cases)
          in the scalar interaction with the earth's scalar field) or
          possible some other universe scalar fields?). This means that
          the reactive 'circulating' current in the series resonant
          circuit would also be at least two to four times the <u>real</u>
          current being drawn from the local generator source. Thus, the
          reactive powers could be increased by the current <u>squared</u>,
          or at least four to sixteen times! This has been verified in
          some of my past coil experiments. The reason for this is that,
          <u>circuit-wise</u>, the reactances of the capacitor and
          inductor are 180° out of phase and thus would 'cancel out',
          leaving only the residual resistance in the series circuit to
          determine the real current level. However, since each reactive
          voltage is 90° out of phase with the reactive current, the
          reactive powers are essentially non-dissipative (or lossless),
          assuming low loss components are used. Thus, the real powers,
          as a function of EI cos Ø, are essentially zero, but the
          reactive powers, as a function of EI <u>sin</u> Ø, are at
          their highest levels! The reactive powers continue to exist at
          resonance --- they are <u>not</u> cancelled out --- and the
          high reactive voltages can be measured across each reactance!
          The MRA makes use of the high reactive power developed across
          inductor L<sub>1</sub> of Figure (1) available to a real load
          across L<sub>2</sub> through the use of transformer action.
          Some of these reactions and other data are summarized also in
          Figure (1) for your convenience. </p>

            II. Some Additional Comments</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (1) At resonance, in a <u>properly working&nbsp;</u> Mini-MRA
          circuit, all waveforms are essentially sinusoidal and quite
          similar. Thus, <u>most</u> true RMS reading meters can be
          used to make <u>relative</u> power gain measurements, even
          somewhat outside of their normally calibrated ranges! </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (2) At slightly off-resonance conditions, some additional
          waveforms may be seen superimposed upon the generator-induced
          waveforms. These were recognized by the writer as quite
          similar to those 'seen' with his gravity wave detector units,
          which are known to interact with cosmic induced 'modulations'
          on the earth's gravity field. While the gravity detectors
          generally have only <u>one</u> active pole, the presence of <u>two</u>
          active poles in the MRA can and does at times complicate these
          interactions. However, the effect seems to increase the
          parametric or reactive amplification --- thus the output
          powers here would be best determined with rectifications and
          thus as a DC power. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (3) In general, the real power developed in the resistive load
          across the secondary, L<sub>2</sub>, is a clean sinusoidal
          even under off-resonance conditions. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            III. Some Final Remarks</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          The writer feels that the MRA is for real and a potential <u>new






            energy source</u> for mankind. It is free from pollution
          effects and uses a universal energy source which cannot be
          depleted! </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          It is also speculated that the 60 Hz energy source experiments
          using ferrites and coils (per Sweet) are possibly 'tapping'
          into the 50-60 Hz power grids which range over this earth. The
          long wavelengths of the 60 Hz transmission lines essentially
          generate scalar type fields which can 'excite' the universe
          (or possibly only the earth-ionosphere complex). However, this
          energy is normally returned to the power grids --- except for
          that which may be 'tapped' in this manner. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          It may be hard to convince academia on all this, but you
          'hands on' experimenters should be able to run these types of
          simple experiments and determine for yourself if this is real
          or not --- go for it! </p>

            I. Updated Tests on the Original Mini-MRA</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          A <u>new</u> breadboard of the original Mini-MRA was put
          together, using all <u>new</u> parts. The test circuit is
          shown in Figure (1). A 620 pF silver mica capacitor was used
          as C1, since the 680 pF was no longer available. Thus the
          resonance frequency was a bit higher. Previous testing had
          shown that if the current sensing resistor (R<sub>S</sub>) was
          placed between the two reactances of this series circuit, it
          was possible to <u>directly</u> measure the <u>enhanced</u>
          circulating current in the system. At resonance, the ordinary
          line current is generally determined by the DC resistance in
          the line since reactances are generally cancelled out. This
          does not mean that reactive voltages and currents are not
          present --- they are! Since the reactive voltages and currents
          are now 90° out-of-phase, there is no power dissipation. Both
          reactive voltages are reactive currents are 180° out-of-phase,
          thus they do not appear in the line RMS measurements, per se.
          However, the high reactance voltages can be measured across
          each reactance and the high reactive current is possible being
          measured across R<sub>S</sub> (in scope measurements). </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          The present circuit and test results are given in Figure (1)
          and Tables (1) and (2). The data is self-explanatory. </p>

            II. Conclusions</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Tests of the original Mini-MRA continue to indicate that these
          results are real and there is better than 10X power gains in
          these circuits (depending upon operating conditions). It would
          be nice if those of you who have received the pulse
          transformer (or your equivalent) to try these tests. One
          caution: you must use reactive sources and loads! </p>

            Recent Updated Tests of the Original Mini-MRA</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          A fresh breadboard was assembled for these tests as shown in
          Figure (1). One change is that the circulating current sensing
          resistor R<sub>S</sub> was placed between the two reactances.
          Since strong scalar-type fields are believed to be generated
          by this circuitry, this position could be more balanced. At
          resonance, the generator line current would normally be
          determined by the remaining resistance in the line, since the
          line reactances are essentially cancelled out. This does not
          means that the reactive voltages and currents are not present
          --- they are! However, since the reactive voltages and
          currents are 90° out-of-phase, there is essentially <u>no</u>
          power losses (dissipation) in this line. Moreover, the
          reactive currents in a series circuit are in-phase and thus
          should appear as the circulatory current in the line. This
          could be directly measured by the sampling resistance R<sub>S</sub>,
          or also calculated from the measured voltage across, say
          resistance L<sub>i</sub>; e.g., </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          I<sub>circ</sub> = V<sub>L1</sub> / X<sub>L1</sub> = V<sub>L1</sub>
          / 2?fL<sub>1</sub> <u>~</u> 21.2 / 2545 <u>~</u> 8.3 mA </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          For the test of Table (1). The i<sub>circ</sub> as determined
          by the sampling resistor R<sub>S</sub> was about 5.8 mA as
          given in Table (1). The difference seen here might be due to
          the sensitivity of the scope probe to other scalar components
          present here. With a calculated line current (i<sub>G</sub>)
          of about 0.56 mA, it is seen that the circulating line current
          is more than 10X the generator current. Where does this excess
          current come from? It is my belief that the scalar-type flux
          being generated by the capacitance and inductor of this
          circuit may be 'interacting' with the aether (or some other
          aether-related fields) and thus, in effect, 'extracting' this
          additional flux energy. The generator is a source of the
          voltage (potential) to drive this series circuit, and thus the
          'drive power' would be determined by the power dissipated in
          the generator <u>resistive</u> source impedance of about 5
          KOhms, i.e., P<sub>in</sub> = V<sub>G</sub> x i<sub>G</sub>.
          Again, remember that there are no real losses in the series
          circuit line due to the 90° phase difference between the
          reactive terms. However, the reactive power (or VAR) <u>exists</u>
          and it is of high magnitude. In this simple circuit, the high
          reactive voltage (potential) developed in L<sub>1</sub> is
          transformed (and stepped down) in the secondary winding, L<sub>2</sub>.
          This stepped down voltage will now drive a <u>real</u>
          current in the 1 KOhm load resistance, R<sub>L</sub>, and thus
          <u>real</u> power is developed at the output. The use of
          resistive sources and loads in this circuitry will enable the
          calculation of true RMS powers since the voltages and currents
          are in-phase under such conditions. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            II. Conclusions</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          The tests as given here continue to indicate <u>real</u>
          power gains for the Mini-MRA, even with calibrated
          oscilloscope tests. The use of digital-type meters (outside of
          their calibrated ranges in these tests) will not measure <u>true</u>
          RMS voltages and currents, but the power gains determined
          could be valid provided the waveforms are truly sinusoidal.
          Thus, these <u>types of tests</u> could be made by
          researchers with limited equipment and means. However, it must
          be emphasized that if phase-shift complications are to be
          avoided, the source and load <u>must</u> be resistive and the
          waveforms sinusoidal. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Finally, while the enclosed tests are believed to be valid,
          only <u>more</u> independent testing (possibly using other
          components) will really settle the issue of over-unity
          operation for MA-type devices. In the long run a 'stand-alone'
          operation will make any measurement questions moot! While my
          efforts are still quite limited, I will continue with that
          quest as time permits. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>

            More Speculations on the Mini-MRA</b><br>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Even though I was only able to apply very limited effort on
          the Mini-MRA device, I have released to you many thoughts and
          experiments, some of which could be quite significant for an
          understanding of the operation of this device. The viewpoints
          are from Rhysmonic Cosmology and those of you who are quite
          familiar with some of its premises should be able to
          understand the following discussions: </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            Figure 1</b> </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            A. Simplified Sketch of the Mini-MRA</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Shown above is a very simple depiction of the peak one-half
          cycle of the 'flow' of scalar flux in the Mini-MRA. In normal
          theory, one considers that when energy is being 'stored' in
          the capacitor's 'field', energy is being 'returned' from the
          inductor's 'field'. Rhysmonic Theory goes well beyond that
          simple statement and speculates that the capacitor 'flux' is
          'exciting' the universe (or some component of it) and that the
          inductor 'flux' is also 'exciting' the universe. That this is
          so has been reported to you in many simple experiments and
          some Notes and papers in the past. However, as depicted above,
          these two flux components are 180° out-of-phase and also a
          function of the resonant frequency. It is also emphasized that
          good sinusoidal waveforms and resistive loads are necessary
          for this circuit to work! </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><b><br>
            B. Further Remarks on This Operation</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (1) While the <u>intrinsic</u> rhysmonic flux of the universe
          s 'instantaneous' and 'omni-directional', there are also many
          other 'directed' fluxes due to various universe and
          terrestrial factors. A few common terrestrial factors are the
          earth's G-field, E-field, magnetic field, as well as the many
          components in the ionosphere and near-earth, due to emissions
          from the sun, and possible <u>other</u> cosmic emissions.
          Thus, the universe is a vast source of energy, both <u>intrinsic</u>
          and also '<u>converted</u>'. The converted energies are
          presently being utilized, much of it being rapidly exhausted
          and much of it polluting the earth. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (2) The scalar-type 'flux' being developed by the reactances
          through the action of the driving source, i.e., the generator,
          will be as shown by the solid lines in the depiction above,
          while the interactions possible in the universe will be simply
          depicted by the dotted lines while the orientation of the
          reactances possibly could be directed for enhanced
          interactions (say, with the earth's G- or E-fields), the
          positioning, in general, will be immaterial, since there
          always will be a <u>substantial</u> component of rhysmonic
          flux in <u>any</u> direction. The 'driven' reactances will
          'pump' the universe (or some component of it). Many past
          rhysmonic experiments have shown this to be the case and such
          'pumping' was found to 'magnify' the energy levels in possible
          'resonance' in these interactions. The higher the drive level
          of the 'pump', i.e., the drive, the higher the level of
          interactions. Also, the longer the 'pump' acts, the greater
          the level of interaction up to some <u>limiting level</u>.
          This has also been proven in other simple rhysmonic
          experiments, many of which have been released in the past, and
          <u>some</u> of which <u>were not</u>! Since most of these
          experiments are so simple, one only needs to perform them
          (which I find many are reluctant to do so since they are so
          unconventional!). </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (3) Due to the nature of some of the 'directed' rhysmonic
          fluxes, the performance of the Mini-MRA could vary with the
          rotation of the earth, i.e., the time of day; but in general,
          the interaction is found to be relatively constant. The
          interaction is essentially between parallel scalar-field
          components and thus one of simple superposition of fields
          (potential) and thus only simple algebraic addition of flux is
          required. While certain 'resonant' frequencies could enhance
          the interaction with certain directed flux components, the
          long time constant of these circuits compared to the <u>very
            high</u> basic rhysmonic (intrinsic) frequencies will ensure
          at least a measure of interaction at <u>all</u> the
          frequencies of operation (provided resonance occurs). </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          (4) The flux interaction in the universe (depicted by the
          dotted lines in the sketch) is <u>repetitive</u> at the
          resonant frequency and thus should also complete the reactive
          circuit (perhaps <u>no</u> line return may be needed?).
          Therefore, the sensing resistor, R<sub>S</sub>, could directly
          determine this reactive 'circulating' current. With the proper
          design of the reactive elements and a proper frequency of
          operation, this reactive current could be made <u>many</u>, <u>many</u>
          times greater than the generator line current needed to
          sustain this mode of operation. The reactive voltage across L<sub>1</sub>
          would be i<sub>circ</sub> x X<sub>L1</sub>, and could be vary
          large. However, due to the 90° phase difference between the
          reactive voltages and reactive currents, <u>no</u>
          appreciable dissipation losses will be sustained in this
          reactive 'circulating loop'. The high reactive voltage in L<sub>1</sub>
          can be transformer-coupled to L<sub>2</sub>, where this high
          voltage could now drive a large <u>real</u> current (in phase
          with the voltage) and thus develop large <u>real</u> power <u>in






            the load, R<sub>L</sub></u>. This has been confirmed in many
          Mini-MRA tests, but again I must caution you that solid state
          sources can react to the scalar fluxes being developed here
          and thus distort the drive input and even destroy the source!
        </p>

            II. Conclusions</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          As usual, the above speculative remarks on the possible
          operation of the Mini-MRA are primarily aimed at getting more
          of you more actively involved in these simple tests. All
          indications are that the MRA is for <u>real</u> and possibly
          a <u>great new source</u> of space energy which will be both
          inexhaustible and also non-polluting. While these exploratory
          tests are yet at low levels, there is every reason to believe
          that very high levels will be achieved with this technique.
          Witness the Swiss M-L, which to me appears to be but a <u>Super</u>
          MRA device! </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          Rhysmonic Cosmology is basically used in these discussions ---
          it is a <u>real</u> science --- and many experiments have
          shown it to be so. Much has been released to you in past Notes
          and papers, both published and unpublished. Also, there is <u>much</u>
          that has not yet been released --- to use the Swiss M-L
          group's phrase, "Mankind may not be ready for it yet". In any
          case, I wish you all well and continued good experimenting. </p>

          This circuit was featured in the July-September 1995 issue of
          <i>Extraordinary Science Magazine</i>. The circuit was
          originally intended as a Demo Unit. It was sent to McClain and
          Wootan, who modified it somewhat to limit performance range
          and then had it sent to <u>three</u> independent labs in the
          Georgia area for evaluation. <u>All three</u> labs <u>confirmed</u>
          power gains in the order of 10-21 times! It was eventually
          returned to me and I verified their data. I have now restored
          the original circuitry and made some tests using a 25 MHz
          scope rather than digital voltmeters. </p>

            A. Background</b> </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          In the past I have reported to you on many Mini-MRA (Magnetic
          Resonance Amplifier) tests which were instilled by the initial
          report by McClain and Wootan on this device published in the
          January 1995 issue of <i>New Energy News</i>. At that time I
          had tried a 'first look' at this circuit using some parts and
          equipment which I had on hand. This initial circuit has since
          proved to be very useful in trying to understand the operation
          of the MRA device (from the viewpoint of my Rhysmonic
          Cosmology). This Note will summarize my viewpoints from a
          position of hindsight at this time. </p>

          This was out 'initial' look at this device but I will now
          summarize it anew. A simplified version of the circuit is
          shown below. A new unit was made on 6-23-01 and evaluated at
          that time. Tests were made with a 25 MHz scope and <u>all</u>
          waveforms were <u>very</u> good sinewaves. The signal source
          used was an old tube-type which was capable of only about 10
          mW if output power I<sub>max</sub>). </p>

            Gains (P.G.)! </p>
          <p>(3) The reactive L<sub>1</sub> powers (VAR) in both modes
            are equal! </p>
          <p>(4) Note also that f<sub>o</sub> (74.2 KHz) is also a
            subharmonic of the Universal Rhysmonic (Planck) frequency
            1.885 x 10<sup>-43</sup> Hz. </p>
          <p>(5) Tube-type generators are recommended for these tests as
            they are not sensitive to scalar fields as solid state
            sources seem to be! </p>
          <p>(6) It is concluded that the MRA type devices (or more
            simple reactive systems) remain viable as a source of energy
            extracted from the Universal G-fields (i.e., aether).
            However, more effort by others is needed --- I have shown
            you the way and the many possibilities. Good Luck! </p>

          MRAFLUKE.ASC
          <p>14 Nov 1995 </p>
          <p>To: keelynet@ix.netcom.com <br>
            From: David Forbes <br>
            Subject: MRA </p>
          <p>I found the Magnetic Resonance Amplifier to be an amusing
            if not wholly effective Free Energy device. I showed the
            articles to my co-workers one at a time, and the first thing
            each of them said was, 'You can't measure AC power with a
            Fluke meter!' </p>
          <p>I built Greg Hodowanec's Mini-MRA circuit (described in
            Jul-Aug-Sep '95 <i>Extraordinary Science</i> magazine) and
            found that it works at about 50% efficiency if the input
            current is measured with an oscilloscope. Then I saw that
            his measured input current was much lower than mine. I found
            that he used a Fluke 87 DMM to measure the input current but
            not the output current. He calculated output current from
            the load resistor, so his output current value was more or
            less correct. </p>
          <p>I then called Fluke to ask about the frequency response of
            the AC current function of the model 87, and they said it's
            only accurate up to 2 KiloHertz. He was using it at 75 KHz!
            No wonder he measured such an efficient circuit... he was
            badly misusing the test equipment. And he was measunring in
            such a way that the bad reading increased the apparent
            efficiency. </p>
          <p>The reason I built this circuit is that it is a textbook
            circuit that exists in millions of consumer electronic items
            with &lt;100% efficiency. So I knew it was a bogus Free
            Energy device before I built it. I just built it to
            demonstrate to myself that I understood the author's error.
            Just in case you haven't realized this yet: </p>
          <p>The file you got from Joel McClain about the Teledyne Ryan
            Aeronautical 'verification' is NOT a verification of
            over-unity operation of his MRA. It is simply a duplication
            of McClain's erroneous efficiency measurement. Note the
            wording of the following statements by TRA: </p>
          <p>4)&nbsp; The input current was then calculated PER THE
            CUSTOMER as the voltage (rms) across R1 &amp; R2 divided by
            the resistance of R1 + R2. </p>
          <p>6)&nbsp; The output current through R3 was calculated PER
            THE CUSTOMER&nbsp; as the voltage (rms) across R3 divided by
            the resistance of R3. </p>
          <p>7)&nbsp; The CUSTOMER DEFINES the MRA gain as the output
            voltage (rms) D to E times the output current through R3
            divided by the input voltage (rms) A to B times the input
            current through R1 &amp; R2. </p>
          <p>The people at TRA did *not* analyze the circuit or the
            measurement techniques. They simply used McClain's
            techniques, as they stated above.&nbsp; That doesn't prove
            that the circuit works. It only serves to lend false
            authority to a flawed measurement --- one that was shown to
            be erroneous by both Puthoff and Frode. </p>
          <p>So please change your MRA score to: 2 against, 1
            irrelevant. </p>
          <p>One thing to keep in mind about the MRA. The underlying
            principle of the whole thing as stated by Norm Wooten is
            that it taps the energy locked in a permanent magnet and an
            piezoelectric crystal. (I don't have the source handy, but
            he says this in his Extraordinary Science article of
            Jul-Aug-Sep '95.) </p>
          <p>I don't know if you're familiar with the operation of a
            peizoelectric crystal, but it doesn't have any energy locked
            in it. It just has the ability to convert electrical energy
            into mechanical energy.&nbsp; That is, if you put in
            electrical power, you get out mechanical power, or
            vice-versa.&nbsp; Nothing magic in that. An electromagnet
            does the same thing. And they have both been shown to do
            this with less than 100% efficiency by thousands of
            researchers over the years.<br>
