          From: David Forbes <br>
          Subject: MRA </p>
      </center>
      <p>I found the Magnetic Resonance Amplifier to be an amusing if
        not wholly effective Free Energy device. I showed the articles
        to my co-workers one at a time, and the first thing each of them
        said was, 'You can't measure AC power with a Fluke meter!' </p>
      <p>I built Greg Hodowanec's Mini-MRA circuit (described in
        Jul-Aug-Sep '95 <i>Extraordinary Science</i> magazine) and
        found that it works at about 50% <br>
        efficiency if the input current is measured with an
        oscilloscope. Then I saw that his measured input current was
        much lower than mine. I found that he used a Fluke 87 DMM to
        measure the input current but not the output current. He
        calculated output current from the load resistor, so his output
        current value was more or less correct. </p>
      <p>I then called Fluke to ask about the frequency response of the
        AC current function of the model 87, and they said it's only
        accurate up to 2 KiloHertz. He was using it at 75 KHz! No wonder
        he measured such an efficient circuit... he was badly misusing
        the test equipment. And he was measunring in such a way that the
        bad reading increased the apparent efficiency. </p>
      <p>The reason I built this circuit is that it is a textbook
        circuit that exists in millions of consumer electronic items
        with &lt;100% efficiency. So I knew it <br>
        was a bogus Free Energy device before I built it. I just built
        it to demonstrate to myself that I understood the author's
        error. Just in case you haven't realized this yet: </p>
      <p>The file you got from Joel McClain about the Teledyne Ryan
        Aeronautical 'verification' is NOT a verification of over-unity
        operation of his MRA. It is simply a duplication of McClain's
        erroneous efficiency measurement. Note the wording of the
        following statements by TRA: </p>
      <p>4)&nbsp; The input current was then calculated PER THE CUSTOMER
        as the voltage (rms) across R1 &amp; R2 divided by the
        resistance of R1 + R2. </p>
      <p>6)&nbsp; The output current through R3 was calculated PER THE
        CUSTOMER&nbsp; as the voltage (rms) across R3 divided by the
        resistance of R3. </p>
      <p>7)&nbsp; The CUSTOMER DEFINES the MRA gain as the output
        voltage (rms) D to E times the output current through R3 divided
        by the input voltage (rms) A to B times the input current
        through R1 &amp; R2. </p>
      <p>The people at TRA did *not* analyze the circuit or the
        measurement techniques. They simply used McClain's techniques,
        as they stated above.&nbsp; That doesn't prove that the circuit
        works. It only serves to lend false authority to a flawed
        measurement --- one that was shown to be erroneous by both
        Puthoff and Frode. </p>
      <p>So please change your MRA score to: 2 against, 1 irrelevant. </p>
      <p>One thing to keep in mind about the MRA. The underlying
        principle of the whole thing as stated by Norm Wooten is that it
        taps the energy locked in a permanent magnet and an
        piezoelectric crystal. (I don't have the source handy, but he
        says this in his Extraordinary Science article of Jul-Aug-Sep
        '95.) </p>
      <p>I don't know if you're familiar with the operation of a
        peizoelectric crystal, but it doesn't have any energy locked in
        it. It just has the ability to convert electrical energy into
        mechanical energy.&nbsp; That is, if you put in electrical
        power, you get out mechanical power, or vice-versa.&nbsp;
        Nothing magic in that. An electromagnet does the same thing. And
        they have both been shown to do this with less than 100%
        efficiency by thousands of researchers over the years.</p>
