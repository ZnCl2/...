              I.&nbsp; Some Remarks on Current Flow in the Mini-MRA</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>( 12-10-05 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>A. Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>There has been much debate on the true measurement of the input
        power levels in the original MRA and also the mini-MRA. This
        will be an effort to clarify the situation, primarily with
        regard to the mini-MRA system. </p>
      <p><b>B. The Mini-MRA Circuit Simplified</b> </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" height="208" width="374"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>C. Circuit Operation Remarks</b> </p>
      <p>1. While the reactances C<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> are
        180° out of phase and thus cancel out, their reactive currents
        are in phase and form the circulating current, iRe as shown
        above. </p>
      <p>2. Reactive current may be determined by the voltage developed
        across small sensing resistors, about 3.3 ohms, shown as RS<sub>1</sub>
        and RS<sub>2</sub> above. Ohm’s Law is used to determine the
        circulating current, iRe. </p>
      <p>3. Reactive circulating current also flows across the generator
        input resistance, R<sub>G</sub>, where it “bucks” V<sub>G</sub>
        and depresses it to very low values. The reactive voltage across
        the winding, L<sub>1</sub>, in the pulse transformer T<sub>1</sub>,
        is transferred to winding, L<sub>2</sub>, where it now develops
        real power in the load resistor, R<sub>L</sub>. </p>
      <p>4. The very high reactive circulating current, iRe, is due
        mainly to the interaction of the special reactances with the
        Universal G-fields of the Universe, resulting in the
        "extraction" of energy in the process (See my many reports on
        this!). </p>
      <p><b>D. Test Results (Scope Measurements)</b> </p>
      <p>1. Relatively large circulating currents, iRe, were measured
        using the voltages developed across the 3.3 ohm resistors at
        sensing points A and B. These are not line currents being
        provided by the same generator! At resonance (at an optimum
        frequency needed by the inductive coil core ferrite properties),
        the source generator needs to supply only a very small voltage
        "kick", which can maintain oscillation at resonance by
        overcoming small resistive losses in the LC elements! This is
        automatically achieved here in the generator source resistance,
        R<sub>G</sub>, where the circulating current, iRe, phases
        generate “large” voltage drops which “buck” the generator
        voltage to very low levels of V<sub>G</sub>. The lower the V<sub>G</sub>,
        is a sign that the Mini-MRA is operating at an effective
        frequency, F<sub>o</sub>, for optimum power efficiency. </p>
      <p>2. The tube generator source and the special IC oscillator
        circuits used with the Mini-MRA develop an AC signal (as
        referenced to negative ground levels) as an AC variation in the
        DC levels of the source output. The generator thus has a
        dissipative line current level as measured by the reduced V<sub>G</sub>
        levels divided by the generator input resistance, R<sub>G</sub>.
        This is the real input current drive level i<sub>G</sub> in this
        type of circuit! The input power is thus V<sub>G</sub> x i<sub>G</sub>!
      </p>
      <p>3. A few tests of input drive current levels were made using
        the Fluke 87 (well outside its guaranteed range) using its
        lowest AC current range inserted at point X in the simplified
        circuit shown. These seemed to be about in the same order of
        magnitude as those as measured with the scope as seen in (2)
        above! This could have been due to the fact that the sensing
        resistor (1.5 ohms) in the Fluke 87 tests was essentially at the
        system ground level, or perhaps the error in the Fluke 87 (well
        beyond its guaranteed accuracy of but 2 KHz) was not as severe
        as most would expect? Normally, I did not use the Fluke 87 in
        Mini-MRA current determination! </p>
      <p><b>E. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>1. It is concluded that the test methods used with the Mini-MRA
        were valid and true measurements. This was confirmed in par in
        the any so-called “self-sustaining” modes of operation of the
        Mini-MRA. Here, a portion of the DC output power was “fed back”
        to rechargeable batteries powering the IC oscillator driving the
        Mini-MRA. These tests maintained continuous full operation of
        the Mini-MRA for 500-1000 hours! When there was no such
        feedback, the system operated for only 50 or so hours, when the
        system started to fail due to lack of charge in the batteries! </p>
      <p>2. Orthodox testers are claiming only 50% efficiency because
        they are in error in using the high reactive circulating
        currents measured in sensor RS<sub>2</sub> as the generator line
        current driving the series LC circuit! </p>
      <p>3. Finally, a word of caution in the use of magnetized ferrites
        in MRA’s. The Mini-MRA uses only un-magnetized ferrites. Here,
        the domains may be “flipping” or at least vibrating in an
        optimum resonance with a G-field resonance, in a process of
        “easy” magnetization and de-magnetization. In the case of
        magnetized ferrites. There is a possibility that a massive
        “de-magnetization” may occur, releasing a very large pulse of
        energy, which may not terminate in the system load, but may
        reflect back to the system source where it could be very
        damaging, especially with solid-state equipment. Perhaps, this
        is what McClain and Wootan experienced? </p>
