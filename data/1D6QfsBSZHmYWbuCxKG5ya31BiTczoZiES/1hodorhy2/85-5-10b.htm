              Microwave Background Radiation (MBR) Data</font></b> </p>

      <p>A. Measured Lambda ~ = 0.25 cm (numerous tests) </p>
      <p>B. Remarks: </p>
      <p>(1) Effect of perturbation is isotropic, largely. </p>
      <p>(2) Perturbations are independent of size or volume. </p>
      <p>(3) Lambda is measured as distance between two adjacent peaks
        or two adjacent nulls in the GW signal response (modulation
        effect) </p>
      <p>(4) That effects is gravitational is seen in: </p>
      <blockquote>a. Response is present no matter how much ‘electrical
        shielding’ is used.
        <p>b. The mechanical motion of the heart, which is shielded
          within the body, also modulates the GW signals.</p>
      </blockquote>
      (5) Effect is present in all GW detectors, but most prominently
      noticed in l/f types. The QND mode response ‘swamps’ out the
      effect in most cases (still rpesent in background however).
      <p>(6) Perturbations do not seem to be affected by laboratory
        distances: some apparently at 2” and 50’ </p>
      <p>C. Mechanism of Perturbations: </p>
      <p>(1) Gravitation is given by Newton: </p>
      <p>F =&nbsp; G m<sub>1</sub> m<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>Therefore, </p>
      <blockquote>a. Force is proportional to masses.
        <p>b. Force is inversely proportional to radius squared. </p>
        <p>c. Force is proportional to constant G.</p>
      </blockquote>
      (2) GW radiation is sum total of rhysmonic flux die to all
      perturbations in the universe. Since GW effects propagate any
      distance in Planck Time, these are essentially ‘instantaneous’
      effects. Also, since the universe is a perfect black body, all
      radiation would be black body radiation. However, there is a big
      distinction between EM waves and GW waves.
      <blockquote>a. EM waves have a constant increase with wavelength
        and thus would essentially dissipate within the universe to very
        long wavelengths of low energy (micropulsations?).
        <p>b. GW signals do not have this ‘increase effect’ and thus
          would have a ‘mechanical’ black body effect, the present
          ‘effect wavelength’ being about 0.25-0.30 cm the measured MBR.</p>
