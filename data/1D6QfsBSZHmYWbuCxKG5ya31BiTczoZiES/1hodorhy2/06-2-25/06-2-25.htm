      <p><b>I. Another Simple Rhysmonic Resonance Test</b> </p>
      <p>A rhysmonic (Planck) resonance response test was made using a
        miniature Tamura (G-512) pulse transformer as shown below: </p>
      <p>The DVM was a Sears model 82n129 unit and SW, was a momentary
        On push button. The antenna was a 12 ft wire stretched out and
        was used to [possibly improve the response level. The primary
        circuit was the 1 mH winding shunted with a 0.01 uF ceramic
        capacitor for a broad response at about 50 kc. The secondary was
        the 2 mH (untuned) winding and was loaded down (RL) with 500
        KOhms (actually the input resistance of an old all-tube
        oscilloscope). The resonant frequency (50 kc) was measured
        across the secondary winding and was only in the order of
        millivolts and thus was just barely seen on this old scope.
        Momentarily closing SW, would enable the DVM (in the frequency
        mode) to ‘latch’ for about one second on a caught rhysmonic
        frequency signal! A run of 20 ‘latches’ was made and the results
        are given in Table 1. </p>
      <p><b>II. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>1. Due to the very low level of the input signal to the DVM (in
        the frequency measuring mode) the experimental errors were
        somewhat scattered, but a number of ‘latches’ were seen to
        repeat! The overall averaged deviation in the experimental error
        was in the order of -o.3%. This simple test again appears to
        show that the rhysmonic (Planck) resonances are very real and
        that they may be the source of all energy in our Universe! </p>
      <p>2. Another Tamura miniature pulse transformer (G-506) is
        presently being evaluated in a special mini-MRA circuit. This
        pulse transformer contains one 2 mH and two 1 mH windings. The
        special circuit is a stable self-oscillating system and may run
        in the ‘stand-alone’ mode, or at least in the self-sustaining
        mode. There is yet some question on the ‘stand alone’ mode since
        it may be limited in the amount of space energy that can be
        ‘extracted’ due to the very small ferrite core size in these
        transformers! </p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: Ferrite core may be only 1/8 inch diam. And 3/8
        inch long! </p>
      <p>The Tamura transformers were provided by a colleague who
        obtained a very few samples (for another use) from the DigiKey
        Corporation. </p>
      <p>3. After the Tamura evaluations, I will re-evaluate the
        original Red Pulse transformer in the special circuit (no
        outside source needed) and also a special hand jumble wound
        tri-coil unit ( 5 nH windings) made by Bill Ramsay, which I feel
        has the most potential to ‘stand alone’. </p>
