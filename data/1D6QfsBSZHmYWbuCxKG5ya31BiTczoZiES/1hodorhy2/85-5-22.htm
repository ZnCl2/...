      <p><b>A. Tests made with shielded l/f detector # 15</b> </p>
      <blockquote>(1) The GW signal background can be modulated at a
        certain rate; modulation then is ceased physically, but
        modulation in detector will continue until over-ridden by
        another modulation (which is usually the heartbeat!)
        <p>(2) Rates between 0.05 cm to at least 10 cm were observed to
          be established as oscillations in this background. However,
          rates near 0.25 cm in wavelength appeared to be related to a
          strong fixed wavelength in space in which perturbations at
          this length appeared to be more stable. That is, movements at
          0.25 cm either peaked or nulled the radiation, and had reduced
          tendency to oscillate. </p>
        <p>(3) That this oscillation may have been a charge oscillation
          in the detector circuit was considered, but rejected for:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>a. It does not appear to be related to any natural
          LRC frequency.
          <p>b. Oscillation frequencies of 0.5 per second to 5 per
            second are readily established, except when wavelengths are
            in the order of 0.25 cm. </p>
          <p>c. The above seems to be related to the 2.7 K black body
            radiation, or a thermal radiation, which is, in effect, a
            ‘particle’ radiation effect.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <b>B. Conclusions:</b>
      <blockquote>(1) Modulation of the GW background radiation appears
        to be a modulation of the ‘vacuum’ energy, very much like EM
        wave propagation or inertial energy propagation.
        <p>(2) This was the GW wave of the so-called quadrature-type
          considered in rhysmonics? The disturbance created in vacuum by
          this mass movement is now propagated as ‘waves’ at the speed
          of light. These waves are detectable in the laboratory because
          of the inverse square relation. At several hundred feet
          distance, these ‘effects’ may not be noticeable (perhaps the
          superimposed ‘noise’ on GW signals may partially be this.</p>
