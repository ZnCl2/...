      Inventor: ZOGRAFOS PETROS EVANGELOU, SPILIOPOULOS IOANNIS

      <br>
      Novelty: There are disclosed a method and a device destined for
      water electrolysis and production of hydrogen to be used as
      combustible by combination of high frequencies produced by
      semitonic oscillators; when mixed, reinforced and combined, said
      frequencies contrive to break water into its elements (hydrogen
      and oxygen) upon influence of the coordination effect. Secondary
      frequencies configurating the structure of the primary frequencies
      for obtaining adequately-combined frequencies by means of the
      respective electronic circuit composed of an isolator, a mixer, a
      directional coupler, a multiplier, configurators, digital
      frequency controllers, and linear amplifiers can be introduced
      with the assistance of adequate main and auxiliary treatment
      equipments into the primary frequencies produced by the semitonic
      oscillators. The vibration of water molecules and the breaking
      thereof into hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by
      suitably-coordinated frequencies. The gases are, thereafter,
      separated by special sorting guides while the producing hydrogen.<br>

      "I found a bunch of nonsense claims in the internet, about the
      resonance frequency of water helping to split bonds.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing to realize here is that there is no one resonance
      frequency of water. With suitable energy, you can excite
      rotational, vibrational and electronic states (I left out
      translation - there transition energies minute). At room
      temperature you can say as a rule of thumb that most molecules
      will be in some excited rotational state, but in the vibrational
      and electronic ground states. Excitation energies for rotation are
      in the far infrared or microwave energy/frequency region. Widely
      used e.g. in the microwave oven at 2.45 GHz (≈ 12 cm). Actually,
      the whole region is full of bands where water absorbs. Note that
      microwave heating of water does not cause electrolysis.
      Vibrational transitions are around 2.9 μm = 105 THz = 3500 cm⁻¹
      and 6μm = 50 THz = 1635 cm⁻¹ with lots of combinations and
      overtones throughout the near infrared region. Quite
      exceptionally, the visible region is basically free of water
      absorption. Electronic transitions (breaking of bonds) need
      energies in the UV, and here we meet bands that lead to
      photodissociation, e.g. at 166nm (taken from Wikipedia). That
      corresponds to 1.8 PHz = 1.8⋅1015 Hz. Compare this to the kHz and
      MHz where your link claims dissociation.<br>
      <br>
      This doesn't mean that the pulsed DC cannot help, nor that
      impedance spectroscopy won't give important information. But
      resonance frequencies in the kHz range are electrical LC-circuit
      resonances depending on cell and electrode geometries and
      electrical double layers etc. But neither on vibrations nor
      breaking of the bonds of the water molecule.<br>
      <br>
      To give the "method" you ask about some real world numbers, at the
      very end of the Wiki page the energy efficiency for industrial
      water electrolysis is cited as usually between 50 and 80 %.<br>
      <br>
      The paper then proposes to burn the gas in an internal combustion
      machine. As such a stationary process could be adjusted so that
      the engine is at its maximum efficiency, we may assume 1/3 or 35%
      efficiency here.<br>
      <br>
      We then need a generator to convert the mechanical energy into
      electric energy. Fortunately, that step is rather efficient. Say,
      95 %.<br>
      <br>
      A fuel cell would be more efficient than the combustion -
      generator combination: ca. 40 - 60 % according to Wikipedia.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, also battery charging is not 100% efficient. Let's
      assume 80–90% (taken from Wikipedia on Li-ion batteries) For
      batteries that are charged with higher current (or current
      density) efficiency is less. Example would be lead-acid batteries
      as used in cars. Wiki quotes efficiencies between 50 and 80 %.<br>
      <br>
      Taking these numbers together, I conclude that after going once
      through the cycle of the proposed "perpetuum mobile", 8 - 24 % of
      the energy are retained in a "useful state" while 76 - 92 % became
      heat. With fuel cell, we may be able to "boost" the energy
      efficiency to 43%...<br>

        <br>
        Microwave ovens operate at a frequency of 2.45 GHz (2.45x109 Hz)
        and this is NOT the resonant frequency of a water molecule…<br>
        <br>
        <b>Water and microwaves</b><br>
        <br>
        Water molecules contain three atoms and so can vibrate in a
        number of different ways. This makes calculating their resonant
        frequency very difficult. However microwave radiation of any
        frequency will affect them although they may not resonate.<br>
        <br>
        Some vibrations of a three atom molecules are shown in the
        diagram. They are not to scale and are only meant to represent
        possible states of vibration.<br>
        <br>
        When microwaves pass through water the water molecules absorb
        some of the microwave energy and as a result they twist and
        turn, writhing around, as the radiation passes by. However after
        the microwaves have gone the molecules stop moving again,
        remitting the energy as more microwaves. In free water molecules
        this does not result in a heating.<br>
        <br>
        In a liquid things are rather different. The water molecules are
        close to reach other and so there is "friction" between them. It
        is the rubbing of one molecule against another as in liquid
        water that allows the energy to be retained and prevents it
        being reemitted as microwaves. The "friction" between the
        writhing water molecules and other molecules in a solid also
        heats up the solid.<br>
        <br>
        Microwave ovens operate at a frequency of 2.45 GHz (2.45x109 Hz)
        and this is NOT the resonant frequency of a water molecule. This
        frequency is much lower than the diatomic molecule resonant
        frequencies mentioned earlier. If 2.45 GHz were the resonant
        frequency of water molecules the microwaves would all be
        absorbed in the surface layer of a substance (liquid water or
        food) and so the interior of the food would not get cooked at
        all.<br>
        <br>
        The 2.45 GHz is a kind of useful average frequency. If the
        frequency was much higher then the waves would penetrate less
        well, lower frequencies would penetrate better but are absorbed
        only weakly and so once again the food would not absorb enough
        energy to cook well.<br>
        <br>
        Standing waves set up within the oven. A standing wave is formed
        whenever two waves travelling in opposite directions meet in a
        "restricted area". This restricted area could be a metal box (as
        in a microwave oven) or a stretched string as in a violin.<br>
        <br>
        Microwave ovens cook unevenly because a pattern of standing
        waves forms inside the oven chamber, and the pattern creates an
        array of hotspots throughout the oven's volume. An operating
        frequency of 2.45 GHz will produce a wavelength of around 12.25
        cm, and the regions of maximum intensity (hotspots) will be at
        half-wave points, or every 6.125 cm, but in a complex 3D
        pattern.<br>
        <br>
        This standing wave pattern explains why microwave ovens only
        work effectively if the food is rotated through the standing
        waves and why some ovens actually move the pattern by rotating
        the transmitter.<br>

        <br>
        The lowest resonance of the water molecule is 22.235 GHz. This
        frequency is almost 10 times higher than the operating frequency
        of the microwave oven (2.45 GHz)…<br>
        <br>
        What is important in the idea of resonance with water is to
        establish a frequency of excitation that causes the natural
        frequencies to superimpose or wave superposition. By achieving
        wave superposition the amplitude of the oscillations will have
        the greatest potential of breaking the molecule into its
        elemental constituents thereby creating free atoms that can
        recombine to form the diatomic molecules desired. H2 and O2
        Oddly enough chemistry and properties of elements can play into
        this process as the electrodes used if they are constructed of
        platinum will result in a better yield from hydrolysis. This may
        be the result of how the atomic structure of platinum releases
        electrons through solution. A similar process has been observed
        in certain solar cells as alloys of atoms are placed on layers
        of silicon substrate creating a resonant cavity to enhance
        voltage production through the capture of photons. The
        explanation comes from the energy level of exchange of electrons
        during enthalpy processes that exceed the enthalpy energy
        required to break the covalent bonds of H2O…<br>

        It's quite easy... Most high power SONAR systems can do it.
        Cavitation was always a concern of the higher power SONAR heads.
        Things that could do 230-235 dB at 38 to 50 kHz. Even higher,
        further up in frequency. And could be done with just 300-500W of
        power.<br>
        <br>
        Look for info on SONAR head design. However, if you're looking
        to do it for energy generation via release of hydrogen, it's
        terribly inefficient. It'll take A few hundred Watts to get a
        few Watts of hydrogen...<br>
        <br>
        It's 42 kHz which can be be achieved by either ultrasound or
        radiowaves or both but because you need pure water to split it
        at this frequency so it's kinda impractical - tho if you vibrate
        water at this frequency it makes standard electrolysis more

              Etheric Force from Water</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        A recent (1965) possible verification of the frequency Keely
        used to dissociate water into etheric force was related to me by
        a scientist when we were discussing certain aspects of free
        energy. He wishes to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, but
        his name is on file. I have no other verification of this
        experiment, however I believe it merits telling.<br>
        <br>
        The scientist, I shall call him Dr. X, was doing experiments
        with ultrasonic sound in a column of water. The object of the
        experiments was to devise a means of separating various
        densities of materials by injecting them into a column of water
        which was subjected to an ultrasonic standing wave vibration.
        The experimental setup is sketched in Figure 3-3 (for BBS
        considerations a description follows).<br>
        <br>
        A Barium Titanate ultrasonic transducer was fixed to the bottom
        of a quartz tube which was closed at the bottom and open at the
        top. Pure water was poured into the tube and the water column
        was "tuned" so that a standing wave was produced at 40,000 CPS
        (cycles per second). The transducer was powered by a 700 Watt
        power amplifier which was driven by an ultrasonic frequency
        generator.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the large amount of power put into the column of
        water a certain amount of evaporation took place at a constant
        rate when the transducer was energized. Therefore, to maintain a
        standing wave in the water column a feedback device caused the
        frequency to be raised as the water evaporated and the
        temperature changed.<br>
        <br>
        As a test, Dr. X decided to run through the experiment with only
        water in the tube to insure that a standing wave was maintained
        as the water evaporated and the frequency rose higher and
        higher. When the experiment was started everything worked
        beautifully.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. X took periodic readings of his instrumentation and was
        assured that the standing wave was being maintained. Suddenly,
        with no warning whatever the water disappeared from the open
        quartz tube. He looked up thinking to see the water splashed on
        the ceiling when to his amazement a clean hole went right
        through the ceiling. The hole was the same size as the inside of
        the quartz tube.<br>
        <br>
        Further investigation showed the hole continued on through the
        roof also! Dr. X checked his notebook and found the last
        frequency entry to be 41,300 CPS. It was shortly after this that
        the water disappeared.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the time interval between the last reading and the
        disappearing water, the frequency sent to the transducer was
        higher than the last reading and Dr. X said it could well have
        been very close to 42,800 CPS, the Keely dissociation frequency.
        (11)<br>
        <br>
        This obviously dangerous event caused Dr. X to dismantle the
        equipment and try some other approach to his problem. This
        experiment points the way to the use of our modern technology in
        conjunction with Keely's laws of dissociation to change matter
        into energy without the use of radioactive materials or
        extremely expensive atomic accelerators…<br>
        <br>
        Recently we learned that the Water Disrupting Spark Plug
        promoted around 1994 by Stan Meyers was in fact suggested to him
        by Dale Pond at a conference in Switzerland back in 1989. The
        idea was you should be able to use Keely's 42.8khz emitted from
        a spark plug to instantly dissociate the water molecule to
        hydrogen and oxygen which would then be exploded to drive the
        piston.<br>
        <br>
        Meyer took this idea, claimed it as his own and never credited
        Dale with the idea. He cannot patent it because it was disclosed
        in a public place in the presence of witnesses. Needless to say,
        like all of Meyer's other claims, nothing has come of it. </div>

      Water's oxygen hydrogen bonds can be broken in many ways resulting
      in high energy outputs that are stored in water. Since water
      contains an enormous amount of energy, the potentials are endless.

            Into Fire</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. -- A Florida man may have accidentally
      invented a machine that could solve the gasoline and energy crisis
      plaguing the U.S., WPBF News 25 reported.<br>
      <br>
      Sanibel Island resident John Kanzius is a former broadcast
      executive from Pennsylvania who wondered if his background in
      physics and radio could come in handy in treating the disease from
      which he suffers: cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Kanzius, 63, invented a machine that emits radio waves in an
      attempt to kill cancerous cells while leaving normal cells intact.
      While testing his machine, he noticed that his invention had other
      unexpected abilities.<br>
      <br>
      Filling a test tube with salt water from a canal in his back yard,
      Kanzius placed the tube and a paper towel in the machine and
      turned it on. Suddenly, the paper towel ignited, lighting up the
      tube like it was a wax candle.<br>
      <br>
      "Pretty neat, huh?" Kanzius asked WPBF's Jon Shainman.<br>
      <br>
      Kanzius performed the experiment without the paper towel and got
      the same result -- the saltwater was actually burning.<br>
      <br>
      The former broadcasting executive said he showed the experiment to
      a handful of scientists across the country who claim they are
      baffled at watching salt water ignite.<br>
      <br>
      Kanzius said the flame created from his machine reaches a
      temperature of around 3,000 degrees Farenheit. He said a chemist
      told him that the immense heat created from the machine breaks
      down the hydrogen-oxygen bond in the water, igniting the hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      "You could take plain salt water out of the sea, put it in
      containers and produce a violent flame that could heat generators
      that make electricity, or provide other forms of energy," Kanzius
      said.<br>
      <br>
      He said engineers are currently experimenting with him in Erie,
      Pa. in an attempt to harness the energy. They've built an engine
      that, when placed on top of the flame, chugged along for two
      minutes, Kanzius told WPBF.<br>
      <br>
      Kanzius admits all the excitement surrounding a new possible
      energy source was a stroke of luck. Someone who witnessed his work
      on the cancer front asked him if perhaps the machine could be used
      for desalinization.<br>
      <br>
      "This was an experiment to see if I could heat salt water, and
      instead of heat, I got fire," Kanzius said.<br>
      <br>
      Kanzius said he hoped that his invention could one day solve a lot
      of the world's energy problems.<br>
      <br>
      "If I were to be bold enough, I think one day you could power an
      automobile with this, eventually," Kanzius told WPBF. <br>

      The invention discloses an automobile water fuel system with high
      efficiency and low consumption. <b>The system is composed of a
        high frequency and high voltage power supply, a microwave source
        and a hydrogen oxygen generator. </b>The high frequency and
      high voltage power supply comprises a storage battery, a high
      frequency oscillator and a high voltage coil; the microwave source
      is composed of a microwave oven magnetron and an assorted circuit;
      the hydrogen oxygen generator is a reformed miniature water
      welding machine. The storage battery converts direct current into
      alternating current through the high frequency oscillator, boosts
      the alternating current into high frequency and high voltage
      through the high voltage coil and provides the alternating current
      to the magnetron; <b>the magnetron generates 2450 MHz microwaves</b>,
      and the microwaves are introduced into a<b> resonant cavity</b> of
      the<b> hydrogen oxygen generator</b> to drive water molecules to
      generate resonance to crack into H&lt;+&gt; and OH&lt;-&gt; ions
      and generate hydrogen and oxygen under the action of a direct
      current electric field. A mixed gas with a volume ratio of 2:1 is
      prepared from the hydrogen and the oxygen by a flow adjusting
      valve, and the mixed gas is conveyed into an engine compartment
      for burning to propel a crank shaft to rotate. The system is small
      in volume, high in efficiency and low in energy consumption, and
      the gas production speed can satisfy the requirements of the
      engine, so that the system can be used as the fuel systems of all

      by a horn-antenna (4) containing balls (b) or porous ceramics or
      corundum particles (b'), in order to convert the water fed
      thereinto by a nozzle (3) with an electrically-operated valve (5),

          <br>
          <b>COMPONENT I. The Electrical Funtion Generator</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This device has an output consisting of an audio frequency
          (range 20 to 200 Hz) amplitude modulation of a carrier wave
          (range 200 Hz to 100,000 Hz). The impedance of this output
          signal is continuously being matched to the load which is the
          second component, the thermodynamic device.<br>
          <br>
          The electrical function generator represents a novel
          application of circuitry disclosed in my earlier U.S. Pat.
          Nos. 3,629,521; 3,563,246; and 3,726,762, which are
          incorporated by reference herein. See FIG. 1 for the block
          diagram of Component I…<br>
          <br>
          To make the new system operational, the Component I output
          electrodes are connected to component II, but no water is
          placed in the cell of Component III. When Component I output
          is across the load of Component II we observe the following
          electrical parameters are observed:<br>
          <br>
          Range of current (I) output with (dry) load:<br>
          <br>
          0 to 25 mA (milliamperes) rms.<br>
          <br>
          Range of voltage (E) output with (dry) load:<br>
          <br>
          0 to 250 Volts (AC) rms.<br>
          <br>
          There is no distortion of the amplitude modulated (AM), or of
          the sine wave carrier whose center frequency, fc'<br>
          <br>
          Ranges between 59,748 Hz to 66, 221 Hz<br>
          <br>
          with fc average=62, 985 Hz<br>
          <br>
          The carrier frequency varies with the power output in that fc
          goes down with an increase in amperes (current). The AM wave
          form is shown in FIG. 5. It is to be noted here that the
          electrical function generator, Component I, has an automatic
          amplitude modulation volume control which cycles the degree of
          AM from 0% to 100%, and then down from 100% to 0% ≅ every 3.0
          seconds. This cycle rate of 3.0 seconds corresponds to the
          nuclear spin relaxation time, τ/sec, of the water in Component
          III…<br>
          <br>
          <b>Appearance of Rippled Square Waves</b><br>
          <br>
          Phase 1: At the end of the Stage A dry charging, the output of
          Component I is lowered to a typical value of:<br>
          <br>
          I=1mA.&nbsp; E=24VAC. fc ≅66,234 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          Phase 2: Then water is added to the Component III water cell
          drop by drop until the top of the center electrode, 1', in
          FIG. 3 is covered, and when this water just makes contact with
          the inner surface of the top outer electrode at 2'. As this
          coupling of the two electrodes by water happens, the following
          series of events occur:<br>
          <br>
          Phase 3: The fc drops from 66,234 Hz, to a range from 1272 Hz
          to 1848 Hz. The current and voltage both drop, and begin to
          pulse in entrainment with the water nuclear spin relaxation
          constant, τ=3.0 sec. The presence of the nuclear spin
          relaxation oscillation is proven by a characteristic
          hysteresis loop on the X-Y axes of an oscillscope.<br>
          <br>
          I=0 to 0.2mA surging at τ cycle<br>
          <br>
          E=4.3 to 4.8VAC surging at τ cycle<br>
          <br>
          The sine wave carrier converts to a rippled square wave pulse
          which reflects the RC time constant of water, and it is
          observed that the square wave contains higher order harmonics.
          See FIG. 6:<br>
          <br>
          With the appearance of the rippled square wave, the threshold
          of hydrolysis may be detected (just barely) as a vapor
          precipitation on a cover glass slip placed over the Component
          III cell and viewed under a low power microscope...<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The `Open Circuit` Reversible Threshold Effect<br>
          <br>
          Phase 4: A secondary effect of the change in the RC constant
          of water on the wave form shows up as a full half wave
          rectification of the carrier wave indicating a high level of
          polarization of the water molecule in tetrahedral form at the
          outer electrode.<br>
          <br>
          With the already noted appearance of the rippled square wave,
          and the signs of faint vapor precipitation which indicate the
          earliest stage of electrolysis, it is possible to test for the
          presence of a reversible hydrolysis threshold. This test is
          carried out by creating an open circuit between Components I
          and II, i.e., no current flows. This is done by lowering the
          water level between the two electrodes in the region--1' and
          2' shown in FIG. 3; or by interrupting the circuit between
          Component I and II, while the Component I signal generator is
          on and oscillating.<br>
          <br>
          Immediately, with the creation of an `open circuit` condition,
          the following effects occur:<br>
          <br>
          (a) The carrier frequency, fc, shifts from Phase 4 valve 1272
          Hz to 1848 Hz to 6128 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          (b) The current and voltage drop to zero on the meters which
          record I and E, but the oscilloscope continues to show the
          presence of the peak-to-peak (p-p) voltage, and the waveform
          shows a remarkable effect. The rippled square wave has
          disappeared, and in its place there appear unipolar (positive)
          pulses as follows in FIG. 6A.<br>
          <br>
          The unipolar pulse frequency stabilizes to ca. 5000 Hz. The
          unipolar pulses undergo a 0 to 1.3 volt pulsing amplitude
          modulation with τ at 3.0 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, there exists a pure open circuit reversible threshold
          for water electrolysis in which the water molecules are
          capacitor charging and discharging at their characteristic low
          frequency RC time constant of 0.0002 seconds. It is to be
          noted that pure water has a very high dielectric constant
          which makes such an effect possible. The pulsing amplitude
          modulation of the voltage is determined by the Hydrogen
          Nuclear Spin Relaxation constant, where τ≅3.0 seconds. It is
          to be noted that the positive pulse spikes are followed by a
          negative after-potential. These pulse wave forms are identical
          to the classic nerve action potential spikes found in the
          nervous system of all living species that have a nervous
          system. The fact that these unipolar pulses were observed
          arising in water under the conditions of reversible threshold
          hydrolysis has a profound significance. These findings
          illuminate and confirm the Warren McCulloch Theory of water
          "crystal" dynamics as being the foundation of neural dynamics;
          and the converse theory of Linus Pauling which holds that
          water clathrate formation is the mechanism of neural
          anesthesia.<br>
          <br>
          Phase 5: The effects associated with reversible threshold
          electrolysis are noted only in passim since they reflect
          events which are occurring on the electrode surfaces of
          Component II, the Thermodynamic Device.<br>
          <br>
          A principal effect that occurs in Stage B, Phase 3, in
          Component II, the thermodynamic device, is that the two
          electrodes undergo stages of polarization. It has been
          observed in extensive experiments with different kinds of
          fluids in the cell of Component II i.e., distilled water, sea
          water, tap water, Ringers solution, dilute suspensions of
          animal and human blood cells, that the inner surface of the
          outer ring electrode at 3' in FIG. 3 (the electrode that is in
          contact with the fluid) becomes negatively charged. Referring
          to FIG. 7, this corresponds to the left hand columnar area
          marked, Electrode ⊖.<br>
          Electrode Polarization Effects at the Interface Between
          Components II and III<br>
          <br>
          Concurrently with the driver pulsing of Component I at the τ
          constant cycle which leads to electrode polarization effects
          in Component II, there is an action on Component III which
          energizes and entrains the water molecule to a higher energy
          level which shifts the bond angle from 104° to the tetrahedral
          form with angle 109°28' as shown in FIGS. 8 and 15. This
          electronic pumping action is most important, and represents a
          significant part of the novel method of this invention for
          several reasons. First, the shift to the tetrahedral form of
          water increases the structural stability of the water
          molecule, thereby making it more susceptible to breakage at
          the correct resonant frequency, or frequencies. Second,
          increasing the polarization of the water molecule makes the
          lone pair electrons, S- connected with the oxygen molecule
          more electronegative; and the weakly positive hydrogen atoms,
          S+ more positive. See FIG. 9 and FIG. 22.<br>
          <br>
          As the outer electrode becomes more electronegative, the
          center electrode concomitantly becomes more electropositive as
          will be shown. As the polarity of the water molecule
          tetrahedron increases, a repulsive force occurs between the
          two S+ apices of the water tetrahedron and the negatively
          charged electrode surface within the region of the Helmholtz
          layer, as shown in FIG. 7. This effect "orients" the water
          molecule in the field, and is the well-known "orientation
          factor" of electrochemistry which serves to catalyse the rate
          of oxygen dissociation from the water molecule, and thereby
          causes the reaction rate to proceed at the lowest energy
          levels. See FIG. 10 for an example of how the orientation
          factor works.<br>
          <br>
          Near the end of Stage B, the conditions are established for
          the beginning of the next stage, the stage of high efficiency
          electrolysis of water.<br>
          STAGE C<br>
          <br>
          Generation of the complex wave form frequencies from Component
          I to match the complex wave form resonant frequencies of the
          energized and highly polarized water molecule in tetrahedral
          form with angles, 109°28' are carried out in Stage C.<br>
          <br>
          In the operation of the invention active bubble electrolysis
          of water is initiated following Stage B, phase 3 by setting
          (automatically) the output of Component I to:<br>
          <br>
          I=1mA.,&nbsp; E=22VAC-rms,<br>
          <br>
          causing the rippled square wave pulses to disappear with the
          appearance of a rippled sawtooth wave. The basic frequency of
          the carrier now becomes, fc =3980 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          The wave form now automatically shifts to a form found to be
          the prime characteristic necessary for optimum efficiency in
          the electrolysis of water and illustrated in FIG. 11. In the
          wave form of FIG. 11, the fundamental carrier frequency, fc
          =3980 Hz., and a harmonic modulation of the carrier is as
          follows:<br>
          <br>
          1st Order Harmonic Modulation (OHM)=7960 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          2nd Order Harmonic Modulation (II OHM)=15,920 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          3rd Order Harmonic Modulation (III OHM)=31,840 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          4th Order Harmonic Modulation (IV OHM)=63,690 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          What is believed to be happening in this IV OHM effect is that
          each of the four apices of the tetrahedron water molecule is
          resonant to one of the four harmonics observed. It is believed
          that the combination of negative repulsive forces at the outer
          electrode with the resonant frequencies just described work
          together to shatter the water molecule into its component
          hydrogen and oxygen atoms (as gases). This deduction is based
          on the following observations of the process through a low
          power microscope. The hydrogen bubbles were seen to originate
          at the electrode rim, 4', of FIG. 3. The bubbles then moved in
          a very orderly `pearl chain` formation centripetally (like the
          spokes of a wheel) toward the center electrode, 1' of FIG. 3.
          FIG. 12 shows a top view of this effect.<br>
          <br>
          Thereafter, upon lowering the output of Component I, the
          threshold for electrolysis of water as evidenced by vapor
          deposition of water droplets on a glass cover plate over the
          cell of Component III, is: ##EQU1## with all other conditions
          and waveforms as described under Stage C, supra. Occasionally,
          this threshold can be lowered to: ##EQU2##<br>
          <br>
          This Stage C vapor hydrolysis threshold effect cannot be
          directly observed as taking place in the fluid because no
          bubbles are formed--only invisible gas molecules which become
          visible when they strike a glass plate and combine into water
          molecules and form droplets which appear as vapor.<br>
          STAGE D<br>
          <br>
          Production of hydrogen and oxygen gas at an efficient rate of
          water electrolysis is slowed in Stage D when a barrier
          potential is formed, which barrier blocks electrolysis,
          irrespective of the amount of power applied to Components II
          and III.<br>
          <br>
          A typical experiment will illustrate the problems of barrier
          potential formation. Components I, II, and III are set to
          operate with the following parameters: ##EQU3##<br>
          <br>
          This input to Component III yields, by electrolysis of water,
          approximately 0.1 cm3 of hydrogen gas per minute at one
          atmosphere and 289° K. It is observed that as a function of
          time the fc crept up from 2978 Hz to 6474 Hz over 27 minutes.
          The current and the voltage also rose with time. At the 27th
          minute a barrier effect blocked the electrolysis of water, and
          one can best appreciate the cycle of events by reference to
          FIG. 13…<br>
          <br>
          STAGE F<br>
          <br>
          Region C: It was found that the barrier effect could be
          unblocked by some relatively simple procedures:<br>
          <br>
          (a) Reversing the output electrodes from Component I to
          Component II, and/or:<br>
          <br>
          (b) Mechanically tapping the Component III cell at a frequency
          T/2=1.5 seconds per tap.<br>
          <br>
          These effects are shown in FIG. 12 and induce the drop in
          barrier potential from: ##EQU4##<br>
          <br>
          Upon unblocking of the barrier effect, electrolysis of water
          resumed with renewed bubble formation of hydrogen gas.<br>
          <br>
          The barrier potential problem has been solved for practical
          application by lowering the high dielectric constant of pure
          water, by adding salts (NaCl, KOH, etc.) to the pure water
          thereby increasing its conductivity characteristics. For
          optimum efficiency the salt concentration need not exceed that
          of sea water (0.9% salinity) in Section 3, "Thermodynamics of
          the Invention", it is to be understood that all water
          solutions described are not "pure" water as in Section B, but
          refer only to salinized water…<br>
          <br>
          A typical set of experiments (using water in the form of 0.9%
          saline solution =0.1540 molar concentration) to obtain high
          efficiency hydrolysis gave the following results:<br>
          <br>
          rms Current=I=25 mA to 38 mA (0.025 A to 0.038 A)<br>
          <br>
          rms Volts=E=4 Volts to 2.6 Volts<br>
          <br>
          The resultant ratio between current and voltage is dependent
          on many factors, such as the gap distance between the center
          and ring electrodes, dielectric properties of the water,
          conductivity properties of the water, equilibrium states,
          isothermal conditions, materials used, and even the presence
          of clathrates. The above current and voltage values reflect
          the net effect of various combinations of such parameters. The
          product of rms current, and rms volts is a measure of the
          power, P in watts:<br>
          <br>
          P=I×E=25 mA×4.0 volts=100 mW(0.1 W)<br>
          <br>
          P=I×E=38 mA×2.6 volts=98.8 mW(0.0988 W)<br>
          <br>
          At these power levels (with load), the resonant frequency of
          the system is 600 Hz (±5 Hz) as measured on a precision
          frequency counter. The wave form was monitored for harmonic
          content on an oscilloscope, and the nuclear magnetic
          relaxation cycle was monitored on an X-Y plotting oscilloscope
          in order to maintain the proper hysteresis loop figure. All
          experiments were run so that the power in Watts, applied
          through Components I, II, and III ranged between 98.8 mW to
          100 mW…<br>

              ELETROLYSIS OF HIGH FREQUENCY.</b><br>

          </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
          <br>
          Several processes have been considered for hydrogen obtaining
          of water, being the electrolysis the most important of them.
          The problem with all those is that the expense of energy to
          liberate hydrogen of the molecule that contains it is greater
          that the energy gotten for the release of hydrogen. The same
          situation happens in the case of eletrolise of water.<br>
          <br>
          Our system, which differs from conventional electrolyses
          (constant voltage), consists of an arrangement of two plates
          parallel bars with a capacitor, where the pure water acting as
          a dielectric in a resonant circuit that includes an inductor
          in series with the capacitor. Submitting the capacitor the
          pulses of unipolar voltage with a frequency of approximately
          45 kHz, induces a frequency of resonance to the water
          molecule. The energy supplied to each oscillation of the
          molecule is absorbed until the separation of its principal
          components (hydrogen and oxygen).<br>
          <br>
          By the nature of the resonance, this is a much more efficient
          system that conventional electrolysis or any another form of
          hydrogen obtaining.<br>
          <br>
          Numerous processes have been proposed for separating water
          molecule into its elemental hydrogen and oxygen components,
          like steam reforming of water, or electrolysis. The
          electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing
          hydrogen, although the resulting hydrogen necessarily has less
          energy content than was required to produce it. <br>
          <br>
          In this work, we continued the pionering work of Stanley
          Mayer1 for obtaining hydrogen providing a capacitor, in which
          water is included as a dielectric between capacitor plates,
          and subjeting this to a pulsating unipolar electric charging
          voltage.<br>
          <br>
          [ Meyer, Stanley A., Method for the production of a fuel gas,
          U.S. Patent 4,936,961 ]<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Briefly, the method used in the first stage consists, in
          agreement with Mayer, of:<br>
          <br>
          (A)&nbsp; providing a capacitor, in which the water is
          included as a dielectric liquid between capacitor plates, in a
          resonant charging choke circuit that includes an inductance in
          series with the capacitor (see Figures 1 and 2);<br>
          <br>
          (B)&nbsp; subjecting the capacitor to a pulsating unipolar
          electric voltage field in which the polarity does not pass
          beyond an arbitrary ground, whereby the water molecules within
          the capacitor are subjected to a charge of the same polarity
          and the water molecules are distended by their subjection to
          electrical polar forces;<br>
          <br>
          (C)&nbsp;&nbsp; further subjecting the water, such capacitor
          pulsating an electric field to achieve a pulse frequency such
          that the electric field induces a resonance within the water
          molecule;<br>
          <br>
          (D)&nbsp;&nbsp; continuing the application of the pulsing
          frequency to the capacitor cell after resonance occurs, so
          that the energy level within the molecule is increased in
          cascading incremental steps in proportion to the number of
          pulses; <br>
          <br>
          (E)&nbsp; maintaining the charge of capacitor during the
          application of the pulsing field, whereby the covalent
          electrical binding of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within
          their molecules is destabilized such that the force of the
          electrical field applied, as same as the force is effective
          within the molecule, exceeds the binding force of the
          molecule, and hydrogen and oxygen atoms are liberated from the
          molecules as elemental gases; and&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          (F)&nbsp;&nbsp; collecting the hydrogen and oxygen gases, and

          The water molecules are subjected to increasing electrical
          forces. In normal conditions of temperature (25°C) and
          pression (1atm), randomly oriented water molecules are aligned
          with respect to a molecular polar orientation. They are
          themselves polarized and elongated by the application of an
          electric potential.&nbsp; Water in the fuel cell is subjected
          to a pulsating polar electric field produced by the electrical
          circuit whereby the water molecules are distended by reason of
          their subjection to electrical unipolar forces of the
          capacitor plates. The positively electrically charged hydrogen
          atoms of such aligned molecules are attracted in a direction
          opposite to the negatively charged oxigen atom, because this
          is repeled for the plate of the same charge, as shown in Fig.
          3. This effect is different when the plates are dipolar, since
          in this case the molecule will be only aligned in the
          direction of the field produced by them with its variation in
          time. In our unipolar case, the variation alternate in the
          time will produce that the atoms of the molecule oscillate
          around their center of charge, and undergo a elongation in
          this direction. Then, the polar pulsating frequency of the
          circuit, which generates a symetricel squarewave applied, is
          such that the pulsating electric field induces a resonance in
          the molecule. The hydrogen and oxygen atomic gases, and other
          gas components formerly entrapped as dissolved gases in water,
          are released when the resonant energy exceeds the covalent
          binding force of the water molecule. A cascade effect occurs,
          and the overall energy level of specific water molecules is
          increased in cascading incremental steps. In the process, the
          point of optimum gas release is reached at a circuit
          resonance.<br>

          For a given power, resonant electrolysis increases the
          hydrogen liberation, in comparison to electrolysis with
          constant voltage, since the transformer of the circuit
          increases the voltage in a proportion of thousands of times,
          at the cost of diminishing the current to miliamperers, but
          letting the power remains constant. According to it, the
          dissociation of the water in its components could be the
          resonance of the circuit exerts on the dielectric properties
          of the water locked up within the capacitor. We think that, in
          order that must molecular resonance induced by this circuit.
          The high voltage can help this one phenomenon that is applied
          simultaneously separating the atoms. In a future work, we will
          try to demonstrate the hypothesis of the molecular resonance
          trying to reproduce this effect with voltages smaller to 1.5
          V, that is the necessary one to separate hydrogen of the water
          by electrolysis, and that could possibly help to discard or to
          confirm this one effect, and the other of ionization by high
          voltage.<br>
          <br>
          This is a much more efficient system that conventional
          electrolysis or any another form of hydrogen obtaining,
          because the energy to the proper frequency of natural
          resonance of the water is injected, being the absorption of
          this almost total.<br>
