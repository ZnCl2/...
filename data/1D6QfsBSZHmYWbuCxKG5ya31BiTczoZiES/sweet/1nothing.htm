      <p><b>Theoretical Overview</b> </p>
      <p><i>Nothing</i>, on the cosmological scale, is virtually
        everything. It is the home of all the invisible fields, rippling
        with the activity of every real force. Every kind of matter
        produces a field, the field all mesh in complex ways, often
        causing interference with other fields. Fields are the "stuff"
        of the virtual vacuum. A light particle is nothing more than a
        large interference in the electromagnetic field. Apart from
        interaction with matter of other fields a field will not be
        changed in the vacuum. It will not go away; it cannot. Fields
        are a fundamental part of the vacuum structure itself. Fields in
        their most quiescent state form the virtual vacuum itself. Even
        when everything that can be removed from a vacuum has been
        removed, the Higgs field remains. `"Imagine the entire universe
        permeated with a constant magnetic field". One need not imagine,
        for it is true. It is clear from experimentation that certain
        results appear that are not explainable without the presence of
        a field. The field consists of an infinite number of
        one-dimensional North and South poles in an incoherent state-
        incoherent due to the presence of a multitude of other
        interfering fields formed by other North and South poles, or
        particles or quanta. Thus the virtual vacuum is far from empty,
        far from nothing, it is rather seething with potential energy as
        the primordial powerhouse of everything in the universe. </p>
      <p>As postulated by Einstein in his famous equation E = MC<sup>2</sup>
        , energy is a kind of matter. So even the energy of distant
        starlight must be accounted for in any holistic view of physical
        reality. The vacuum itself is literally popping with virtual
        particles that appear and disappear in the field during instants
        too brief to be measured. Virtual particles with lifetimes or
        dwelltimes too short for the name "particles" to be appropriate.
        As a result the generated fields are always in some state of
        flux. However, under the influence of a generated Motional
        Electromagnetic field parts of the normally chaotic virtual
        field break off from randomness and form a more coherent region.
        This region consists of a structured portion of the spacetime
        continuum which by its very nature seems to attract more virtual
        particles (This increase in particle density has been verified
        by lab experiments conducted the week of June 19, 1988). This
        higher concentration of particles develops a warping of the
        spacetime continuum where negative energy is produced in
        abundance. The existence of this condition via direct
        engineering of the virtual state allows for the safe generation
        of electrical energy. This condition, in essence, forms the
        underlying principle of operation of the Phase-Conjugated Vacuum
        Triode. This device, however, produces negative energy which is
        the reverse of the conventional positive energy generated by all
        devices in service today. The arc generated by a short-circuit
        in a negative energy system is excessively bright and cold,
        producing barely an audible hiss with no explosive force.
        Melting of conductors does not occur and this type of negative
        current passes through the human body with only the feeling of a
        chill. Conductors remain cool under load while only tiny
        cross-sectional areas of copper are required to convey many
        hundreds of watts of power. Although all of this seems nearly
        unbelievable, only what has been demonstrated in the laboratory
        has been described in this paper. The source of energy is
        unlimited, the virtual vacuum of space itself structured by a
        motional electromagnetic field is the powerhouse. </p>
      <p><b>The Nature of Space</b> </p>
      <p>Space itself is the ability to accommodate energy. Consider for
        a moment the following illustration: A signal (energy) is
        transmitted from point A to point B. A and B are separated by a
        finite distance. Consider three periods of time: </p>
      <p>1) The signal is launched from A. <br>
        2) The signal resides in the space between A and B. <br>
        3) The signal arrives at B. </p>
      <p>If (3) occurs simultaneously with (1) we say that the signal
        has traveled at infinite velocity. The signal has never resided
        in the intervening space and therefore <u>there exists no space
          between A and B</u>. A is virtually at the same point in space
        as B. For real space to exist between A and B it is necessary
        that a signal travelling between them be "lost" with reference
        to both points for a finite period of time. </p>
      <p>Now we know that for real space to exist between two points a
        signal travelling between them will propagate at a finite
        velocity&nbsp;<img src="p1.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="24" width="87">.
        If a signal will not travel between two points, as in the case
        when c = 0, then we can also conclude that there is no link or
        intervening space between them. We have no means of detecting
        either an infinite velocity-supporting space or zero-velocity
        space, so they do not exist as usable scientific concepts. If
        space cannot accommodate a signal it has no function and no
        reality. We are left then with the only real space, the home of
        the real and virtual vacuum. Space which supports a finite,
        nonzero velocity where&nbsp;<img src="p2.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="22" width="66">. </p>
      <p>The above discussion dealt with a definition of space and the
        propagation velocity it will support. A similar argument applies
        to the impedance of space. A medium can only accommodate
        positive energy if the medium resists it to a reasonable degree.
        Neither an infinitely strong spring nor an infinitely weak one
        can absorb or accommodate energy by being compressed. Neither an
        infinitely large mass nor an infinitely light mass can absorb or
        accommodate energy imparted by collision. The same holds true
        for space. Energy cannot enter space of zero impedance
        (i.e;&nbsp;<img src="p3.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="20" width="55">)
        any more than a force can bear on a mass of zero magnitude.
        Similarly, energy could not enter space of infinite impedance.
        It follows therefore, that necessary properties of real space
        are: </p>
      <p>1) finite propagation velocity <br>
        2) finite impedance. </p>
      <p>Continuing our discussion of space and the values of c, Z<sub>o</sub>,
        µ,<img src="p4.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="9" width="10">
        we take as given that real space sustains non-zero finite
        impedance and velocity as follows: </p>
      <p><img src="p2.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="22" width="66"><img
          src="p5.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          height="24" width="70"></p>
      <p>where: µ and<img src="p4.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="9" width="10">
        are characteristics of a unit volume. </p>
      <p>As yet we have not arrived at volume, which implies real space.
        At this point in our discussion we have merely described c and Z<sub>o</sub>
        . Therefore, we can only define µ and&nbsp;<img src="p4.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="9" width="10"> in terms of them. Algebraically it can
        be shown that: </p>
      <p><img src="p6.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="18" width="80"><img
          src="p7.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          height="18" width="66"></p>
      <p>Although we have said that the fundamental characteristics of
        space are c and Z<sub>o</sub> , perhaps it is better to say that
        they are t and Z<sub>o</sub> , where t is the time delay through
        a finite segment of space replacing c, the velocity through that
        segment. It is profitable to move away from the idea of constant
        velocity c travelling through space which leads one to
        conceptualization of a segment of space which traversed in 1
        nanosecond (nsec) is 1 foot long. If one starts with a
        conceptual frame in which space is in terms of t, a segment of
        space can easily be though of as 1 nsec wide, and the energy
        entering it appears leaving it 1 nsec later. Subsidiary concepts
        of length and velocity can then be deduced as needed. We could
        alternately say that space was (a) 1 foot wide with a
        propagation velocity of 1 foot/nsec, or (b) 2 feet wide with a
        velocity of 2 feet/nsec. Fundamental to the proposed world view
        is the reality that no experiment could help us decide between
        (a) and (b). The essence of space is time, not distance, and
        only one propagation velocity (<img src="p8.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="19" width="42">) is possible through a segment of
        space. Thus, time through a segment is <br>
        intimately related to the length of the segment. Propagation
        which is not at the speed of light cannot exist according to
        this world view. </p>
      <p><b>General Description of Energy Transfer</b> </p>
      <p>Consider energy, flowing straight and level down the proximity
        of a transmission line. The energy does not know the width of
        the channel through which it is passing. If the energy reaches a
        point where the dielectric changes (but not the geometry), some
        of it will continue on and some of it will reflect. If the
        energy reaches a change in the width of the transmission line
        some will reflect and some will continue as well. The energy
        current will not know whether: </p>
      <p>(a) the dielectric is changing, or <br>
        (b) the geometry is changing. </p>
      <p>Energy current does not have directional inertia, so that (a)
        is equivalent to (b). Energy current <u>does</u> have an aspect
        ratio. If the aspect ratio is forced to change, some of the
        flowing energy will reflect in order to assure that its <u>total</u>
        aspect ratio remains constant. Crudely, the aspect ratio is
        similar to the ratio of E to H, or the same as the ratio
        of&nbsp;<img src="p4.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="9" width="10">to
        µ<img src="p9.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="22" width="48">.
        The aspect ratio of energy current is much like the aspect ratio
        of space. While the aspect ratio of space can change, it
        fundamental velocity<img src="p2.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="22" width="66">
        cannot really change. This parameter becomes merely our way of
        conceptualizing time delay when energy resides in a region of
        space. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="p10.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
            x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle" height="138"
            width="246"><br>
          A /B = Aspect Ratio</p>
      </center>
      <p>Uniform space has only two parameters: </p>
      <p>1) aspect ratio <br>
        2) time delay. </p>
      <p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of energy entering a given
        region of space, but not its amplitude. Velocity or length
        define the time during which the properly shaped energy can be
        accommodated by a region of space. Aspect ratio is really a
        definition of the relative compatibility of adjacent regions of
        space. Does flowing energy current largely travel unimpeded
        through an interface, or does it largely reflect at the
        interface? Space has quiet zones through which energy glides
        virtually unreflected. There are also noisy zones where energy
        current becomes incoherent, bounces about and splits apart.
        Noisy zones in space have either rapidly changing geometry or
        rapidly changing impedance (<img src="p11.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="19" width="37">). </p>
      <p><b>Electromagnetic Energy</b> </p>
      <p>The rate of flow of energy through a surface can be calculated
        as a function of E and H. Specifically this flow is equivalent
        to E<b>.</b>H per unit area. This energy flows at the speed of
        light through a medium where<img src="p2.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="22" width="66"> . E and H are in quadrature and are
        normal to the direction of the energy flow. The energy density
        is therefore: E<b>.</b>H/c. If two signals of equal magnitude
        (assume E/2 &amp; H/2) are travelling through each other in
        opposite directions the energy density is calculated as follows:
      </p>
      <p><img src="p12.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="53" width="111"></p>
      <p>If the directions of the two signals are such that opposite
        H-fields cancel and E-fields add, an apparently steady E-field
        will be created. The energy density of the fields remain as
        calculated above, but the value of the E-field will double from
        E/2 to E. It is a simple matter using the equations&nbsp;<img
          src="p13.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          align="middle" height="23" width="83"> and&nbsp;<img
          src="p2.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          align="middle" height="22" width="66"> for a team wave to get
        rid of H and c and so convert the first equation into the well
        known equation for energy density in the so-called electrostatic
        field: </p>
      <p><img src="p14.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="38" width="186"></p>
      <p>Similarly, if two signals flow through each other in such a way
        as to give the appearance of a steady magnetic field as a result
        of their E-field canceling it is easily shown using the above
        equations to cancel out H and c so that: </p>
      <p><img src="p15.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="36" width="183"></p>
      <p>Modern physics is based upon the faulty assumption that
        electromagnetics contains two kinds of energy: electric and
        magnetic. This assumption leads to a Baroque view of physical
        reality. Under that view energy seems to be associated with the
        square of the field intensity rather than a more reasonable view
        that it is linearly proportional to field intensity. It is worth
        remembering that neither Einstein nor most modern physicists
        were or are familiar with the concept of energy currents
        described herein. However, their work still survives by ignoring
        the energy current concept, scalar electromagnetics, the works
        of T. E. Bearden, Kaluza-Klein, and others who dispute
        Heaviside's interpretations of Maxwell's equations. </p>
      <p><b>The Fallacy of Displacement Current</b> </p>
      <p>Conventional electromagnetic theory proposes that when an
        electric current flows down a wire into a capacitor it spreads
        out across the plate, producing an electric charge on the plate
        which in turn leads to an electric field between the capacitor
        plates. The valuable concept of continuity is then retained by
        postulating "after Maxwell" a displacement current. This current
        is a manipulation of the electric field (E) between the
        capacitor plates which has the dimensions of electric current
        and completes the flow of electricity in the circuit. This
        approach permits us to retain Kirchoff's laws and other valuable
        concepts even though superficially it appears that at the
        capacitor there is a break in the continuous flow of electric
        current. The flaw in this model appears when we notice that the
        current entered the capacitor at only one point on the capacitor
        plate. We then are left with the major difficulty of explaining
        how the electric charge flowing down the wire suddenly
        distributes itself uniformly across the entire capacitor plate,
        at a velocity in excess of the speed of light. This paradoxical
        situation is created by a flaw in the basic model. Work in high
        speed logic conducted by Ivor Catt has shown that the model of
        lumped capacitance is faulty and displacement current is an
        artifact of the faulty model. Since any capacitor behaves
        similarly to a transmission line it is no more necessary to
        postulate a displacement current for the capacitor than it is
        necessary to do so for a transmission line. The excision of
        "displacement current" from electromagnetic theory has been
        based on arguments which are independent of the classic dispute
        over whether the electric current causes the electromagnetic
        field, or vice versa. </p>
      <p><b>The Motional E-Field</b> </p>
      <p>Of all the known fields --- electric, magnetic, gravitational
        and motional E-field --- the only ones incapable of being
        shielded are the induced motional E-field and the gravitational
        field. The nature of the motionally induced electric field is
        quite unique; in order understand it more fully we must start by
        parting with a few misleading paradigms. When magnetic flux is
        moved perpendicularly across a conductor an electromotive force
        (emf) is electromagnetically induced "within'' the conductor.
        "Within" is an artifact of the commonly used analogy comparing
        the flow of electric current within a wire to the flow of water
        within a pipe. This is a most misleading model theoretically.
        The true phenomenon taking place has little been thought of as
        involving the production of a spatially distributed electric
        field. We can see that the model's origins likely arose from the
        operation called "flux cutting", a most deceiving and misleading
        term. A better term, "time varying flux modulation", does not
        imply any separation of lines of flux. Truly, lines of flux are
        always in closure upon themselves and are mathematically
        expressed as line integrals. It is fallacious to use the term
        "cutting", which implies time varying separation which does not
        in fact ever occur. A motionally induced E-field is actually
        created within the space occupied by the moving magnetic flux
        described above. This field is present therein, whether or not a
        conductor is present in the space. In terms of a definition we
        can say that, when magnetic flux of vector intensity&nbsp;<img

      <p>It is this field that is related to gravity, it is virtually
        unshieldable. This field may be called the Motional E-field.
        According to T.E. Bearden, "It seems that the charged particles
        in the atom (electrons and protons) act like tiny magnets. Their
        motion in the space surrounding the atom would create this
        motional E-field". The field created by both the positive and
        negative charges would cancel to some degree, but due to the
        high orbital velocity of the negative electron relative to that
        of the positive proton the induced field of the electron should
        dominate the resulting field. The field produced as a result of
        these charges would vary proportionally to the inverse square of
        distance similar to gravity. The field produced by the
        translational motion of the charges would vary inversely as the
        cube of distance. This concept totally unites the
        electromagnetic and gravitational field theories and accounts
        for the strong and weak forces within the atom. </p>
      <p><b>Field Super-Position &amp; The Vacuum Triode</b> </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic induction with no measurable magnetic field is
        not new. It is well known that in the space surrounding a
        properly wound toroidal coil there is no magnetic field. This is
        due to the superposition of the fields. However, when
        alternating current is surging through a transformer an electric
        field surrounds it. When we apply the principle of superposition
        to the vacuum triode it becomes more obvious how the device is
        in fact operating. </p>
      <p>The principle of superposition states that "In order to
        calculate the resultant intensity of superimposed fields, each
        field must be dealt with individually as though the other were
        not present". The resultant is obtained by vector addition of
        each field considered singularly. Consider for a moment the
        construction of the triode which includes the bifilar coils
        located within the fields of the two conditioned magnets. When
        the current in one half of the conductors in the coils (i.e.,
        one of the bifilar elements in each coil) of the device is
        moving up, both the current and the magnetic field follow the
        right-hand rule. The resultant motional E-field would be
        vertical to both and inwardly directed. At the same time the
        current in the other half of the conductors in the coils is
        moving down and both the current and magnetic field follow the
        right-hand rule. The resulting motion E-field is again vertical
        to both and inwardly directed. Thus, the resultant field
        intensity is double the intensity attributable to either one of
        the set of coil conductors taken singularly. Expressed

        field which theory states is proportional to the current.
        Electrometer readings were always close to parabolic, thus
        indicating that the source was of infinite capacity. It was
        further determined through experiment that the magnetic field
        does not change with temperature. Also, there is no reason yet

      <p><b>Induced Electromotive Force: Positive Energy</b> </p>
      <p>When an emf. is impressed on a closed metallic circuit, current
        results. The emf along a closed path C in space is defined as
        the work per unit charge (W/Q) done by the electromagnetic
        fields on a small test charge moved along path C. Since work is
        the line integral of force (F), the work per unit charge is the
        line integral of force per unit charge. Letting F/Q denote the
        vector electromagnetic force per unit charge (in newtons per
        coulomb) we have </p>

      <p>The electric force per unit charge is the electric field
        intensity (E) in volts/meter. The magnetic force per unit charge
        is V x B where V denotes the velocity of the test charge in
        meters per second and B denotes the magnetic flux density in
        webers/M<sup>2</sup>. In terms of the smaller angle<img

          align="middle" height="14" width="9"> between V and B, the

          align="middle" height="14" width="9">. The direction of vector
        VxB is normal to the plane which contains vectors V and B in
        accordance with the right-hand rule (i.e., VxB is in the
        direction of the thumb while the fingers curl through the angle<img
          src="p23.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          align="middle" height="14" width="9"> from V toward B). Since

        (4) </p>
      <p>It appears from eq. (4) that the emf depends on the forward
        velocity with which the test charge is moved along the path C.
        This, however, is not the case. If V and dl in eq. (4) have the
        same direction then their associated scalar product is zero.
        Thus, only the component of V which is not in-line with dl (i.e.<img
          src="p23.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          align="middle" height="14" width="9"> = 0) can contribute to
        the emf.. This component has value only if the differential path
        length dl has a sideways motion. Thus, V in eq. (4) represents
        the sideways motion, if any, of dl. The fields E and B in eq.(4)
        could well be represented as functions of time as well as
        functions of the space coordinates. In addition, the velocity V
        of each differential path length dl may vary with time. However,
        eq. (4) correctly expresses the emf or voltage drop along path C
        as a function of time. That component of the emf consisting of
        the line integral V x B is the motional E-field since it has
        value ony when path C is moving through a magnetic field,
        traversing lines of magnetic flux. For stationary paths there is
        no motional E-field and the voltage drop is simply the integral
        of the electric field E. Emfs are generated by devices that
        separate charge. A familiar example is the battery which
        utilizes chemical forces to separate charge. Other examples
        include the heating of a thermocouple, exposure of a
        photovoltaic cell to incident light, or the rubbing together of
        different materials (electrostatic charge separation). Electric
        fields are also produced by time varying magnetic fields. This
        principle is extensively exploited to produce conventional
        electric power in the utility industry. </p>

      <p>Continuing this discussion leads us to note that an electric

        is the magnetic flux in webers out of the positive side of any
        surface having path C as its contour. Combining eq. (7) above
        with eq. (4) we are able to calculate the emf about a closed
        path C. This is shown below: </p>

        (9) </p>
      <p>Thus, the emf around a closed path consists in general of two
        components. The component d<img src="p25.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="13" width="14">/dt is the variational emf and the
        second component is the motional E-field. In eq.(9) (V x B)dl
        can be means of a vector identity be replaced with B*(V x dl)A.
        V is the sideways velocity of dl, the vector Vxdl has magnitude
        Vdl and a direction normal to the surface ds swept out by moving
        length dl in time d. Letting B<sub>n</sub> denote the component
        of B normal to this area we can see that -B*(v x dl) becomes -B<sub>n</sub>Vdl




        and eq.(9) can be rewritten as: </p>

      <p>Clearly, the integral of B<sub>n</sub>V around the closed
        contour C with sideways velocity of magnitude V for each length
        dl traversed is simply the time rate of change of the magnetic
        flux through the surface bounded by C. This change is due
        directly to the passage of path C through lines of magnetic
        flux. Hence, the complete expression of emf above in eq.(10) is
        the time rate of change of the magnetic flux over any surface S
        bounded by the closed path C, due to the changing magnetic field
        and the movement of the path through the magnetic field. eq.(10)
        may be written: </p>

      <p><i>Note</i>: The only difference between eq.(7) and eq.(11) is
        that eq.(7) contains only the variational emf while eq.(11) is
        the sum of the variational and motional emf's. In eq.(7) the
        partial time derivative of magnetic flux<img src="p25.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="13" width="14">is the rate of flux change due only to
        the time varying magnetic field while eq.(11) includes the total
        time derivative of the rate of flux change due to the time
        varying magnetic field and path C's passage through the magnetic
        field. If the closed path C is not passing through lines of
        magnetic flux then eq.(7) and eq.(11) are equivalent. </p>
      <p>It is also important to point out that d<img src="p25.jpg"
          x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth="" align="middle"
          height="13" width="14">/dt in eq.(11) does not necessarily

        even the flux is changing with time. Note that d<img

      <p>In the application of the presented equations it is required

      <p>This component results from modulation of the lines of flux by
        the moving conductor. If the voltmeter draws no current, there
        can be no electromagnetic force on the free electrons of the
        wire. Therefore, the emf along the path of the metal conductors
        including the moving conductor is zero. </p>
      <p><b>Example #2</b> </p>
      <p>Suppose the conductor with the sliding taps is stationary (V =
        0) and it is located at y = y<sub>1</sub> . Also suppose the
        magnetic field B is produced by a system of moving conductors
        not shown in Figure 2 which are travelling with a constant
        velocity V = Vay . At time t = 0 the magnetic field B is Bo
        sinBy ax. Determine the voltage across the voltmeter. </p>
      <p><i>Solution</i>: There is no motional E-field because the
        conductors in Figure 2 are at rest (stationary) with respect to
        our selected coordinate system. However, the magnetic field at
        points fixed with respect to the coordinate system is changing
        with time and as a result there is a variational e.m.f. Since
        the B-field at t = 0 is B 0 sinBy ax and has a velocity of V =
        Vay it can be calculated that the B-field as a function of time
        is B<sub>o</sub> sin [B(y-vt)] ax. This is verified by noting
        that an observer located at y at time t = 0 who is travelling at
        the constant velocity (V = Vay) of the moving current would have
        a y coordinate of y = y + Vt and an accordingly different
        expression for B. He would observe a constant field where the
        magnetic current density is: </p>
      <p><img src="p41.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight=""
          x-sas-useimagewidth="" height="21" width="210"></p>
      <p>The counterclockwise emf can be arrived at by taking the
        negative of an integral of the above expression for the
        rectangular surface bounded by the electric circuit with the
        positive side facing the reader with the limits of zero and y.
        The resulting emf equals: </p>

      <p>which is the voltage across the meter. </p>
      <p><b>Induced Motional Field: Negative Energy</b> </p>
      <p>Conventional theory says that electric fields and magnetic
        fields are different things. Consider for a moment a charge with
        an electric field around it. If the charge is moved a magnetic
        field develops and the moving charge constitutes a current. If
        an observer were to move along with the charge, he would see no
        relative motion, no current, and no magnetic field. A stationary
        observer would see motion, current and a magnetic field. It
        would appear that a magnetic field is an electric field observed
        from a motional reference frame. Similarly, if we take a mass
        with a gravity field around it and we move the mass and create a
        mass current, a new field is also created. It is a different
        kind of gravity field with no source and no sink. It is called
        the Protational field also known as the "Lense-Thirring Effect".
        This field an its governing principles will form the basis for
        future anti-gravity devices. </p>

      <p>Within the confined area of the Vacuum Triode box, the
        spacetime continuum is reversed by the fields that are produced
        in the presence of excited coherent space flux quanta. These
        quanta have been attracted from and ultimately extracted from
        the virtual vacuum, the infinitely non-exhaustible Dirac Sea.
        For a more detailed mathematical format see Appendix A, a paper
        on "The Phase Conjugate Vacuum Triode" by T.E. Bearden, April
        23, 1987. Much of the theory which likely applies to the vacuum
        triode has been developed in the field of phase conjugate
        optics. </p>
      <p>With regards to over-unity phenomena it is important to note
        that so long as positive energy is present in a positive/flowing
        time regime unity and over-unity power gains are not possible.
        The summation of the losses due to resistance, impedance,
        friction, magnetic hysteresis and eddy currents and windage
        losses of rotating machinery will always reduce overall
        efficiency below unity for a closed system. The laws of
        conservation of energy always apply to all systems. However, the
        induced motional E-field changes the system upon which those
        laws need be applied. Since the vacuum triode operates in
        dimensions more than four and provides a line between the
        multi-dimensional reality of the quantum state and a link
        between Dirac Sea we are now dealing with an open-ended system,
        not the closed system within which all conservation and
        thermodynamic laws were developed. To achieve unity, the
        summation of all magnetic and ohmic losses must equal zero. To
        achieve this state negative energy and resistance moves to zero
        and all energy flows along the outside of conductors in the form
        of a special space field. Negative energy is fully capable of
        lighting incandescent lights, running motors, and performing all
        of the functions of positive energy tested to date. When run in
        parallel with positive energy however, cancellation
        (annihilation) of opposing power types occurs. This has been
        fully tested in the laboratory. </p>
      <p>Once unity has been achieved and the gate to the Dirac Sea
        opened, over-unity is affected by loading the open gate more and
        more which opens it further to the point where direct
        communication/interaction with the nucleus of the atom itself is
        achieved. Output of the vacuum triode is not proportional to the
        excitation input as the output produced by the device is
        directly proportional to the load which is placed upon it. That
        load is the only dependent variable for device output. The
        triode's output voltage and frequency always remains constant
        due to the conditioning of the motional E-field in the permanent
        magnets and the small regulated excitation signal which is
        provided through a small oscillator. Regulation remains
        constant, output locks into an in-phase condition (cos<img
          src="p23.jpg" x-sas-useimageheight="" x-sas-useimagewidth=""
          align="middle" height="14" width="9"> = 1 Kvar = 1) under all
        load characteristics. </p>
      <p>The vacuum triode is a solid state device consisting of
        conditioned permanent magnets capable of producing a motional
        field. This field opens the gate to the Dirac Sea where negative
        energy is able to flow from an into the triode's receiving
        coils. The coils are very small diameter copper wire but are
        capable of producing in excess of 5 kilowatts of useful power;
        this in itself is a clear indicator that the type of electrical
        energy provided by the device is not conventional. The wire
        sizes employed by the device would not be capable of carrying
        such large currents without excessive heat gain, however, the
        triode's coils actually run cooler when loaded at 5 kW. </p>
      <p>The fundamental magnets have been broken free of their binding
        forces which constrained them to be steadystate single pole
        uniform magnetic flux devices. They are now able to simply
        support mass, as demonstrated with the transformer steel
        illustration. They can now easily be made to adopt a dynamic
        motional field by applying a tiny amount of excitation.
        Specifically, 10V @ 1 mA (10 mW) of excitation at 60 Hz. will
        enable the coils of the triode to receive from the Dirac Sea in
        excess of 5000 watts of usable negative energy; how much more
        can safely be removed has not yet been determined. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Based on E.T. Whittaker's previously unnoticed 1903-1904 papers
        which established a hidden bidirectional EM wave structure in a
        standing forcefield free scalar potential, a method of directly
        engineering the ambient potential of the vacuum has been
        developed and realized experimentally. </p>
      <p>Adding Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable theory to
        classical electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, and general&nbsp;
        relativity produces supersets of each discipline. These
        supersets are joined by the common Whittaker subset, producing a
        unified field theory that is engineerable and tested. </p>
      <p>By treating the nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase conjugate
        mirror, several working model energy units have been produced
        which excite and organize the local vacuum, increase the local
        virtual photon flux between local vacuum and nucleus, establish
        coherent self-oscillations between the local excited vacuum and
        the affected nuclei, utilize the self-oscillating standing wave
        for self-pumping of the nuclei/mirrors, introduce a very tiny
        signal wave to the mirrors, and output into an external load
        circuit a powerful, amplified, time-reversed phase conjugate
        replica wave at 60 Hertz frequency and nominal 120 volt sine
        wave power. </p>
      <p>Several models have been built, ranging from 6 watts early on
        to one of 5 kilowatts. Both closed batteryless systems with
        damped positive feedback and open loop systems with
        battery-powered input have been successfully built. Open loop
        power gains of from 5 x 104 to 1.5 x 106 have been achieved. </p>
      <p>Antigravity experiments have also been successfully conducted
        where the weight of the unit was reduced by 90% in controlled
        experiments, with a signal wave input of 175 microwatts and an
        output of 1 kilowatt. </p>
      <p>The basic theory of the device is briefly explained and
        experimental results presented. In the demonstration session, a
        videotape of one operating open-loop unit with a 1.5 x 106 power
        gain is planned, as is the demonstration of an actual working
        model closed-loop system with a nominal rating of 500 watts, and
        without external power input of any kind. </p>
      <p>The units are solid state, with no moving parts. Each of them
        comprises a unique form of self-powered vacuum triode of
        extraordinary gain, where the cathode power and plate power are
        freely furnished by the vacuum, and only a small grid signal
        need be furnished either from an external power source or by
        clamped positive feedback from the device's output. The output
        is negative energy, and some of its unique characteristics are
        pointed out. </p>
      <p>Implications of the experimental application of the Sweet
        vacuum triode, the Bearden approach to the nucleus as a pumped
        phase conjugate mirror, and the unified field theory based on
        Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable scalar EM potential
        theory, are also briefly addressed. </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scalar Electromagnetics</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In 1837 Sir W.R. Hamilton said, "The notion
        of time may be unfolded into an independent pure science... a
        science of pure time is possible." </p>
      <p>As is well known, the fundamental units utilized in physics are
        arbitrary. It is even possible to construct all of physics on a
        single unit, time. This oddity shows the truth in Hamilton's
        statement; it is even more odd, because quantum mechanically
        time is not an observable. This means that the observable world
        can be modeled completely in terms of the nonobservable, which
        is essentially what modern quantum mechanics is now doing. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton viewed his magnificent quaternions
        as essentially having accomplished the mathematical structuring
        of time.&nbsp; Maxwell's original EM theory, as is well-known,
        was modeled in Hamilton's quaternions, not in the highly
        curtailed Heaviside/Hertz vectors erroneously taught today as
        "Maxwell's theory." </p>
      <p>Not a single one of the present so-called "Maxwell's" vector
        equations ever appeared in a book or paper by James Clerk
        Maxwell. </p>
      <p>For some years the author has worked on an extended
        electromagnetics theory, involving the scalar component of the
        quaternion. [ref. 1] </p>
      <p>In Maxwell's original quaternion theory, this scalar component
        often remains when the directional components zero. Further, it
        then enfolds vectors and functions of vectors inside, in a
        hidden variable manner. Specifically, the author has patterned a
        unified field theory concept upon the previously unnoticed but
        remarkable early work of E.T. Whittaker. [ref. 2] </p>
      <p>In two fundamental papers in 1903 and 1904, Whittaker showed
        that all present vector EM can be replaced by scalar potential
        interferometry, and that bidirectional harmonic EM plane wave
        sets could be used to produce a standing wave of
        force-field-free potential (Figures 1 and 2). </p>

      <p>Thus Whittaker anticipated the quantum mechanical Aharonov/Bohm
        effect by 55 years, including extending it to the macroscopic
        world instead of the mesoscopic realm where it has been
        established to date. [ref. 3] </p>
      <p>In modern terms, Whittaker showed how to turn EM wave energy
        into electrogravitational potential energy, then how to
        interfere two such scalar potential waves to recover
        electromagnetic energy, even at a distance. [ref. 4] </p>
      <p>This unrecognized work is of great importance: when applied to
        modern physics, it produces supersets of quantum mechanics (QM),
        classical electromagnetics (EM), and general relativity (GR). </p>
      <p>Further, all three extended disciplines unify on their common
        Whittaker subset, in a testable and engineerable fashion. [ref.

      <p><b>The Nucleus as a PPCM and Triode</b> </p>
      <p>The author has also considered the highly nonlinear nucleus of
        the atom as a pumped phase conjugate mirror (PPCM), having found
        no other consideration of same in the literature. </p>
      <p>The author also dubbed a PPCM a "triode," since the amplified
        phase conjugate replica of the signal wave is much like the
        amplified output of a triode, and the signal wave input to a
        PPCM is much like a triode's grid signal input. The PPCM pump
        wave then corresponds roughly to the power input to the cathode
        and plate of a triode. [ref. 6] </p>
      <p>Figure 3 diagrammatically shows the PPCM with correspondence to
        a triode. [Referring to figure 3] </p>
      <p>Up to all the power in the pump waves A1 and A2 may be output
        in phase conjugate replica wave A3 in response to a small signal
        wave input A1. </p>

      <p><b>Vacuum Triode background</b> </p>
      <p>About seven years ago, the author was privileged to see and
        examine an invention of Mr. Floyd Sweet, that produced about 6
        watts of electrical power from the vacuum itself. </p>
      <p>This remarkable device, which the author dubbed a vacuum
        triode, in a single unit utilized most of the scalar EM concepts
        the author had so painfully and slowly formulated over the
        years. </p>
      <p>Sweet, a brilliant inventor with a remarkable knowledge of
        magnetics, had utilized barium ferrite magnets and special coils
        to produce a solid-state device that successfully tapped the
        vacuum energy. </p>
      <p>The author quickly put together a theoretical concept for the
        energy-tapping mechanism, based on treatment of the nucleus as a
        PPCM and Whittaker's scalar EM potential unified field theory.
        [ref. 7] </p>
      <p>The author furnished the technical concept, treating the
        nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, to the inventor
        along with copies of Whittaker's papers. </p>
      <p><b>Sweet's Synthesis and Extension</b> </p>
      <p>Sweet is also a brilliant EM theoretician, working in four,
        five, or even six dimensions with ease. He immediately
        synthesized the entire PPCM and Whittaker theory, and developed
        a complete theoretical treatment of the device. [ref. 8] </p>
      <p>He also increased the nuclear potential utilized in the
        activated nuclei of the device, which increased the pumping
        energy and hence the energy output. He next produced an
        open-loop vacuum triode (VT) with an output of 500 watts, for an
        input of 33 microwatts. </p>
      <p>Thereafter he produced several other models, including
        closed-loop systems and one with 5-KW output. </p>
      <p><b>Purpose of This Paper</b> </p>
      <p>Our purpose is to explain the detailed scalar EM concept of the
        operation of the vacuum triode, since it is a universal method
        for cohering and tapping useful EM energy from the vacuum. </p>
      <p>The author believes that this mechanism is the fundamental
        mechanism that must be invoked in any over-unity device that
        electromagnetically extracts vacuum energy as electromagnetic
        effects. </p>
      <p>We also intend to demonstrate a full working model of the
        device at this conference. Sweet's detailed theoretical
        treatment will be completed and submitted to a major journal
        shortly, to complete the scientific exposition of the new
        methodology. </p>
      <p>I must also express my deep admiration for my brilliant
        inventor colleague. It has been a privilege to work with him,
        though under great difficulties and at a distance. He has
        developed several other related devices that are of great
        importance to the emerging new physics of vacuum engineering, in
        the sense referred to by Lee. [ref. 9] </p>
      <p>To mention just one, he has produced a magnetic lens which
        apparently can directly display the vacuum's virtual particle
        flux, or a good analog of it. So far as I am aware, this is the
        only extant instrument today that can perform this feat. </p>
      <p>When the vacuum triode has been proven to the scientific
        community, it is my intention to nominate Sweet for the Nobel
        Prize he so richly deserves, and seek high scientific
        endorsements for the recommendation. </p>
      <p><b>Entropy</b> </p>
      <p>As is well known, in any closed dynamic system the order
        existing in it will gradually be dissipated, as more and more
        interactions occur. This leads to the notion of entropy as the
        increasing disorder in such systems. The assumptions are </p>
      <p>(1) a closed system, and <br>
        (2) a positive flow of time for the components of the system. </p>
      <p>Actually no such thing as a completely closed system exists in
        nature. Every mass system is open to virtual particle flux
        exchange with the vacuum, for example, particularly in the
        nucleus of its atoms, where the bulk of its mass is located. </p>
      <p>However, the closed system assumption is reasonably
        approximated by a great many systems which are in stable
        thermodynamic equilibrium, or nearly so. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, in an open system far from thermodynamic
        equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics does not
        necessarily apply, because the system violates both the closed
        system assumption and its equilibrium approximation. [ref.10] </p>
      <p><b>Time Reversal</b> </p>
      <p>Since being discovered in 1972 in the open Soviet literature,
        the time-reversed (phase conjugate) EM wave has also been known.
        The phase conjugate EM wave is truly time-reversed, as has been
        shown experimentally. Since the time-reversed EM wave violates
        the second major assumption, the second law of thermodynamics
        need not necessarily hold for time-reversed entities. </p>
      <p>Putting all this together, if one wishes negentropy and hence
        increased energy in a system, the candidate suggested would
        appear to be a system that was strongly </p>
      <p>(1) open loop, <br>
        (2) time-reversed, and <br>
        (3) far from thermodynamic equilibrium. </p>
      <p>A good overview of time-reversal in physics has been provided
        by Sachs. [ref. 11] </p>
      <p><b>Engineering the Nucleus</b> </p>
      <p>Since the nucleus already provides a myriad of time-reversed
        processes, engineering the nucleus of an atom is a very good
        candidate for practical negentropy. </p>
      <p>To engineer the nucleus directly, a Whittaker potential is
        first artificially constructed, by composing a harmonic set of
        phase-locked EM wave/antiwave pairs. It is accented that the
        antiwaves must be true phase conjugates; otherwise they will not
        constitute a gradient-free Whittaker standing potential wave. </p>
      <p>In addition, at least one harmonic interval must be used, and
        additional harmonic sets are most desirable. The reason is that
        a space-time lattice must be formed in the vacuum, where the
        energy is additive spatially but oppositive in t-dot, the rate
        of flow of time, in the fourth dimension. </p>
      <p>So a time-structure is required as well as a spatial structure,
        which is what is provided by <i>n</i> bidirectional harmonic
        Whittaker EM wave sets, where <i>n</i> is an integer greater
        than 1. </p>
      <p>Once a specific Whittaker structure has been chosen, the local
        lattice of space-time is established. This establishes
        phase-locked lattice groupings of coupled photon/antiphoton
        pairs, or of gravitons. In turn, this Whittaker-structured
        vacuum now contains specific graviton vacuum engines, which
        directly engineer and structure the vacuum's virtual particle
        flux (VPF) exchange with the nucleus. [ref.12] </p>
      <p>The nucleus is highly nonlinear, hence strongly phase
        conjugative, or time-reversed. The ambient potential of the
        local vacuum surrounding the nucleus is in a violent virtual
        photon exchange with it, accounting for its electrical charge. </p>
      <p>Since the preponderant charge is positive, from the viewpoint
        of the ordinary light observer whose light interacts with
        electron shells, the nucleus may be taken to exhibit time
        reversal (phase conjugation). </p>
      <p><b>Energy, Time, and Gravitons</b> </p>
      <p>We take the definition of "energy" to be fundamentally an
        ordering imposed upon the VPF of vacuum. We take photon
        scattering from the electron shells of atoms to be the
        fundamental exterior mechanism producing forward flow of
        external observer time. </p>
      <p>It then follows that "time's arrow" for the EM observer is due
        to the universal scattering of photons from electron shells. </p>
      <p>In this view, forward (positive) time flow and entropy are due
        to the same primary action: photon scattering from electron
        shells. It is unfortunate that the concept of "positive" energy
        has been tied to, and defined in terms of, the scattering and
        dissipation of VPF order as work, or energy expended. </p>
      <p>Via the standard labeling, then, negative energy is the
        reconstitution of order in the vacuum VPF. It should be noted
        that, in a PPCM, dissipative or external pump wave stress energy
        can be scavenged and re-emitted in perfect order as the phase
        conjugate replica. This is a negentropic process, for it is
        capable of turning disorder into order. [ref. 13] </p>
      <p>In the time-reversed&nbsp; PPCM&nbsp; nucleus, we should expect
        to see appreciable negative energy, that is, energy removed from
        the EM scattering domain. This includes the binding energy of
        the nucleus, and the gravitational (G) potential energy of the
        EM energy removed from the "scattering interaction realm" and
        locked into the mass. </p>
      <p>Following Sakharov, we hold that the G-field is not a
        fundamental field of nature, but a composite caused by, or made
        from, other fields. [ref. 14] </p>
      <p>To the first order, we assume the G-potential is comprised of
        coupled photon/antiphoton pairs, on the average, where the
        statistical coupled spin-2 photon/antiphoton pair is a graviton.
        [ref. 15] </p>
      <p>We follow the modern view of the field: because of vacuum
        fluctuations, rigorously one no longer speaks of "the" field,
        but of the probability of a particular field configuration.
        [ref. 16] </p>
      <p>We also hold the vacuum to be composed of potentials, and
        regard the three terms space-time, vacuum, and scalar potential
        as essentially synonymous. </p>
      <p><b>Newton's Third Law and the Detection Process</b> </p>
      <p>The VPF EM stress of the local vacuum immediately surrounding
        the nucleus may be decomposed a la Whittaker into opposing
        bidirectional EM plane waves/forces. Thus the nonlinear nucleus
        may be regarded as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, normally
        with a gain of one. </p>
      <p>In this view, Newton's third law reaction force is generated
        because the so-called "photon" interaction with an atom is in
        fact a graviton reaction involving a photon/antiphoton pair that
        is decoupled. </p>
      <p>The decoupled photon normally is absorbed and reradiated by an
        orbital electron, while the decoupled antiphoton interacts with
        the nucleus, producing a time-reversed twin of the external
        force, or, in other words, Newton's third law reaction force,
        which gives a slight recoil of the nucleus. </p>
      <p>Half of every measurement physicists normally make is
        discarded, with the missing half accounting only for Newtonian
        reaction in the meter or instrument, which is usually ignored. </p>
      <p>The fact that half of our measurement interactions are ignored
        is occasionally discovered and noted by physicists, who may even
        write a paper pointing it out, but no change is instituted in
        the foundations. [ref. 17 and 18] </p>
      <p><b>Semiconducting Vacuum and Self-Oscillation</b> </p>
      <p>The vacuum immediately surrounding the nucleus is structured by
        the nucleus, and is itself nonlinear and capable of acting as a
        semiconductor. [ref. 19] </p>
      <p>Since both this immediately local semiconductor vacuum and the
        nucleus it surrounds are highly nonlinear, then nonlinear
        resonance can conceivably be established between them. </p>
      <p>Further, since the resonating system in such case is an open
        system away from thermodynamic equilibrium, the oscillation can
        be self-sustaining. Such self-oscillation of the pumping of a
        PCM is already well known in the nonlinear optical literature,
        particularly with compounds containing barium. [ref. 20] </p>
      <p><b>The Vacuum Triode: The Basic Concept</b> </p>
      <p>As is well known, a stress can be decomposed into opposing sets
        of forces. But quantum mechanically, the forces we are
        interested in with our work here are all caused
        electromagnetically, by the exchange of virtual photons. Even
        mechanical force, according to QM, is caused in this manner.
        Thus opposing electromagnetic or mechanical "stress" sets
        of&nbsp; bidirectional EM forces are microscopically equivalent
        to the notion of pump waves in nonlinear optics. </p>
      <p>Hence under the proper conditions, it follows that trapped EM
        stress energy of the vacuum can be utilized to "pump" the
        nucleus. Treating the stress-pumped nonlinear nucleus as a PPCM,
        it follows that the stress energy of the vacuum can be tapped by
        a 4-wave mixing mechanism in the atomic nucleus, to provide
        amplified phase conjugate EM wave outputs from the atom in
        response to small signal wave inputs. [21] </p>
      <p>In the proper nonlinear material, the material may act as a
        PPCM, in which case there exists a suitable connection between
        the material's atomic nuclei and its external electromagnetic
        lattice bonds, and the amplified phase conjugate replica wave
        generated in the nucleus will be emitted from the material as an
        EM wave field. This field can then be tapped by suitable means
        and output to an external load circuit. </p>
      <p>Block Diagram of the Vacuum Triode<b>: </b>Figure 4 shows a
        basic block diagram of the vacuum triode process, utilized by
        Sweet in several laboratory vacuum energy devices. These devices
        have ranged from a nominal 500 watt output in a 6 lb device to 5
        kilo watts for a heavier unit. Gains have ranged from 50,000 to
        1,500,000 for open-loop systems. Both open-loop and closed-loop
        systems have been built and tested. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 shows a combined block diagram for either a
        closed-loop or open-loop system. In the open-loop system, a
        barium ferrite magnetic material is used as a pumped phase
        conjugate mirror. </p>
      <p>In the "standard" design, two opposing PPCMs are used. The
        advantage of this dual combination is the use of self-targeting
        (repetitive phase conjugation, signal by signal). This has the
        effect of </p>
      <p>(1) stabilizing the Whittaker field, and <br>
        (2) producing a quantum potential between the two mirrors, so
        the mirrors and the Whittaker potential between them are
        essentially one single space-time entity. </p>
      <p>Discussion of a quantum potential is beyond the scope of this
        paper, but the technical mechanism for creating one has been
        previously presented by the author on several occasions. [ref.
        22] </p>
      <p>First we will explain the open-loop operation of the vacuum
        triode. In Figure 4, on the right an external 60 Hz, nominal 10
        volt AC sine wave of several tens of microwatts in power is
        input into the stabilized field of the barium ferrite magnet
        structure, where it modulates the field, producing a signal wave
        input into the atoms of the material. </p>
      <p>In the top right block, the EM signal wave interacts with the
        electron shell of an atom, which in turn is EM-coupled to the
        nucleus. </p>
      <p>[This figure could not be effectively depicted in ASCII. See
        the original paper] <br>
        Figure 4: The Vacuum Triode Concept </p>
      <p>Thus an EM signal wave is input to the nucleus of the atom,
        which is highly nonlinear (middle top block). Earlier, Sweet had
        specifically conditioned the atomic nuclei with a proprietary
        process, wherein in the barium nucleus a trapped 60 Hz scalar EM
        spherical wave resonance (self-oscillation) exists between the
        structured semiconductor vacuum immediately surrounding the Ba
        nucleus. </p>
      <p>In the same activation process, the ambient potential of the
        surrounding vacuum was raised and stabilized, in the two
        leftmost blocks. </p>
      <p>At this point the nonlinear nucleus is effectively self-pumped
        by the trapped, excited, spherical scalar wave oscillation
        between the structured semiconductor vacuum and the nucleus. The
        nucleus is now a strongly pumped phase conjugate mirror. </p>
      <p>Consequently, when the signal wave input arrives, the PPCM
        nucleus emits an amplified phase conjugate replica (PCR) wave,
        which precisely backtracks the input signal wave. This precise
        backtracking (perfect retroreflection) is referred to as the
        "distortion correction theorem." </p>
      <p>In short, the powerful PCR wave returns precisely toward the
        external source, passing through the electron shells and
        arriving in the perturbed barium ferrite magnet assembly field,
        where it perturbs the field. </p>
      <p>A transformer-like system then extracts this magnetic field
        perturbation and conducts it to the external load circuit. </p>
      <p>However, the PCR contains negative energy. Short of the load,
        the internal circuits run cool, rather than heating. This is a
        signature of a true vacuum energy-tapping device. </p>
      <p>Indeed, if the output leads of the Sweet vacuum triode are
        physically shorted together, a brilliant flash occurs, and the
        leads instantly ice as if dipped in liquid oxygen. This is
        another signature of the true negentropic over-unity vacuum tap.
      </p>
      <p>Note that the energy extracted from the semiconducting vacuum
        adjacent to the nucleus is just instantly replaced by the
        surrounding vacuum's inexhaustible energy pool. This is an
        open-loop system, with a hidden energy source: the intense
        virtual particle flux of the vacuum's ambient charge. </p>
      <p>It is not possible to exhaust that flux, which is often
        calculated to have an energy density of some 10^100 or more
        grams per cm^3, if the energy were cohered and condensed into
        mass. </p>
      <p>As can be seen, even a VT gain of 1.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>
        represents a "vacuum tap" of an incredibly small efficiency, on
        the order of 10<sup>-100</sup> or so. However, the vacuum
        "river" is so energetic that such efficiencies are quite
        sufficient. </p>
      <p>We accent that the barium ferrite magnetic material must be
        activated so that stable self-oscillation between the barium
        nucleus and the surrounding semiconductor vacuum exists.
        Although self-oscillating/self-pumped PCMs are known at optical
        frequencies, Sweet has discovered and perfected a brilliant
        methodology for activating PPCM nuclei at ELF frequencies. </p>
      <p>In a resistive load such as light bulbs, the resistive material
        accomplishes repetitive phase conjugation. Thus in the resistor,
        half the total energy is expressed as photon or dissipative
        energy in the external (electron shell) level. </p>
      <p>As the excited electrons decay, they emit scattered EM energy
        as light and heat. This is an exothermic interaction. The other
        half of the total energy reacts in the atomic nuclei, as a phase
        conjugative or endothermic interaction. </p>
      <p>We strongly accent that, Whittaker-wise, there are two
        electromagnetic channels and two kinds of EM: </p>
      <p>(1) external EM, the common electron-shell interacting,
        entropic, scattering, time-forward kind, and <br>
        (2) the internal, unsuspected, hidden variable, nuclei
        interacting, negentropic, reordering/convergent kind. </p>
      <p>Internal EM travels strictly between atomic nuclei, normally
        not reacting with electron shells unless a pumped phase
        conjugate mirror reaction is invoked in the nucleus to produce a
        gain somewhat greater than unity. </p>
      <p>Thus if we wish to communicate with atomic nuclei directly, and
        engineer them directly, we must utilize the internal EM channel
        via applied Whittaker methods. </p>
      <p><b>Antigravity Tests</b> </p>
      <p>Inherent in the preceding discussions is the possibility to
        turn EM energy into gravitational energy of either sign. In
        other words, one should be able to utilize Sweet's vacuum triode
        to produce and demonstrate antigravity. </p>
      <p>Indeed this is the case. Sweet has also discovered the special
        alterations necessary to perform straightforward transformation
        of the internal energy in the nucleus to antigravitational
        energy, producing a unilateral thrust upward. </p>
      <p>Note that the bulk of G-potential gradient (G-force-field)
        occurs Whittaker-wise at ELF frequencies. This explains why
        nonlinear phase conjugate opticians do not notice direct
        antigravity effects. </p>
      <p>At the optical frequencies at which they work, the effects are
        so miniscule that they are negligible. This is readily explained
        as follows: In QM, the quantum (photon) is comprised of action
        (angular momentum), not just energy. It is rather like a "piece
        of energy welded to a piece of time, with no seam in the
        middle." </p>
      <p>Since quantum change occurs in quanta, the decoupling of the
        energy and time components, in the continual interaction of
        photons with matter, exchanges energy between G-potential of
        vacuum and trapped mass of the atom or particle. In this
        exchange, small increments of time are continually being formed
        (and unformed, as photon emission occurs). </p>
      <p>Consequently, each mass is moving forward in time in small
        incremental jumps, usually of exceedingly small magnitude.&nbsp;
        However, the energy and time trapped in a photon are canonical.
        The greater the piece of energy, the smaller the piece of time,
        and vice versa. </p>
      <p>So if one wishes to stress the "rate of flow of time"
        significantly, one needs to produce large amounts of photons
        that have very large pieces of time, and consequently little
        pieces of energy. </p>
      <p>Since the energy of the photon is directly proportional to its
        frequency, this means that the lower frequency photons have
        larger time increments, and hence endure over many
        "regular-sized photon absorption/emission changes" to
        appreciably stress the rate of time flow/production. </p>
      <p>The bottom line is that the standard pumped phase conjugate
        mirror can be adapted to produce antigravity at ELF frequencies,
        but precisely the same adaptation at optical frequencies will
        have negligible effect. </p>
      <p>With this in mind, the author requested Sweet to perform an
        antigravity experiment to prove the thesis. With Sweet's
        proprietary adaptation of his vacuum triode/PPCM, the experiment
        produced rather straightforward but spectacular results, as
        shown in Figure 5. </p>
      <p>The experiment was performed as follows: Rigged for
        antigravity, the 6-lb device was placed on a scale so that its
        weight could be continuously monitored. A special external load
        box was utilized in which multiple electric light sockets were
        connected in parallel. </p>
      <p>Then the external load draw was adjusted by merely screwing in
        100-watt lamps, one at a time, with measurement and observation
        pauses in between. The output of the device was 120 volt,
        negative AC sine-wave power at 60 Hz. </p>
      <p>For each 100-watt increment, the load power was recorded and
        the weight was carefully recorded. The results are shown in the
        rather smooth, classic curve shown in Figure 5. </p>
      <p>At 1,000 watts load draw, the previously 6-lb device had
        reduced its weight due to gravity by 90 percent. At that point
        the signal-wave (grid) input to the open-loop vacuum triode was
        only 175.4 microamps at 10 volts, or just under two milliwatts.
      </p>
      <p>[This figure could not be effectively depicted in ASCII. See
        the original paper] <br>
        Figure 5:&nbsp; Antigravity Test of Sweet's Adapted Vacuum
        Triode. </p>
      <p>We accent that the nominal two milliwatt input is only a gating
        signal. It is the organized, gated vacuum energy that is
        performing the action. </p>
      <p>The experiment was stopped short of actual hovering and flying
        due to safety considerations. With the specific adaptation,
        magnetic monopoles are deposited in the magnet materials,
        producing internal tensile stress. </p>
      <p>Since no explosive controlled facilities were available, and
        there was no wish to destroy the VT, the experiment was
        terminated at 90% antigravity performance. It was completely
        successful, and adequately demonstrated the validity of the
        unified field theory concepts utilized in our approach. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>A new unified field theory has been developed, tested, and at
        least partially verified experimentally. The concepts of the
        theory have been applied by Sweet in a series of inventions that
        produce readily usable, safe electromagnetic power directly from
        the vacuum. </p>
      <p>The methodology lends itself to formulation of power devices
        without moving parts. Antigravity, predicted by the concepts of
        the theory, has been demonstrated in actual practical
        demonstrations on the laboratory bench. </p>
      <p>Though not discussed in this paper, application of the concepts
        and methodology to a large variety of other fields, such as
        medical reversal of aging and curing of almost the entire range
        of present debilitating diseases, has been previously pointed
        out. [ref. 23] </p>
      <p>We have also pointed out the mechanism for Kaznacheyev's
        cytopathogenic effect, or the induction of cellular pathology at
        a distance by electromagnetic means. [ref. 24] </p>
      <p>We have also pointed out the specific mechanism involved in
        Priore's device, which in rigorous laboratory animal testing
        under the auspices of eminent French scientists, demonstrated
        nearly 100 percent cures for terminal cancers and leukemias,
        sleeping sickness, artherosclerosis, and other debilitating
        diseases.[ref. 25] </p>
      <p>We believe we have also produced the concepts enabling the
        direct engineering and therapeutic manipulation of Popp's master
        cellular control system. [ref. 26] </p>
      <p>We conclude that the concepts we have utilized and
        experimentally demonstrated are universal, as implied by any
        notional unified field theory. </p>
      <p>Our conclusion is that the concepts, theory, and experiments,
        taken together, are sufficient for investigation and replication
        by the scientific community. </p>
      <p>If replicated and fully substantiated, we believe the work will
        directly point the way to, and usher in, a new unified field
        theory physics of universal application. </p>
      <p><b>Speculated Implications</b> </p>
      <p>As can be seen, the implications of the new approach are
        profound. The authors believe they have ushered in the
        forerunner of a vast new physics, one which will change our
        lives, and our view of physical reality, in ways previously
        undreamed of. </p>
      <p>By mastering, controlling, and gating the vast, incredible
        energy of the seething vacuum, we can power our automobiles,
        flying machines, and technology inexhaustibly. Further, it can
        be done absolutely cleanly; there are no noxious chemical
        pollutants to poison the biosphere. With practical antigravity,
        ships can be developed to cross the solar system as readily as
        one crosses the ocean today. </p>
      <p>And the ships, automobiles, and technology will never run out
        of fuel; the inexhaustible vacuum fills every system,
        everywhere, to overflowing. </p>
      <p>Not discussed in this paper, it turns out that living systems,
        faced with the problem of achieving negentropy so as to maintain
        their form in a dissipative external physical reality, have
        always used the hidden internal channel for such things as mind,
        thought, cell control, and living functions. </p>
      <p>With the new methodology, one now faces the advent of access
        and engineering of the mind and life of the observer as readily
        as the observer's physical body. </p>
      <p>Transmutation of the elements, control of the weather, lighting
        and powering our cities and homes cheaply and cleanly, and
        provision of plenty for everyone is the vista for the future. We
        can in fact clean up the radioactive wastes, rid ourselves of
        coarse nuclear and petroleum powerplants. </p>
      <p>We strongly stress that, with the ability to engineer the
        Schroedinger equation itself, the new methodology allows the
        direct engineering and control of quantum change, and hence of
        physical reality itself. </p>
      <p>The methodology is extendable to hyperdimensions; nested
        virtual levels of the vacuum are already precisely that. The
        author has already pointed out the application of this emerging
        technology to the absolute cure of diseases such as AIDS,
        cancer, leukemia, etc., and shown that the Priore device in
        France already proved the efficacy of the application in the 60s
        and 70s. </p>
      <p>We shall be able to rid ourselves and our descendents of
        diseases. With direct access to the actual software of life and
        mind, in the future we should be able to achieve levels of
        education previously unattainable, by directly inputting the
        relevant software. </p>
      <p>Previously we have also pointed out that four nations of the
        world are already embarked on weaponization of scalar EM unified
        field technology. It is sobering to think that, in addition to
        having the ability to make our planet a paradise for&nbsp;
        humankind, we also will have the ability to make it a hades. </p>
      <p>For that reason, we are doing our best to clarify the technical
        concept and the theory in this 1991, hopefully with the view
        that humankind will seize upon the positive aspects, and develop
        and apply this technology for the betterment of all people
        everywhere. </p>
      <p>Long ago, Albert Einstein said these words: "It would of course
        be a great step forward if we succeeded in combining the
        gravitational field and the electromagnetic field into a single
        structure. Only so could the era in theoretical physics
        inaugurated by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell be brought to a
        satisfactory close." </p>
      <p>And Teilhard de Chardin wrote: "Someday, after we have mastered
        the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness
        for God the energies of love. Then for the second time in the
        history of the world man will have discovered fire." </p>
      <p>The authors fervently believe they have come upon fire for the
        second time, as allegorized by de Chardin. If so, let us all use
        the knowledge wisely. </p>

        This paper pointed out the primacy of the potentials. Instead of
        being causative agents, the force fields are actually effects
        generated from the potentials. This is in complete violation of
        both classical electromagnetics and classical dynamics, but it
        is absolutely required by quantum mechanics. For an extensive

      <p>[4] It is pointed out that today all potentials are well known
        to be gravitational entities. However, this was not known in
        Whittaker's time, and so he himself did not realize that he had
        actually produced an engineerable, testable unified theory of
        electromagnetics and gravitation. </p>

        Holt, Rinehart, and&nbsp; Winston, New York, 1985. In a normal
        triode tube, the amplified plate signal is 180 degrees out of
        phase spatially with the grid input, but in-phase with it in
        respect to rate of flow through time. In a PPCM, the amplified
        phase conjugate replica wave is in phase spatially with the
        signal wave, but 180 degrees out of phase with it in respect to
        its rate of flow through time. It is pointed out that a PCM with
        a gain of unity produces a coupled EM wave/antiwave pair whose
        energy is additive in 3-space but subtractive in the first
        derivative of the fourth dimension, time. Hence it is no longer
        an electromagnetic wave as such, but an oscillatory wave of
        stress upon the local rate of flow of time. Hence it is a
        powerful electrogravitational wave, whose EM nature is hidden in
        the guise of a scalar EM potential. It is also a wave of
        variation in the local gauge, and of variation in the local ST
        curvature. </p>

      <p>[12] Note that this moves the entire notion of the charge of a
        fundamental particle to a deeper and more extended level. Now
        the charge may be discretized, but it is not quantized in the
        hard conventional sense. Further, the internal Whittaker
        structure of the massless VPF photon exchange of vacuum and
        mass, which, quantum mechanically, is what the electrical charge
        of the particle is in the first place, is deterministically
        structured. Note that this violates the present assumption that
        all like charged particles are identical; now two electrons may
        have either the same or different magnitudes of charge, and even
        when the magnitudes are the same, their internal charge
        structures (Whittaker structures) and VPF exchange with the
        vacuum may differ. Also note that this resolves the severe QM
        problem of missing chaos (hidden order) in quantum change. The
        reason for the problem was the use of Gibbs statistics with its
        assumption of random variable change, which a priori excluded
        hidden order&nbsp; (and hence chaos) from QM. That was only a
        special case, albeit an important one. There are now three QM
        cases: (1) the conventional case, where there is no hidden
        order; (2) the case where there is some hidden order, and the
        statistics is chaotic, not random; and (3) the case where the QM
        change is deterministic, with essentially total hidden order.
        Note that the Whittaker methodology allows one to directly
        engineer cases (2) and (3), including the Schroedinger equation
        itself. </p>
      <p>[13] The present second law of thermodynamics is written only
        for time-forward entities, and need not apply for the
        time-reversed case. Merely viewing the energy-dissipating
        forward time case in reverse allows an appreciation of the
        time-reversed case. In other words, the second law of
        thermodynamics is incomplete as presently stated. The complete
        law has a corollary to cover the increase in order as the
        time-reversal of the system increases. Thus the complete law
        consists of two parts: (1) the entropic, time-forward case, and
        (2) the negentropic time-reversed case. Since the re-ordering
        can be amplified at will by a PPCM process, the correct
        distinction between the two subsets of the complete law is
        important, and applies to real systems. </p>

      <p>[18] A nonlinear material may simply emit a photon, or it may
        act as a phase conjugate mirror (PCM) and emit a phase conjugate
        replica of the absorbed photon. When the material emits a normal
        photon, it measurably recoils. When it emits a time-reversed
        photon, it does not recoil, as already experimentally
        established in nonlinear phase conjugate optics. The solution to
        the mystery is this: When emitting a normal photon, the material
        does not act as a PCM. In that case the matching antiphoton
        which split from the interacting graviton (the graviton that
        yielded the external photon) interacts with the nucleus,
        producing a recoil action with a gain of one. Thus Newtonian
        third-law recoil of the nucleus occurs. On the other hand, when
        the material acts as a PCM, it also emits the antiphoton outside
        the atom to "backtrack" the absorbed "signal wave" photon. In
        that case there is no Newtonian recoil of the nucleus, because
        the agent for causing recoil did not interact with the nucleus
        to produce it. </p>

      <p>The Vacuum Triode Amplifier (VTA) invented by Floyd Sweet
        consists of two ferrite magnets and two to four coreless wire
        coils. It is self-powered in the preferred configuration and
        produces in excess of one&nbsp; KW of 120 VRMS 60 HZ power in
        the form of energy that resembles electricity. This energy is
        referred to as negative energy. The VTA development history, its
        anti-gravity characteristics, negative energy properties, and
        some of the personalities involved are discussed. </p>
      <p>This is a story of Floyd Sweet's trials and tribulations
        involving a mystery wrapped in an enigma. God revealed to Floyd
        sufficient information to build a machine to provide energy that
        resembles electricity. However, God did not provide solutions to
        the frustrating string of problems that would surface in
        converting the idea into a working device. There are several
        people in this story that have provided help and some who have
        hindered. </p>
      <p>When Tom Bearden met Floyd, the device Floyd had developed was
        producing a few watts of alternating current at 28 volts. Tom
        saw in Floyd's device the physical embodiment of a principle he
        had theorized many years before. Tom had never designed&nbsp; or
        constructed a physical device to access this elusive energy
        source. </p>
      <p>Tom's name for the extraction process is 'Four Wave Phase
        Conjugate Mixing'. The energy source is the intense non-cohered
        energy that is thought to be present everywhere in the universe.
        Various researchers through the years have given this energy
        different names, such as "Zero Point Energy", "Gravity Field
        Energy", "Radiant Energy", and others. </p>
      <p>Tom Bearden gave Floyd's device the name "Vacuum Triode
        Amplifier" or VTA. The machine provides a small amount of its
        output fed back to the equivalent of a grid which gates or
        coheres a large amount of energy which appears at the device
        output terminal as something that resembles electricity!
        Negative Electricity. </p>
      <p>This energy can be utilized by devices designed to convert
        electricity to light, heat, or mechanical work or anything else
        for which normal electricity is used. The properties of this
        energy, although superficially resembling the 120 VRMS 60 HZ
        power we normally use, are unique and sufficiently different
        from conventional electricity, so that it should be classified
        as an entirely new energy form. It will require careful extended
        study by a wide range of people in order to document its
        properties in the manner scientists have done with conventional
        electricity. </p>
      <p>Tom Bearden refers to this energy as negative energy, and he
        states that negative time must be utilized. In negative time
        according to Bearden, gravity is a repulsive force. </p>
      <p>Floyd's experiments demonstrated that the VTA loses weight in
        proportion to the amount of generated "Negative Energy". This
        was carefully documented by Floyd on a kitchen scale. The
        machine weight was observed decreasing with increased load in a
        quite orderly fashion until a point was suddenly reached when
        Floyd heard an immense sound, as if he were at the center of a
        giant whirlwind but without actual air movement. The sound was
        heard by his wife Rose in another room of their apartment and
        was heard by others outside the apartment. The experience was
        very&nbsp; frightening and the experiment has not been repeated.
      </p>
      <p>Some observers of the light emanating from ordinary 120 volt
        100 watt incandescent bulbs powered by the VTA claim the light
        is different, softer than normal incandescent light. The VTA
        magnets and coils when powering loads of over a kilowatt become
        cold and temperatures of 20 degrees F below ambient have been
        observed. Similar reports of below ambient temperature of energy
        machine components have been reported by other inventors, such
        as John Bedini and John R.R. Searl. </p>
      <p>When the VTA output wires had been accidentally shorted, first
        an extremely brilliant flash occurred. When the wires involved
        were examined shortly afterward, they were found covered with
        frost. Unfortunately this also caused the VTA magnet to fracture
        and the machine ceased operating. In one instance the machine
        operation ceased during a local earthquake. The physical
        shacking was not believed to be sufficiently severe to disrupt
        the machine magnet/coil relative placement or physical shock to
        the magnet such as a hammer blow might impart. The best
        speculation is that the machine was affected by the intense
        electromagnetic pulse known to originate from earthquakes. </p>
      <p>Conventional instruments used to measure volts, amps, or watts
        appear to correlate machine output as coupled to loads, but only
        up to approximately 1 KW; above that value they may indicate
        zero or some other value not related to the known actual load. </p>
      <p>Floyd's attempts to use conventional electrical design formulas
        relating number of coil turns, amp turns on drive coils, and any
        other parameter to predict observed outputs have all resulted in
        failures with calculations. Empirical formulas based on actual
        tests have been documented. </p>
      <p>Observation of machine output voltage of approximately 120 VRMS
        while the load was changed in 100 watt increments from 100 watts
        to 1000 watts has shown no observable output voltage change,
        which suggests an extremely low internal equivalent impedance.
        The 20 gauge magnet wire in the output coils consisting of
        several hundred turns has significant DC resistance which is not
        correlated with the unvarying output terminal voltage at
        different loads. It is speculated that this energy does not
        travel within the copper wire or its passage through the copper
        wire does not generate a voltage drop --- a most useful feature
        when transferring energy from one place to another. </p>
      <p>One frustrating aspect of the VTA has been its failures,
        evidenced by the output voltage slowly decaying to zero over a
        few seconds or minutes. There also have been spontaneous
        instances of the voltage rising above 120 VRMS as observed by
        the increased lamp load bank brightness. The volt meters,
        ammeter, and power meter did not correlate with the brightness
        change except when the machine would the fail to produce any
        power. </p>
      <p>Many times the VTA was normally left on powering a lamp load
        bank 24 hours a day. During a period of time when it appeared to
        be functioning properly all day long, Floyd got up at 3:00 AM to
        go to the bathroom. As he walked past the room where the VTA was
        located, he noticed that the lights appeared dim. He measured
        the voltage at 70 VRMS. Being tired at the moment, he returned
        to bed. The next morning when he rose, the voltage was back to
        the&nbsp; normal 120 VRMS and stayed there all day. The next
        night Floyd got up at 4:30 AM. The voltage was measured at 85
        VRMS. Floyd returned to bed. The voltage was normal the entire
        next day. </p>
      <p>A possible clue to this anomaly has appeared in an article by
        E.W. Silvertooth titled 'Motion Through The Ether' where Silver
        tooth describes a dual path laser interferometer experiment that
        conclusively demonstrated the presence of an ether that flows
        through our portion of the universe at greater than the speed of
        light with its vector in the direction of the constellation Leo.
        Floyd's VTA may be orientation sensitive to this ether velocity
        vector. </p>
      <p>The VTA consists of two 4" X 6" X .5" grade 5 or grade 8
        ferrite magnets spaced 3 inches apart in the attractive
        orientation, with the output and drive coils in between. The
        output coils are wound with 20 gage magnet wire. Their axis is
        parallel to the magnetic lines of force between the two magnets.
        The two drive (or excitation) coil axes are positioned at 90
        degrees to the output coil axis. The VTA excitation coils may be
        driven by the VTA output voltage or a separate sinewave
        oscillator source. </p>
      <p>The "Secret" to the machine is the process that "conditions"
        the magnets. This conditioning process determines the
        output&nbsp; frequency and also prepares the machine for
        operation. The same machine could be just as well "told" to
        output 50 HZ or 400&nbsp; HZ. The conditioning technique is so
        novel, it is doubtful anyone would ever guess how it is done. </p>
      <p>Oscilloscope observation of the VTA output voltage waveform
        shows an apparently perfect sinewave that is not phase
        locked&nbsp; to the local 60 HZ powerline voltage. </p>
      <p>The VTA can be started by momentary connection of a 9-volt
        battery to the drive coils when the machine is operated in the
        self-powered mode. The operation is stopped by momentary
        interruption of power to the power coils. </p>
      <p>The VTA "likes" to always see a minimum load of 25 watts. </p>
      <p>Electrical shock to humans from the VTA may be more damaging
        than contact with a 120 VRMS 60 HZ conventional powerline
        voltage. Floyd has accidentally had VTA current pass from
        his&nbsp; thumb to his smallest finger. It appears to freeze the
        flesh and was extremely painful for at least two weeks. </p>
      <p>The mechanism by which negative energy makes copper conductors
        cold but will also heat light bulb filaments is not understood.
        Tom Bearden has coined the term "Gravito-Striction" for this
        process and has described how he believes it works. </p>
      <p>On the human side of the VTA development, some incidents are
        worth telling. Two people from Australia, who claimed they
        wanted to help Floyd, stole his notebook and promptly asked John
        Bedini for help in replicating the VTA based on the notebook
        contents. John recognized the notebook as belonging to Floyd and
        promptly asked them to leave. However, the notebook was never
        recovered. </p>
      <p>Floyd has received many death threats over the phone, and some
        threats face to face. A well dressed gentleman in an expensive
        suit, tie, hat, and hundred dollar shoes approached Floyd on the
        sidewalk of the street where he lives and introduced himself as
        Cecil Brown. He showed him a picture of Floyd inside his
        apartment. Cecil then told him that he represented a
        conglomerate that did not want Floyd's device to appear in the
        world at this time. He further stated that sometimes unfortunate
        things happen to people who do not comply with the wishes of
        others. He then retrieved the picture and departed. Incidences
        like this do impart significant concern in Floyd's mind! </p>
      <p>One real unsung hero of the human side of this story is Al
        Margolin, who for many years has provided test equipment,&nbsp;
        fabrication help, and transportation for Floyd and Rose whenever
        needed, and it was needed many times. </p>
      <p>Floyd's long time friend and former employer Bill Lawry has
        provided living and project expenses and fabrication help when
        needed. </p>
      <p>The reliable conditioning of the magnets in a manner that
        assures long time operation is the Achilles heel of this device.
        With the help of enough of the right people this device may
        change our world and open a new field of physics! This adventure
        of course is an on going and the final goal of powering the
        world with the VTA is still a long ways off. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Floyd Sweet: Vacuum Triode Amplifier (VTA)</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>According to Floyd Sweet, who is now deceased, God "revealed"
        information to him about how to create a device that would
        provide energy "that resembles electricity." (1) Although Sweet
        may have claimed divine inspiration, don't let your skepticism
        deter you from reading on -- the end result is worth a good deal
        of consideration. </p>
      <p>"The virtual vacuum is the primordial powerhouse of everything
        in the universe." Floyd Sweet </p>
      <p>The Vacuum Triode Amplifier, the result of Sweet's hard work,
        is claimed to produce an overunity effect due to its interaction
        with the vacuum of space. Sweet declared that "the virtual
        vacuum is far from empty, far from nothing, it is rather
        seething with potential energy as the primordial powerhouse of
        everything in the universe." (2) This energy is referred to by
        Sweet's compatriot, free thinker and nuclear engineer Thomas
        Bearden, as negative energy. It was Bearden who gave Floyd's
        device the name "Vacuum Triode Amplifier" or VTA. Tom saw in
        Floyd's invention the physical embodiment of a principle he had
        theorized many years before, but Bearden himself had never
        designed or constructed a physical device to access this elusive
        energy force. Upon meeting Sweet and examining the VTA, Thomas
        Bearden recognized what he calls "Four Wave Phase Conjugate
        Mixing," a type of energy extraction that taps what he, too,
        believes to be a universal, ever-present source of energy.
        Whether called "zero-point energy," "gravity field energy," or
        "radiant energy," its availability for conversion of electricity
        into heat, light, or mechanical work makes it a new form of
        energy worthy of extensive research. Bearden thinks it is
        negative energy, whose acquisition requires negative time. This
        means that if gravity were similarly utilized, it would be
        construed as a repelling force. </p>
      <p>In its physical form, the VTA consists of two magnets whose
        attractive sides are held about 3 inches apart by 2 to 4
        coreless wire output and drive coils. The device is self-powered
        but can be started by connecting a 9-volt battery to the drive
        coils. One of the reasons that the Sweet vacuum unit falls into
        the free energy category is because it pertains to the wider
        technological domain that includes the prior research of other
        inventors such as Paul Baumann, of the Swiss commune,
        Methernitha, and Hans Coler (Germany 1942). (See AEI website for
        more info.) </p>
      <p>The success of these three inventors' devices can be attributed
        to the work of Franz Kalusa and Oskar Kline in the first few
        decades of the twentieth century. By using "twin bifilar wound
        coils over permanent magnets," it is believed that the Sweet
        VTA, Swiss M-L converters, and Coler Magnetstromapparat utilize
        the same principle to acquire free energy. The coils are thought
        to cancel out the magnetic field that "the normal, excited EMF
        flow" causes. This allows the magnetism from the stack of
        permanent magnets to be directed into the 5th and 6th
        dimensions, which are "' curled up' within the other four
        dimensions," according to Kalusa. The magnets are then allowed
        to freely tap the space energy in those dimensions while the
        coil continues to distract the normal magnetic field, so to
        speak. The Sweet VTA is slightly different than the other two
        devices, in that "it uses special conditioned or activated
        permanent magnet material." It is therefore considered a "Stand
        alone device." This conditioning of the magnets is considered
        "the secret to the machine," since it could "be just as well
        'told' to output 50 HZ or 400 HZ." When the theory behind the
        source of free energy that runs these three devices was
        originally postulated, Einstein rejected it. Eventually he
        accepted the idea and allowed it to be published by the Prussian
        Science Academy. </p>
      <p>Floyd's homespun experiments with the Vacuum Triode Amplifier
        apparently tapped some very interesting forces. During one test
        in his apartment, the VTA actually weighed less and less the
        more that was applied to the load. In other words, the more
        "negative energy" generated, the more anti-gravity observed. At
        a certain point, a frighteningly loud sound jolted the inventor,
        and that particular experiment was forever retired. </p>
      <p>A recurring theme in other experiments is a decrease in
        temperature of the Sweet VTA. Sometimes the magnets and coils
        measure as much as 20F below air temperature when the device is
        powering loads of over one kilowatt. Once when the wiring was
        accidentally shorted, a "brilliant flash" appeared and frost was
        observed on the wires. Sweet was even electrocuted by his device
        once, which appeared to freeze the skin through which the
        current passed, and he believes that it was more damaging than a
        shock from conventional voltage in a power line would be.
        Bearden calls the simultaneous cooling of the device and heating
        of what it powers "Gravito Striction." Similar reports of energy
        machine components that exhibit below-ambient temperatures have
        been observed by other inventors, such as John Bedini and John
        R.R. Searl. A theory that could explain this effect has been
        postulated by Victor Schauberger, Walter Russell, and other
        researchers. They think "nature uses two types of 'spin,' one
        clockwise, the other counterclockwise. The clockwise spin is a
        concentrating effect which generates Heat as a byproduct and is
        used in all modern power generation and utilization. The
        counterclockwise spin is an expanding effect associated with
        cold and the attempt of nature to regain the unity that prevails
        when force of any type (Aether, magnetic, light, electric,
        gravitic, etc.) is not polarized. In fact, the very existence of
        electricity, magnetism, gravity, heat, light, etc. is not
        possible unless the Aether is thus polarized to create the
        interferences necessary to provide potential differences." </p>
      <p>Other oddities of the VTA's performance have been reported. The
        device is known to have stopped working one day after an
        earthquake. Though it was not substantial enough to disrupt the
        VTA's set-up, it is believed that the earthquake's accompanying
        electromagnetic pulse interfered with the machine. Also, when
        Sweet left his device on for 24 hours a day, he noticed that at
        night there was less voltage measured and the lights it powered
        were dim, while in the daytime there was more voltage and the
        lights were bright. Obviously, there is still a lot to learn
        about this new source of energy. </p>
      <p>Sweet's VTA unit is listed as an overunity device in the
        database of the Institute for New Energy (INE). The unit was
        tested by Tom Bearden on April 30, 1987, in front of multiple
        witnesses, and its most recent demonstration occurred in the
        1990s (3). According to its own guidelines, INE rates the
        invention at the highest interest level, with the potential for
        "new physics and great impact." INE also believes that "the
        device seems to be scalable to a larger size." INE ranks the
        commercial aspects of Floyd Sweet's VTA unit as very high since
        "the operation techniques and measurements are being refined."
        Bearden vouches for the validity of his colleague's invention,
        which can produce 500 watts of electricity with only a
        330-microwatt input (4). </p>
      <p>Like many other inventors, Floyd Sweet ran into problems with
        threats and theft. Two Australians once offered their help to
        Sweet and then stole his work notebook. Upon asking John Bedini
        for help in understanding the notebook's contents in order to
        replicate the device, Bedini noticed it was Sweet's property and
        refused to cooperate. Sweet never recovered the notebook. The
        inventor also received death threats, over the phone and face to
        face. Reportedly, a well-dressed man wearing a very expensive
        suit and shoes approached Floyd on the street he lived on. He
        introduced himself as Cecil Brown, showed him a picture of Sweet
        inside his apartment, and said that he represented people who
        did not want Sweet's invention to be revealed to the public. The
        man then said "that sometimes unfortunate things happen to
        people who do not comply with the wishes of others," and walked
        away. </p>
      <p>The VTA is not without problems. Although it is capable of
        producing "in excess of one KW of 120 VRMS 60 HZ power," the
        latest VTA prototype "has not shown the ability to continue
        operation for extended periods of time." It is thought that
        electrical disturbances outside the device are responsible for
        disrupting the internal resonance. The device often fails
        altogether to produce a steady output, as it is common for the
        voltage to drop to zero within only seconds or minutes. It is
        not yet known how or if this problem can be solved. </p>
      <p>Another challenge is that conventional electrical design and
        instrumentation does not seem to be compatible with the VTA.
        Floyd tried to apply conventional design formulas in order to
        figure out how many coil turns and amp turns should be made to
        achieve desirable outputs. To his dismay, this method "resulted
        in calculation inconsistencies." When it came to using
        conventional instrumentation to measure watts, volts, or amps,
        it would not work properly over 1 kW; instead, it would
        "indicate zero or some other value not related to the known
        actual load." For instance, when the VTA's voltage surpassed 120
        VRMS, indicated by the increased brightness of a lamp load, the
        ammeter, voltmeters, and power meter did not correlate with the
        change in brightness. These mysteries still plague the work of
        present researchers and scientists who are trying to further
        understand Sweet's device. The fact that they "are not quite
        sure why Sparky presents such flaws in his data releases"
        indicates either the difficulties Sweet ran into or the
        changing, unpredictable nature of the device's functioning (5).
        The painstaking process of duplicating the VTA's overunity
        effect coupled with the fact that "reliable conditioning of the
        magnets in a manner that assures long time operation is the
        Achilles heel of this device" mean that "we must await further
        troubleshooting and development of this unique Sweet VTA
        technology." Let's hope that it happens sooner than later. </p>
      <p><b>Does Sweet's Work Explain Searl's Device?</b> </p>
      <p>Floyd Sweet claims to have obtained over unity electrical
        energy effects by applying a special magnetization process to
        some ferrite magnets. His setup consisted of one or more
        specially conditioned magnets and at least 2 coils. The magnets
        are fixed (stationary). One coil was used to excite or begin the
        oscillations of the magnets with a small AC field. The other
        coil(s) were used to "pick up" the magnet's large magnetic
        oscillations. (Clearly a non-linear effect occurs here for the
        excitation AC magnetic field is small compared to the output.) </p>
      <p>See, for example, Alan Dubla's web pages and this article for a
        more detailed description of Floyd Sweet's devices. </p>
      <p>I have also investigated Prof. John Searl's magnetic
        motor/generator. After spending a couple of years volunteering
        my time with D.I.S.C. Inc. USA to help Prof. Searl reproduce his
        device according to his explanations and instructions, I have
        not been able to figure out by what physical bases Prof. Searl
        claims his devices worked. (Note: I have not worked directly
        with Prof. Searl. However, the group working here in the USA was
        in direct and frequent contact with Prof. Searl.) He has
        developed a construction method which he calls "The Laws of
        Squares" which, in my opinion, is so far removed from the
        language of physics and engineering that one is left completely
        in the dark as to the cause of the motion in his devices. We are
        therefore free to think up our own methods and explanations for
        constructing a device in which magnets are "self-propelled". </p>
      <p>Here is a rough illustration [Not included here] of Searl's
        setup. For more detail on Searl's devices see the info at this
        web site or just search the web. </p>
      <p>What is most interesting for the following comparison is the
        similarity (but not perfect match) between Sweet's method of
        conditioning the magnets and Searl's magnetization process. In
        both cases, an AC field is applied to the material. (There is
        more detail, of course, to both Sweet's and Searl's
        magnetization process. I am only pointing out the most obvious
        similarity here.) </p>
      <p>So, is there a way to use Sweet's effect to produce a
        Searl-like magnetic motor? </p>
      <p>Consider "large" but "slow" magnetization vector oscillations
        cohered (in sync) to produce traveling waves. It would then be
        possible for the wave to "pull" (or "push") a disk magnet along
        with it. This is illustrated in the next figure [Not included
        here] in which a disk magnet (red) moves along a magnetization
        vector oscillation traveling wave. </p>
      <p>If such waves can be created around a cylinder (or ring) then
        it might be possible to move the stacks of disks around this
        center cylinder. </p>
      <p>In Sweet's work, a small AC excitation is needed to begin the
        larger magnetization oscillations. Applying this concept to the
        Searl-like arrangement, the disks rolling around the center
        cylinder would be "seen" by the center cylinder as small
        "excitation" magnetic oscillations. </p>
      <p>Searl says that his first devices needed to be "started". That
        is, the stack of disk magnets need an external source to start
        them rolling. This could have excited large magnitude
        oscillations in the center cylinder in a similar way that
        Sweet's small excitations started the large magnetization
        oscillations in his magnets. </p>
      <p>One problem that I see with this arrangement is that I would
        not expect the wave length to be so large that the disks fit
        between wave crests. I would expect the wave length on the
        center cylinder to be much smaller. Then it is doubtful that the
        disks would be carried along. </p>
      <p>This may be why Searl claims that both the center cylinder
        (actually, its a ring in Searl's set-up) and the disks need to
        be specially magnetized (conditioned). The result may be another
        magnetization wave around the disks. These waves in the disks
        coupled with the wave in the center cylinder may be like two
        gears in which their teeth mesh. (Searl says that the frequency
        used to magnetize the disks is not to be the same as that used
        for the center ring. So it is not clear whether or not this
        "gear" analogy is appropriate.) </p>
      <p>In a static condition (that is, considering the center cylinder
        alone with no disks around it) The magnetization vector wave
        might "stop" (might not be traveling around the cylinder) but it
        might retain its alternating "pattern" around the periphery of
        the cylinder. This might be the origin of the "pattern" that
        Prof. Searl claims is measured around his center ring. </p>
      <p>Both Sweet and Searl claim that once the oscillation started
        and they extracted energy from their devices the magnets would
        become very cold. </p>
      <p>I have read that in ferromagnets, the magnetization vectors of
        the material are constantly oscillating. But the oscillations
        are chaotic/random. Sweet may have found a way to cohere or
        "order" these oscillations with a non-linear oscillating result.
        And Searl (independent of Sweet) might be using these
        oscillations to "carry" the stacks of disk magnets around the
        center cylinder. </p>
      <p>It is claimed that another researcher by the name of Hans Coler
        was also able to induce "large" oscillations in ferromagnets. I
        don't think there was any kind of special "magnetization"
        process involved, but I could be wrong. </p>
      <p>As far as I can determine, "large" scale coherence of magnetic
        oscillations is not known to exist in "large" magnets. (But then
        neither are the over unity effects produced by Sweet, Searl and
        Coler!) </p>
      <p>On the other hand, "small" coherent oscillations are know to
        exist in magnetic material. </p>
      <p>If you want to read up on magnetic oscillations, take a look at
        the following books. </p>
      <p><i>Magnetization Oscillations and Waves</i>, by A.G. Gurevich
        and G.A. Melkov, CRC Press, 1996 <br>
        <i>Theory of Magnetostatic Waves</i>, by D.D. Stancil,
        Springer-Verlag, 1993 <br>
        <i>Magnetostatic Waves and Their Application</i>, by P. Kabos
        and V.S. Stalmachov, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1994 </p>
      <p>These books mention the use of a DC magnetic "bias" field
        together with an AC magnetic field being applied to the magnetic
        material sample to induce various kinds of oscillations. This
        technique is called "parallel pumping". It is clear, to me, that
        AC magnetization techniques have been applied to small sample
        magnetic material now for many years. But the science folks
        don't seem to have applied such techniques on the "large scale"
        as have Sweet and Searl. </p>

      <p><b>Magnetic Bubbles</b> </p>
      <p>A fellow handed out a paper at the '94 INE Conference, which
        was sent to me (Alan Dubla), that had references to the Sweet
        VTA. It talked about creating a magnetic bubble and extracting
        energy out of it using methods similar to those described in
        articles written on Sweet's VTA. I was able to recreate a
        magnetic bubble, in small round BaFe magnets. I have had no
        success extracting energy out of it yet, but it is rather
        interesting and worth studying for a while. </p>
      <p>When the bubble is created and stable, the magnet has a very
        weak field. In the picture bellow, I have 8 1.25 inch diameter
        ring magnets lined up in two rows of four each. There is a strip
        of magnetic viewing paper laid across each of the rows. This
        paper will show the Bloc wall as a light green band. The Bloc
        wall, in easy to explain terms, is where the north and south
        pole meet in a magnet. On one side of the wall you have the
        north pole and on the other side you have the south pole.
        Looking at the magnets from right to left, top to bottom, you
        will notice that each magnet has a light green circular band
        over it, as seen with the viewing paper. The number above each
        magnet represents the number of joules it took to alter the
        original magnetic field to form the new, modified magnetic
        field. As the joules increase, the bubble shifts position from
        the outside of the magnet towards the middle. As the joules
        increase even more, the bubble starts moving towards the center.
        When that happens the original orientation of the magnetic field
        will be flipped 180 degrees. The bubble is created in the magnet
        as a result of partial demagnetization. By doing this, I am
        moving the Bloc wall and magnetic poles 90 degrees from their
        original position. After the field is modified, the north pole
        is now orientated towards the center of the magnet, and the
        south pole is along the outer edge of the magnet.&nbsp; When the
        band is centered between the outer circumference and the inner,
        the magnet is at its weakest point and the poles flip very
        easily. Running a 60 Hz AC signal running through a small
        electromagnet at a 90 degree angle to the magnet face makes the
        poles flip-flop, and the magnetic bubble expands and contracts,
        back and forth. </p>
      <p><b>Magnetizer</b> </p>
      <p>To create the magnetic bubbles, you need some high power
        magnetizing equipment. In the picture I have a box housing 8000
        uf worth of caps, a giant resistor to slow current draw, and a
        600 amp SCR for switching. The power supply is an old HP 300
        VDC. </p>
      <p>The caps charge up, and with the push of a button the caps are
        discharged through a 1 ohm coil with the magnet in the middle.
        The small coil in the picture is what I used to make the
        magnetic bubbles. The big coil is designed for the 4X6 magnets,
        but more power is required. The amount of joules discharged is
        variable. The small BaFe magnets require around 205 joules to
        create the neutral/centered magnetic bubble. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">A Way to Program Magnets</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have spoken with a fellow who had hired Don Watson several
        years ago to replicate the Sweet device; allegedly Watson was
        able to get about 3 watts from one model. The deal however went
        sour somehow, and work was not continued. </p>
      <p>Sweet, too, had a beginning model that output 6 watts until he
        did something *more* to excite the living you-know-what out of
        the barium nuclei - only after that was the phenomenal power
        gain (and 500 watt nominal output) available to use (for a while
        - until it inevitably sputtered out). </p>
      <p>Watson is correct in mentioning one way to excite barium nuclei
        in a magnet. It is a weak method however, and does not cause
        much action (at least as I have done it) </p>
      <p>One experiment I tried on this angle some time ago, caused some
        odd effects. </p>
      <p>I had a 4x6x1" barium ferrite slab sitting on top of a large
        tupperware (polypropylene) container, about 2 feet off the
        floor. The slab was magnetized and its attraction held a steel
        alligator clip onto it, in electrical contact. The other end of
        the alligator clip wire (about 2 feet long) connected to one
        terminal of a neon sign transformer. </p>
      <p>The neon xfmr is rated 15 kV, center tapped, so each output
        represents about a 7.5 kV RMS AC signal, the two outputs being
        out of phase of course. The other end of the xfmr output was
        left open. Only one end was used. The transformer's case (center
        tap) was grounded. </p>
      <p>So the magnet sitting on the plastic container was oscillated
        with about 7.5 kVRMS at 60 Hz. </p>
      <p>I was living with a roommate at the time who came near the
        thing and didn't know it was "on". Glad he didn't touch it. </p>
      <p>He was curious what it was and said when he put his head near
        the magnet to have a look, it built up a "pressure" behind his
        forehead, which caused him a curious headache afterward. </p>
      <p>After I heard this I went down to the basement where it was and
        did the same thing, putting my head within about 2 feet of the
        magnet. It began to hurt in a way, it was a kind of pain from
        the thing that I remember feeling. It caused in me a persistent
        headache as well, and also a shift in mood, I became very
        "spacey" and somewhat disturbed </p>
      <p>This also seemed to make both me and my roommate prone to
        violence, we both began to get irritated at trivial things and
        ended up in a brief fist fight. This was very out of character
        for both of us. My (now ex) roommate still says I should do more
        with my "electric brainwhacker". </p>
      <p>The magnet, after a while of this treatment, does develop a
        *slight* and mellow buzz, as I am used to feeling it. However I
        doubt it would be immediately perceptible to the unaccustomed
        observer. It is a small thing. And it will not create magnetic
        bubbles, so far as I know. </p>
      <p>The excitation does decay rapidly, and usually will not hold
        for more than a period of ten minutes. It begins to decay
        immediately after excitation is removed, and the rate of decay
        appears to be exponential. </p>
      <p>This is in sharp contrast to other things I have done, in which
        the vibrations are stronger and fully perceptible to
        unaccustomed observers. The decay rate is not exponential, but
        seems to follow a curve similar to the run down of an alkaline
        cell - it holds for a while, then tapers off at a faster rate.
        And it can happen over days, not minutes. Also it travels, I
        have been able to take energized magnets on a 300 mile road trip
        with no acceleration in decay. There has been mention, for
        intance, of the Testatika's inability to continue power output
        when moved. (To me --- as good ol Einstein would have put it ---
        a "clew".) </p>
      <p>So it appears that there are various modes of BaFe excitation,
        and that they have distinct effects, as evidenced, in part, by
        the different curves of excitation-decay. For starters though,
        HV excitation will show you a bit of something... but no
        promises, if you don't think you see any effects :) </p>

      <p>In fact, Don Watson said the magnet to be programmed was to be
        excited between two plates that were charged <br>
        with at least 20KV (DC or AC). This would cause a 'ringing' in
        the barium which would last for upwards <br>
        of 15 minutes. </p>
      <p>During that time, the magnet could be subjected to a sharp
        pulse at roughly 260 degrees of a 60 cps <br>
        sinewave. He said this was based on his own experiments and
        seemed to get the best results. </p>
      <p>Why would I believe Don Watson? Because he showed me two
        magnets, both 4" X 6" by 1/2" thick. One was <br>
        'programmed', the other was not. </p>
      <p>Using a piece of magnetic field line viewing plastic to view
        the unprogrammed magnet, I could clearly see the south pole on
        one face and the north pole on the other face, separated at the
        middle of the 1/2" magnet width by the Bloch wall. </p>
      <p>However, in the programmed magnet, the south pole did not stop
        at the midpoint, but wrapped up onto the face <br>
        of the north pole section, extending inward from the edge by
        about 1/4". That is where the Bloch wall HAD MOVED. </p>
      <p>It was like altering the duty cycle of a square wave, where a
        normal magnet would be analogous to a North/South relationship
        of 50:50, the programmed magnet was something like 30:70. Quite
        amazing! </p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a bubble within the top North pole
        face, looking much like an air bubble in water covered by
        plastic. And when you put another magnet near this bubble, IT
        MOVED away, just like pressing on a sheet of plastic to move the
        captive air bubble. </p>
      <p>Don said the programming did not always take, but that you
        could just do it again, using the same magnet until it did. Also
        that some magnets were imperfect, having internal fractures not
        visible without using the magnetic viewing plastic. </p>
      <p>The slabs were also sensitive to shock or outside stimulus
        which would kill the programmed effect and necessitate the
        magnet being reprogrammed. </p>

        <p><b>By Jerry Decker</b> </p>
        <p>During the year of 1993, I received a call from a fellow by
          the name of Donny Watson. He lived in Lancaster and had called
          to talk about various free energy devices, particularly Floyd
          Sweets VTA (Vacuum Triode Amplifier).</p>
      </center>
      <p>Donny claimed he had made a device that was producing anomalous
        amounts of energy, not large quantities, but definitely
        overunity. This particular unit was a rotary mechanical unit
        that as I recall was based on collecting back emf. I of course
        asked to see the device, but Donny was reticent. </p>
      <p>We met for lunch and on several other occasions, becoming
        friends in the process. Though I never saw any machines, I did
        see Donnys work area and he had a lot o parts and some
        equipment, but out of all the time I knew him, he showed me
        nothing. </p>
      <p>After several months of periodic discussion and meetings, we
        had a falling out and I did not hear from Dony again. </p>
      <p>At the ISNE conference in Denver, I was surprised to hear that
        a Donny Watson would be speaking on the Sweet VTA and his work
        to duplicate it. Turns out it was the same Donny Watson, we
        became reacquainted and ended up drinking beer late into the
        night, swapping all kinds of goodies. </p>
      <p>During the course o the conference, Donny showed me two
        magnets, they were both BaFe (barium ferrite) 4" x 6" x 1/2"
        thick. One was "programmed", the other was not. </p>
      <p>Using a piece of magnetic viewing plastic to view the
        unprogrammed magnet, I could clearly see the south pole on one
        face, separated at the middle of the ½ inch magnet width by the
        Bloch wall. </p>
      <p>However, in the programmed magnet, the south pole did not stop
        at the midpoint, but wrapped up onto the face of the north pole
        section, extending inward from the edge by about 1/4". That is
        where the Bloch wall had moved! </p>
      <p>It was like altering the duty cycle of a square wave, where a
        normal magnet would be analogous to a S-N relationship of 50:50,
        the programmed magnet was now something like 70:30. Quite
        amazing! </p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a bubble within the top N pole face,
        looking much like an air bubble in water covered by plastic.
        When you put another magnet near the bubble, it moved away, just
        like pressing on a sheet of plastic to move the captive air
        bubble. </p>
      <p>Donny said the programming did not always take, but that you
        could just do it again, using the same magnet until it did. Also
        that some magnets were imperfect, having internal fractures not
        visible without using the magnetic viewing plastic. </p>
      <p>The slabs were also sensitive to shock or outside stimulus
        which would kill the programmed effect and necessitate the
        magnet being reprogrammed. </p>
      <p>Although Ive never seen any working models of the Sweet device
        from anyone, this observation of the magnets was the closest
        Ive come, so Don Watson has my vote of confidence at this point
        and he is to be commended for figuring out how to produce the
        effect but also for sharing this information for other
        researchers </p>
      <p><b>New Insights ~</b> </p>
      <p>The reason I have written this short paper is because in the
        last few days, Ive been thinking a lot about the VTA and it
        struck me what must be going on in the programmed slab magnet. </p>
      <p>The only way you could have a bubble inside of the N face is if
        that bubble was of a different polarity, i.e., S, with the
        bubble edge being another Bloch wall. </p>
      <p>You must have a difference to be able to measure anything,
        homogeneity means harmony, no polarity and equates to zero,
        though there appears to always be minor fluctuations since
        nothing is ever truly in balance. </p>
      <p>I always thought the trick of the VTA was to cause the Bloch
        wall to vibrate in the presence of a coil of wire. Anytime you
        have a change of magnetic polarity near a conductor, you have an
        induced current, when that polarity changes, the current changes
        and in effect, pumps the energy out. </p>
      <p>Since this artificially created S pole in te form of a moving
        bubble floating on the N pole face can easily move, it can
        easily be made to vibrate, possibly over a contained area. </p>
      <p>If you place a coil of wire around the bubble, creating a
        constrained area, you could push the bubble back and forth in a
        controlled fashion with very small magnetic impulses. </p>
      <p>Now, if you could place another coil of wire, in such a way
        that the bubble edge moves back and forth across this coil, then
        you will induce a changing current that can be extracted. </p>
      <p>If the coil tapping the energy is bifilar, it would not suffer
        magnetic repulsions due to back emf. If under load, it would
        work like a homopolar generator, where the dissipation of
        produced power for any size load would not increase the energy
        needed to drive the motor driving the generator. </p>
      <p>Another key point, I think, is that the bubble must be tuned to
        the frequency at which it will be driven, say 60 Hz, to get the
        greatest Q (coupling of energy). </p>
      <p>Resonance is thus necessary to be able to tap the extra energy.
        Much like tapping a swing at precisely the right moment, with
        precisely enough energy to overcome internal resistances,
        eventually the inertia of the mass (or energy) will reach a
        point where other forces can e added and tapped. </p>
      <p>Alan Dubla has recently put up a new site dedicated to the
        Sweet VTA. Alan has achieved what appears to be the same
        magnetic bubble that Don did. </p>
      <p>In closing, there is one other point Id like to make; when I
        asked Donny about the programming of the magnet with the 60 Hz
        wave, he said it could be any frequency. Don also said that once
        a magnet was programmed, you could touch a scope probe to the
        magnet and you would see a very weak 60 Hz wave on the screen. </p>
      <p>I asked if this could be simply picking up background 60 Hz
        from the wall wiring and Don insisted it was not. I did not see
        this test since we were at the conference and he was just
        describing it. Perhaps he had programmed in another frequency
        and could see that on the scope, maybe even put the magnet and
        scope in a Faraday cage. Lots of room for experiment here </p>

      <p>Dear Jon: </p>
      <p>Thanks for sending along the extract of comments on the papers.
        Perhaps I can add a thing or two that will shed a little more
        light on some of this. First, let's settle the matter of whether
        this is a scam by persons after money. It isn't. There are no
        stock plans. Nobody wants any "investment." No one would accept
        it if it were offered. The inventor presently has a sufficient
        small income for his small needs. I work every day as a senior
        engineer, and support myself adequately in that fashion. I'm
        also retired from the U.S. Army with the rank of Lieutenant
        Colonel. Also, it is certainly quite true that the burden of
        proof is fully upon Sweet and me. That proof can only be
        achieved by independent test and certification by agencies and
        scientists of impeccable credentials and with no formal
        connection to the project. Until that is done, we totally accept
        that what we have said will not be believed, and should not be
        believed. I will say this: I have absolutely no control of the
        invention, and absolutely no say in its direction. It is totally
        Sweet's invention. </p>
      <p>If I had had my own fervent wish, formal submission for
        independent testing and certification (or falsification) by the
        scientific community would have been accomplished in 1987. Let
        it also be noted that an inventor has agreements and/or (with
        other) parties involved; he is often not legally free to do
        exactly as he might wish. The best we can presently ask is that
        the readers keep an open but highly skeptical mind, until such
        independent certification is forthcoming. If it isn't
        forthcoming, then trash the whole thing in file 13. </p>
      <p>To try to address the gist of many of the other comments, let
        me point out that we are referring to two key mathematical
        papers: Whittaker 1903 as cited, and Whittaker 1904 as cited.
        Let me urge all persons who commented on the lack of mathematics
        to please at least study those two papers intensely. Let me
        summarize what they actually show, rigorously. </p>
      <p>In the first paper, Whittaker shows that, completely at odds
        with the present scientific view, the electrostatic scalar
        potential has a totally unsuspected and highly organized
        bidirectional EM internal structure. It's actually composed of
        paired EM waves, each going in opposite directions (and in my
        view, one being the phase conjugate of the other). Further, the
        bidirectional pairs are phaselocked and in a harmonic sequence.
        So what the potential is actually composed of is a Fourier-type
        harmonic expansion, directly coupled with its time-reversed twin
        set, in a one-to-one ratio, with all the harmonic twin waves
        phase-locked. </p>
      <p>Normally, in electromagnetics one just gives a magnitude to the
        potential at each point and leaves it at that. However,
        Whittaker shows that the potential at a point actually
        encompasses a magnificent, hidden, highly organized flow of EM
        waves and energy into and out of that point. Although there may
        be no net EM forcefield at the point, the "hidden interior"
        energy flow through the point to and from the surrounding space
        is filled with EM forces and waves in dynamic motion. </p>
      <p>This leads to a real quandary in the assumed nature of a scalar
        potential, in my view: Instead of being a passive or simple
        scalar sort of thing that just has a convolution magnitude and
        sometimes an external gradient in that magnitude, it's a new
        kind of entity that is scalar externally, with gradients between
        adjacent external points, but at the same time it's totally
        dynamic, vectorial, and energetically organized "inside." </p>
      <p>"Further, it would seem to be in hidden hyperspatial EM
        communication with every other point in the universe, at least
        in the simple case. The basic thing, I think, is that Whittaker
        seems to delocalize the notion of the potential, extending it
        into hyperspace with respect to its internal EM energy flow. If
        someone on the net could put that into more precise language,
        I'd be very grateful. </p>
      <p>In my picture of it, as shown by Whittaker the seemingly quite
        placid scalar potential is an unsuspecting vector EM dynamo
        inside. In early 1987 I simply took the Whittaker picture of the
        potential's internal bidirectional EM waves seriously, and
        realized that these internal hidden EM waves didn't translate
        electrons in the electron shells of atoms, but instead
        penetrated to the nucleus directly. That meant that, in simply
        having a stress potential added to a material, one effectively
        had "pumping" EM waves connected directly to the atomic nuclei
        through hyperspace, bypassing the electron shells' usual Faraday
        shielding interaction. </p>
      <p>One can fairly readily build EM wave oppositions in proper
        harmonic, phase-locked Whittaker fashion, and so one can make
        and use an EM gradient-free potential construction entirely of
        bidirectional waves. This construction is such that : </p>
      <p>(1) a normal electron-wiggle detector instrument doesn't even
        "see" it, </p>
      <p>(2) the internal wave EM reaches directly to the nucleus and
        affects it and </p>
      <p>(3) it consists of EM "pump" waves in the nonlinear phase
        conjugate mirror sense. </p>
      <p>All that was needed then was to simply extract the standard
        pumped phase conjugate mirror equations from nonlinear optics
        and apply them to this "potentialized" or "Whittaker-pumped"
        nucleus of the atom. That mean that the nucleus should now be a
        pumped phase conjugate mirror. However, it still needs one small
        thing added. Sweet did one additional thing: he superposed a
        60-Hz modulation on the envelope of the Whittaker bidirectional
        waveset. </p>
      <p>In other words, the external amplitude of the artificially
        constructed stress potential was oscillated at 60 Hz. [Note that
        the external amplitude of the potential is what is in our
        3-space; the internal Whittaker EM biwaves are BEYOND 3-space.
        The nucleus is a hyperspatial or higher topological entity when
        the Whittaker structures of its potentials are taken into
        account.] </p>
      <p>Sweet personally discovered the activation procedure (which he
        still holds proprietary) for causing this 60-Hz oscillation to
        be taken up and self-sustained by the barium nucleus (we assume
        that it's the barium nucleus involved, because it won't work
        with any other kind of magnet except a barium ferrite magnet).
        Self- oscillation of barium compounds is well-known in the phase
        conjugate mirror optical literature. However, most of the papers
        I've been able to find on self-pumping mirrors have achieved the
        self-pumping only at optical frequencies. </p>
      <p>I've not been able to find anything else at ELF self-
        oscillation frequencies. I will say that, if Sweet's 6-lb unit
        is not in the self-oscillation (activated, or self-pumping)
        condition, you won't get a microwatt out of it, no matter what
        you do! If it's in the self-oscillation condition but at
        essentially "normal" nuclear potential, you will only get a few
        watts out, say, something like six watts. </p>
      <p>Sweet increased the nuclear potential and its 60-Hz
        oscillation, trapping it in the barium nucleus also as part of
        the activation, whereupon much greater electrical power is
        extractable from the device. He also worked out the device
        design so that its objective output voltage was 120 volts, for
        an input voltage of 10 volts (at 33 microamps). This small 1/3
        milliwatt 60 Hz input corresponds to the signal wave in PPCM
        theory. </p>
      <p>The entire device is, in my view, just a special self-pumped
        phase conjugate mirror, precisely like what is already in the
        standard literature, self-pumping and all. It's just self-pumped
        at ELF frequencies, and in a very special manner. It is being
        fed by self-oscillating hidden EM biwave (pumpwave) energy
        directly from the surrounding vacuum. [The EM energy of the
        vacuum intercommunicates internally through the hyperspatial
        Whittaker channels of the vacuum. The gradient in the potential
        magnitude represents the EM energy entering our 3-space by local
        scalar interferometry.] </p>
      <p>I also quoted a reference that shows that the local vacuum
        immediately around a nucleus is structured by the nucleus and
        can be considered and treated as a special sort of
        semiconductor. One can visualize, then, that the 60-Hz trapped
        self-oscillation is between that local semiconductor vacuum and
        the potentialized barium nucleus. In other words, in the
        self-oscillating nuclear potential it is both the local vacuum
        and the nucleus that are oscillating, at 180 degrees phase from
        each other. That means that there is a rhythmic inflow and
        outflow of potential (Whittaker biwaves) envelope magnitude
        gradient, to and from the nucleus, exchanged to and from the
        local semiconductor vacuum. Note what we're talking about. </p>
      <p>You've got to get the hyperspatial EM energy exchange of the
        vacuum "gated" or" shifted" into our 3-space, from hyperspace.
        Whittaker's 1904 paper can be interpreted as showing that (1)
        the gradient in the potential represents the 3-space aspect, and
        (2) any such potential gradient in 3-space is produced by scalar
        interferometry (interference of the hyperspatial vector EM wave
        interiors of scalar potentials.) </p>
      <p>So Sweet's 60-Hz modulation of the nuclear potential's
        amplitude represents a 3-space oscillating flow of EM vector
        energy, in and out of the nucleus from the surrounding
        semiconductor vacuum. If you properly introduce a signal wave to
        that "activated" or self- pumped nucleus (once it's got a
        3-space oscillating EM vector flow), then by standard textbook
        theory you are going to get out up to all the energy in the pump
        waves, coming forth from the "nucleus-mirror" as an amplified
        phase conjugate replica (PCR) of the small signal wave input. </p>
      <p>By the standard distortion correction theorem, that amplified
        PCR wave will travel back along the path taken by the signal
        wave. In other words, you've got organized EM energy coming out
        of the nuclei as a coherent EM wave, through the electron
        shells, into the material lattice, and on out of there into the
        external circuit. At that point, one simply taps onto it (e.g.,
        by magnetic induction), and you can extract and gate the
        amplified energy wherever you wish in the external circuit. Note
        that the 60-Hz self-oscillation energy comes in from the local
        vacuum to the nucleus, on the inflow or "intake" cycle. If you
        gate some of it on out of the nucleus externally, instead of
        letting it flow back to the local semiconductor vacuum, the
        adjacent vacuum surrounding the semiconductor just promptly
        replenishes the local vacuum potential. It has to do so, because
        of the nonlocal hyperspatial EM energy flow in the Whittaker
        structure of the potential in the first place. You can draw EM
        energy out of those internal EM waves in the Whittaker structure
        of the potential, and the electrical charges establishing that
        potential will continue to "pump out" virtual photons and
        replenish the potential. </p>
      <p>It can be seen that the potentials between the self-pumping
        nuclei are self-cohering (in their internal EM) throughout the
        mirror material by what is called "self-targeting," but that is
        another story too long to detail here. The second (1904)
        Whittaker paper I cited is also quite revealing. Here's what it
        shows. Rigorously, you can replace all of classical forcefield
        EM with scalar potential interferometry. Period. Note that this
        paper actually incorporates the Aharonov-Bohm effect, decades
        before Aharonov and Bohm's seminal 1959 paper. It also
        drastically extends it, for it is dealing with macroscopic
        effects, not just mesoscopic. Also, please note that scalar
        interferometry is not an oxymoron,in spite of being so labeled
        by one eminent scientist. </p>
      <p>If you realize that the scalar potential is totally vectorial
        in its Whittaker internal composition, and comprised of multiple
        EM waves, then when one interferes two scalar EM potentials, one
        is simply doing multiple wave interferometry simultaneously.
        It's perfectly good "wave" interferometry; it's just a whole
        bunch of it at once. And the wave interference actually connects
        hyperspace EM waves with 3-space EM waves. The hyperspatial EM
        wave interference creates 3-space EM potential gradients
        (forcefields), including both statics and dynamics. To sum up my
        view of the Whittaker papers, here's what they add to physics: </p>
      <p>(1) They add a second and completely new kind of
        electromagnetics, a hidden hyperspatial EM wave communication
        inside the scalar potential. Since the magnitude of the scalar
        potential from a single point charge does not reach zero until
        an infinite radial distance is reached, then each point charge
        communicates electromagnetically with each other point in the
        universe, through the hidden Whittaker EM hyperspace channel. It
        communicates via hidden (hyperspatial) EM waves that a normal EM
        detector does not even see. </p>
      <p>(2) The papers allow replacing all notions of external [3-
        space] EM force fields, waves, etc. with scalar interferometry
        of potentials [hyperspatial EM wave interferometry]. </p>
      <p>(3) by adding the "internal" EM energy and its hyperspatial
        "hidden variable" communication, the two papers do in fact
        extend each of the three disciplines: classical EM, QM,and
        general relativity. </p>
      <p>Indeed, they force consideration of a sort of "action at a
        distance," where by scalar interferometry the local vacuum
        potential and the local spacetime itself are altered and
        interact with the system in unexpected manners. </p>
      <p>Since the Whittaker internal EM energy extension set is the
        same in each case, it is my view that adding the Whittaker
        internal EM does unify the three extended disciplines. Note that
        it does not change the three present subsets. We might also ask
        the following: </p>
      <p>Can anyone show any paper in the literature, other than the
        Whittaker work and the other two recent papers I cited, that
        deals with this internal organized EM inside the scalar
        potential? If so, I've personally been unable to find it, and
        would very much appreciate the reference. </p>
      <p>Does there exist any other paper in the literature that treats
        the atomic nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror? I would
        very much appreciate the references, if there are any. </p>
      <p>Are there any papers at all in the literature, where research
        has been conducted in actually making the Whittaker-type of
        simultaneous wave/antiwave structure as an artificial scalar
        potential, in beams, and performing scalar beam interferometry
        with it on materials and systems at a distance __ e.g., say at
        three feet in the laboratory? If so, I'd again very much
        appreciate the references. </p>
      <p>It is my strong feeling that we must get such things looked
        into by the universities and by sharp physicists and graduate
        students. The Whittaker approach and the concept of using the
        nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase conjugate mirror that one
        can externally engineer electromagnetically, do seem to lead to
        some startling things on the bench. But presently the
        phenomenology is so completely unknown and unexpected that I
        fear we may never have a true science and technology here unless
        university-level work is done on it. Indeed, it's going to take
        some good theorists and some good experimentalists both. </p>
      <p>I might add that Sweet is incorporating the Whittaker theory
        into his EM theory of the device, and I expect him to publish
        that in the future for peer review and examination. His wife
        died recently, however, and so that part of the effort has been
        setback for a time. Sweet is a good theorist (I am not), and he
        is an especially good magnetics engineer of high caliber. He is
        also, in my opinion, a genius on the experimental bench. </p>
      <p>*** He has other highly unusual EM inventions which may ***
        receive more publicity in the future. </p>
      <p>I believe that, for the quaternions, the best way to describe
        EM expressed in quaternions (or better yet, in Clifford algebra)
        is to note that the EM thus expressed has a higher topology. It
        seems that you can get EM effects in the higher topology that a
        rigorous orthodox EM analysis will never reveal or appreciate. </p>
      <p>A very interesting reference to check in this respect --- by a
        highly capable scientist, and with all the mathematics --- is
        T.W. Barrett, "Tesla's nonlinear oscillator-shuttle-circuit
        (OSC) theory," <i>Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie</i>,
        16(1), 1991,p. 23-41. </p>
      <p>Indeed, I'm attracted to the notion that my own concept of the
        nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror could also possibly
        be expressed in terms of Barrett's OSC exposition. This is
        particularly attractive because Barrett points out that in the
        higher topology the nonlinear optics effects are achievable by
        circuits and devices themselves, without the presence of laser-
        matter interactions as such. He also cites a document number
        225395, 1988, U.S. Patent Office, where the OSC theory was
        originally disclosed. </p>
      <p>The complete mathematics for decomposition of the electrostatic
        scalar potential into bidirectional EM wave sets in harmonic
        phase- locked series is in E.T. Whittaker, "On the partial
        differential equations of mathematical physics," <i>Mathematische





          Annalen</i>, Vol. 57, 1903, p. 333-355. </p>
      <p>The complete mathematical proof that classical EM can be
        completely replaced with scalar potential interferometry is in
        E.T. Whittaker, "On an expression of the electromagnetic field
        due to electrons by means of two scalar potential functions," <i>Proceedings





          of the London Mathematical Society</i>, Series 2, Vol. 1,
        1904, p. 367-372. </p>
      <p>I believe Whittaker actually orally delivered both papers in
        1903. Review and commentary from the network scientists on the
        two Whittaker papers, and on the significance of the Whittaker
        papers or lack of it, would be most deeply appreciated.
        Particularly desired would be the results of any experiments
        performed in scalar potential interferometry, at a mild distance
        (say, three feet) where each of the two interfering potentials
        is artificially constructed of multiple phase-locked harmonics
        and their true phase conjugate waves in one-to-one magnitude
        ratio. We accent that at least one harmonic interval, and
        preferably more than that, are essential. </p>

        II of our decades-long operation. Phase I was to alert the free
        nations to the dangers of Soviet scalar EM weapons, and the
        necessity of countering them. That phase has been successfully
        completed. There are now three other nations --- not hostile to
        the U.S. --- that have developed and deployed scalar EM
        weaponry. The Soviets/KGB are soundly checked by these three
        nations, with regards to scalar EM weaponry. </p>
      <p><b>Phase II Operation Begun</b> </p>
      <p>The goal of the phase II operation is to get cheap, clean
        energy from the vacuum, obtain antigravity, and develop scalar
        EM healing of notorious diseases such as cancer, leukemia, AIDS,
        etc. In this phase we are now publishing papers in the orthodox
        literature that carry the message. Our target is the bright
        young graduate students and postdoctoral candidates who are
        becoming increasingly curious in this area. We will try to get
        as many of these interested as possible. The idea is to have
        about 100 "seed cells", in major universities, so that these
        young tigers do the necessary phenomenology experiments and
        produce the necessary theory extensions. If we can reach that
        number of seed cells, then those young Turks will turn over the
        present physics. That Phase II operation has begun. </p>
      <p><b>Two Fundamental Papers Published</b> </p>
      <p>For example, in mid-1991 we gave (in absentia) two fundamental
        papers to a very large symposium (IECEC '91) in the Boston area.
        The symposium was sponsored by IEEE, AIAA, and many of the other
        leading technical societies of the U.S. The two papers are
        published in the Proceedings by the American Nuclear
        Society.[1,2] </p>
      <p>One of these papers [1] tells what is wrong with quantum
        mechanics, electromagnetics, and general relativity - that is,
        what actually prevents their unification. It also tells what has
        to be done to unify them. I emphasize that the thesis in this
        paper is testable on the laboratory bench; it isn't just
        conjecture. </p>
      <p>The second paper [2] is rather unique, to say the least. In it
        I openly released the basic universal mechanism that is capable
        of directly tapping the potential energy of the vacuum,
        electromagnetically. That's a secret eventually worth billions
        of dollars; I freely gave it to everyone. I discovered the
        theoretical mechanism, so it was mine to give. The paper
        reported on Floyd Sweet's (my colleague for several years)
        vacuum triode which successfully taps the vacuum's virtual
        photon flux energy to produce 500 watts of time-reversed
        electrical power, with only 330 microwatts of normal power
        input. That device has been in existence since 1987 or earlier.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Fundamental Mechanism Is Proven</b> </p>
      <p>There are several hundred papers in the nonlinear optics
        literature that prove that the fundamental pumped phase
        conjugate mirror (PPCM) mechanism works, in the macroscopic
        world. I seem to have been (in 1986/87) the first person to
        openly treat the nucleus of the atom as a PPCM. </p>
      <p>In a proprietary 1986 draft and later 1987 paper given to
        Sweet, I produced the basic theory of how Sweet's vacuum triode
        device (which then was producing 6 watts output) was tapping the
        vacuum energy. To do so, I treated the Whittaker bidirectional
        EM wave components of a scalar EM potential --- introduced onto
        the nucleus --- as a set of wave/antiwave pairs or pump waves. </p>
      <p>This application simply uses the internal scalar potential's
        internal structuring as clearly established by Whittaker in
        1903.[3] </p>
      <p>With the internal Whittaker wave/antiwave structure, one can
        establish a self-oscillation (self-pumping) on the barium
        nucleus, in and of the virtual photon flux (VPF) exchange
        between the nucleus and its immediately surrounding vacuum.[4] </p>
      <p>When that is successfully done, the material containing the
        barium (in Sweet's case, barium ferrite magnets) is activated.
        That is, VPF exchange energy is rhythmically flowing into the
        barium nucleus and back out again in a 60 Hz wave --- as a wave
        of pure VPF stress potential; a pure scalar EM wave, which is
        composed of (and can be decomposed into) phase-locked AM
        oscillations of the set of Whittaker biwaves composing the
        potential. </p>
      <p>With this Whittaker decomposition, the self-oscillating barium
        nucleus is then a self-pumped phase conjugate mirror. Note that
        this "nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror" approach is a
        universal scheme for tapping the trapped energy in a massless
        scalar EM potential in the vacuum, without depleting the
        potential. </p>
      <p>The potential in the vacuum is a function of vacuum VPF
        activity; the potential is continually replenished by the vacuum
        itself. The EM energy trapped inside the potential can be tapped
        forever, if the potential is not bled off by translating
        electrons (or other charged particles). </p>
      <p>Then all that remains to be done to tap this vacuum-furnished
        "pumping" energy, is to utilize standard 4-wave mixing theory
        from nonlinear optics, and introduce a small signal wave input.
        By standard textbook theory, up to all the energy in the pump
        waves will then be emitted by the nucleus as a phase conjugate
        replica (PCR) (time-reversed replica) of the signal wave input.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, an amplified EM energy wave --- in this case,
        60 Hz --- will come from the self-pumped nuclei and will
        backtrack the path taken by the signal wave, in accordance with
        the so-called distortion correction theorem of orthodox
        nonlinear optics.[5] </p>
      <p>In this fashion, the energy in a potential established in
        vacuum can be directly tapped, taken from the VPF exchange with
        the nucleus, and gated out of the atom and into the external
        circuit, to power an external load. </p>
      <p><b>The Secret of Overunity EM Devices</b> </p>
      <p>THIS "NUCLEUS AS A PUMPED PHASE CONJUGATE MIRROR" MECHANISM IS
        THE FUNDAMENTAL SECRET OF ALL LEGITIMATE OVER-UNITY DEVICES THAT
        TAP VACUUM ENERGY. </p>
      <p>The tapping device is not a closed system, but is open to the
        flow of energy from the vacuum to the nuclei and back. All
        systems everywhere are open to this in-and-out VPF flux exchange
        anyway. Normally, however, the two VPF flows --- in and out ---
        are equal and opposite, and so the energy exchange between
        vacuum and nucleus is in equilibrium. In that case, none of the
        VPF exchange energy is gated out to the external circuit. </p>
      <p>In the "activated" case, however, the two VPF flows (between
        the nucleus and the vacuum) are not equal, because part of the
        flow energy that accumulates in the in-surge into the nucleus is
        gated out of the atom and into the external circuit. </p>
      <p>Hence the vacuum/nucleus flux exchange system is not locally in
        equilibrium, because part of the in-flow is being gated by
        4-wave mixing accomplished in the PPCM barium nuclei, into
        forming an organized PCR wave, which in turn goes on out of the
        atom instead of back to the vacuum. Any local vacuum energy
        extracted is just instantly replaced by the surrounding vacuum -
        just as a raging ocean instantly refills the hole left in
        dipping out a spoonful of water. </p>
      <p>So in the self-oscillating PPCM nucleus, part of the vacuum
        influx energy is gated into an organized phase conjugate replica
        (PCR) wave, instead of simply being flux-exchanged back to the
        local vacuum. This amplified PCR wave backtracks the path
        previously taken by the input 60 Hz signal wave, and thus
        proceeds out of the vacuum-pumped nuclei, through the atom's
        electron shells, into and through the material lattice, and
        arrives in the outer circuit, which is connected to the external
        electrical load. </p>
      <p>The device thus powers the external load directly off the
        energy organized and gated from the local vacua surrounding the
        excited, activated, self-pumped barium nuclei. Floyd Sweet's
        Vacuum Triode </p>
      <p>In his second vacuum triode, Sweet obtained 500 watts of
        negative electrical power out (at 60 Hz and 120 volts), with an
        input (signal wave, in nonlinear optical PPCM terminology) of
        only 330 microwatts (10 volts, 33 x 10^-6 amps) from a small 60
        Hz oscillator. That's about a 1,500,000 power gain. Not too bad
        at all. </p>
      <p>Sweet later "close-looped" the device, tapping off a wee bit of
        the output, and using it as the rigidly clamped
        positive-feedback input. So his later devices put out 500 watts,
        directly from the vacuum, without any external input at all. </p>
      <p>Sweet has also built devices having 1,000 watt output and 5,000
        watt output. The devices also are solid state, with no moving
        parts. </p>
      <p>A nominal Sweet device outputs 1,000 watts of time-reversed
        (PCR) EM power at 60 Hz and 120 volts. It weighs 6 pounds, and
        can be rigged to simultaneously produce antigravity, while it is
        producing its negative power. </p>
      <p>However, there are still some serious problems with stability,
        etc. Also, there are serious legal problems, and in fact the
        entire thing has been in litigation. It may be that nothing will
        ever be possible with this device, because of the horrendous
        legal entanglements. But the device is real, it works (albeit it
        is just a laboratory demonstration device, and not at all a
        production-ready model). It proves the principles, and the
        report is now in the standard literature. </p>
      <p><b>World's First Antigravity Success</b> </p>
      <p>Also, to prove the scalar EM interpretation of gravity and
        antigravity, at my urgent request in 1987, Sweet specially
        rigged the device for antigravity production. In the cited paper
        we report on the highly successful result. </p>
      <p>The 6-lb. weight of the object was reduced in periodic stages
        by 90%, on a scale on the lab bench, in a totally controlled,
        smooth, slow, sustained experiment without transients or sudden
        surges, jerks, etc. At the same time, the device was steadily
        producing negative electrical power. </p>
      <p>In fact, the method of producing antigravity in a "rigged" unit
        is simply to force it to process more negative power through the
        nucleus. Gravitational energy is negative energy, and
        gravitational power is negative power, as is well known. </p>
      <p>It follows that to first order, antigravity can be regarded as
        simply the outputting or ejecting of negative energy from the
        atomic nucleus, through the electron shells and into an external
        load, rather than return of the negative VPF energy back to the
        vacuum from the nucleus. </p>
      <p>The curve is reproduced in the paper, and printed in the
        proceedings. I had qualitatively predicted the results, prior to
        the experiment. </p>
      <p>What is not printed in the proceedings is that, with another
        more powerful model, Sweet has actually fully levitated the
        entire 6-lb unit, and "flown" it above the bench, via this
        approach to antigravity. </p>
      <p>So the scalar EM theory works. It's still tricky, and we're
        just at the stage that normal EM went through with "cat fur,
        glass rods, and pith balls." But slowly we're getting there.
        Still, we desperately need to develop good instrumentation for
        detecting (1) the absolute scalar potential, including its
        magnitude, and (2) the exact Whittaker bidirectional EM wave
        harmonic structure of the scalar potential. We know how to
        approach that problem, but it will be quite expensive, and
        funding to do that has simply never been available. </p>
      <p><b>"Energy" Is Presently Incorrectly Defined</b> </p>
      <p>To illustrate just how poorly some of the foundations of normal
        science (including physics) are known, let me point out that the
        present definition of energy is totally wrong. Now there's a
        real attention grabber of a statement! Can I prove it? Let's
        see. </p>
      <p>The present "definition" of energy in science is usually stated
        something like this. "Energy is the capacity to do work." Well,
        that statement happens to be totally, hopelessly false. It isn't
        even correct logic. Here's why. </p>
      <p>What is work? Ultimately, work is the scattering (disordering)
        of energy. We can always resort to calorimetry, e.g., and
        determine the warming of a solution (such as water) by a
        mechanically-powered paddlewheel, to convert mechanical energy
        to heat energy, etc. But in QM, all mechanical forces are
        generated by the exchange of virtual photons, so even mechanical
        force is electromagnetic at base. Hence mechanical force times
        distance is also EM-generated, at its causative base.
        Eventually, mechanical and electromagnetic work involves the
        scattering of EM energy. </p>
      <p>So substituting for the term "work" in the accepted definition
        of energy, the standard definition is really this: "Energy is
        the (capacity to do) scattering of energy."[6] That's logically
        contradictory. It says that energy is just its own scattering!
        And that's nonsense. </p>
      <p>Try it on the notion of a fishhook. I can truthfully state: "A
        fishhook can be used to catch fish." That's perfectly okay.
        However, we cannot accurately define a fishhook as "A fishhook
        IS the capacity to catch fish." That's a non sequitur. We can
        say, accurately, that "a fishhook HAS the (innate) capacity to
        catch fish," and that is accurate. That's just a statement about
        fishhooks, it is not a definition. But we cannot say that "a
        fishhook IS the capacity to catch fish." Indeed, a fishhook IS a
        bent piece of wire, where one end is usually curved with a barb
        on the tip. </p>
      <p>Similarly, we can say that "energy HAS the capacity to do
        work," and that is logically accurate. In that form, it's just a
        statement of one of the things that energy can be used to do.
        One can, by scattering the energy, do work --- since work is
        just the scattering of energy in the first place. But one cannot
        say that "Energy IS the capacity to do work." A thing cannot be
        defined as just its own scattering! </p>
      <p>I find it remarkable --- even astounding --- that generations
        of scientists and engineers have apparently failed to notice
        this simple, elementary fact. Could it be that all the
        physicists and engineers are presently wrong in their notion as
        to precisely what energy IS? If so, then (one might say) what,
        pray tell, is it? What is energy anyway? </p>
      <p><b>A Fundamental Redefinition of Energy</b> </p>
      <p>Here's the precise definition: ENERGY IS ANY ORDERING, EITHER
        STATIC OR DYNAMIC, IN THE VIRTUAL PARTICLE FLUX OF VACUUM.
        Period. Note that energy overall refers to the flux of any and
        all kinds of virtual particles in the vacuum. It can be any kind
        of ordering imposed in or on any or some or all of those
        particle fluxes. </p>
      <p>But when you put an adjective modifier in front of the word
        "energy", then you have selected a particular type of flux. In
        that case you have to discriminate the type of quantum particle
        of the field, comprising the flux that is being referred to.
        Like the following: </p>
      <p><b>Definition of Electromagnetic Energy</b> </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic energy is any ordering, either static or
        dynamic, in the virtual photon flux of vacuum. In other words,
        for a field energy, one selects only the type of particle in the
        VPF that is the quantum particle of that field. </p>
      <p>Let's continue: Nowhere in physics --- in all of physics ---
        does there appear a legitimate definition of the electrostatic
        scalar potential. The normal "definition" utilized or advanced
        is a prescription for calculating its magnitude. I could not
        find a single physicist or electrical engineer who could
        accurately define it. So I went to QM and dug out what it is,
        myself. Let's continue: </p>
      <p><b>Definitions of Some Types of Potentials</b> </p>
      <p>A potential is any ordering, either static or dynamic or
        combination thereof, in the virtual particle flux of vacuum. </p>
      <p>Note that, according to this definition, a potential is pure
        energy, a priori. But we must be careful. Because of the nature
        of the virtual particle flux comprising it, the potential is a
        collection of individual virtual energies --- a collection of
        the individual energies of a host of individually moving virtual
        particles. Each particle is still almost totally separate from
        each other, most of the time. In other words, as an informal
        analogy, potential is a sort of mostly disintegrated energy,
        which only has just a touch of integration, enough to allow it
        to be referred to as a single "collection" or "ordering." </p>
      <p>A scalar potential is any static (stationary) ordering in the
        virtual particle flux of vacuum. A vector potential is any
        dynamic (nonstationary) ordering in the virtual particle flux of
        vacuum. So scalar potentials and vector potentials are simply
        different subsets of the energy domain. </p>
      <p>An electrostatic scalar potential is any static (stationary)
        ordering in the virtual photon flux of vacuum. And so on. </p>
      <p>Now those are all precise definitions. To the best of my
        knowledge, they have not previously appeared in physics. </p>
      <p><b>Internal Wave Structure of A Scalar Potential</b> </p>
      <p>However, with respect to the electrostatic scalar potential,
        one still has a conceptual problem. Any photon in the vacuum
        must of necessity be moving at an average velocity of c, it
        would seem. So how does one have a "stationary" ordering of
        these extremely fast photons? In other words, how do you catch
        and "hold stationary" a particle that's moving at luminal
        velocity, and have it still continuing to move that fast? </p>
      <p>It's simply a special case of a kind of "standing wave"
        stationary solution by another name. Indeed, Whittaker
        decomposes the scalar potential into bidirectional pairs (in a
        harmonic series) of EM waves.[7] In other words, a scalar
        electrostatic potential internally consists of --- and is
        composed of --- paired EM waves, passing through each other, in
        pairs in a harmonic set. Sort of like a Fourier expansion set of
        harmonic waves, coupled with its phase conjugate set that is
        present at the same time. Notice that the harmonic wavepairs are
        phase-locked in frequency and time. </p>
      <p>Hence this structure establishes an organized, standing,
        stationary spatiotemporal lattice directly in the vacuum
        potential. It is strongly pointed out that this represents a
        local organization and structuring of spacetime itself. </p>
      <p>Further, a given potential created by our circuits is a change
        in the trapped local EM energy of the vacuum. It therefore
        represents a local curvature of spacetime, and this local
        curvature is Whittaker-structured. </p>
      <p><b>Gravitons, Photons, and Antiphotons</b> </p>
      <p>So we look at one pair of Whittaker waves, at its wave and
        antiwave components. We point out that the antiwave is a true
        phase conjugate (time-reversal) twin of the wave. In that
        wave/antiwave pair, photons in the wave are moving forward (say,
        from left to right) in one direction, and antiphotons in the
        antiwave are moving back (say, from right to left). In other
        words, photons and antiphotons are present and constantly
        meeting each other in each wave/antiwave pair. </p>
      <p>Further, the antiwave is precisely coupled to the wave by phase
        conjugation. This requires that photons and antiphotons are also
        continually and precisely coupling - which they can do and will
        do if one is a precise phase conjugate of the other --- and
        decoupling. But when momentarily coupled, the photon/antiphoton
        pair have helicity 2. In other words, at that moment the paired
        system (couple) is stationary. As a crude visual model, each may
        be visualized as "whirling around" (orbiting) the other
        momentarily, so that each has tangential velocity c, but
        oppositely directed, producing a spin-2 system that is
        momentarily "trapped" and not translating.[8] In this fashion a
        photon may be "spatially trapped" in a graviton system, but the
        individual photon may still be moving with tangential velocity
        c, even though the graviton system is stationary. </p>
      <p>Thus what we have in the Whittaker bidirectional wave structure
        of the scalar EM potential is the continual formation and
        dissolution of stationary spin-2 gravitons, with photons and
        antiphotons continually entering and exiting each coupling
        position. The gravitons resulting from the photon
        coupling/uncoupling are statistical, for they are continually
        being created and destroyed. </p>
      <p>Those statistical gravitons are what comprise the
        "electrostatic scalar potential," and constitute the convolution
        of the locally trapped photons. Consequently, the local EM
        energy trapped in the scalar EM potential exists in that form. </p>
      <p>Note that, because of the arrangement of the photon/antiphoton
        pairs into a harmonic series, all the EM waves in the entire
        Whittaker set are phase-locked, as are the gravitons. This means
        that the phase-locked graviton sets represent an ordered
        spacetime graviton lattice --- containing EM energy ordered both
        dynamically and statically in frequency, energy, space, and
        time. </p>
      <p>So, the scalar electrostatic potential is actually a hidden
        graviton latticing organization of local spacetime itself. </p>
      <p><b>Photon Interaction And Newton's Third Law</b> </p>
      <p>It follows that, in photon interactions, normally we actually
        have a bust-up of a graviton, so that we have two photon
        interactions,[9] not one, as follows: (1) the freed forward-time
        photon interacts with the shell electrons of the atom, which is
        the reaction contained in the textbooks, and (2) the freed
        time-reversed antiphoton interacts with the nucleus of the atom
        to produce Newton's third law reaction force.[10] </p>
      <p><b>The Scalar Potential Is Gravitational</b> </p>
      <p>Now that we know that the scalar potential is comprised of
        gravitons, we can understand why the potential is gravitational
        (as is well-known in general relativity.)[11] We also realize
        something even more important: We realize precisely how
        gravitational potential is made and sustained
        electromagnetically. In other words, we now understand
        electrogravitation. Note that, so far, we have described a very
        "linear" condition in spacetime, where the local spacetime from
        one point to its neighboring points does not change in the
        photon coupling constituency of the graviton lattice. Such a
        spacetime is locally flat. </p>
      <p><b>Curved and Flat Local Spacetimes</b> </p>
      <p>However, it follows that we also should be able to do some
        nonlinear things to make the average photon/antiphoton coupling
        differ from spin-2. In that case, we can have some multiple
        photon couplings greater than helicity 2. We can also have the
        occasional failure of photon and antiphoton to couple, so that
        the average coupling is less than helicity 2. </p>
      <p>Because of the continual creation and annihilation of
        gravitons, in describing "the" graviton we are speaking of the
        average photon coupling over a finite time, where the average
        smooths and becomes a constant value, and where by "photon" we
        refer to both photons and antiphotons. </p>
      <p>If so, we then have this characteristic: If the average photon
        coupling in the vacuum EM potential is spin-2, then that's the
        "linear" coupling case, and the local spacetime is flat
        (uncurved). If the average coupling is less than spin-2, then
        the local spacetime is curved in one direction. It is deficient
        in photons for its preferred coupling, so it acts as a photon
        sink, or EM energy sink. So to speak, such a
        potential/vacuum/spacetime has "unfilled photon holes --- sort
        of a slightly depleted "Dirac photon sea." On the other hand, if
        the average coupling is greater than spin-2, the local spacetime
        is curved in the opposite direction. It has a surplus of
        photons, so it acts as a photon source --- in other words, as an
        EM energy source. In this case, it is a sort of "excited Dirac
        photon sea." </p>
      <p>Just as the spacetime/vacuum possesses a negative energy sea of
        Dirac electrons, so it possesses a negative energy sea of
        photons. When it's flat, all the negative energy "holes" are
        filled with virtual photons. When it's curved in one direction,
        some of the holes are empty, and the local spacetime will
        "absorb" some available photons. When it's curved in the other
        direction, an excess of virtual photons/antiphotons are crammed
        in there in excess of the holes, so the spacetime will emit
        photons and serve as an energy source. </p>
      <p>Remember that spacetime/vacuum to first order is just scalar
        potential. We can have a negative or a positive potential, as a
        delta compared to the normal or ambient vacuum potential. And
        when we speak of curved spacetime, we are just talking about a
        surplus or shortage of trapped photon energy coupling density to
        comprise the local vacuum/potential. </p>
      <p><b>Potential, Vacuum, Spacetime, and Energy</b> </p>
      <p>The four words, potential, vacuum, spacetime, and static energy
        turn out to be essentially identities. Also, all of them have a
        dynamic substructure. That is, a vacuum per se is
        structured/ordered, since it is essentially a scalar potential.
        To first order, it is an electrostatic scalar EM potential, in
        the manner shown by Whittaker to have an internal bidirectional
        EM wave harmonic structure. </p>
      <p>A spacetime is internally structured; this provides direct
        access to "hyperspace" engineering, since the "internal" part of
        spacetime is hyperspatial, mathematically. But with the
        Whittaker approach, it is straightforward to directly engineer
        this internal hyperspace aspect. </p>
      <p>The ultimate engineering is hyperspatial engineering, vacuum
        engineering, engineering of potentials, engineering of vacuum
        engines, energizing the vacuum, energizing spacetime,
        structuring the local curvature of spacetime, engineering the
        internal electromagnetics, etc. All these things are identically
        the same thing. They are all part of scalar electromagnetics. </p>
      <p>Interference of vacua/potentials generates what we call EM
        waves in vacuum.[12] These waves may move either time-forward or
        time- reversed (antiwaves). You can also engineer this direct
        scalar interferometry to produce, stabilize, and control EM
        energy, in static or dynamic form, as Whittaker showed in 1904,
        even at a distance.[13] </p>
      <p><b>Overunity Condition: Tapping The Potential</b> </p>
      <p>So, as you might surmise, in scalar EM we can curve local
        spacetime, and use it as either a source or a sink of EM energy.
        Once we pay to move a set of charges so as to establish a
        particular excitation and structure to the local or distant
        spacetime, so long as we do not allow the depletion of the
        charges, they continue to "pump" virtual photons (that is what
        electric charge is, according to QM) and sustain that particular
        active/excited/ energetic spacetime/vacuum/potential. If virtual
        EM photon energy is removed from that excited/activated vacuum
        region, the surrounding activated vacuum instantly replaces it,
        continually and forever. </p>
      <p>Now we are free to build a device which (1) establishes the
        excited vacuum/spacetime/potential in the first place, and (2)
        then taps off the virtual photon energy of the excited vacuum
        potential itself, without allowing depletion of the sustaining
        charged particles that are fixed in position and
        creating/pumping the virtual photon flux that creates the
        potential. We can tap the continual power of the Whittaker EM
        biwaves flowing through the excited vacuum potential forever,
        without exhausting it. It is simply comparable to putting a
        paddlewheel in a river, where in this case the Whittaker
        bidirectional EM wave structure is the river, and a special
        tapping device or process is the "paddlewheel." We can extract
        all the energy we wish, forever, from the stream, and the vacuum
        itself will continually and forever replenish the stream as fast
        as we extract the power. </p>
      <p>So we can build an over-unity machine, IF WE TAP THE LOCALLY
        ALTERED VACUUM POTENTIAL'S HIDDEN WHITTAKER RIVER, rather than
        releasing the sustaining electrical charges/VPF spray pumps we
        accumulated to create that altered potential. </p>
      <p>If you release the charges (the electrons, e.g.) as normal
        electrical engineers are trained to do, the charges translate
        and mechanically bang and clang their way through resistances,
        etc. on the way to electrical ground, depleting the potential in
        the process. This banging and clanging produces scattering of
        the order/energy in the potential and hence does work. But that
        way you only get one shot of it. It's a one-time thing, and then
        you've got to pay to move in some more charges, build another
        potential, and release the potential and the charges so the
        charges will go banging and clanging through the circuit again,
        scattering energy (order) and producing one-time work again. </p>
      <p>That's a very poor way to do business. It's rather like having
        some free, self-powered pumps, building a dam to hold some water
        pressure, moving in some of the pumps and pumping up water
        behind the dam to provide the pressure, then knocking down the
        dam and releasing the pumps and the water simultaneously, so
        that the water will rush out and push the pumps along to bump
        into things along the flow channel and do "banging and clanging"
        work. Yes, you can get some work done by the pumps one time that
        way. But it's a "hell of a way to run a railroad!" Yet all our
        present electrical engineers and electrical scientists are
        trained to plan, develop, build, and utilize just such crude EM
        systems! </p>
      <p><b>Nature's Engines: Charged Particles Are Pumps</b> </p>
      <p>Charged particles, in quantum mechanics, are engaged in a
        violent virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum. The
        violent virtual photon exchange between vacuum and mass particle
        is what creates and constitutes the electrical charge on that
        particle of mass. In other words, the electrically charged
        particle is nature's little "spray engine" or "spray pump," with
        respect to virtual photon flux or spray. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of the electrostatic scalar potential created by
        the accumulated charges (spray pumps) represents the local
        magnitude (flux/spray density) of that virtual photon "spray."
        It has nothing to do with the mass of the charges, except that
        nature has built those particular masses to be "little
        self-powered spray pumps." </p>
      <p>When we "charge up" an accumulator, such as a steel sphere or a
        capacitor, we push in the electrons so that they pack closer
        together, and we thus increase the virtual photon spray density
        because we've accumulated more sprayers in a confined volumetric
        region. The volumetric spray density represents the magnitude of
        the electrostatic scalar potential (ESP), in this analogy. </p>
      <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, Whittaker proved that this
        scalar potential - this "spray density" --- is internally
        organized into hidden, flowing, bidirectional EM waves.[14] EM
        forcefield wave Energy is flowing in both directions. In the
        electrostatic scalar potential, the net Poynting vector
        resultant is zero, but it is a "sum-zero system" composed of an
        infinite set of opposite but equal finite Poynting vectors. That
        zero vector resultant is a scalar EM potential. It's got lots
        and lots of EM energy flowing both in and out simultaneously,
        but these flows are normally balanced and in equilibrium. </p>
      <p><b>The Overunity Electrical Machine's Secret</b> </p>
      <p>However, if we could tap the EM energy in those hidden EM waves
        flowing oppositively inside the ESP, we could extract EM energy
        from the vacuum. We could "gate" some of the spray energy, that
        comes in from the vacuum to the charged particle, into the
        external circuit instead of back out to the vacuum. If so, we
        can use that "extracted and externally gated EM energy" to power
        a load. The "nucleus as a Whittaker-pumped phase conjugate
        mirror" mechanism I found in 1986, furnished to Floyd Sweet in
        early 1987, an released in 1991 allows precisely that tapping
        and gating capability. </p>
      <p>Here's the magic secret of all electrical over-unity machines:
      </p>
      <p>1) TAP THE VIRTUAL PHOTON SPRAY. </p>
      <p>2) TAP THE ENERGY IN THE MASSLESS VACUUM POTENTIAL. </p>
      <p>3) DO NOT RELEASE THE SPRAY PUMPS. </p>
      <p>4) DO NOT ALLOW CURRENT FLOW IN THAT PART OF THE CIRCUIT WHERE
        THE CHARGE PUMPS ARE COLLECTED TO CREATE THE POTENTIAL. </p>
      <p>5) OR AT LEAST ALLOW ONLY THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM OF
        FLOW/BLEED-OFF THERE, OF THE PUMPS. </p>
      <p>6) ORGANIZE, GATE, AND APPLY THE POTENTIAL SPRAY TO THE
        EXTERNAL CIRCUIT, WHERE IT WILL ATTACH TO AVAILABLE ELECTRONS,
        FORMING FORCE FIELDS, VOLTAGE, AND CURRENTS TO PUMP ELECTRONS
        AROUND THE CIRCUIT. </p>
      <p>7) USE THOSE EXTERNALLY POWERED FIELDS AND CURRENTS TO POWER
        THE LOAD. </p>
      <p>You can freely tap the potential's VPF "spray" forever, once
        one is created in the vacuum. As fast as you scavenge out the
        power in the spray, it is just renewed by the continued pumping
        of the charged particle "spray pumps." Nature and nature's
        excited vacuum potential "flux-spray" provide and replenish that
        pumping and that power, for free, forever. </p>
      <p>So the altered vacuum (potential) is a universal
        "virtual-photon- flux fuel" if you construct your power units
        correctly. But you must engineer things one step deeper than the
        present seriously flawed electromagnetics prescribes. </p>
      <p>Similar constructions give the secret of gravity and
        antigravity, and how to engineer them as well. However, that is
        beyond the scope of this paper. </p>
      <p><b>All Systems Are Open To Vacuum Flux Exchange</b> </p>
      <p>As we stated, our attention is no longer directed to scalar EM
        weapons, but to the Phase II operation. That is progressing;
        there are at present several legitimate devices or processes
        that produce overunity. We reiterate that this is nothing
        mystical; none of these systems or processes is a closed system,
        so closed-system energy conservation need not apply locally. </p>
      <p>Indeed, there is really no such thing in the universe as a
        truly closed system, anywhere. Every system is open to the
        vacuum's virtual particle flux, and is in fact already in a
        fantastic virtual particle exchange with the vacuum. Normally,
        however, the influx and the outflux are equal in absolute
        magnitude; hence the system is in internal equilibrium vis-a-vis
        the vacuum. </p>
      <p>However, if one breaks the equilibrium in this internal flux
        exchange, and organizes and gates a portion of that influx on
        out of the atom and into the external circuits, one can power an
        external electromagnetic load directly from the extracted vacuum
        energy. It is no more mysterious than placing a paddlewheel in a
        flowing stream, to extract some useful energy as shaft
        horsepower. We just have a more esoteric stream and a more
        esoteric paddlewheel. </p>
      <p><b>In Conclusion</b> </p>
      <p>We also point out that there are no irrevocable "laws" of
        nature. Every so-called "law of physics" is just a great and
        useful generalization, based on certain fixed assumptions, that
        holds in a broad area. If the assumptions are violated, however,
        the law need no longer hold, and it can be violated. </p>
      <p>Scientific proof is proof by the experimental method, not by
        the authoritarian pronouncements of orthodox scientists.
        Unfortunately, orthodoxy as yet knows nothing of the process we
        are advancing, or of scalar electromagnetics. In the unorthodox
        experimental arena, however, scalar EM is still a newborn infant
        in the womb, but it is thriving and advancing. It is up to us to
        serve as midwives and get the infant born. </p>

        one has a phase conjugate material, it may emit either photons
        (a normal wave) or antiphotons (a time-reversed or
        phase-conjugate wave). </p>
      <p>Now, if I am right as to the genesis of Newtonian 3rd law
        reaction force, then when the material emits a time-reversed
        wave, or an antiphoton, the material should not recoil. Such
        experiments have in fact been done in nonlinear optics
        experiments, and "inexplicably" a phase conjugate mirror
        material does not recoil when it emits an antiphoton or a phase
        conjugate wave, seemingly violating Newton's third law! So it
        seems I am correct after all. </p>

        It is the trapped EM energy in mass, e.g., that is
        gravitational. Mass is in fact a highly intense mass potential.
      </p>
      <p>Since any scalar potential is also a form of trapped EM energy,
        that energy --- and hence the potential also --- is
        gravitational in nature. </p>

        that the present forcefield electromagnetics can be replaced by
        scalar potential interferometry. And I'm called a lunatic for
        speaking of scalar interferometry! </p>
      <p>Rigorously the scalar potential is composed of a dynamic,
        opposing vector forcefield wave internal structure. Internally
        it's vectorial; externally it's scalar. Whittaker 1903 tells how
        to make standing scalar potentials; these can be made as beams.

        FALSE STATEMENT -- as Tom Bearden explains below: </p>
      <p><i>Bearden Replies</i> </p>
      <p>Hi Les, </p>
      <p>Typical [mis]information. He charges "hearsay" and speaks
        entirely from hearsay himself. </p>
      <p>I did lots of experiments with Sweet, in Sweet's lab, on
        personal visits to California to work with him awhile (ask John
        Bedini, he was there). And John did not "work for" <br>
        Sweet; to the contrary, he personally assisted Sweet to help him
        get going, for free. Without John's assistance, Sweet would have
        been a very much longer time in getting <br>
        successful activation of persistent self-oscillation in his
        barium ferrite magnets. </p>
      <p>http://www.cheniere.org/misc/sweet.htm </p>
      <p>At the time I met him, Sweet knew nothing of phase conjugate
        optics (when he got his Master's degree from MIT in the 1940s,
        the subject was not even being taught in the U.S., <br>
        or even known here -- check it out). Information on phase
        conjugate optics was given to the U.S. by the Russians much
        later in a briefing by the Russians at a U.S. university, and <br>
        even then it took quite a while for the U.S. to get going in
        phase conjugation. Again, check <br>
        it out. </p>
      <p>I personally extracted the main phase conjugate equations from
        one of the first books on the subject, and furnished them to
        Sweet since he was entangled with -- among other <br>
        things -- phase conjugate signals. At the time, his unit put out
        only 6 watts. That's S-I-X watts, not 500. </p>
      <p>Incorporating the results of phase conjugation for more proper
        handling, Sweet's next VTA put out 500 watts of power and had an
        amplification (COP)due to his new phase <br>
        conjugate pumping of 1,500,000. Then since his unit also put out
        negative EM energy, and with high gain that makes antigravity
        possible, I designed the antigravity experiment for <br>
        him, and gave it to him. At the time, I was very busy with my
        aerospace job at Computer Sciences Corporation, and could not
        travel again to California for some weeks. Hence <br>
        Sweet built the necessary output unit and set up and performed
        the experiment there in California with me on the phone with
        him, here from Alabama. He read off the <br>
        measurements there on the bench, and I wrote them down here in
        Huntsville. </p>
      <p>I later included these results in a joint paper, putting
        Sweet's name first which was proper, since he was the inventor,
        not me. The paper is Floyd Sweet and T. E. Bearden, "Utilizing <br>
        Scalar Electromagnetics to Tap Vacuum Energy," Proc. 26th
        Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC
        '91), Boston, Massachusetts, 1991, p. <br>
        370-375 </p>
      <p>Contrary to your disinformation, the magnets were indeed barium
        ferrite magnets -- the old audio kind which were quite common in
        surplus shops at the time. Again, ask John Bedini. </p>
      <p>And for your information, I personally took a Sweet-activated
        barium ferrite magnet, placed a shim stock on it, and watched
        the shim stock oscillate continuously to and fro for <br>
        an hour, fanning air and doing free work all the time. I then
        locked the self-oscillating magnet and its waving shim stock fan
        load) in a safe, and took the key with me. 24 hours <br>
        later, when I reopened the safe, there sat the magnet with its
        shim stock still waving and fanning air and doing free work. </p>
      <p>Sweet himself had great difficulty in activating the magnets;
        only about one in 30 had a sufficiently "accurate" and even
        overall field to take and hold activation. He only got to that <br>
        level of success when Walter Rosenthal built for him a device to
        allow much more precision in the activation process, and when he
        initiated a line-scanning process for <br>
        checking the smoothness of the magnet's magnetic field. Too may
        ripples, the material construction was too variable and it would
        not hold activation. Thereafter, he could <br>
        successfully activate one selected from about 30 "scanned"
        magnets, and that one would "hold" the activation for a long
        time (in some cases, a year or two at the least). Most <br>
        unscanned and non-culled magnets would hold it only for a few
        seconds to a few hours as they lost their self-oscillation
        activation. </p>
      <p>You speak lightly of hearsay -- did you ever even meet Sweet,
        or Bedini? Or me either, for that matter? Did you meet Walter
        Rosenthal, who built Sweet's activation circuit and <br>
        system for him, and who measured and examined several Sweet VTA
        systems, including the last one that was self-powering (closed
        clamped positive feedback loop system)? I <br>
        never saw the closed-loop self-powering Sweet system. </p>
      <p>To my knowledge, the answer is no, you were not there, know
        nothing about what happened or what was done, and are just
        "spouting off". So everything you have uttered is <br>
        the rankest hearsay, and in fact much of it is a flat lie. </p>
      <p>Since you seem to want to pose as a fount of all knowledge,
        then please explain precisely how Sweet was able to trick the
        negative binding energy of the barium nucleus in his <br>
        barium ferrite magnets into long-lasting self-oscillation. The
        powerful negative energy binding forces in the nucleus are one
        of the few places one can get gains (COPs) on the <br>
        order of 1,500,000. Once you have the original gain stably,
        however, it is fairly straightforward to increase it further if
        you are dealing with negative energy. I personally <br>
        activated several sets of magnets in Sweet's lab when working
        with Sweet, but I also never knew the FULL activation secret
        which he kept very, very secret. </p>
      <p>One can produce negative energy in several ways;
        self-oscillation of the barium nucleus' negative binding energy
        is one. Sharp gradients (as used for nearly 20 years by Bedini
        in <br>
        his battery chargers and other circuits) are another; the sharp
        gradient suddenly lifts normal electrons from the Dirac Sea,
        resulting in a sudden spurt of normal electron current (usually
        <br>
        called the Lenz law effect). But accompanying it is the sudden
        spurt of currents of"Dirac Sea holes" in the opposite direction.
        And while they exist, those holes are pouring out <br>
        negative EM energy. The longer they exist before swallowing up
        an electron, the more negative EM energy they freely emit. </p>
      <p>And a Dirac Sea hole is not a positron (that was a trick by the
        conventional physics community to get rid of negative energy
        arbitrarily). The Dirac Sea hole is actually a <br>
        negative mass-energy electron. And as a source charge, it
        produces negative energy EM fields -- i.e., fields whose photons
        are of negative angular momentum, that is, they have <br>
        (-delta E)x(t), rather than (+delta E)x(t). </p>
      <p>Please go and read some of Dr. Dan Solomon's papers, since his
        group has now strongly pointed out that it was an error and a
        mistake to arbitrarily eliminate negative energy from <br>
        the Dirac Sea theory. Particularly see Dan Solomon, "Some new
        results concerning the vacuum in Dirac's hole theory," Physica
        Scripta, Vol. 74, 2006, p. 117-122. He has <br>
        several other key papers on the subject also. </p>
      <p>Here's a quote from Dotson, dealing with the issue of the
        arbitrary exclusion of negative energy. Quoting: </p>
      <p>"I think if one had to point to a single place where science
        went profoundly and permanently off the track, it would be 1934
        and the emasculation of Dirac's equation." . <br>
        "Dirac's wave equation is a relativistic generalization of the
        Schrodinger wave equation. In 934 this brilliantly successful
        equation was shorn of half of its solutions by a questionable <br>
        bit of mathematical slight-of-hand. Because it was 'politically
        correct,' this bit of juggling became the accepted
        interpretation. However, recent developments have shown the very
        <br>
        basis of this mathematical trick to be invalid." "Dirac's
        complete equation, however, describes a quantum spinor field,
        which has as solutions four different kinds of electrons: <br>
        electrons and positrons of positive energy, and electrons and
        positrons of negative energy." [D. L. Hotson, "Dirac's Equation
        and the Sea of Negative Energy, Part I, New Energy, <br>
        Issue 43, 2002, pp. 1-20.] </p>
      <p>Indeed, Dirac got his positron with a sleight of hand bit of
        trickery. The "hole" itself has negative mass energy. If the
        hole (altered vacuum) movesaway and is replaced by a filled <br>
        hole (normal vacuum), the CHANGE that will be observed is
        positive -- in short, a positron change. That is not the hole at
        all, but is the change resulting from the replacement <br>
        of the empty hole by a filled hole. The (-1) negative energy of
        the hole increased by (+1) to get back to (0) (a filled hole).
        Identifying the (-1) hole as a (+1)replacement by a filled <br>
        hole falsely assumes that 0 - 1 = +1, a violation of simple
        arithmetic. </p>
      <p>Quoting Dirac (who hated negative energy) himself, where E =
        energy: </p>
      <p>"One gets over the difficulty on the classical theory by
        arbitrarily excluding those solutions that have a negative E.
        One cannot do this in the quantum theory, since in general a <br>
        perturbation will cause transitions from states with E positive
        to states with E negative." [Dirac, Proceedings of the Royal
        Society A, Vol. 117, p. 610.] </p>
      <p>Not only Dirac, but most other scientists also hated negative
        energy, and so they were determined to get rid of it at whatever
        costs. </p>
      <p>Quoting Farmelo: </p>
      <p>"Dirac. proposed that, if a negative-energy electron were for
        some reason 'displaced', experimenters should be able to observe
        it as a positive-energy particle with a positive <br>
        charge. (The empty space will have become less negative, and
        therefore more positive.) At first, he identified these holes as
        protons, but by 1931 he had changed his mind and come <br>
        to a much more radical conclusion: 'A hole, if there was one,
        would be a new kind of elementary particle, unknown to
        experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite <br>
        charge to the electron.' ". [Graham Farmelo, "Pipped to the
        positron," New Scientist, 10 Aug. 2002, p. 48-49. Quote is from
        p. 48.] </p>
      <p>In other words, if you FILL the hole, the filling process will
        appear to be a positron appearance. But a FILLED hole and an
        empty hole are not at all the same thing, and <br>
        assuming they are is a false assumption. </p>
      <p>I will tell you that most of this stuff with negative energy
        (and also antigravity) is also "old hat" for several decades now
        to several nations who have developed and deployed (in great
        secrecy) negative energy EMP weapons among other things. The
        Russian scientists <br>
        have known all about negative energy since shortly after WW II,
        and they are probably the most knowledgeable in it today as
        well. </p>
      <p>Several persons have been able to activate barium ferrite
        magnets where the activation lasted for several hours or in a
        few cases even six weeks. While activated, they had the
        successful mechanism of a Sweet VTA operating. But so far as I'm
        aware, no one else (at <br>
        least in the open community) except Sweet has been able to get
        extremely long and enduring activation (self-oscillation of the
        negative binding energy of the barium nucleus). </p>

      <p>No Problem! </p>
      <p>John is telling it like it happened. He actually got Sparky
        started, and helped him immensely -- with work, parts, and even
        protection. All completely true. And John did <br>
        save Sparky's life, just as he stated. And John is indeed the
        one who introduced me to Sparky, and arranged for me to meet him
        and work with him as I could. </p>
      <p>In my opinion, John Bedini is the only man living who really
        knows exactly how Sparky activated his magnets. And who can
        probably do it. And the "backers" and other folks <br>
        who cluttered around Sparky were responsible for excluding
        Bedini, because in their view John knew exactly how the beast
        worked and how to make it. </p>
      <p>John Bedini has forgotten more crucial knowledge of strange
        circuits and overunity power systems than most people will know
        in ten lifetimes. And he's simply the best there is out <br>
        there, to my knowledge and in my opinion. I do expect to see
        working Bedini units on the market soon, and am looking forward
        to it with great hopes. John just may be the man <br>
        who saves the U.S. from a catastrophic economic collapse over
        the escalating oil crisis and energy problem. </p>
      <p>Best wishes, </p>
