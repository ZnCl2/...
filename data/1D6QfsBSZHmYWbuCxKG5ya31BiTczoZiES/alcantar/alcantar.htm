      FORGET expensive machinery, the best way to purify water could be
      hiding in a cactus. It turns out that an extract from the prickly
      pear cactus is effective at removing sediment and bacteria from
      dirty water.<br>
      <br>
      Many water purification methods introduced into the developing
      world are quickly abandoned as people don't know how to use and
      maintain them, says Norma Alcantar at the University of South
      Florida in Tampa. So she and her colleagues decided to investigate
      the prickly pear cactus, Opuntia ficus-indica, which 19th-century
      Mexican communities used as a water purifier. The cactus is found
      across the globe.<br>
      <br>
      The team extracted the cactus's mucilage - the thick gum the plant
      uses to store water. They then mixed this with water to which they
      had added high levels of either sediment or the bacterium Bacillus
      cereus.<br>
      <br>
      Alcantar found that the mucilage acted as a flocculant, causing
      the sediment particles to join together and settle to the bottom
      of the water samples. The gum also caused the bacteria to combine
      and settle, allowing 98 per cent of bacteria to be filtered from
      the water (Environmental Science and Technology, DOI:
      10.1021/es9030744). They now intend to test it on natural water.<br>
      <br>
      Householders in the developing world could boil a slice of cactus
      to release the mucilage and add it to water in need of
      purification, says Alcantar. "The cactus's prevalence,
      affordability and cultural acceptance make it an attractive
      natural material for water purification technologies."<br>
      <br>
      But Colin Horwitz of GreenOx Catalysts in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania, says many issues remain, including how much land and
      water is needed to grow cacti for widespread water purification,
      and how households will know all the bacteria have been removed.<br>

      Arsenic is a poisonous metalloid which, because of its hydroscopic
      nature, is primarily transported through water. Most plant
      species, including the nopal cactus, produce a sticky substance
      called mucilage. Mucilage swells in water but is insoluble and can
      precipitate ions, bacteria and particles from aqueous solutions.
      The invention includes a method of separating particulates and
      heavy metals such as arsenic (As) from drinking water using
      natural flocculants obtained from cactus mucilage. The extraction
      techniques and the methodology for using the cactus mucilage
      obtain higher As removal than conventional methods, like aluminum
      sulfate precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><br>
      This invention relates to field water purification. Specifically,
      a water purification method using plant mucilage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      Arsenic is a metalloid with similar properties to phosphorus.
      Arsenic oxidizes to form hygroscopic, colorless, odorless As2O3
      and As2O5. The principal means of arsenic dispersion through
      nature is via water, and varies from locations based on soil and
      arsenic forms.<br>
      <br>
      Arsenic has been attributed to changes in respiratory,
      gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, and cardiovascular systems.
      Because of the similarities between arsenic and phosphorus,
      arsenic can substitute in place of phosphorus in some biological
      reactions, making it poisonous. Particularly, consumption of
      arsenic-contaminated water may enter the metabolic citric cycle,
      inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase and preventing ATP production.
      Arsenic poisoning is cumulative and symptoms include nausea,
      vomiting, stomach aches, diarrhea, and delirium. Ingested arsenic
      is deposited into fingernails and skin Further, arsenic can remain
      in hair follicles for years following the arsenic exposure.<br>
      <br>
      Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have experienced a massive epidemic
      from arsenic groundwater contamination. 35 million people are
      believed to be consuming water with at least 50 [mu]g/L, and 57
      million people drinking water with at least 10 [mu]g/L of arsenic.
      Nongovernmental organizations entered the region and established
      tube wells to collect groundwater and prevent the indigenous
      populations from using bacteria-contaminated surface water. Over 8
      million wells were built since the program began in the 1970s.
      Roughly one quarter of Bangladesh's population now rely on water
      collected from tube-wells for drinking. However, testing has
      revealed one in five of the tube wells are contaminated by water
      containing ten to fifty times the arsenic levels considered safe
      by the World Health Organization.<br>
      <br>
      Most plant species produce an exopolysaccharide, a polymer of
      mono- and polysaccharides and proteins bonded by glycosidic bonds,
      referred to as mucilage. Plants secrete the substance to slow
      water loss, aid germination, and store food.<br>
      <br>
      The<b> tuna cactus (Opuntia ficus indica)</b> mucilage produced by
      the flattened pads of this cactus was of particular interest. It
      can easily be recognized by its green, thick long pads, one linked
      to the next. The nopal plants are very inexpensive to cultivate
      and edible. Nopal pads are formed of complex carbohydrates that
      have the ability to store and retain water, allowing these plants
      to survive in extremely arid environments. Nopal mucilage is a
      neutral mixture of approximately 55 high-molecular weight sugar
      residues composed basically of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose,
      xylose, and galacturonic acid and has the capacity to interact
      with metals, cations and biological substances.<br>
      <br>
      Mucilage is used in producing agar and used as an adhesive
      Importantly, mucilage swells in water but is insoluble. As such,
      the substance has the potential to precipitate ions, bacteria and
      particles from aqueous solutions. Further, the material has unique
      surface active characteristics, making it an ideal candidate for
      enhancing dispersion properties, creating emulsifications, and
      reducing surface tension of high polarity liquids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><br>
      The invention includes a method of separating particulates and
      heavy metals such as arsenic (As) from drinking water using
      natural flocculants obtained from cactus (i.e. cactus mucilage).
      The extraction techniques and the methodology for using the cactus
      mucilage obtain higher As removal than previous methods. The use
      of low cost flocculants can be implemented in low income
      communities or third world countries with drinking water
      deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      A gelling extract (GE), a nongelling extract (NE), and a combined
      extract (CE) of mucilage from the cactus were collected and used
      individually as flocculent to remove contaminants that reduce
      water potability.<br>
      <br>
      Cylinder tests using kaolin slurry show mucilage is a better
      flocculent of suspended solids than Al2(SO4)3. The same dosage of
      mucilage precipitates the same amount of particulate, in one third
      the time, as does Al2(SO4)3. Additionally, small doses of mucilage
      provided fast settling rates and clear supernatant.<br>
      <br>
      The effective concentration of gelling extract mucilage was found
      to be 4 mg/L. This concentration precipitated most of the slurry
      within 10 minutes, twice as fast as the next quickest
      concentration, 3 mg/l; showing the gelling extract was most
      effective at higher concentrations. The non-gelling mucilage
      extract was less affected by concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Flocculation studies using the standard jar test and kaolin slurry
      solutions were performed on the three extracts. At lower
      concentrations, the combined mucilage extract mirrors the residual
      turbidity characteristics of aluminum sulfate, where higher
      concentrations of aluminum sulfate are more effective at reducing
      the residual turbidity of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      The capacity of the gelling mucilage extract to remove arsenic
      from contaminated water at low concentration dosing was determined
      by adding gelling mucilage extract to a contaminated water column.
      The top layer of the water column was removed at set intervals.
      The mucilage facilitates removal of arsenic by transporting
      arsenic to the water-air interface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For a fuller understanding of the invention, reference should be
      made to the following detailed description, taken in connection
      with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a graph comparing flocculation rates at 3 mg/L
      flocculent dosages. A kaolin solution was used at a concentration
      of 50 g/L, to mimic contaminated water containing a high
      concentration of particles. The flocculation characteristics of
      mucilage were tested with a total mucilage extract (3 ppm), a
      gelling extract harvested with the mucilage (3 ppm), or a
      non-gelling extract harvested with the mucilage (3 ppm). A
      commercial flocculent (3 ppm Al2(SO4)3) and negative control
      without flocculent (control) were used to establish a baseline and
      compare the efficiencies of the extracts. The cylinder was capped
      and inverted 10 times to mix and the height of the interface
      between the supernatant and settling solids was measured. The
      gelling extract performed the best.<br>

      mucilage, 1.0 mg/L of non-gelling extract mucilage, 2.0 mg/L of
      non-gelling extract mucilage, 3.0 mg/L of non-gelling extract
      mucilage, 4.0 mg/L of non-gelling extract mucilage, or a negative
      control without flocculent. The cylinder was capped and inverted
      10 times to mix and placed on a horizontal surface. The height of
      the interface between the supernatant and settling solids was
      measured.<br>
      <br>

      rate of sedimentation calculated.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a graph showing the efficiency of the combined extract
      with increasing dosages. A 50 g/L of kaolin clay slurry were
      placed into a 100 mL cylinder. Flocculent was added to the slurry
      as either 0.01 ppm of non-gelling extract mucilage, 0.1 ppm of
      non-gelling extract mucilage, 1.0 ppm of non-gelling extract
      mucilage, 2.0 ppm of non-gelling extract mucilage, 3.0 ppm of

      measured and the rate of sedimentation calculated.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 is a graph showing the mucilage efficiency at reducing
      residual turbidity at very low doses-comparable with aluminum
      sulfate. Standard jar test for flocculent sedimentation. 0.5 g/L
      kaolin clay slurry was added to a test jar. The solution was
      stirred at 100 rpm and varying amounts of identified flocculent
      were added. After 2 minutes, the speed was reduced to 20 rpm for 5
      minutes, and mixing was stopped. The solution was allowed to
      settle for 30 minutes, and turbidity tests were performed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a graph showing the mucilage's departure from the
      efficiency of aluminum sulfate at higher doses. However, secondary
      filtration can be used to reduce the residual turbidity. Standard
      jar test for flocculent sedimentation. 0.5 g/L kaolin clay slurry
      was added to a test jar. The solution was stirred at 100 rpm and
      varying amounts of identified flocculent were added. After 2
      minutes, the speed was reduced to 20 rpm for 5 minutes, and then
      mixing was stopped. The solution was allowed to settle for 30
      minutes, and turbidity tests were performed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a graph showing mucilage efficiency at reducing residual
      turbidity at higher dosages. Standard jar test for flocculent
      sedimentation. 0.5 g/L kaolin clay slurry was added to a test jar.
      The solution was stirred at 100 rpm and varying amounts of
      identified flocculent were added. After 2 minutes, the speed was
      reduced to 20 rpm for 5 minutes, and then mixing was stopped. The
      solution was allowed to settle for 30 minutes, and turbidity tests
      were performed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a graph showing water column arsenic levels after
      gelling extract mucilage treatment. Arsenic was dissolved in water
      at 290 [mu]g/L. 30 ppm of gelling extract was added to the arsenic
      solution. After addition of the mucilage the appearance of solid
      metallic like particles was observed. After 30 minutes the
      particles settled to the bottom, embedded in the mucilage gel. A
      sample was analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a graph showing water column arsenic distribution. 86
      ppb arsenic was added to a 300 mL water column. The water was
      dosed with 5 ppm gelling mucilage extract. 36 hours later, 20 mL
      samples were taken from the top, middle, and bottom of the water
      column and analyzed for arsenic concentrations. An arsenic
      concentration profile was established.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 is a graph showing that the make-up method improves the
      mucilage efficiency at reducing As concentration in a water
      column. 5 ppm gelling mucilage extract was added to a 300 mL water
      column, contaminated with 83.65 ppb of arsenic. The concentration
      of the gelling extract was maintained by removing the top 2% of
      the water column at 30 minute intervals and replacing the removed
      water with a 5 ppm gelling extract/water solution. Spent mucilage
      transports arsenic to the water-air interface, where the arsenic
      is removed every 30 minutes and replaced with new, active
      mucilage.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the following detailed description of the preferred
      embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which
      form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of
      illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be
      practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be
      utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from
      the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The invention includes a process for the removal of suspended
      solids and/or arsenic from drinking water using a natural-based
      flocculent, such as that derived from Opuntia ficus indica, or
      nopal, cactus. Three types of mucilage extract from the cactus are
      obtained (a gelling extract (GE), a nongelling extract (NE), and a
      combined extract (CE)) and are used individually as a flocculent
      for the removal of harmful contaminants that reduce the potability
      of water. The process steps are (a) cactus pad maceration, (b)
      chosen mucilage fraction extraction, (c) aqueous dissolution of
      the solid extract, (d) contaminated water dosing, (e)
      flocculation, and (f) supernatant decantation.<br>
      <br>
      Three types of mucilage were extracted: a gelling extract (GE) and
      a non-gelling extract (NE) were obtained, and a combined version
      (CE) consisting of GE &amp; NE. Cactus plants were purchased from
      Living Stones Nursery, Tucson, Ariz. All mucilage types extracted
      were stored dry and at room temperature. For the extraction of NE
      and GE, cactus pads were cleaned and boiled in milli Q water until
      they became tender (approximately 20 minutes). The soft pads were
      then liquefied in a blender. The pH of the resulting suspension
      was then neutralized and the solids and liquid supernatant were
      separated in a centrifuge at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was
      collected, mixed with 1M-NaCl solution (10:1 ratio), filtered and
      precipitated with 1:2 ratio of pulp to acetone to produce the NE
      extract. The acetone was then decanted and the precipitate washed
      with a 1:1 volume ratio of precipitate to isopropanol. The
      resulting NE precipitate was air dried on a watch glass at room
      temperature. In order to separate the gelling portion, the
      centrifuged precipitates were mixed with 50 mL of 50 mM NaOH. The
      suspension was stirred for 10 min and the pH adjusted with HCl to
      2. The suspension was centrifuged and the solids again resuspended
      in water while the pH was adjusted to 8 with NaOH. The suspension
      was then filtered and the solids were washed following the same
      procedure as for the NE extract. For the combined extract, the
      initial blend was centrifuged and the supernatant was separated
      and pH adjusted to 8 with NaOH, washed with acetone and
      isopropanol as described above and finally it was air-dried. On
      average, for each pad that weighs around 300 g wet weight, a 1.5-2
      g dry powder is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      A series of cylinder tests were performed, shown in FIGS. 1
      through 6, to determine the flocculating efficiency of the three
      different varieties of mucilage produced the inventors. A kaolin
      slurry of 50 g/l was poured into a stoppered 100 ml cylinder, 3
      ppm of mucilage flocculent solution or control was added, the
      cylinder was capped and inverted completely 10 times for total
      mixing of the contents, the cylinder was then placed on a
      horizontal surface and the height of the interface between the
      supernatant and the settling solids were recorded with time.<br>
      <br>
      The flocculation efficiency was tested, analyzing the three
      mucilage extracts against a positive control (Al2(SO4)3) or a
      negative control (without flocculent). The flocculants were added
      at 3 ppm to the slurry and analyzed as described above. FIG. 1
      shows the mucilage is an excellent flocculent of suspended solids
      compared to Al2(SO4)3. Comparing the same dosage of mucilage and
      Al2(SO4)3, the mucilage settled the same amount of particulate
      matter in 3.6 minutes as Al2(SO4)3 did in 10 minutes. Further,
      smaller dosages of mucilage provided faster settling rates and the
      clearest supernatant. The mucilage was also found to reduce
      arsenic concentrations by 50% after 36 hours at low dosages.<br>
      <br>
      The effective concentration and precipitation rates were
      determined for gelling extract (GE). The gelling extract was added
      to a 50 g/L kaolin slurry, described above, at 0.01 mg/L, 0.1
      mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, 3 mg/L, and 4 mg/L. 4 mg/L of gelling
      extract mucilage precipitated most of the slurry within 10
      minutes, whereas 3 mg/L required 20 minutes to precipitate the
      same amount of clay slurry, seen in FIG. 2. However, the
      precipitation rates from 0.01 mg/L to 3 mg/L were significantly
      closer, the 0.01 mg/L mucilage extract requiring about 5 minutes
      more than the 3 mg/L extract, and 15 minutes more than the 4 mg/L
      extract, to precipitate the same amount of slurry. Thus, the
      gelling extract was most effective at a very higher concentration,
      but the extract concentration did not drastically affect the
      precipitation rates from low to mid level extract concentrations.
      The difference between concentrations is more pronounced from 1
      minute to 4 minutes after addition of the flocculent to a colloid
      solution, as depicted in FIG. 3. 4 mg/l gelling mucilage extract
      precipitated the slurry much quicker than any other concentration,
      reducing the level of slurry about 8.5 cm in three minutes. The
      next most effective concentration, 3 mg/l, reduced the slurry 6 cm
      in the same time. Lower concentrations had less effect on the
      level of the slurry, reducing the slurry level about 3 cm during
      the three minute period.<br>
      <br>
      The non-gelling mucilage extract (NE) was then tested to determine
      the effective dose. Nongelling extract was added to a 50 g/L
      kaolin slurry, described above, at 0.01 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2
      mg/L, 3 mg/L, and 4 mg/L. Unlike the gelling extract, the
      non-gelling extract is less affected by concentration, as seen in
      FIG. 4. Between 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L, the nongelling extract reduces
      the slurry by approximately 12 cm in 20 minutes. However, lesser
      nongelling extract concentrations, between 0.01 mg/L and 2 mg/L,
      reduce the slurry level by 10 cm in the same time and require
      about 30 minutes to reduce the slurry level by 12 cm. Further, the
      lower concentrations precipitate the slurry at the same rate as
      the negative control. The precipitation rates are seen more
      dramatically between 2 and 13 minutes, shown in FIG. 5. The 5 mg/L
      extract precipitates the slurry most rapidly, removing about 6 cm
      in 5 minutes. The nongelling extract exhibited similar
      precipitation rates from 2 mg/L to 4 mg/L, removing from 4.25 to 5
      cm of slurry in 5 minutes. At lesser concentrations, from 0.01
      mg/L to 1 mg/L, the nongelling extract precipitates the slurry at
      the same rate as the negative control, about 3 cm in 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The combined extract (CE) exhibited similar precipitation
      properties to the nongelling extract. The combined extract was
      added to a 50 g/L kaolin slurry, described above, at 0.01 mg/L,
      0.1 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, 3 mg/L, and 4 mg/L. High concentrations
      of the combined extracts, between 2 ppm and 5 ppm, precipitate
      about 11 cm of slurry in 10 minutes and 12 cm in 20 minutes, seen
      in FIG. 6. Lower concentrations of the combined extract required
      20 minutes to precipitate the slurry 10 cm, approximately
      precipitating the slurry at the same rate as the control.<br>
      <br>
      Flocculation studies were conducted using the standard jar test,
      where previously prepared kaolin solutions at 0.5 g/l were poured
      into the jars of the jar test apparatus, then stirring at 100 rpm
      was started and different quantities of the flocculent solutions
      were added to each jar always leaving one without flocculent added
      to serve as a control. The contents were stirred for 2 minutes and
      then the speed was reduced speed to 20 rpm for 5 minutes. After
      this, agitation was stopped and the contents were allowed to
      settle for 30 minutes before collecting a sample and measuring its
      turbidity. At lower concentrations, the combined mucilage extract
      mirrors the residual turbidity characteristics of aluminum
      sulfate, as shown in FIG. 7. Higher concentrations of aluminum
      sulfate are more effective at reducing the residual turbidity of
      the solution, shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. However, secondary
      filtration may be used to remove residual particulates, if
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      The capacity of the gelling mucilage extract to reduce arsenic
      from water was then determined. A 290 ng/L arsenic solution was
      dosed with 30 ppm of gelling mucilage extract. After the gelling
      mucilage extract was added, solid metallic-like particles were
      observed forming in the solution. After 30 minutes the particles
      settled to the bottom, embedded in the mucilage gel. A sample of
      the solution was analyzed, as seen in FIG. 10. The mucilage
      flocculent treatment yielded a reduction of approximately 11% of
      the As of the original solution, compared to about 50% for the
      control, proving the interaction between the gelling extract and
      As.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the action of the mucilage when removing Arsenic, 86
      ppb of arsenic was added to a 300 ml water column The water was
      dosed with 5 ppm gelling mucilage extract. After 36 hours, a 20 ml
      sample from the top, middle, and bottom of the water column were
      taken and analyzed for arsenic concentration. The arsenic
      concentration profile was determined, shown in FIG. 11. Water
      taken from the middle of the water column had steady
      concentrations of arsenic, whereas the top and bottom of the water
      column had fluctuating arsenic concentrations. Arsenic
      concentrations in the combined water column were lowest at 1.5
      hours, and began to rise again at 2 hours, indicating the mucilage
      was saturated and the treatment allowed arsenic to redissolve.
      However, arsenic concentrations did go down over time.<br>
      <br>
      The capacity of the gelling mucilage extract to remove arsenic
      from contaminated water at low concentration dosing was determined
      using the make-up. A concentration of 5 ppm gelling mucilage
      extract was established in a water column The top 2% of the water
      column was removed at 30 minute intervals and the water column
      volume restored to the original amount by adding a 5 ppm gelling
      mucilage extract/water solution to the contaminated water column
      Spent mucilage transports arsenic to the water-air interface where
      it is removed. The mucilage thus facilitates the removal of
      arsenic, as seen in FIG. 12.<br>
