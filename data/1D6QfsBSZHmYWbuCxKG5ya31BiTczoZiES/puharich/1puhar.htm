          reportedly drove his motor home for hundreds of thousands of

            is hardly necessary to weigh the value of the World Energy
            bank account for any sophisticated person, these days. It is
            grim. The oil reserves will dwindle away in a score of years
            or so, and the coal reserves will be gone in some twelve
            score years. ( Ref. 1)</font> </p>

is



            this magical fuel, and why is it not being used? The fuel is
            water. It can be used in its fresh water form. It can be
            used in its salt water form. It can be used in its brackish
            form. It can be used in its snow and ice form. When such
            water is decomposed by electrolytic fission into hydrogen
            and oxygen gases, it becomes a high energy fuel with three
            times the energy output which is available from an
            equivalent weight of high grade gasoline.</font> </p>

why



            is water not being used as a fuel? The answer is simple. It
            costs too much with existing technology to convert water
            into gases hydrogen and oxygen. The basic cycle of using
            water for fuel is described in the following two equations,
            familiar to every high school student of Chemistry:</font> </p>

            that 302.375 Btu of energy (heat or electricity) will be
            released when the gases, hydrogen and oxygen, combine. The
            end product (the exhaust) from this reaction is water. Note
            that more energy (under ideal conditions) is released from
            combining the gases than is used to free them from water. It
            is know that under ideal conditions it is possible to get
            some 20% more energy out of reaction (2) above, then it
            takes to produce the gases of reaction (1) above. Therefore,
            if reaction (1) could be carried out at 100% efficiency, the
            release of energy from reaction (2) in an optimally
            efficient engine (such as a low temperature fuel cell),
            there would be a net energy profit which would make the use
            of water as a fuel an economically feasible source of energy

cost



            of producing hydrogen is directly related to the cost of
            producing electricity. Hydrogen as produced today is
            generally a byproduct of off-peak-hour electrical production
            in either nuclear or hydroelectric plants. The electricity
            thus produced is the cheapest way of making hydrogen. We can
            compare the cost of production of electricity and the cost
            of producing hydrogen. The following table is adapted from

            now portray the complex electromagnetic wave as the

            the water molecule is in the protons of the vectors, i (H<sub>1</sub>)

            cycling of the amplitude of the carrier frequency and its

            up a rotation moment of the proton magnetic moment which one
            can clearly see on the XY plot of an oscilloscope, as an
            hysteresis loop figure. However, it is noted that this
            hysteresis loop does not appear in the liquid water sample
            until all the parameters of the three components have been
            adjusted to the configuration which is the novel basis of

            however is achieved through control of two other factors.
            The first is the molal concentration of salt in the water.
            This is controlled by measuring the conductivity of the
            water through the built in current meter of Component I.
            There is maintained an idea ratio of current to voltage I/E
            = 0.01870 which is an index to the optimum salt
            concentration of 0.1540 Molal.</font> </p>

            factor which helps to hold the resonant which helps to hold
            the resonant frequency at 600 Hz is the gap distance of Y,

            distance will vary depending on the size scale of Component

            optimal distance when the voltage reads between 2.30 (rms)
            volts, at resonance F<sub>o</sub>, and at molal
            concentration, 0.1540. The molal concentration of the water

amplitude



            modulation of the carrier gives rise to side bands in the
            power spectrum of the carrier frequency distribution. It is
            these side bands which give rise to an acoustic vibration of
            the liquid water, and it is believed to the tetrahedral
            water molecule. The importance of the phonon effect --- the
            acoustic vibration of water in electrolysis --- was
            discovered in a roundabout way. Research work with Component
            I had earlier established that it could be used for the
            electro-stimulation of hearing in humans. When the output of
            Component I is comprised of flat circular metal plates
            applied to the head of normal hearing humans, it was found
            that they could hear pure tones and speech. Simultaneously,
            acoustic vibration could also be heard by an outside
            observer with a stethoscope placed near one of the
            electrodes on the skin. It was observed that the absolute
            threshold of hearing could be obtained at 0.16 mW (rms), and
            by calculation that there was an amplitude of displacement
            of the eardrum of the order of 10<sup>-11</sup> and a
            corresponding amplitude of the cochlear basilar membrane of
            10<sup>-13</sup> meter. Corollary to this finding. I was
            able to achieve the absolute reversible threshold of
            electrolysis at a power level of 0.16 mW (rms). By carrying
            out new calculations I was able to show that the water was
            being vibrated with a displacement of the order of 1
            Angstrom ( = 10<sup>-10</sup> meters). This displacement is
            of the order of the diameter of the hydrogen atom.</font> </p>

it

now



            turn to the measurement problem with respect to efficiency
            of electrolysis. There are four means that can be used to
            measure the reactant product of water electrolysis . For
            simple volume measurements one can use a precision
            nitrometer such as the Pregl type. For both volume and
            quantitative analysis one can use the gas chromatography
            with thermal conductivity detector. For a continuous flow
            analysis of both volume and gas species the mass
            spectrometer is very useful. For pure thermodynamic
            measurements the calorimeter is useful. In our measurements,
            all four methods were examined, and it was found that the
            mass spectrometer gave the most flexibility and the greatest
            precision. In the next section we will describe our
            measurement using the mass spectrometer.</font> </p>

            to properly couple Component II to a mass spectrometer one
            requires a special housing around Component II that it will
            capture the gases produced and permit these to to be drawn
            under low vacuum into the mass spectometer. Therefore a
            stainless steel and glass chamber was built to contain
            Component II, and provision made to couple it directly
            through a CO<sub>2</sub> watertrap to the mass spectrometer
            with the appropriate stainless steel tubing. This chamber is
            designated as Component IV. Both the mass spectrometer and
            Component IV were purged with helium and evacuated for a two
            hour period before any gas samples were drawn. In this way
            contamination was minimized. The definitive measurement were

            describe the use of Component I and how its energy <u>output</u>
            to Component II is measured. The energy output of Component
            I is an amplitude modulated alternating current looking into
            a highly non-linear load, i.e., the water solution.
            Component I is so designed that at peak load it is in
            resonance across the system --- Components I, II, and III
            --- and the vector diagrams show that the capacitive
            reactance, and the inductance reactance are almost exactly
            180° out of phase, so that the net power output is reactive
            (the dissipative power is very small). This design ensures
            minimum power lossses across the entire output system. In
            the experiments to be described, the entire emphasis is
            placed on achieving the maximum gas yield (credit) in
            exchange for the minimum applied electrical energy.</font> </p>

            precise way to measure the applied energy from Component I
            to Component II and Component III is to measure the power,
            P, in watts, W. Ideally this should be done with a precision
            wattmeter. But since we were interested in following the
            voltage and current separately, it was decided not to use
            the watt meter. Separate meters were used to continuously

            instruments were used to take these two measurements. A

          Seawater - or even dirty rainwater - could be transmuted into
          fuel through a new technique serendipitously discovered by a
          researcher in medical electronics.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Andrija Puharich has found a way to split water molecules
          by tuning in on the vibrations of their atoms and breaking the
          molecules into hydrogen, which could become fuel, and oxygen.<br>
          <br>
          Alternating-current impulses augment naturally occurring
          vibrations in the H2O molecules. By boosting the vibrations
          out of control, Puharich makes the molecules fly apart into
          the component atoms.<br>
          <br>
          He likens the water-splitting effect to the way soldiers
          marching in step across a bridge risk damaging the structure
          by making it vibrate at a critical, stress-producing rate.<br>
          <br>
          Electrolysis by simple direct current would create hydrogen
          and oxygen with a net energy efficiency of only 54 percent,
          according to Puharich, a Virginia-based inventor. But he says
          his alternating-current system reaches better than 90 per cent
          efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          A former physician, Puharich discovered the water-splitting
          technique a dozen years ago but has only recently presented
          his findings publicly.<br>
          <br>
          Originally, he was investigating the DISRUPTIVE EFFECT of
          electrical resonances on blood clots and noticed a peculiar
          thing: in dilute blood, a SPECIFIC FREQUENCY made bubbles
          appear in the liquid.<br>
          <br>
          Lab analysis showed that the bubbles were composed of oxygen
          and hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          A barrel-shaped cavity contains the water in Puharich's
          recentlyrefined system. He introduces alternating current at A
          KEY FREQUENCY of 600 cycles per second.<br>
          <br>
          The cavity resonates with the impulses in somewhat the same
          way the body of a violin resonates with the sound of one
          string, ADDING HIGHER AND LOWER HARMONICS TO THE PRINCIPAL
          TONE.<br>
          <br>
          The additional harmonics, Puharich says, cause the proton in
          the hydrogen atom TO ROTATE, further forcing the hydrogen to
          split from the oxygen.<br>
          <br>
          Puharich suggests that the splitting energy could be provided
          by solar or wind generators. The hydrogen could then be stored
          and used conveniently in fuel cells or hydrogen-powered cars.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Vangard notes...<br>
          <br>
          This paper is quite astounding in that it correlates with
          Keelys' claim that water can be progressively dissociated at
          620, 630 and 12,000 cycles per second. These are on the
          molecular, atomic and etheric levels respectively.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting that the etheric level of 12,000 / 20 = 600
          (Puharich's frequency) found by original experimentation. This
          600 cps frequency is therefore a harmonic of the 12,000 cps
          frequency which Puharich discovered.<br>
          <br>
          Keely also claims that the disruption of water occurs at
          42,800 cycles per second.<br>
          <br>
          The direct quote from the book "Keely and His Discoveries" by
          Bloomfield Moore, published in 1893 ;<br>
          <br>
          "The orders of intensification for accelerating dissociation
          would not be understood by any explanations that could be
          made, if unaccompanied by the demonstrations witnessed by the
          late Professor Leidy, Dr. Brinton, and others.<br>
          <br>
          "When the ether flows from a tube, its negative centre
          represents molecular sub-division carrying interstitially (or
          between its molecules) the lowest order of liberated ozone.<br>
          <br>
          "This is the first order of ozone and its wonderfully
          refreshing and vitalizing to those who breathe it.<br>
          <br>
          "The second order, or atomic separation, releases a much
          higher grade of ozone; in fact, too pure for inhalation, is
          the one that has been (though attended withe much danger to
          the operator) utilized by Keely in his carbon register to
          produce the circuit of high vibration that breaks up the
          molecular magnetism which is recognized as cohesion.<br>
          <br>
          "The acceleration of these orders is governed by the
          introductory impulse on a certain combination of vibratory
          chords, arranged for this purpose in the instrument, with
          which Keely dissociates the elements of water, and which he
          calls a Liberator.<br>
          <br>
          "In molecular dissociation one fork of 620 is used, setting
          the chords on the first octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In atomic separation two forks, one of 620 and one of 630 per
          second; setting the chords on the second octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In the etheric three forks; one of 620, one of 630, and one
          of 12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.<br>
          <br>
          As a matter of further clarification, Keely states that you
          cannot DIRECTLY dissociate a single level of aggregation due
          to the shell structure of matter.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, if you wish to dissociate the Atomic level,
          you must first dissociate the molecular to be able to get to
          the atomic. That follows also if you wish to dissociate the
          etheric, you must disrupt the molecular AND the atomic, THEN
          the etheric.<br>
          <br>
          Keely refers to this technique as progressive dissociation.<br>
          <br>
          In 1988, we had Andrija Puharich in Dallas for about 4 days as
          a joint speaker for Vangard Sciences and MUFON Metroplex. We
          spent many hours with Andrija and discussed a wide variety of
          subjects.<br>
          <br>
          At that time, I asked him about this experiment and he said
          the original research was done in the late 50's, early 60's by
          him in a dual attempt. One was to selectively remove gases
          from the blood and the other to dissolve clots.<br>
          <br>
          Andrija had not heard of Keely or his work with dissociation
          or disruption of matter with acoustic frequencies. He was
          quite interested that the work had been done almost 100 years
          ago and wanted to know more about Keely.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Puharich has dropped out of sight over the last few years,
          so we have lost contact with him. He was at that time (1988)
          very concerned about the ecology and was working on some type
          of retreat for future hard times.<br>
          <br>
          They were re-building an old hydro-electric power system fed
          by a small lake on the land they had in Virginia. Puharich at
          that time was living on land donated by R. J. Reynolds.<br>
          <br>
          We heard recently that Reynolds was attempting to get the land
          back. Since we have not seen or heard from Andrija in about 2
          years, we don't know what is going on with him.<br>
          <br>
          We hope this information is of use in your researches.</p>

            since there are over 300 million cubic miles of water on the
            earth's surface, all of it a potential source of hydrogen
            for use as fuel. In fact, more than 100 years ago Jules
            Verne prophesied that water eventually would be employed as
            a fuel and that the hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it
            would furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light.</font>

has



            been split into its constituent elements of hydrogen and
            oxygen by electrolytic methods, which have been extremely
            inefficient, by thermochemical extraction processes called
            thermochemical water-splitting, which have likewise been
            inefficient and have also been inordinately expensive, and
            by other processes including some employing solar energy. In
            addition, artificial chloroplasts imitating the natural
            process of photosynthesis have been used to separate
            hydrogen from water utilizing complicated membranes and
            sophisticated artificial catalysts. However, these
            artificial chloroplasts have yet to produce hydrogen at an

different



            parts of a molecule are bound together by electrons. One of
            the electron configurations which can exist is the covalent
            bond which is achieved by the sharing of electrons. A
            molecule of hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub> is the smallest
            representative unit of covalent bonding, as can be seen in
            FIG. 4. The molecule of hydrogen gas is formed by the
            overlap and pairing of 1s orbital electrons. A new molecular
            orbit is formed in which the shared electron pair orbits
            both nuclei as shown in FIG. 4. The attraction of the nuclei
            for the shared electrons holds the atoms together in a

            at right angles to each other (see FIG. 4A), a bond angle of

            hybrid orbitals are formed when the excitement of 2s
            electrons results in their promotion from the ground state
            to a state energetically equivalent to the 2p orbitals. The
            new hybrids are termed sp<sup>3</sup> from the combination
            of one s and three p orbitals (See FIG. 4B). Hybrid sp<sup>3</sup>
            orbitals are directed in space from the center of a regular
            tetrahedron toward the four corners. If the orbitals are
            equivalent the bond angle will be 109°28' (See Fig. 15)
            consistent with the geometry of a tetrahedron. In the case
            of water two of the orbitals are occupied by non-bonding
            electrons (See FIG. 4C). There is greater repulsion of these
            lone pair electrons which orbit only one nucleus, compared
            to the repulsion of electrons in bonding orbitals which
            orbit two nuclei. This tends to increase the angle between
            non-bonding orbitals so that it is greater than 109°, which
            pushes the bonding orbitals together, reducing the bond
            angle to 104°. In the case of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub> where
            there is only one lone pair, the repulsion is not so great
            and the bond angle is 107°. Carbon forms typical tetrahedral
            forms and components the simplest being the gas methane, CH<sub>4</sub>
            (See FIGS. 4C and 8). The repulsion of lone pair electrons
            affects charge distribution and contributes to the polarity
            of a covalent bond. (See FIG. 16)</font> </p>

            noted that pure water has a very high dielectric constant

with



            the driver pulsing of Component I at the .tau. constant
            cycle which leads to electrode polarization effects in
            Component II, there is an action on Component III which
            energizes and entrains the water molecule to a higher energy
            level which shifts the bond angle from 104° to the
            tetrahedral form with angle 109°28' as shown in FIGS. 8 and
            15. This electronic pumping action is most important, and
            represents a significant part of the novel method of this
            invention for several reasons. First, the shift to the
            tetrahedral form of water increases the structural stability
            of the water molecule, thereby making it more susceptible to
            breakage at the correct resonant frequency, or frequencies.
            Second, increasing the polarization of the water molecule
            makes the lone pair electrons, S- connected with the oxygen
            molecule more electronegative; and the weakly positive
            hydrogen atoms, S+ more positive. See FIG. 9 and FIG. 22.</font>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As
the



            outer electrode becomes more electronegative, the center
            electrode concomitantly becomes more electropositive as will
            be shown. As the polarity of the water molecule tetrahedron
            increases, a repulsive force occurs between the two S+
            apices of the water tetrahedron and the negatively charged
            electrode surface within the region of the Helmholtz layer,
            as shown in FIG. 7. This effect "orients" the water molecule
            in the field, and is the well-known "orientation factor" of
            electrochemistry which serves to catalyse the rate of oxygen
            dissociation from the water molecule, and thereby causes the
            reaction rate to proceed at the lowest energy levels. See
            FIG. 10 for an example of how the orientation factor works.</font>

            believed to be happening in this IV OHM effect is that each

            resonant to one of the four harmonics observed. It is
            believed that the combination of negative repulsive forces
            at the outer electrode with the resonant frequencies just
            described work together to shatter the water molecule into
            its component hydrogen and oxygen atoms (as gases). This
            deduction is based on the following observations of the
            process through a low power microscope. The hydrogen bubbles
            were seen to originate at the electrode rim, 4', of FIG. 3.
            The bubbles then moved in a very orderly `pearl chain`

            bonds of the water molecules have a lower energy content

            ability. High energy molecules are inherently unstable.
            These relations are summarized in the two graphs of FIG. 14.
            It is to be noted that FIG. 14 (b) shows the endergonic
            reaction aspect of the invention when water is decomposed by
            electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. FIG. 14 (a) shows the

            liberate energy, and re-form into water. Note that there is
            a difference in the potential energy of the two reactions.
            FIG. 14 (c) shows that there are two components to this
            potential energy. The net energy released, or the energy
            that yields net work is labelled in the diagram as Net
            Energy released, and is more properly called the free energy

            represents an ideal model, it is believed that there is
            enough return (app. 15%) on the capital energy investment to
            yield a net energy profit that can be used to do useful
