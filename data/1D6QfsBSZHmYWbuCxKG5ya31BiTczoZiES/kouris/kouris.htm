      The force that creates whirlpools and hurricanes could soon be
      used to boost the output of traditional hydroelectric power
      stations by 27 percent, says Australian Paul Kouris, inventor of a
      new turbine that he says harnesses the vortex effect created by
      the rotation of the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      Using the Coriolis force, the turbine is designed to harness
      draining water's rotational kinetic energy, as distinct from
      traditional hydroelectric plants which get their motive power from
      water falling under gravity's influence.<br>
      <br>
      Kouris, a barrister and part-time inventor, has just secured
      government funding to develop a pilot installation at Marysville
      in eastern Victoria, Australia, after what he describes as an
      uphill battle to convince academia and government of the merits of
      his new turbine design.<br>
      <br>
      The funding comes after tests conducted by the University of
      Ballarat, Australia, which showed that the vortex effect did
      indeed produce additional power beyond that provided by only the
      gravity-fall of water. Kouris claims that his 2004 small-scale
      test tank installation managed to extract an additional 27 percent
      energy over what is produced by traditional turbines. If his
      figures are correct, refurbishing existing hydraulic installations
      with the new turbine could radically increase their power output
      capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      Kouris filed for a patent in 1998, but a stoush may be brewing
      with Austria where the town of Obergrafendorf has had Coriolis
      turbines operating in concrete ponds on the banks of a river since
      2005.<br>

      Marysville KCT outlet 13/7/2010 showing flow used to power a house
      viz. approx. 110 L/sec, using a vortex depth of 60cm to produce
      &gt; 9.5 kWh per day.<br>
      <br>
      The KCT is the world’s first patented, in the river or in the
      reservoir, vortex turbine, operated using the spin as distinct
      from the fall of water. The KCT harnesses the energy in a vortex,
      it draws from the Coriolis Force and thus promises to supplement
      the energy created by conventional gravity fed generators.<br>
      <br>
      The KCT uses the flow not the fall of water, and can operate with
      a very low head, well under the 3 metre minimum required by
      conventional turbines to operate efficiently. Furthermore it does
      not interfere with the flow rate, which enables the system to be
      used sequentially in a waterway.<br>
      <br>
      The KCT has been reviewed and endorsed by Dr. Harry Schaap,
      Federal Advisor for Renewable Energy. In turn Austrade has
      endorsed The KCT and included it on its Clean Energy Export
      Directory.<br>
      <br>
      The KCT is designed to increase output without cutting down any
      more trees or damming any more rivers – by simply employing the
      water more efficiently; see accompanying ‘KCT Product Brochure’
      diagrams below. <br>

      Abstract -- A new hydraulic turbine assembly for deriving extra
      energy out of a conventional hydroelectric power generating system
      by incorporating a second turbine generator at the inlet from the
      reservoir. The inventive device includes a vertical water inlet
      pipe being extended into the water reservoir of a dam to deliver
      water to the conventional hydroelectric generating system. The
      vertical water inlet pipe has a water inlet point being positioned
      in the water reservoir to create an inlet free vortex formation.
      An outer housing tube having an inlet cone for collecting water
      from said inlet free vortex formation and an outlet draft in fluid
      communication with the vertical water inlet pipe to permit water
      to pass through the outer housing tube to the vertical water inlet
      pipe. A rotor and turbine assembly having a rotor unit and at
      least one generator unit for creating electrical energy is
      disposed within the outer housing tube to permit rotation of the
      rotor unit within the outer housing unit by water passing through
      the outer housing tube. Each of the generator units is
      operationally coupled to the rotor unit so that the rotational
      energy of the rotor unit is transferred by the generator units
      into electrical energy. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to hydraulic turbines and more
      particularly pertains to a new hydraulic turbine assembly for
      deriving extra energy out of a conventional hydroelectric power
      generating system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      The use of hydraulic turbines is known in the prior art. More
      specifically, hydraulic turbines heretofore devised and utilized
      are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious
      structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs
      encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for
      the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Known prior art hydraulic turbines include U.S. Pat. Nos.
      4,437,017; 4,963,780; 4,219,303; 4,816,697; 4,443,707 and
      4,284,899.<br>
      <br>
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular
      objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not
      disclose a new hydraulic turbine assembly. The inventive device
      includes a vertical water inlet pipe being extended into the water
      reservoir of a dam to deliver water to the conventional
      hydroelectric generating system. The vertical water inlet pipe has
      a water inlet point being positioned in the water reservoir to
      create an inlet free vortex formation. An outer housing tube
      having an inlet cone for collecting water from said inlet free
      vortex formation and an outlet draft in fluid communication with
      the vertical water inlet pipe to permit water to pass through the
      outer housing tube to the vertical water inlet pipe. A rotor and
      turbine assembly having a rotor unit and at least one generator
      unit for creating electrical energy is disposed within the outer
      housing tube to permit rotation of the rotor unit within the outer
      housing unit by water passing through the outer housing tube. Each
      of the generator units is operationally coupled to the rotor unit
      so that the rotational energy of the rotor unit is transferred by
      the generator units into electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      In these respects, the hydraulic turbine assembly according to the
      present invention substantially departs from the conventional
      concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an
      apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of deriving extra
      energy out of a conventional hydroelectric power generating
      system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types
      of hydraulic turbines now present in the prior art, the present
      invention provides a new hydraulic turbine assembly construction
      wherein the same can be utilized for deriving extra energy out of
      a conventional hydroelectric power generating system.<br>
      <br>
      The general purpose of the present invention, which will be
      described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new
      hydraulic turbine assembly apparatus and method which has many of
      the advantages of the hydraulic turbines mentioned heretofore and
      many novel features that result in a new hydraulic turbine
      assembly which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or
      even implied by any of the prior art hydraulic turbines, either
      alone or in any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a
      vertical water inlet pipe being extended into the water reservoir
      of a dam to deliver water to the conventional hydroelectric
      generating system. The vertical water inlet pipe has a water inlet
      point being positioned in the water reservoir to create an inlet
      free vortex formation. An outer housing tube having an inlet cone
      for collecting water from said inlet free vortex formation and an
      outlet draft in fluid communication with the vertical water inlet
      pipe to permit water to pass through the outer housing tube to the
      vertical water inlet pipe. A rotor and turbine assembly having a
      rotor unit and at least one generator unit for creating electrical
      energy is disposed within the outer housing tube to permit
      rotation of the rotor unit within the outer housing unit by water
      passing through the outer housing tube. Each of the generator
      units is operationally coupled to the rotor unit so that the
      rotational energy of the rotor unit is transferred by the
      generator units into electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important
      features of the invention in order that the detailed description
      thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that
      the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      There are additional features of the invention that will be
      described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of
      the claims appended hereto.<br>
      <br>
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the
      invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is
      not limited in its application to the details of construction and
      to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following
      description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is
      capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried
      out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the
      phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of
      description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
      <br>
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the
      conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be
      utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods
      and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present
      invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded
      as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not
      depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the
      U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and
      especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art
      who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to
      determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence
      of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is
      neither intended to define the invention of the application, which
      is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to
      the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
      new hydraulic turbine assembly apparatus and method which has many
      of the advantages of the hydraulic turbines mentioned heretofore
      and many novel features that result in a new hydraulic turbine
      assembly which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or
      even implied by any of the prior art hydraulic turbines, either
      alone or in any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a new
      hydraulic turbine assembly which may be easily and efficiently
      manufactured and marketed.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new
      hydraulic turbine assembly which is of a durable and reliable
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      An even further object of the present invention is to provide a
      new hydraulic turbine assembly which is susceptible of a low cost
      of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which
      accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the
      consuming public, thereby making such hydraulic turbine assembly
      economically available to the buying public.<br>
      <br>
      Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
      new hydraulic turbine assembly which provides in the apparatuses
      and methods of the prior art some of the advantages thereof, while
      simultaneously overcoming some of the disadvantages normally
      associated therewith.<br>
      <br>
      Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new
      hydraulic turbine assembly for deriving extra energy out of a
      conventional hydroelectric power generating system.<br>
      <br>
      Still a further object of the present invention is to allow, if
      required, water to be returned to the reservoir, utilizing the
      extra energy created, and thereby provide an alternative means of
      increasing the overall energy output of a conventional
      hydroelectric power generating system, by increasing the volume of
      water available to pass through that system.<br>
      <br>
      Still yet a further object of the present invention is to allow,
      if required, any number of hydraulic turbine assemblies to be
      incorporated into the reservoir at various locations within the
      reservoir, their respective outlet pipes each ultimately joining
      with the main outlet pipe of the reservoir which leads to the
      conventional hydroelectric power generating system, thus
      multiplying the additional energy output of the hydraulic turbine
      assemblies within that system.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a new
      hydraulic turbine assembly which includes a vertical water inlet
      pipe being extended into the water reservoir of a dam to deliver
      water to the conventional hydroelectric generating system. The
      vertical water inlet pipe has a water inlet point being positioned
      in the water reservoir to create an inlet free vortex formation.
      An outer housing tube having an inlet cone for collecting water
      from said inlet free vortex formation and an outlet draft in fluid
      communication with the vertical water inlet pipe to permit water
      to pass through the outer housing tube to the vertical water inlet
      pipe. A rotor and turbine assembly having a rotor unit and at
      least one generator unit for creating electrical energy is
      disposed within the outer housing tube to permit rotation of the
      rotor unit within the outer housing unit by water passing through
      the outer housing tube. Each of the generator units is
      operationally coupled to the rotor unit so that the rotational
      energy of the rotor unit is transferred by the generator units
      into electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
      new hydraulic turbine assembly that derives extra energy out of a
      conventional hydroelectric power generating system by
      incorporating a second turbine generator at the inlet from the
      reservoir while allowing the majority of the energy to be
      available to the conventional turbine arrangement of the dam.<br>
      <br>
      Even still another object of the present invention is to provide a
      new hydraulic turbine assembly that has an inlet designed to allow
      a free vortex to form, the energy of which is currently lost in
      the form of other turbulence. The source of this energy is a
      combination of various parameters including initial pre-swirl in
      the water, the Coriolis effect from the rotation of the Earth and
      the shape of the reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      These together with other objects of the invention, along with the
      various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are
      pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and
      forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of
      the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects
      attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying
      drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated
      preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>

      assembly 3 comprises the vertical water inlet pipe (1), the outlet
      draft tube (8), and the rotor and turbine assembly (38).<br>
      <br>
      As best illustrated in FIGS. I through 9, it can be shown that
      this hydraulic turbine assembly (3) is designed to derive extra
      energy out of a conventional hydroelectric power generation system
      by incorporating a second turbine generator at the vertical inlet
      from the reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      The invention as shown in FIG. 1 consists of a modular designed
      removable electrical generation turbine unit attached to a
      vertically facing inlet water feed pipe that supplies water to the
      conventional down stream or lower electrical generation power
      plant.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the vertical inlet pipe (1) presents itself
      with a flange receiving end (42) suitable for the attachment of
      the flange mount (30) of the hydraulic turbine unit (3) and may be
      fabricated from concrete, steel or other suitable materials in
      order to withstand the weight and torsional loading subjected by
      the unit.<br>
      <br>
      The vertical inlet pipe's (1) horizontal positioning within the
      water reservoir (41) shall allow for adequate clearance from
      retaining or dam wall (31), base (32), water surface (33) and
      sides of the water reservoir (41) so as to enable the proper
      formation of a free inlet vortex (34) specific to the application.
      The water supply or flow can be slowed or stopped using a suitable
      form of valve or shut off gate (2) necessary for system shut down.<br>
      <br>
      The flange mount (30) of the hydraulic turbine assembly (3) itself
      is flange mounted to the flange receiving end (42) of the water
      inlet pipe (1) and so can be easily disassembled and removed for
      repairs, maintenance or to enable the conventional hydroelectric
      generating system (35) to operate as previously.<br>
      <br>
      The power output cable (4) is appropriately insulated and exits
      from the hermetically sealed generator unit (29) to the required
      supply feed point outside the water reservoir (41).<br>
      <br>
      The height of the water inlet point (5) of the unit from the free
      surface of the water (33) is such as to allow for the formation of
      a free vortex (34) above the hydraulic turbine assembly (3) and
      depends on the particular application. A screened enclosure
      structure such as a mesh screen (6) may be required depending on
      the application for the prevention of material other than water
      from entering the system.<br>
      <br>
      As depicted in FIG. 2, the hydraulic turbine assembly (3) consists
      of three sections the first of which is described as the inlet
      cone (7). Its function is to collect the inlet water and is shaped
      to minimize inlet hydraulic pressure losses according to the
      particular application as well as to locally increase water
      velocity entering the turbine main section (10). The inlet cone
      (7) can be made from concrete or steel or other suitable materials
      according to the specific application and must withstand the high
      water velocities in its proximity and also the weight of the whole
      of the unit for unit installation and disassembly. The inlet cone
      (7) is flange mounted at the flanged joint (36) to the main
      section (10) and can be disassembled from it.<br>
      <br>
      The outlet draft tube (8) is diverging in shape and is shaped so
      as to reduce turbine exit water velocity and to further increase
      the energy potential across the turbine. Its construction is
      similar to that of the inlet cone (7). The outlet draft tube (8)
      is also flange mounted to the main section (10) at the flanged
      joint (43) and can also be disassembled from it.<br>
      <br>
      The power outlet cable (4) exits the hydraulic turbine assembly
      (3) via one of the turbine support pillars (9) and may either pass
      through a hollow support pillar (9) from the hydraulic turbine
      assembly (3) or be attached along it. The exit point may also be a
      hermetically sealed junction box (37) where disconnection is
      possible separating the cable (4) from the rest of the unit.<br>
      <br>
      The hydraulic turbine assembly (3) main section (10) completes the
      three part structure of the hydraulic turbine assembly (3) and is
      the working section containing the turbine rotor and electrical
      power generating equipment. Its outer housing tube (13) is made
      from similar materials to the inlet cone (7) and outlet draft (8)
      and mounts to each respectively at its inlet and outlet flanged
      joints (36, 43) mount to each respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing the modularity of the concept when separated from the
      inlet cone (7) and outlet draft (8), the main section (10) as
      shown in FIG. 3 can be further disassembled to reveal a top cap
      assembly (11) flange mounted between the main section (10) and
      inlet cone (7) containing the top support pillars (9) that help
      suspend the rotor and turbine assembly (38) in the middle of the
      water stream as well as the streamlined top cap (11). The purpose
      of the top cap assembly (11) is to minimize the hydraulic form
      losses of the rotor and turbine assembly (38) and does not rotate
      with the rotor unit (26).<br>
      <br>
      The support pillars (9) are also hydrodynamically designed to
      minimize form drag and also do not rotate. Similarly, the lower
      cap assembly (12) is a structure that does not rotate but serves
      to support the rotor and turbine assembly (38) whilst minimizing
      drag. The flanged outer housing tube (13) completes the support
      structure for the rotor and turbine assembly (38) as well as of
      course containing the water.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the rotor and turbine assembly (38) is
      supported by the upper support plate (14) and lower support plate
      (15) which do not rotate but serve to attach the contained unit to
      the top cap assembly (11) and bottom cap assembly (12) mentioned
      above.<br>
      <br>
      The support plates (14, 15) also fix the support shaft (16) which
      also does not rotate thereby minimizing the actual number of
      components and hence weight of the parts that do rotate in the
      unit and mentioned later on. The actual method of fixing can be
      splining or keying or other suitable method to prevent the shaft
      (16) from rotating with respect to the fixed support plates (14,
      15). The fixed support shaft (16) also carries the upper bearing
      assembly (17) and lower bearing assembly (18) about which the
      revolves the rotor (26).<br>
      <br>
      The rotor unit assembly (26) may need to be sealed against water
      entry and for this, felt or any suitable seals may be used for the
      upper seal (19) and the lower seal (20). Upper retaining cap (21)
      and lower retaining cap (22) also serve to complete the sealing
      and to vertically locate the fixed support shaft (16). The rotor
      and generator sub-assembly (23) can be seen separated here from
      the upper and lower bearing assemblies (17, 18) and upper and
      lower support plates (14, 15).<br>
      <br>
      The upper bearing plate (24) and lower bearing plate (25) are
      attached and rotate with the rotor (26). Their function is to
      support the rotor (26) in the first instance but also, in the case
      of the upper bearing plate (24), to transfer the rotational energy
      of the rotor (26) to the electrical generator unit (29) via a
      series of gears. The upper bearing plate (24) is itself an annular
      gear with internal teeth that act on the gear box (27).<br>
      <br>
      As depicted in FIGS. 6 and 7, the rotor unit (26) is the main
      rotating element of the turbine containing three to six blades
      (40) depending on the application. These blades (40) are pitched
      at a greater angle at the tip and shallower at the hub to
      accommodate for differences in relative speeds between the blades
      (40) and the water for varying distance from the central axis of
      the rotor unit (26).<br>
      <br>
      A gear box assembly (27) accepts the rotational energy from the
      upper bearing plate gear (24) and transforms the torque and speed
      to suitable values depending on the application feeding it to the
      generator units (29). The number of sets of gears (39) used
      depends on the number of modular generator units (29) deployed in
      the application. A gear carrier (28) that does not rotate and is
      fixed by keying or other suitable method to the central fixed
      support shaft (16) is used to maintain the gear box gears (39) in
      their relative positions and prevent them from revolving around
      with the upper bearing plate (24). The shape of the gear carrier
      (28) depends on the number of modular generator units (29)
      deployed in the application.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanical rotational energy is finally converted to
      electrical energy by the use of generator units (29) that are
      firmly attached to flat sections of the fixed support shaft (16)
      and do not themselves move. The number of generator units (29)
      deployed depends on the particular application, the annular space
      considerations and the available torque generated. Each generator
      unit (29) is fully sealed and submersible, the output cable (4)
      being also fully sealed.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the inlet of the hydraulic turbine assembly (3) is
      designed to allow a free vortex to form, the energy of which is
      currently lost in the form of other turbulence. The source of this
      energy is a combination of various parameters including initial
      pre-swirl in the water, the Coriolis effect from the rotation of
      the Earth and the shape of the water reservoir (41). The low
      operating head, large flow rate and significant water swirl thus
      lends itself to the use of an axial flow type of hydraulic turbine
      as in the present hydraulic turbine assembly (3).<br>
      <br>
      In use, it should also be understood that this hydraulic turbine
      assembly (3) may be used separately from the conventional
      hydroelectric generating system (35) of the dam (31) as a stand
      alone hydroelectric generating system. That is, the hydraulic
      turbine assembly (3) may be used so that water passing from the
      hydraulic turbine assembly (3) does not have to enter the
      conventional hydroelectric generation system (35) of the dam or it
      may be used in a system that does not include the conventional
      hydroelectric generating system (35).<br>
      <br>
      Because of the low operating hydraulic head across this hydraulic
      turbine assembly (3), the majority of the energy to the
      conventional turbine arrangement for the dam would still be
      available. Thus, the total energy output of the system with the
      added hydraulic turbine assembly (3) would then be greater than
      that using only the conventional turbine arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      One of the greatest strengths of the hydraulic turbine assembly
      (3) is that by drawing upon the Coriolis effect this invention
      does not thereby interfere with the operation of the conventional
      hydraulic turbine system of the dam (31). Accordingly, this
      invention does not contravene the conservation of energy
      principle.<br>
      <br>
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of
      the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above
      description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the
      manner of usage and operation will be provided.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized
      that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the
      invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form,
      function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed
      readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all
      equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and
      described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the
      principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications
      and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is
      not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and
      operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable
      modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within
      the scope of the invention. <br>
