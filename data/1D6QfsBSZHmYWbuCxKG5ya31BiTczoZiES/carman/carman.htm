          <p>The Good News is that Vincent Carman's new transmission can
            double your car's gas mileage. The Bad News is that, thanks
            in part to bungling by the U.S. Government's Energy Research
            and Development Administration (ERDA), it may be decades
            before this fuel saver is on the market. </p>
          <p>Portland, Oregon's Vincent Carman is an honest,
            straightforward guy ... and the revolutionary automobile
            transmission he's invented is the same kind of animal. It's
            a simple, straightforward combination of off-the-shelf
            components that don't do a blessed thing ... except simply
            and straightforwardly double the gasoline mileage of a
            passenger car or other internal combustion engine-powered
            vehicle. </p>
          <p>Getting this new fuel saver developed and put on the
            market, however, is proving to be a somewhat more devious
            and complicated breed of cat. </p>
          <p>THE INERTIAL STORAGE TRANSMISSION IS A REALITY </p>
          <p>It would be easier to understand Mr. Carman's current
            development and marketing frustrations if his new piece of
            equipment was merely a vague daydream that he'd sketched out
            on a place mat in a greasy spoon restaurant somewhere. But
            it isn't. </p>
          <p>Vincent's Inertial Storage Transmission (IST) is already in
            its third or fourth generation of development, it has been
            endorsed by the National Bureau of Standards and championed
            by Senator Mark Hatfield and Congressman Robert Duncan,
            several versions of the transmission have actually been road
            tested, and the U.S. Postal Service is interested in
            equipping a whole fleet of vehicles with the IST ... <i>just















              as soon as</i> ERDA conducts some "independent" tests on
            Mr. Carman's invention. </p>
          <p>And there's the rub. Because, ”thanks to a set of
            circumstances that occasionally seems as implausible as the
            script for a 1927 slapstick comedy” there sometimes doesn't
            seem to be much chance that those tests will ever get
            underway. </p>
          <p>THE IST: WHAT IT IS </p>
          <p>Vincent Carman's Inertial Storage Transmission does just
            what its name indicates: It stores energy that would
            otherwise be wasted during the many times an ordinary
            automobile is stopped with its engine running (in heavy
            traffic, while waiting to pull onto a freeway, at red
            lights, etc.) ... and then draws on that stored energy when
            it's needed to propel an IST-equipped vehicle down the pike.
          </p>
          <p>More specifically, the IST [1] allows a passenger car or
            other internal combustion engine-powered vehicle's
            powerplant to run at a fuelsaving optimum and constant speed
            ... no matter how much the vehicle itself is accelerated,
            cruised at varying speeds, brought to panic stops or
            otherwise operated, [2] accumulates and stores a great deal
            of the energy that is normally "thrown away" any time a
            vehicle is parked with its engine running, [3] captures and
            saves a great deal of the energy that is normally dissipated
            as brake shoe heat when a vehicle is decelerated and/or
            stopped, and [4] will even automatically turn a vehicle's
            engine completely off and leave the machine cruising
            silently down the highway on nothing but stored power under
            certain conditions! </p>
          <p>Although the sensors and "brain'' which control these
            activities are complex, the actual hardware which does all
            the work is a very simple hydraulic system. If you'll look
            at the diagrams which accompany this article, you'll notice
            that the whole transmission consists of little more than a
            hydraulic pump (directly driven by a vehicle's engine), a
            pressure accumulator (which is where all the energy that
            would otherwise be wasted is stored), a reservoir (in which
            "extra" hydraulic fluid is kept until it's pumped into the
            accumulator), a hydraulic motor (which is what actually
            drives the vehicle's rear wheels when oil from the
            accumulator tank is pumped through it), and enough plumbing
            and valves to connect these major components together
            properly. </p>
          <p>LET'S TRY 'ER OUT! </p>
          <p>A typical "spin around the block" in an IST-equipped
            automobile isn't really any different from the same trip
            made in an ordinary car. No different, that is, up in the
            passenger compartment. Under the hood and along the
            vehicle's drive line, however, some most unusual-and
            gasoline savingactions will constantly be taking place. </p>
          <p>If the IST-outfitted machine had been parked with an
            appreciable amount of pressure still in its accumulator, for
            instance ... you would get into the vehicle, turn on its
            key, step on the accelerator, and start moving down the road
            just as you would move in an ordinary automobile. Except for
            the fact that you'll be driving on "old" stored energy, and
            your car's engine won't even have started yet! (No wonder
            that acceleration is so smooth ... and so quiet! </p>
          <p>Nor will the internal combustion engine be started until
            the IST-equipped vehicle has traveled some distance down the
            road. How far? As much as it takes to bleed the stored
            hydraulic pressure in the IST accumulator tank down to a
            predetermined and pre-set minimum level. At that point the
            gasoline engine will be started automatically (you probably
            won't know-nor do you even need to know-when this happens).
            It will not, however, be started in the usual way (with
            electricity from a battery spinning an electric starter
            which, in turn, cranks over the internal combustion engine).
            Instead, some of the remaining pressure in the accumulator
            will be piped through the hydraulic pump that is directly
            attached to the engine, and-as the pump spins- it will act
            as the gasoline engine's starter. </p>
          <p>Pretty clever, this invention of Vincent Carman's! But
            that's only the beginning of the fuel-stretching tricks that
            the Inertial Storage Transmission has up its sleeves. For
            example: </p>
          <p>When you come to a red light and remove your foot from the
            accelerator ... you will not also have to step on the brake
            (which is left in an IST-outfitted car mostly as an
            emergency backup for the automatic braking action built
            right into the Inertial Storage Transmission itself). What
            happens, you seeâ€”as soon as you let up on the
            acceleratorâ€”is that the hydraulic motor which has been
            driving the rear wheels to make your vehicle move down the
            road ... that hydraulic motor is instantly converted into a
            pump. It no longer drives the wheels. Instead, the coasting
            wheels begin to drive it. And as this hydraulic unit is
            turned, it just like the pump attached directly to the car's
            internal combustion engineâ€”begins to force more and more
            pressure into the IST accumulator. </p>
          <p>This action, of course, puts a considerable braking load on
            the coasting wheels which means that two very desirable
            things are being accomplished at once: [1] your car is being
            smoothly brought to a halt, and [2] as it is stopped, the
            vehicle's dissipating kinetic energy is not being wastefully
            spewed into the atmosphere as brake drum heat. Instead, it's
            being accumulated and stored in a form that you'll be able
            to use to make your car move once again when that red
            traffic lightâ€”which stopped you in the first placeâ€”turns
            green. </p>
          <p>Don't forget that your vehicle's prime internal combustion
            engine is not being slowed down and left to kick over at an
            inefficient, gas-burning idle all the time you're sitting
            there waiting for that light to change, either. </p>
          <p>Rather, it's allowed to keep right on running at its most
            efficient rpmâ€”for as long as necessary during your
            deceleration and the time you're haltedâ€”until the pressure
            in the IST accumulator has been raised back up to a pre-set
            maximum level. At that point and only at that point (and,
            again, without your knowing or even needing to know that
            it's happening) your car's engine will be shut off
            automatically. And it will then remain shut off until the
            pressure in the IST accumulator is again bled down to its
            preset minimum level. </p>
          <p>Chances are, then, when that light finally does turn back
            to green and you glide off down the road once more, you'll
            begin to move the same way you did when this trial spin
            started. That is, you'll accelerate and go some distance
            before your vehicle's engine is again started. </p>
          <p>What this all means is that your carin heavy stop-and-go
            city traffic-can be operated as much as 80% of the time ...
            on stored energy and with its engine shut off! And if all
            the other cars around you were also equipped with Inertial
            Storage Transmissions ... just think what that would mean in
            terms of soaring gas mileage and plunging levels of internal
            combustion engine air pollution! </p>
          <p>WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE GO IST? </p>
          <p>Why, then, doesn't everyone have an IST in his or her car?
            Certainly not because the concept hasn't been proven. </p>
          <p>Vincent Carman's first Inertial Storage Transmission was
            installed in a Fiat 850 and the little automobile was then
            driven over the same 3/4-mile stop-and-go course that it had
            been driven over while it was still equipped with its
            regular transmission. Result: The Fiat, when operated as set
            up at the factory, burned 200 milliliters (a shade over 3/4
            cup) of fuel during the test ... but only 98 milliliters
            (less than half as much) gasoline when run as an IST
            vehicle. </p>
          <p>Vince has also installed an Inertial Storage Transmission
            in a Ford Granada. When tested in city traffic alongside an
            identical-but-unmodified Granada ... you guessed it: The
            stock car gets 20 miles to the gallon, while the IST car
            rolls up 40 miles per gallon. An IST-equipped diesel
            Volkswagen Rabbit will soon be on the road too, and it'll be
            interesting to see just how far Mr. Carman's transmission
            can stretch that car's already superior mileage. In the
            meantime, though, Vince has already convinced some of our
            federal government's heavyweights that he's onto something
            good. </p>
          <p>The National Bureau of Standards, for instance, has
            evaluated the IST and found it to be "technically valid"
            enough to recommend it to ERDA for "appropriate government
            support". That referral becomes even more impressive when
            you know that the NBS has made this sort of recommendation
            for only 22 of the some 4,300 energy inventions it has
            looked into. </p>
          <p>It is interesting, too, that Mr. William Hullgeneral
            manager of research and development for the U.S. Postal
            Service -has witnessed the operation of Vince's IST-Granada
            . . . and that, as a result, the Postal Service is
            interested in testing the transmission on an entire fleet of
            vehicles. Just as soon, that is, as the Energy Research and
            Development Administration runs an "independent" test on the
            unit. </p>
          <p>Which is exactly where the plot begins to thicken. </p>
          <p>Because, according to Vincent Carman, ERDA was notified
            about the development of the IST two years ago and, since
            then, has done little about the invention but "get in the
            way". Carman, in fact, claims that not only has ERDA not
            conducted those independent tests of his transmission yet
            ... but it didn't even acknowledge the transmission's
            existence for a full six months after receiving the National
            Bureau of Standards recommendation of the unit. And ERDA
            only admitted its knowledge of Vince's work then because of
            pressure applied by Senator Mark Hatfield and Congressman
            Robert Duncan. </p>
          <p>At that, Carman still doesn't know whether to laugh or cry
            at the "recognition" for his development that Hatfield and
            Duncan squeezed out of ERDA. The Energy Research and
            Development Administration's report consisted of a short one
            and a half pages which rejected Carman's unit as something
            that is too expensive, unable to achieve the fuel savings
            claimed for it, and unacceptable to the auto industry
            (MOTHER's emphasis). </p>
          <p>What does this mean ... really? How can ERDA flatly pass
            such a judgment on an energy-saving transmission it has
            never even tested? Especially when others (including
            representatives of the National Bureau of Standards and the
            U.S. Postal Service) who have seen the unit demonstrated ...
            say that it does live up to its claims? </p>
          <p>Vince Carman thinks ERDA wants to ignore his work -- or
            worse, actually <i>suppress</i> it -- because of the
            agency's commitment to another energy-efficient vehicle
            technology. ERDA has already spent at least $200,000 on a
            feasibility study of flywheel storage systems for vehicles
            and has earmarked three years of further development and
            $4.5 million to put a prototype on the road. The agency also
            shares a contract with the Department of Transportation
            (which, likewise, is interested in flywheel energy storage
            and has spent five years and $300,000 trying to convert a
            Ford Pinto to such a system) to supply flywheel vehicles to
            the city of New York. </p>
          <p><i>[And by the way, where does bankrupt New York City get
              the money to throw around on such a goose chase? This is
              beginning to sound like one set of government con men
              conning another set of government con men into greater and
              greater flights of fancy</i> -- <i>all at tax payers'
              expense, of course</i> -- <i>while the lone, levelheaded

          <p>ERDA spokesmen, on the other hand, say that they're not
            committed to one type of energy-efficient vehicle (their
            unproven flywheel-storage car) any more than another
            (Carman's proven Inertial Storage Transmission automobiles
            which are running right now). They even admit they initially
            mishandled the whole IST situation and say they'd love to
            test Vince's cars now. The only trouble is that they just
            can't get Vince to agree on an acceptable location for that
            demonstration (the now-wary Carman insists that the test be
            conducted in Portland). </p>
          <p>So where does that leave all the rest of us? </p>
          <p>Well, the automobile companies certainly aren't beating
            Vince's door down for rights to manufacture his fantastic
            fuel saver. Apparently they'd rather not be bothered with
            tooling up for Carman's transmission and redesigning their
            auto bodies around the new drive system because that'd cost
            a lot of money and depress their profits for a few years. </p>
          <p>And you --- all you good people who'd like to cut your use
            of petroleum in half for the sake of both the environment
            and your pocketbooks ---well, unless you're enough of a
            mechanical wizard to figure out how to construct and control
            an IST system of your own ... it leaves you just waiting. </p>
          <p>ERDA'S SIDE OF THE STORY </p>
          <p>MOTHER staffer Travis Brock called ERDA and talked to a Mr.
            Jerry Black ... who told him that Vincent Carman first
            presented his new transmission concept to the Environmental
            Protection Agency, and that the EPA referred Vince to ERDA
            in July of 1975. At about the same time, however, Congress
            decided that the National Bureau of Standards should screen
            all energy-related inventions before ERDA became involved
            with them. </p>
          <p>For that reason, Carman and his transmission were passed
            right on to the National Bureau of Standards. And the NBS,
            after looking the idea over, passed Vince back to ERDA with
            a report that said the IST would save half of all the oil we
            import from the Arabs if it was installed on all the
            vehicles used in our urban traffic. </p>
          <p>ERDA's people then said that such a figure couldn't
            possibly be right and ran some calculations of their own ...
            calculations which showed the IST would save only 3% of U.S.
            imported oil. This report was passed around the agency's
            lower levels where it was considered the end of the whole
            affair by most of ERDA's personnel ... until one of the
            higher-echelon people in the agency stumbled onto the paper.
            "Hey, wait a minute," he said. "It doesn't matter if this
            thing saves 50% or 3% or only 1% of the oil we import. It's
            our responsibility to get this transmission tested and
            that's what we should do. " </p>
          <p>ERDA then contacted the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena,
            California and asked it to investigate the performance of
            the IST. Carman, however, refused to take one of his cars to
            California. ERDA next got in touch with a test lab in
            Portland (Mr. Black implied that it was the only facility in
            the area with the capability of handling such work) ... but,
            due to some internal problems, that particular facility
            won't be able to evaluate the Inertial Storage Transmission
            for another 15 to 18 months. </p>
          <p>Mr. Black also stated that he had heard via the grapevine
            that the hydraulics shop which did much of the work on
            Carman's current prototype has a $20,000 lien on the
            automobile and refuses to let it leave the Portland area.
            ERDA feels that this may be one of the reasons for Vince's
            inflexibility about the location in which his prototype is
            demonstrated to the agency. ERDA, according to Black, has
            even checked with its lawyers to learn if there is any legal
            way it can pay off the lien against the IST prototype so the
            auto can be moved to California and tested. "No," the
            lawyers have decided, "there's no legal way that public
            money can be used to pay off Mr. Carman's private debt." </p>
          <p>Mr. Black further noted that ERDA gets a letter almost
            every day from Mr. Carman ... and that the agency has
            trouble just keeping up its end of the correspondence.
            According to Jerry Black, though, ERDA does feel that the
            Inertial Storage Transmission is technically credible and
            the agency believes that Carman's demonstrations are honest.
            Mr. Black says he is confident that, sooner or later, the
            JPL tests will confirm this and that, sometime in the
            future, the Postal Service will get its fleet of
            IST-equipped vehicles. </p>
          <p>VINCE CARMAN'S RESPONSE TO ERDA'S PROPOSAL FOR A CALIFORNIA
            TEST OF HIS TRANSMISSION </p>
          <p>After visiting Mr. Carman in Portland, seeing his current
            prototype, preparing the main body of this article, and
            talking by phone to ERDA's Mr. Black ... MOTHER's Travis
            Brock called Vince and questioned him further about the
            Energy Research and Development Administration's proposed
            Pasadena test of his transmission. </p>
          <p>Carman replied that the Jet Propulsion Lab (which ERDA
            wants to evaluate his unit) has been doing work on a
            flywheel system (the idea that is directly competitive with
            his energy storage system) and he doesn't trust the people
            at JPL to give his transmission a fair shake. And that's the
            reason, he says, that he insists the ERDA demonstration must
            take place in Portland. </p>
          <p>Vince also mentioned that he's now selling stock (the
            second issue) in an effort to raise $200,000 which he needs
            for further development of the IST ... and for testing the
            system in some transit buses! </p>
          <p>Mr. Carman says the stock is selling well and that he
            "expects this thing to break wide open" once he gets his
            ISTequipped diesel Volkswagen Rabbit on the road. When asked
            what he means by "break wide open", Vince said that "once
            people see this thing being driven all over the U.S.,
            they'll raise such a ruckus demanding cars with IST
            transmissionsâ€”which will only add $200 to $300 to the cost
            of a new carâ€”that both ERDA and Detroit will be forced to
            give the system serious consideration." </p>
          <p>HOW AN OUTSIDER SEES THE IST SITUATION </p>
          <p>Scott Burns is a columnist for the American Boston Herald
            and Mr. Burns has followed the IST story in his column for
            some time. In his very first column on the subject, in fact,
            Scott even accused ERDA of intentionally suppressing Vince
            Carman's Inertial Storage Transmission. </p>
          <p>Mr. Burns seems to have mellowed on the subject, though,
            and now has what appears to be a more philosophical view of
            the whole Vince Carman/ERDA affair. "ERDA's people," he
            says, "are not really conspiring to snub Carman. They're
            just bungling idiots."</p>

                  Storage Transmission</font></b> </p>

            <p><b>Dominic Muren</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Believe it or not, both these old
          beat up cars have something amazing in common: They get double
          the gas mileage of standard models, because of an ingenious
          new transmission system developed by inventor Vincent Carman
          (seriously, could your name be any more perfect for making
          cars?). Not only that, but he did it in the 1970's! Even more
          unbelievable (or maybe not, considering) is that the
          government was sandbagging the implementation of his
          innovation for 2 years... </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Carman's transmission relies on
          hydraulic fluid under pressure to transfer energy from the
          engine to the wheels. A major downside of piston engines is
          that they are most efficient at a very high RPM -- much higher
          than would be effective for starting. So, in current cars,
          manual, or automatic mechanical transmissions try to use
          gearing to keep the engine running at its optimum RPM. But
          these systems inevitably run the engine too slow or too fast,
          because there are just not enough gears to cover everything.
          Some recent cars (like the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius)
          have used continuously variable transmissions which
          theoretically have infinitely many gears, to make an even more
          efficient motor running profile. But problems still happen
          when the car is starting (since the engine starts from rest,
          and is therefore inefficient), and when it accelerates quickly
          from a stop. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Inertial Storage Transmission
          (IST) that Carman developed bypasses all these problems by
          storing the engine's energy in high-pressure fluid. The fluid
          is pumped out of a reservoir by a small gas engine, into an
          accumulator at high pressure, which holds the fluid like a
          super-soaker holds water. Then, based on acceleration, more or
          less high pressure fluid is fed out of the reservoir through a
          hydraulic motor (like a turbine) to drive the wheels. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The system works almost identically
          to current hybrid electric systems, with some major
          advantages. First, it's cheap; hydraulics are a common
          technology with low service costs and cheap materials. Second,
          there are no expensive batteries or electronic systems to
          damage. And third, energy loss in pressurizing the accumulator
          tank is much less than for charging batteries. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So what held up this wonder? It
          looks like the usual bureaucratic nonsense. Some people loved
          it. Some people hated it. Some think it just wouldn't work.
          And yet Vincent has been drove a version of this car for two
          years with no trouble. Did we mention that this was in 1977!
          Surely we've worked out the kinks since then. He was getting
          40 miles per gallon in a real junker of a car. If you're a
          handyman, this might be a project worth resurrecting. And, if
          you know anyone in the automotive lobby, I'm sure that Vincent
          would be much obliged for any mention. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">While the Carter administration
          promotes its plan to turn a mountain of new taxes into a
          molehill of energy savings, the real solution to the energy
          crisis&nbsp; -&nbsp; new&nbsp; technology&nbsp; - may be
          languishing at our beloved Energy Research and Development
          Administration. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Testifying before the Senate
          Sub-Committe on Energy Research and Development on April 4,
          Vincent Carman, inventor of the Inertial Storage Transmission,
          recounted a mind-boggling tale of resistance and delay at
          ERDA, the agency charged with solving the energy crisis. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Here, in brief, is what he said : </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Over six months ago, the National
          Bureau of Standards completed an extensive evaluation of a
          revolutionary automobile transmission that they reported could
          reduce our nation's oil imports by 50 percent.&nbsp; This
          system can reduce vehicular air pollution in our cities by 75
          percent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This OPERATIONAL SYSTEM was
          publicly demonstrated 18 months ago.&nbsp; The system is
          simple, uses OFF-THE-SHELF, commercially available components.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the two years that ERDA has been
          aware of the system they have given the concept no serious
          attention." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It now appears they are attempting
          to suppress it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Unlike Dr. Ilok's solution to the
          energy crisis (reported here April 17-20), Carman's invention
          EXISTS, has been publicly demonstrated, and requires NO
          research and development investment from ERDA. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Carman merely wants ERDA to get OUT
          OF THE WAY and make it possible for him to install his
          invention on some U.S. Post Office trucks so that he might
          further demonstrate its utility and potential for energy
          savings. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But ERDA won't get out of the
          way.&nbsp; Instead, Carman says they have suppressed the
          National Bureau of Standards evaluation of his invention,
          refusing to release it to other agencies. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">They've done this because the NBS
          report recommends Carman's invention for funding, a singular
          achievement since only 22 of some 4300 submissions have
          enjoyed positive recommendation from NBS. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">ERDA's own, one-and-a-half page
          report, issued later, rejects the invention, saying that it is
          too expensive, won't achieve the savings the inventor had
          DEMONSTRATED AND DOCUMENTED, and won't be accepted by the
          automobile industry. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">ERDA is circulating its own report
          and has not, to date, released the NBS report, damaging both
          Carman's credibility and his ability to attract the interest
          of other government agencies or private industry. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What is the IST System? </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Carman's Inertial Storage
          Transmission works by storing oil under high pressure. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This means that all the power
          output from an engine can be used so that in city driving
          where car engines idle much of the time, a car could run USING
          the STORED POWER of its engine and the engine's power WOULD
          NEVER BE LOST IN WASTEFUL IDLING.&nbsp; (stored in the form of
          compressed oil) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As a consequence, the engine could
          be OFF 80 PERCENT OF THE TIME, REDUCING POLLUTION by 75
          PERCENT and FUEL CONSUMPTION by 50 PERCENT! </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Estimates indicate the IST could
          save some 35 BILLION GALLONS A YEAR, cutting our imported oil
          IN HALF. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Carman didn't hear from ERDA for
          six months after NBS's positive report was issued and then
          only after ERDA was pressured by Mark Hatfield and Congressman
          Robert Duncan.&nbsp; Clearly, ERDA would like the matter to
          quietly disappear. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now let's consider the quality of
          the two reports : </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">ERDA's negative report was produced
          in 42 days BY ONE INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT BENEFIT OF ANY PHYSICAL
          TESTING. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The uncirculated NBS report was
          based on 10 months of work and contributions from a variety of
          sources, many of them here in Massachusetts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Department of Transportation
          Systems Center in Cambridge, contributed to the evaluation as
          did the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of
          Massachusetts, the Boston Police Department, the MBTA and
          Yellow Cab Corporation. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, ERDA continues to
          circulate its own report rather than the NBS report. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One possible reason is that ERDA is
          committed to another technology, the flywheel energy storage
          system.&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, they have spent some $200,000 on
          a feasibility study of such systems. The study determined it
          would take three years and 4.5 million to get a prototype on
          the road, something Carman ACHIEVED IN LESS THAN A YEAR WITH
          $4000. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Department of Transportation
          also has an interest in flywheel systems and has spent five
          years and $300,000 trying to convert a Ford Pinto into a
          flywheel storage car.&nbsp; Together, the two agencies have a
          contract to supply flywheel vehicles to the city of New
          York.&nbsp; (Birds of a feather?) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, the Postal Service also
          reports it has contracts for flywheel vehicles and therefore
          can't put up funds for demonstration of the IST system. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">ERDA, in other words, has neatly
          closed out a competing technology because the agency is in a
          position to exercise MONOPOLISTIC CONTROL over the flow of
          both money and ideas in new energy technologies. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In an eloquent close to his
          testimony before the Senate sub-committee, Carman said ; </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"The energy problem has a solution
          and it is quite probable that a large part of that solution
          can come from the little guy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Two men in an upstairs room gave us
          the telephone, and a couple of bicycle mechanics brought
          aviation to the world.&nbsp; It is sometimes said that the day
          of the individual inventor is over, but nobody told Robert
          Goddard that, and he invented the ballistic missle in his
          backyard. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the last few years, while the
          greatest scientific organizations in both the United States
          and Russia struggled with the problem of generating electric
          power from fusion, a young man in California in his own lab
          produced the first major breakthrough." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now that we've seen Carter's energy
          plan, we know that Carter has chosen taxation, not technology,
          as the means of "solving" the energy crisis. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The money we all start paying in
          federal gasoline taxes will soon help ERDA expand its research
          efforts, - WHILE IT IGNORES SOLUTIONS. </p>

          lost in the braking or deceleration of the vehicle, by
          automatically controlled operation of the engine under certain
          conditions, and by automatically controlled use of the stored
          energy and engine respectively as alternative or supplemental
          prime movers for each other for driving the vehicle.
          Subsystems for preventing waste of deceleration energy and
          stored energy are provided, and compact transmission layout
          and packaging are provided which facilitate installation of
          the new system in existing vehicles. </p>

          Abstract --- An internal combustion engine is connected to a
          fixed displacement pump normally having its inlet connected to
          a reservoir and its outlet connected to an accumulator. To
          start the engine, selectively operable valves connect the
          inlet of the pump to the accumulator and the outlet to the
          reservoir to drive the pump as a motor to rotate the engine.
          Also, a fixed displacement motor has an inlet connected by a
          forward solenoid valve to the accumulator and pump and
          connected by a brake solenoid valve to the reservoir. The
          motor also has an outlet connected to the pump and the
          accumulator by a reverse solenoid valve and connected to the
          reservoir by a neutral solenoid valve. </p>
