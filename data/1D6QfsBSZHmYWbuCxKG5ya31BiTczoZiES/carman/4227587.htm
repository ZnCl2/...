      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>An internal combustion engine is connected
        to a fixed displacement pump normally having its inlet connected
        to a reservoir and its outlet connected to an accumulator. To
        start the engine, selectively operable valves connect the inlet
        of the pump to the accumulator and the outlet to the reservoir
        to drive the pump as a motor to rotate the engine. Also, a fixed
        displacement motor has an inlet connected by a forward solenoid
        valve to the accumulator and pump and connected by a brake
        solenoid valve to the reservoir. The motor also has an outlet
        connected to the pump and the accumulator by a reverse solenoid
        valve and connected to the reservoir by a neutral solenoid
        valve. </p>

      </center>
      <p>An improved automotive drive system forming one specific
        embodiment of the invention includes a prime mover in the form
        of an internal combustion engine 10, the speed of which is set
        to operate at its most efficient engine speed. Usually, this is
        slightly over one-half the maximum rated RPM. When the vehicle
        speed reaches approximately one-half the maximum speed of the
        vehicle, or extra rapid acceleration is needed, the engine 10
        will operate at a higher speed. Such speed will be determined by
        the position of a foot throttle (not shown). The engine has a
        drive shaft 12 mechanically connected to a fixed displacement
        hydraulic pump 14 which also can operate as a fixed displacement
        hydraulic motor. The engine has an ignition circuit 16 activated
        when a key operated switch 18 and contacts 20 of a pressure
        responsive switch 22 are closed to connect it to a battery 24.
        Contacts 26 of the switch 22 are connected in series with
        normally closed contacts 28 which are opened, when the engine
        reaches a minimum operating speed, by a known speed responsive
        device 30 driven by the engine. </p>
      <p>The fixed displacement pump 14 also serves as a fixed
        displacement motor to rotate the engine 10 to start the engine.
        To start the engine, switches 18, 82 and 120 are closed by the
        driver, the system being in its neutral condition as is shown in
        FIG. 1. The contacts 28 are closed since the engine is not
        running so that solenoids 34 and 35 are energized to open valves
        36 and 37. It is assumed that pressure on hydraulic liquid 38 in
        an accumulator 40 is lower than the desired minimum operating
        pressure of, for example, 1700 pounds per square inch. The
        switch 22 is set to energize whenever the pressure drops below a
        predetermined level, for example, 2,000 PSI, whereby contacts 26
        close and current flows through closed contacts 28 and opens
        valves 36 and 37 by energizing solenoids 34 and 35. The liquid
        flows from the accumulator 40 through lines 42, 44, 46, 48 and
        50, the valve 36 and lines 52 and 54 to port 56 of the pump 14,
        through the pump 14 (to drive it as a motor), out port 58 of the
        pump, through lines 60 and 62 of the valve 37 and lines 64, 66,
        68 and 70 to a reservoir 72. This drives the pump as a motor to
        turn the engine to start it. When it has started and reached a
        low level operating speed, the speed responsive device opens the
        switch 28. Opening of the switch 28 drops out the solenoids 34
        and 35 and the valves 36 and 37 close. The pump 14 now acts as a
        pump to pump the liquid from the line 54 through lines 60 and
        74, a check valve 76 and line 78 to the line 48. A fixed
        displacement hydraulic motor 100, which serves as the vehicle
        drive motor and also may operate as a pump, may or may not be
        turning depending on whether or not the vehicle is in motion
        when the engine start cycle occurs. If we assume that the
        vehicle is moving forward, and motor 100 rotating and valves 128
        and 90 are both open, the motor will be in a neutral condition
        and oil from reservoir 72 will flow through valve 128, motor 100
        and valve 90 back to the reservoir 72. </p>
      <p>Motor 100 has two ports 98 and 102, respectively referred to as
        the inlet and outlet ports. The inlet port 98 of the motor 100
        is connected by a "forward" solenoid valve 88 to the accumulator
        40 and by a "brake" solenoid valve 128 to the reservoir 72. The
        outlet port 102 of the motor 100 is connected by a "reverse"
        solenoid valve 130 to the accumulator and by a "neutral"
        solenoid valve 90 to the reservoir. </p>
      <p>To drive the automobile forward, the driver closes switch 80
        preferably placing the system in the condition shown in FIG. 2,
        and opens switch 120. Closing the switch 80 causes energization
        of solenoid 84. Opening switch 120 de-energizes solenoid 124.
        Thus, valve 88 opens and valve 128 closes. The liquid 38 then is
        forced from the line 42 or 46 through line 92, the valve 88,
        lines 94 and 96; port 98 of motor 100; the motor 100; port 102
        of the motor 100; lines 104 and 106; the valve 90, and line 108
        to the line 66 leading to the pump through a line 107, a check
        valve 109 and lines 111 and 54 if the engine is running. If the
        engine is not running, the oil will flow through line 68 to the
        reservoir 72. The motor is connected to drive axle 110 and
        drives drive wheels 112 of the automobile in a forward
        direction. </p>
      <p>To drive the automobile in reverse, the driver places the
        system in the condition thereon shown in FIG. 3 by actuating a
        switch in the driving compartment and depressing the
        accelerator. The switches 80 and 82 are open and switches 120
        and 122 are closed to energize solenoid windings 124 and 126 to
        open valves 128 and 130. The liquid 38 pumped from the pump 14
        or flow from accumulator 40, then flows from the line 46 through
        line 140, the valve 130, lines 142 and 104, the motor 100, lines
        96 and 144, the valve 128 and line 146. </p>
      <p>To brake the automobile, the system is placed by the driver in
        the condition shown in FIG. 4, by removing his foot from the
        accelerator. The switch 120 is closed to cause the valve 128 to
        open. The motor 100 then acts as a pump to pump the liquid 38
        from the line 146 through the valve 128, lines 144 and 96; the
        motor 100; lines 104 and 150; check valve 152 and lines 154, 44
        and 42 to the accumulator 40. </p>
      <p>To start the engine 10 under a condition in which there is
        insufficient pressure in the accumulator 40 to start the engine,
        the driver closes the switch 18 to open the valves 36 and 37 and
        closes the switch 120. The automobile then is pushed, or coasted
        downhill, and the motor 100 is in its pumping phase (braking)
        and pumps the liquid 38 through the valve 152 to the accumulator
        and the pump 14, which is thereby driven as a motor to turn over
        the engine and start it. Also, a handpump (not shown) could be
        used to pump oil from the reservoir into the accumulator. </p>
      <p>An adjustable relief valve 160 is provided to prevent the
        pressure in the accumulator from exceeding a predetermined
        maximum, for example, 3,200 pounds per square inch. The pressure
        switch 22 is set to be closed to start the engine 10 whenever
        the pressure is less than a desired predetermined minimum, for
        example, 1,700 pounds per square inch. The switch 22 is set to
        open the contacts 20 and 26 at the upper limit of the desired
        operating ranges, for example, 2,800 pounds per square inch. The
        motor 100 then is driven by the accumulator 40 alone, without
        the engine 10, until the pressure goes below a lower limit of,
        for example 1,700 pounds per square inch, the switch 22 then
        closing the contacts 20 and 26. </p>
      <p>For starting, using the pump as a starter motor, the the engine
        10 is turned over very rapidly as the starter motor is capable
        of providing as much horsepower as the engine. This rapid
        starting of the engine eliminates pollutants during the frequent
        stop/start cycle of the engine. <br>
