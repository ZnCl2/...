          <p><b>by</b> </p>
          <p><b>Dr O. M. Kalinin, Dr Hartmut Mueller, K.S. Surina</b> </p>
          <p><i>St Petersburg State Univ. Res. Inst. of Cosmic Energy</i></p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In October 2000 an opening of
          Research Institute on Cosmic Energy (RICE) took palce in
          Munich. The opening of a branch institute in St petersburg is
          planned to be done in a year. Official materials were
          published in the magazine <i>Raum und Zeit</i> (<i>Space and
            Time</i>) # 109 and #110 (2001),
          http://www.raum-und-zeit.com . A gravito-electrical
          transformer of cosmic energy was shown in the presentation of
          the Institute. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Transformation of energy is a
          central notion in universal (analytical) electrodynamics by
          Maxwell-Zubov. Acad. Vladimir I. Zubov studied the unification
          of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Eighler's
          rotatory mechanics with three Eighler's angles (precession,
          nutation and proper rotation) is opposed to Newtonian
          translational mechanics. Proper rotation is usually called
          rotation, twisting or torsion. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1995 Dr Oleg M. Kalinin
          successfully defended his doctoral thesis on the topic
          "Mathematical biology and quantification". But higher
          Certifying Commission of Russia organized a blockage of this
          thesis. The main opponent was the biophysical cathedra of
          Moscow State university. Research Institute of Cosmic Energy
          was established for the development of this theme. The main
          report on the topic of the theme lasted more than one hour.
          Director of RICE Dr Hartmut Mueller demonstrated a
          gravitational electric unit made of minerals of serpentine
          (negative potential "minus", laminated silicate) and quartz
          (positive potential "plus", tectosilicate). This so-called
          Munich jar is a real perpetual energy source: according to our
          calculation a small 3 watt lamp will work about 3 x 10^6
          years. In this energy source the transformational process of
          hydrogen and helium takes place and the catalyst of this
          process is silicon, 28/14 Si. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The informational equations of 1972
          lie in the base of this theory (Kalinin, 1972, Problems of
          Cybernetics, part 25, pp 107-117). In 1982 Dr Mueller found
          general solutions of informational equations. it was the
          constant of strong interactions, reverse constant of
          electromagnetic interactions and reverse constant of
          gravitational interactions. The Munich jar is a real example
          of electromagnetic and gravitational unification. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Gravitation and electric source of
          energy (Munich jar) also can work as a means of
          telecommunication. The Munich jar transforms the energy of
          gravity waves to electric energy. A reverse process is
          possible, i.e., the modulation of gravity waves and transfer
          of information by means of them. This communication already
          works between Munich and Erfurt. It is planned to make
          communications between Munich and St Petersburg in October
          2001. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Miniature Munich jars have the size
          of 6 x 8 mm are applied in a new medical device. which
          protects a man from the negative effect of low-frequency
          electromagnetic fields of technical origin in the band from
          1-100 Hz. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Another miniature Munich jar having
          the size of 12 x 16 mm also are applied in a new medical
          device, which makes the healing of wounds 2-3 times guicker. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">More information can be found at
          www.raum-und-zeit.com, in the magazine issue #109/2001, page
          70, 66-73 and 105/2000, page 5-10. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Some Notes from Faraday Lab Ltd.
            ---</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We have been acquainted with Acad.
          Zubov from 1989 up to his death. besides the interesting
          discussions (particularly on the topic of inertialess
          non-reactive motion) I should mention his kind willingness to
          give organizational support for new ideas in science. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Concerning the above-mentioned
          Munich jar, I think this effect is a demosntration of
          electro-gravitational phenomena described by T.T. Brown in his
          patents of 1927-1965. Certain materials including complex
          silicates, laminates and clays and certain rare earth elements
          decrease its weight due to tribo-excitation. "The result is
          not only real loss of weight, but such materials suffer a
          retardation in gravitational acceleration (value "g"), writes
          T.T. Brown in his article "Method of Producing Gravitationally
          Anomalous Materials". The method of excitation is a mechanical
          friction only (it is called "tribo-excitation"). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Munich jar, about which we
          wrote above, involves special materials mentioned in Brown's
          articles to the process of electro-gravitational energy
          exchange. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We are interested in the
          development of this research topic, if there will be adequate
          investments from the customer. Commercial application of this
          technology is possible in telecommunication, energetics,
          aerospace and medicine. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Process for thermally joining
          components made from silicate materials and silicate composite
          materials comprises heating the components (B) to be joined in
          a region around their joining site (S) to a pre-heating
          temperature below its softening point; and adding additional
          heat energy to the components at the joining site to heat the
          components to a joining temperature which lies at or above the
          temperature of each softening point. An Independent claim is
          also included for a device for thermally joining components
          made from silicate materials and silicate composite materials
          comprising a first heater for heating the components (B) to be
          joined in a region around their joining site (S) to a
          pre-heating temperature below its softening point; and a
          second heater for adding additional heat energy to the
          components at the joining site to heat the components to a
          joining temperature which lies at or above the temperature of
          each softening point. Preferred Features: Additional energy is
          applied using a laser beam (L) which moves back and forth
          along the joining site.<br>
