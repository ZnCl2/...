    <blockquote>On May 22, researchers at Osaka University presented the
      first demonstration of cold fusion since an unsuccessful attempt
      in 1989 that has clouded the field to this day.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>To many people, cold fusion sounds too good to be true.
      The idea is that, by creating nuclear fusion at room temperature,
      researchers can generate a nearly unlimited source of power that
      uses water as fuel and produces almost zero waste. Essentially,
      cold fusion would make oil obsolete.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>However, many experts debate whether money should be
      spent on cold fusion research or applied to more realistic
      alternative energy solutions. For decades, researchers around the
      world have been simply trying to show that cold fusion is indeed
      possible, but they´ve yet to take that important first step.
      <p>Now, esteemed Physics Professor Yoshiaki Arata of Osaka
        University in Japan claims to have made the first successful
        demonstration of cold fusion. Last Thursday, May 22, Arata and
        his colleague Yue-Chang Zhang of Shianghai Jiotong University
        presented the cold fusion demonstration to 60 onlookers,
        including other physicists, as well as reporters from six major
        newspapers and two TV studios. If Arata and Zhang´s
        demonstration is real, it could lead to a future of new, clean,
        and cheap energy generation. </p>
      <p>In their experiment, the physicists forced deuterium gas into a
        cell containing a mixture of palladium and zirconium oxide,
        which absorbed the deuterium to produce a dense "pynco"
        deuterium. In this dense state, the deuterium nuclei from
        different atoms were so close together that they fused to
        produce helium nuclei. </p>
      <p>Evidence for the occurrence of this fusion came from measuring
        the temperature inside the cell. When Arata first injected the
        deuterium gas, the temperature rose to about 70° C (158° F),
        which Arata explained was due to nuclear and chemical reactions.
        When he turned the gas off, the temperature inside the cell
        remained warmer than the cell wall for 50 hours, which Arata
        said was an effect of nuclear fusion. </p>
      <p>While Arata´s demonstration looked promising to his audience,
        the real test is still to come: duplication. Many scientists and
        others are now recalling the infamous 1989 demonstration by
        Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, who claimed to produce
        controlled nuclear fusion in a glass jar at room temperature.
        However, no one - including Fleischmann and Pons - could
        duplicate the experiment, leading many people to consider cold
        fusion a pseudoscience to this day. </p>
      <p>But one witness at the recent demonstration, physicist Akito
        Takahashi of Osaka University, thought that the experiment
        should be able to be repeated. </p>
      <p>"Arata and Zhang demonstrated very successfully the generation
        of continuous excess energy [heat] from ZrO2-nano-Pd sample
        powders under D2 gas charging and generation of helium-4,"
        Takahashi told New Energy Times. "The demonstrated live data
        looked just like data they reported in their published papers [<i>J.










          High Temp. Soc. Jpn</i>, Feb. and March issues, 2008]. This
        demonstration showed that the method is highly reproducible." </p>
      <p>In addition, researchers will have to repeat the experiment
        with larger amounts of the palladium and zirconium oxide mixture
        in order to generate larger quantities of energy.</p>

      <p>Bangalore, May 27 (IANS) Researchers in Japan have given a live
        public demonstration of their cold fusion device, a historic
        experiment that is likely to revive global interest in this
        controversial method of energy generation that was earlier
        debunked as nonsense. A report in the California-based New
        Energy Times says the tabletop device built by Osaka University
        physicist Yoshiaki Arata and his associate Yue Chang Zhang
        continuously generated excess energy in the form of heat and
        also produced helium particles. </p>
      <p>“The demonstration showed their method was highly
        reproducible,” the report quoted physicist Akito Takahashi, one
        of the 60 persons from industry and universities who witnessed
        it, as saying. </p>
      <p>The demonstration held on May 22 has drawn immediate praise
        from Mahadeva Srinivasan, a cold fusion pioneer and formerly
        associate director of physics at the Bhabha Atomic Research
        Centre (BARC) in Mumbai. </p>
      <p>“The cold fusion community is excited and is reverberating with
        news of a live public demo,” Srinivasan told IANS from Chennai.
        “The field is truly ripe for Indian labs to enter and it is
        hoped that we won’t miss the bus once again.” </p>
      <p>The fusion process that powers the sun requires extreme
        temperature and pressure to force hydrogen nuclei fuse and
        release energy. Achieving fusion at room temperature was
        considered impossible until 1989 when American scientists Martin
        Fleischmann and Stanley Pons startled the world with their
        tabletop experiment. </p>
      <p>They connected a battery to a pair of palladium electrodes
        immersed in a jar of water containing deuterium (heavier form of
        hydrogen) and showed their electrolytic cell produced heat
        energy in excess of what was consumed. They claimed that
        deuterium nuclei were being packed into the palladium’s lattice
        in such a way for fusion to take place. </p>
      <p>Later it was shown by several groups including Srinivasan and
        Padmanabha Krishnagopala Iyengar at BARC in the early 1990s that
        the reaction produced tritium as well as helium indicating that
        cold fusion was real. However, further work at BARC was
        abandoned due to denunciation of cold fusion by mainstream
        scientists and the US government. </p>
      <p>Srinivasan hopes that Arata’s public demonstration in Japan
        will give new birth to cold fusion research in India. </p>
      <p>Arata, who is the recipient of Japan’s highest award, the
        Emperor’s Prize, is the first person to have performed
        thermonuclear fusion research in Japan. Arata and his colleague
        Zhang have been reporting their work on cold fusion at various
        conferences and in Japanese journals for the last 10 years. </p>
      <p>In recent years, they have moved away from electrolysis and
        switched over to direct loading of deuterium gas into a matrix
        of zirconium oxide containing palladium nanoparticles. In their
        latest demonstration, they showed excess heat production
        commenced almost instantaneously when pure deuterium gas at high
        pressure was let in. </p>
      <p>“The high operating temperature, instant response and
        reliability of this device make it the most practical form of
        cold fusion yet developed,” said Jed Rothwell, author of a
        popular book on cold fusion and another witness to the
        demonstration. </p>
      <p>The Japanese demo comes three months after some of India’s
        leading nuclear physicists at a meeting in Bangalore formally
        recommended to the government to revive cold fusion research in
        India. </p>
      <p>“The long neglect of this area (of research) by India must end
        now,” Malur Ramaswamy Srinivasan, former secretary to the
        Department of Atomic Energy, told the meeting held at the
        National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore on Jan 9. </p>
      <p>According to Mahadeva Srinivasan, the Central Electrochemical
        Research Institute in Karaikudi, the Indian Institute of
        Technology in Chennai, and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic
        Research near Chennai have shown interest in restarting the
        work. </p>
      <p>He said the field of cold fusion (which has been renamed as low
        energy nuclear reactions or LENR) has matured sufficiently to
        claim recognition as a valid new branch of science. </p>
      <p>“If all that is claimed by the LENR community is validated,” he
        said, “the prospects of this being developed into a ‘third
        alternative option’ for generating nuclear energy in the 21st
        century, besides fission and thermonuclear fusion, are bright.”

      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- A method of producing ultrahigh pressure
        gas statically and stably without using a dynamic driving unit
        such as a pump. A container formed with a closed space is made
        of a palladium, which is a metal having a high permeability to
        hydrogen and deuterium. A solution present around the container
        is electrolyzed by producing an electric field between the
        container which serves as a cathode and an anode. The gas
        element produced by electrolysis penetrates into the container
        body, so that the hydrogen/deuterium ion concentration in the
        container increases. This solid-air equilibrium reaction is
        carried out until the ion concentration increases to a level at
        which the pressure in the closed space reaches a predetermined
        ultrahigh level. Thus, an ultrahigh pressure gas is produced in
        the closed space of the container. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --</b> PURPOSE: To generate thermal energy at a
        high efficiency with high reproducibility by causing an abnormal
        reaction based on normal temperature nuclear fusion by absorbing
        highly dense liquid heavy hydrogen with super fine palladium
        powder in saturated state of a super high concentration.
        CONSTITUTION: Super fine palladium powder Pd is sealed in a
        pressure resistant vacuum container 1 made of a stainless steel
        and after the inside of the container is evacuated to vacuum by
        a vacuum pump 6V, heavy hydrogen gas D2 is introduced into the
        container by a pressure pump 6P. After being filled with heavy
        hydrogen gas D2 , the container 1 is cooled by a cryostat 10 to
        liquify the heavy hydrogen gas D2 , and after the liquified
        heavy hydrogen is absorbed in the super fine powder until
        becoming the saturated state of a super high concentration to
        cause an abnormal reaction, the whole body of the container is
        heated. While retaining the heavy hydrogen in high concentration
        in the super fine powder by inner pressure produced at the time
        of heating, normal temperature nuclear fusion occurs to generate
        thermal energy. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- PURPOSE:To enable efficient deuterium
        nuclear fusion by using a container filled with powder of a
        great deuterium absorption property as a cathode, and effecting
        electrolysis in a deuterium solution serving as an electrolyte.
        CONSTITUTION:A pressure vessel 1 made from Pd is filled with Pd
        powder 2 and a lid 3 made from Pd is welded to the container 1
        to constitute a cathode 6. A liquid vessel 7 is filled with a
        heavy water solution 8 of LiOD and the cathode 6 and a
        cylindrical platinum anode 9 surrounding the cathode are both
        immersed in the solution 8. When electricity is passed between
        both electrodes 6, 9 via lead wires 5, 10, part of generator
        deuterium generated by electrolysis gets into the wall of the
        vessel 1 and then starts to be absorbed into the powder 2 while
        generating heat of dissolution. The remaining deuterium atoms
        are bonded together and float up as bubbles of deuterium gas.
        During electrolysis, the electrolyte 8 has a temperature rise
        near the surface of the cathode 6 because of resistive heating,
        raising the temperature of the cathode 6. As the concentration
        of deuterium in the powder 2 approaches a saturated state at
        elevated temperatures, the deuterium atoms undergo nuclear
        fusion reaction together, so continuously generating heat in
        excess of the resistive heating and the heat of dissolution. </p>
