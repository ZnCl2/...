      'The usual subdivision of science into chemical, physical,
      botanical, and other departments, necessary for the sake of
      clarity and convenience in teaching, soon began to dominate the
      outlook and work of these institutions. The problems of
      agriculture -- a vast biological complex_began to be subdivided
      much the same way as the teaching of science. Here it was not
      justified, for the subject dealt with could never be divided, it
      being beyond the capacity of the plant or animal to sustain its
      life processes in separate phases. It eats, drinks, breathes,
      sleeps, digests, moves, sickens, suffers or recovers, and reacts
      to all its surroundings, friends and enemies in the course of
      twenty-four-hours. Neither can any of its operations be carried on
      apart from all the others; in fact, agriculture deals with
      organized entities, and agriculture research is bound to recognize
      this truth at the starting point of its investigations,<br>
      <br>
      In doing this, but adopting the artificial divisions of science as
      at present, established conventional research on a subject like
      agriculture was bound to involve itself and magnificently has got
      itself bogged down. An immense amount of work is being done, each
      tiny portion is a separate compartment; a whole army of
      investigators has been recruited; a regular 'profession been
      invented. The absurdity of team work has been devised as a remedy
      for the fragmentation which need never have occurred. This is
      nonsensical. Agricultural investigation is so difficult that it
      will always demand a very special combination of qualities which
      from the nature of the case is rare. A real investigator for such
      a subject can never be created by the mere accumulation of the
      special and rare.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the administration claims that agricultural research
      is now organized, having substituted that dreary precept for the
      soul-shaking principle of that essential freedom needed by the
      seeker after truth. The natural universe, which is one, has been
      halved, quartered, fractionized, and woe betide the investigator
      who looks at any segment other than his own! Departmentalism is
      recognized in its worst and last form when councils and
      super-committees are established; they grade (?) the latest
      exercises, whose purpose is to prevent so-called overlapping...
      strictly.... to hold each man to his allotted narrow path and
      above all to enable the bureaucrat to dodge his responsibilities.<br>
      <br>
      --- "The Soil and Health", by Sir Albert Howard<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BREAD FROM STONES</span><br>
      <br>
      Years ago while I was enjoying leisure travels in Ireland, I
      picked up a book titled "Farming end Gardening for Health and
      Disease," by Sir Albert Howard. It was read, or I should say
      scanned, so quickly that I retained only dim memories of its
      content. What I do remember is that it dwelled on farming
      techniques in India that have been in use since ancient celtic
      times by the Irish.<br>
      <br>
      My bible for pre-World War II Irish farming is the masterpiece
      'Irish Heritage"by the astute professor of Queens University,
      Belfast, E. Estyne Evans. It is the only book I have two copies
      of- one in my lab, and one in my den.<br>
      <br>
      I had, between 1944 end 1946, before deadly chemical farming
      intruded, lived in Fermanagh County, Northern Ireland on the
      Donegal border. I was, in truth, a sergeant in the Arrny Air
      Corps, but may as well have been a 19th-Century potato farmer, for
      I was far more interested in the natural history and agriculture
      of the beautiful Erne Valley than I was in the exactitudes of my
      job as a low-frequency radio range technician.<br>
      <br>
      Liebig, a laboratory chemist, equated life with NKP. I doubt very
      much if as a lad he ever chewed on a fresh piece of grass on his
      back while cloud watching. He published Chemistry in
      theApplication to Agriculture around 1840. His book preceded the
      great book on soil formation by Charles Darwin titled The
      Formation of Vegetable Mould Through theActions of Worms, with
      Observations of Their Habits. This book shines as Darwin's real
      aura of genius, not his treatise on the unprovable but elegant
      theory of evolution.God probably has a hundred differentways of
      creating life, evolution being only one among many. Like
      creationism, it is a reductionist either/or science. Because
      Darwin, like Liebig end other biological chemists, overlooked the
      elegant work of the two T's, John Tyndell and Nikola Tesla, they
      failed miserably in their understanding of naturel forces. It
      remained for another chemist, Julius Hensel, to point the way with
      his beautifully titled book, Bread from Stones. He also had little
      use for the concepts of von Liebig. He talks about von
      Liebig's"mistake":<br>
      <br>
      Ideas that are meaningful develop slowly. Sometime, long after I
      left Ireland, I came to realize that plants, insects and soil (all
      loves of mine), and the nebulous photons of electronic systems
      were all in one. Everything is connected to everything to
      everything else, especially by the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      If I had really paid much attention to what Sir Albert was writing
      about I would have, even in my younger days, realized that his
      life's work was built on a solid foundation and keen understanding
      of the inner connectedness of all of nature. He had little use for
      the reductionist method eof modern science. I might add, neither
      do I! More than any other agricultural scientist of his time he
      understood that reductionism, like communism, might wel lead to
      the destruction of viable agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      Physics is the science that connects chemistry to biology. That
      being so, a scientist that does not have a basic understanding of
      physics is more ignorant of life than a leaping flea hopper that
      at least knows it must jump (physics) to feed (chemistry) on a
      plant (biology).<br>
      <br>
      I was delighted when in the mid 1970s I learned that my editor
      Devin Garrity of the Devin-Adair Company had published Sir
      Albert's book in the United States. He gave me a copy of the book
      under the new title <span style="font-style: italic;">The Soil
        and Health</span>. Needless to say I studied it more thoroughly
      this time around.<br>
      <br>
      Soil end Health is, of course, about the biological-chemical make
      up of agriculture. It is one of the original treatises on
      composting and crop rotation. It also talks about the mess that
      the German chemist Justus von Liebig stared in agriculture with
      his "pure" chemistry concept of plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      Liebig, a laboratory chemist, equated life with NKP. I doubt very
      much if as a lad he ever chewed on a freshpiece of grass on his
      back while cloud watching.<br>
      <br>
      Liebig; published Chemistry in the Application to Agriculture
      around 1840. His look preceded the great book on soil formation by
      Charles Darwin titled The Formations of Vegetable Mould Through
      the Actions of Worms, with Observations of Their Habits. His book
      shines as Darwin's real aura of genius, not his treatise on the
      unprovable but elegant theory of evolution. God probably has a
      hundred different ways of creating life, evolution being only one
      among many.<br>
      <br>
      Like creationism, it is a reductionist either-or science. Because
      Darwin, like Liebig end other biological chemists, overlooked the
      elegant work of the two T's, John Tyndell and Nikola Tesla, they
      failed miserably in their understanding of natural forces. It
      remained for another chemist, Julius Hensel, to point the way with
      his beautifully titled book, Bread from Stones. He also had little
      use for the concepts of von Liebig. He talks about von Liebig's
      "mistake":<br>
      <br>
      Very simply, Liebig was the first agricultural chemist. He found
      that the ashes which remained from grain mainly consisted of
      phosphate of potassa. From this he concluded that phosphate of
      potassa must be restored to the soil, and that was very one-sided
      Liebig had forgotten so take the straw into account, in which only
      small quantities of phosphoric acid are found, because this
      substance during the process of maturing passes from the stalk
      into the grain. If he had not only calculated the seed but also
      the roots and the stalks, he would have found what we know at this
      day, that in the whole plants there is much more lime and magnesia
      as potassa and soda, and thal phosphoric acid forms only the tenth
      part of the sum of these basic constituents. Unfortunately Liebig
      also was of the opinion that potassa and phosphoric acid have to
      be restored to the soil as such, while anyone might have concluded
      that instead of the exhausted soil we must supply earthly matter
      from which nothing has been grown. Such untouched earthly material
      of primitive strength we get by pulverizing rocks into which
      potassa, soda, lime, magnesia, manganese and iron are combined
      with silica, alumina, phosphoric acid, fluorine and sulfur. Among
      these substances fluotine, which is found in mica -minerals, has
      been neglected by Liebig, by all his followers, and has never been
      contained in any artificial fertilizer. But as we know from later
      investigations that fluorine is regularly found even in white and
      yellowbirds' eggs, we must acknowledge it is something essential
      to the organism. Chickens get this fluorine and other earthy
      constituents when they have a chance to pick up little slivers of
      granite. Where this is denied them. as in a wooden hen house, they
      succumb to chicken cholera and chicken diphtheria. The key to
      Bread from Stones is contained in this one paragraph where he
      says, 'we must supply earthy material" and later "little slivers
      of granite."<br>
      <br>
      His use of the word granite implies that he not only knew that
      good soil is made&nbsp; from eroded stone but also which kind of
      stone was best suited to a viable agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      Because he was a chemist, like von Liebig he emphasized the
      chemical constituents of stone, and therein lies the crux of what
      this and subsequent articles are about. It is a dismaying fact
      that there are some rocks, including some granite, that when
      ground up and added to the soil (they may contain all the afore
      mentioned chemicals) accomplish little for plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      The simple and irrefutable fact is that if the force, called in
      the physics handbook paramagnetism, is not in the stone, although
      certain proportions of the chemicals are, little benefit will
      accrue.<br>
      <br>
      This series is about that force, one among many, but the one most
      often missing from poor soil around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Poor soil produces sick plants, and since insects are scavengers
      they are attracted to both old and sick plants. They are nature's
      recyclers.<br>
      <br>
      Crop plants should be young as they are harvested to eat. If they
      are young and healthy, insect losses are almost nil. If they are
      young and sick, losses from insects can be devastating.<br>
      <br>
      We will deal then with growing healthy plants, but it does not
      imply excluding the need to learn about the other two necessities
      of agriculture: composting and soil organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Books on composting and soil organisms abound. Add them to these
      words, and all of the ingredients of a flourishing and viable
      agriculture will attain.<br>
      <br>
      Composting, Organisms of the soil, and the Paramagnetic force
      (COP) might well prevent a worldwide famine from destroying
      mankind.<br>
      <br>
      One last thought; this is for farmers, but it equally applies to
      all of an ecological mindset who, in positions of leadership, are
      attempting to save our wilderness and our wildlife from
      destruction.<br>
      <br>
      Because plants are healthy and do not attract hoards of insects
      does not mean that insectivorous wild creatures, e.g.birds, will
      suffer. The hoards of redwinged blackbirds that descend on corn
      infested with corn earworm larvae not only further damage the
      corn, but would live more beneficially in the cattail marshes free
      from insecticide-contaminated crops.<br>
      <br>
      One half of the population of North America wood warblers has
      disappeared over the last twenty years-probably due in part to
      insecticides veld freely by the American agribusiness industry to
      the Central and South American Countries to which North America
      warblers migrate. There are few government controls in certain
      southern regions on the spread of insecticides by the tons. There
      are more pounds per acre utilized worldwide now than when Rachel
      Carson wrote Silent Spring, that epic treatise on the subject.<br>
      <br>
      Insecticides and weed killers are the modern curse of
      environmental health, we do not and never did need them. The
      simple fact is they both destroy viable soil. A healthy soil
      ecology through healthy agriculture means a healthy world
      population reinforced by that most democratic foundation: the
      family farm.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">VOLCANOES</span><br>
      <br>
      ...The physics of volcano formation is a surface phenomena that
      follows large earthquakes triggered by a subsurface movement of
      what geologists call tectonic plates. The earth is made up of a
      number of such huge platelike platforms floating on a sea of
      viscous, flowing, iron-rich, glassy rock called magma. The more
      brittle crust rock on top moves about separating-colliding and
      triggering powerful interactions that, over eons of time, effect
      the physical makeup of the earth's surface.These moving
      continental plates are the mountain and ocean builders of time.<br>
      <br>
      Volcanic cones usually arise and form in chains where the denser
      subsurface mantle rock is carried by a portion of the molten
      magma.<br>
      <br>
      Theorists believe that the thermal energy required for convective
      movement within the mantle, and the melting of the viscous
      material, is caused by the disintegration of small amounts of the
      radioactive elements of uranium, thorium and potassium contained
      within the earth surfaces. In other words, complex and terrifying
      energies of molten rock generate steam that expands, and under
      tremendous pressure, bursts through the surface crust, forming
      volcanic cones and spewing out, so to speak, our most fertile
      soils.<br>
      <br>
      Few realize that if the theorists are correct (and they do make
      sense), our earth is one huge soil-forming, atomic-steam
      powerplant and that a volcano is in reality the steam explosion of
      an atomic energy system.<br>
      <br>
      The silicate formed by the partial atomic-steam explosion end then
      thrown off by active volcanoes gives rise in atmosphere, where it
      is cooled, to a form of rock called basalt.<br>
      <br>
      A moving plate curves down beneath a crust plate where friction,
      added to the atomic pump, feeds the melt. This energy cracks the
      earth under pressure and carries the liquid basalt rock upward
      where dust and rock forms the cone and the folds round the cone.<br>
      <br>
      Of course this is a simplified description of the whole process
      which in detail is complex beyond all imagination. It has,
      however, been researched by numerous geologists over the years
      since the German meteorologists. Alfred Wegener, in a book titled
      The Origins of Continents and Oceans ( 1915), came upwith what is
      now known as the tectonic theory of land (continent.) formation.
      He was, of course, ridiculed in his own day.<br>

      Bread from Stones has been republished in English by Acres U.S.A.

      The ELF growth pattern force of energy focused into the ground by
      the paramagnetic soil, round towers, or rock can be easily plotted
      by planting radish seeds around the rock, round tower, or in veil
      mixed with ground up rock.<br>
      <br>
      In this red sandstone tower example it will be noted&nbsp; tower
      is oriented with the door facing 95- toward the rising sun in
      mid-September in Gainesville, Florida. In such a system, the least
      energy is to the east resulting in slow growth end small plant
      size and the greatest energy is to the west producing fast growth
      end large plant size . Side growth is intermediate. Such a plot
      based on plant size end root-dirt weigh tat an eight day harvest,
      is very similar to plots of energy from my World War II radio
      range station in Belleek.<br>
      <br>
      The largest root growth, with the most fine rootlets, is at top
      left to the west of the round tower. The smallest is at 95_east at
      the lower right of the photo. The north growth at the top right is
      slightly smaller than the south growth at bottom left.<br>
      <br>
      Note from compass that the strongest growth is to the east at 95_,
      in contrast to tower and tomb plantings. The higher growth rate
      and root complex is always off the sharp corner of such highly
      paramagnetic rocks. I first noticed this growth effect while
      climbing cliffs and searching rock canyons for eagle and falcon
      nests as a youth.<br>
      <br>
      Note energy is weak at front entrance and strong along the sides
      end rear. This model is of a Vermont megalithic stone structure.
      Constructed of diamagnetic wood interior and paramagnetic pink
      granite exterior.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that most healing/religious structures such as gothic
      cathedrals, round towers, and megalithic tombs are facing east so
      that the weak energy is at the entrance and the strong energy is
      at the back where the altar of hearing chamber is located. There
      is also stronger energy at the sides, where the arms of the tomb
      cross the main tuinnel as seen in gothic cathedrals.<br>
      <br>
      PICRAM, Photonic Ionic Cloth Radio Amplifier Maser, is my name for
      the patent (No. 5,247,933) I obtained for my ELF (extremely low
      frequency) antenne detector. As you censee from the bottom photo,
      it is mounted directly on the Tekmeter oscilloscope input with no
      leed. On the 5 mV range, it accurately measures ELF atmospheric
      waves generated bylightning which are detectable even underground
      in soil. These waves stimulate plant root growth.<br>
      <br>
      The PICRAM is constructed by soaking wool-linen clothor burlap in
      seawater. In the top photograph, the cloth is connected to a
      simple banana plug at the corner end wrappedaround the plastic of
      the plug where it is held in place by tworubber bands.<br>
      <br>
      Harry Kornburg, my patent co-author, translated the Hebrew which
      describes such a piece of cloth worn by the Jewish High Priest. It
      enhanced his immune system in order that he could safely examine
      lepers like those sent to him by Christ. The bible is by far the
      best science book for low energy systems ever written. The Hebrew
      name for my PICRAM ELF detector is Shatnez. It was worn as a long
      ribbon strap wrapped around the high priest's body.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      Professor Phil Callahan has suggested that paramagnetism
      represents "Light from Rocks to the Roots". His PCSM has
      effectively lifted an abstract concept into the realms of hard
      science.<br>
      <br>
      The revolutionary new PCSM Meter (Paramagnetic Count Soil Meter or
      Phil Callahan Soil Meter) offers a new dimension in fertility
      monitoring. Developed by Dr Phil Callahan, the meter accurately
      measures the paramagnetism of soil and other materials.
      Paramagnetism has been termed "The Missing Link" in high
      production agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefits</span><br>
      <br>
      * The PCSM can be used as a general fertility monitor - the higher
      the fertility the higher the CGS reading.<br>
      * The PCSM can be used to identify paramagnetic inputs for
      fertility building.<br>
      * This tool can often be used as a problem-solver when soil tests
      don't explain poor crop performance.<br>
      * The tool can be used to monitor the progress of nutrition
      programs.<br>
      * Note: A well-balanced, fertile soil will contain good levels of
      oxygen.<br>
      * Oxygen is a highly paramagnetic gas.<br>

          US2002125419<br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A solid-state, paramagnetic-diamagnetic maser for controlling the
      amplification and direction of electromagnetic emissions from a
      molecular control system, such as insect pheromones. The
      solid-state maser includes a paramagnetic layer of, for example, a
      mixture of andosite, basalt and granite. The paramagnetic layer is
      disposed onto a diamagnetic base. A burlap or hairy cloth
      impregnated with the molecular control system is placed over the
      paramagnetic layer, such that the paramagnetic energy amplifies
      the molecular control system to produce coherent or semi-coherent
      electromagnetic emissions. The molecular control system can be a
      semiochemical (such as, insect pheromones), garlic scent, perfume,
      deodorant, air freshener, similar molecules, infrared coded
      emissions from any system that controls or effects living
      organisms, and the like. The solid-state maser of the present
      invention is an organic and biodegradable device that is tuned and
      modulated by existing and naturally occurring atomospheric
      frequencies. Moreover the device provides a highly efficient and
      effective solution for pest control and improving plant growth,
      without having to exterminate the pests or distribute chemicals
      that may harm the environment or increase health risks for humans.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] The present invention is directed to a device for producing
      maser-like emissions and a method of fabrication. More
      particularly, the present invention relates to the stimulation of
      maser-like emissions from scents or other molecular control
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0006] 1.Background Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] Recent years have imposed major challenges on efforts to
      juxtapose effective pest control with sustaining the delicate
      balance between humans and nature. Mites, ticks, mosquitos, flies,
      other insects, worms, rodents and similar pests are firmly
      integrated into the Earth's ecosystem. They interact with the
      environment, and thus humans, as they search for food and shelter.
      Insects, for example, may be attracted to a number of naturally
      occurring phenomena, such as carbon dioxide resident in a person's
      breath, the makeup of a person's perspiration or the surface of
      the person's skin or hair, the fabric or color of clothing, scents
      emitting from personal cleansing products, lotions, and perfumes,
      and the like. As a result of an insect's attraction to these
      elements, people are naturally annoyed by pests during the course
      of a typical day. Additionally, insects and other pests frequently
      infect homes, schools, other buildings, gardens and farms as they
      continue their quests for food and shelter.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] To mitigate the harmful effects and nuisance of such
      animals, various types of chemicals have been engineered to repel
      or kill them. These chemicals include insecticides and other
      pesticides to directly control the animals, herbicides or weed
      killers to destroy their habitats, and fungicides to control mold
      or mildew. Unfortunately, not only do these chemicals harm or kill
      animals who perform an integral role in the Earth's ecosystem, but
      these deadly poisons and hazardous chemicals also reap harm on the
      environment in general. Pesticides used on farms, for instance,
      contaminate the fields as well as underground water supplies.
      Moreover, pesticides represent leading contributors to air and
      water pollution, and in many cases, infect and poison the food
      that they are intended to protect from insects.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The dangers of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides,
      fertilizers and similar hazardous chemicals are well documented.
      By contaminating the environment or the food they are intended to
      protect, these chemicals can contribute to the development of a
      variety of human physiological illnesses. Prolonged exposure to
      pesticides has been known to manifest nasal congestion, headaches,
      a dry throat, respiratory infections, skin reactions, nervous
      system damage, endocrine disorders, increased sensitivity to other
      chemicals, and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In fact, scientists contend that some of the chemical
      compounds used in pesticides cause irreversible harm to human
      brain cells or neurons. A recent scientific study has revealed
      that individuals exposed to pesticides in the home or garden are
      70% more likely to develop Parkinson's Disease than those who are
      not exposed. See "Pesticide exposure linked to Parkinson's
      disease," Chubb Lucy. (Environmental News Network Inc., May 2000).
      Because of their smaller bodies and developing nervous and
      respiratory systems, children are even more vulnerable to the
      harmful effects of pesticides than adults. Yet, schools are
      commonly sprayed with herbicides and pesticides to control the
      likes of yellow jackets, ants, weeds, fleas, mosquitoes, flies,
      cockroaches, ants, wasps, mold, mildew, bacteria and rodents.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] For example, organophosphates embody a commonly used class
      of pesticides. This chemical has been discovered to contribute to
      heart problems. Another commonly used substance around schools
      includes chlorpyifos that can fatally damage a child's
      nervous-system if inhaled in large doses. Another example is
      synthetic pyrethroids which include cypermethrin, a possible
      carcinogen. Diazinon, which is typically used on lawns, can cause
      nausea, dizziness, headaches and aching joints, and in large
      doses, can damage a child's nervous system. Other illness
      attributed to pesticides include childhood leukemia, soft-tissue
      sarcomas, brain cancers, asthma and other respiratory problems.
      See "Children face danger in the schoolyard grass from
      pesticides," Daniella Brower. (Cable News Network, March 2000). In
      short, these deadly chemicals destroy the nervous systems of not
      only pests but humans as well. Hence, the extended use of
      pesticides creates a significant risk to public health.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] As an alternative to chemical-based solutions, some
      scientists have revisited the laws of physics to use natural
      observations and experimentation to find healthier pest control
      methods. Through scientific observations, the inventors have
      discovered that insect spines, for example, are indeed real
      antenna that have properties comparable to dielectric antenna
      (e.g., plastic or polymeric substance). The inventors' research
      reveals that an insect's antennae functions similarly to a ten
      centimeter (cm) shortwave radar that can be used to smell the
      exhaust of electronics. In other words, an insect's antennae
      receives and processes electromagnetic radiation vibrating at a
      natural frequency signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Thus, by designing an apparatus capable of transmitting
      electromagnetic radiation within a desired frequency range, one
      can attract or repel insects and other pests. This concept is
      explored in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,551 to Callahan,
      issued Jun. 13, 1995, and entitled "Frequency Emitter for Control
      of Insects" (hereinafter referred to as "the '551 patent"), and
      commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,049, issued Jun. 18, 1996,
      and entitled "Frequency Emitter for Control of Insects"
      (hereinafter referred to as "the '049 patent"). The disclosure of
      the '551 patent and the '049 patent is incorporated herein by
      reference as though set forth in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The system described in the '551 patent utilizes natural or
      copied scatter surfaces, dielectric spine forms (representing, for
      example, an insect's sensilla), correct pumping radiations, and
      correct vibratory modulating frequency to generate coherent or
      semi-coherent frequencies to control or attract insects. The
      coherent or semi-coherent frequencies can act as either attractant
      radiation (e.g., trapping) or frequency quenching radiation (e.g.,
      jamming). Similarly, the system of the '049 patent uses pumping
      radiation and either molecular vibratory modulation or a scatter
      surface to generate coherent or semi-coherent radiation
      frequencies to control or attract insects.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The inventors' research shows that the systems of the '551
      patent or '049 patent work very well over short distances, but
      experiences power loss and becomes less efficient over larger
      ranges. Experiments by the inventors reveal that the trap of the
      '551 patent attracted moths over a four inch distance. This device
      functions as a flowing model that works very well over very short
      distances, but is inefficient because of power loss between the
      elements. The spacing between the components of the device are far
      apart, so a considerable amount of power is lost from component to
      component.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Consequently, a system and method are needed to solve the
      above-identified problems and provide an efficient solution for
      controlling insects and other pests in a manner that reduces
      pollution and medical risks.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0017] The system and method of present invention overcome the
      problems of inefficient gaseous, pest control systems with minimum
      output by providing a paramagnetic-diamagnetic system as an
      efficient solid-state maser system that works over long distances.
      Moreover, the maser system is capable of controlling the
      amplification and direction of electromagnetic emissions from any
      molecular control system, such as a semiochemical (e.g., insect
      pheromones), garlic scent, perfume, deodorant, air freshener,
      similar molecules, infrared coded emissions from any system that
      controls or effects living organisms (such as, drugs,
      pharmaceuticals, etc.), and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In an embodiment of the present invention, the maser system
      includes a layer of paramagnetic material. The paramagnetic layer
      can include any combination of andosite, basalt, granite,
      polyester film and other paramagnetic materials having a level of
      paramagnetism ranging from 1 to 14,000 centimeter-gram-seconds
      (cgs).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The paramagnetic layer is typically deposited onto a
      diamagnetic base that provides a housing or structural support for
      the maser system. The diamagnetic base can be composed of quartz,
      wood, plant fibers, leather, plastic, and other diamagnetic
      materials having a level of diamagnetism ranging from -1 to -4,000
      cgs.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In an embodiment, a burlap or hairy cloth is soaked or
      impregnated with the molecular control system, and placed over the
      paramagnetic layer. The paramagnetic energy amplifies the
      molecular control system to produce coherent or semi-coherent
      electromagnetic emissions at a desired frequency, phase and
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In an embodiment, the electromagnetic emissions are
      modulated or tuned to the surrounding environment. The Callahan
      frequencies are used to modulate the solid-state maser system. The
      size of the maser system can also be adjusted to tune the maser
      system to match the resonant, paramagnetic atmospheric
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A feature of the present invention is that it provides an
      organic and biodegradable device for pest control. Furthermore,
      the device is designed to be tuned and modulated by existing and
      naturally occurring atmospheric frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a
      highly efficient and effective solution for maintaining pest
      populations below desired threshold levels and protecting food
      supplies without killing the animals, depleting the ozone layer or
      endangering the health of children and adults, alike.<br>

      <br>
      [0035] I. Overview<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Throughout history, farmers have been known to distribute
      ground-up paramagnetic rock in their fields to revitalize the soil
      and stimulate plant or crop growth. Paramagnetic rock generally
      directs and amplifies organic energy in a single direction. The
      organic energy actually converges like a beam as it passes through
      a medium, such as the ground or air. Hence, this paramagnetic
      force functions as a magnetic modulator and stimulant for plant
      growth and increased agricultural output. As will be demonstrated
      below, the present invention is a paramagnetic-diamagnetic system
      that can be used to grow plants, as well as provide an organic,
      biodegradable solution for pest control without polluting the
      environment or increasing medical risks, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The paramagnetic-diamagnetic system of the present
      invention is a solid-state maser that is configurable to control
      the amplification and direction of electromagnetic waves over a
      wide band of frequencies, primarily in the radio, microwave and
      infrared spectrum, but including all regions of the frequency
      spectrum. More specifically, the system of the present invention
      controls the amplification and direction of electromagnetic
      radiation that is emitted from a molecular control system, such as
      a semiochemical, garlic scent, perfume, deodorant, air freshener,
      similar molecules, infrared coded emissions from any system that
      controls or effects living organisms (such as, drugs,
      pharmaceuticals, etc.), and the like. A semiochemical includes any
      secretory substance, such as insects pheromones, that regulates
      behavior in members of the same species.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] A molecular control system (also referred to herein as "the
      control molecule") contains ions whose energy levels can be
      shifted by a magnetic field. According to the present invention,
      the magnetic field is supplied by a paramagnetic force. In
      response to the application of the paramagnetic force, the
      molecular control system, in essence, can be modulated to amplify
      a desired frequency. This is accomplished by using a paramagnetic
      photon to induce the excited atom or molecule to shift energy
      states and, thereby, emit a photon of the same frequency as the
      paramagnetic photon. The emitted photon would also travel in the
      same direction and in phase with the paramagnetic photon. The
      amplitudes of the waves produced by the emitted and paramagnetic
      photons are aggregated to produce the amplification.<br>

      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B illustrate a paramagnetic-diamagnetic
      maser 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. As
      shown, FIG. 1B illustrates a top-down view of maser 100 and FIG.
      1A illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along line 1-1 of FIG.
      1B. Maser 100 is a central, conical radar dish type configuration
      that is tuned to the atmosphere. The components of maser 100
      includes a diamagnetic base 120, paramagnetic layer 130 and cloth
      140.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Diamagnetic base 120 provides a housing or structural
      support for the other components of maser 100. In an embodiment,
      diamagnetic base 120 is composed of quartz (e.g., sand). However,
      diamagnetic base 120 can be any type of diamagnetic material that
      is weakly repelled by the application of an external magnetic
      field. Such material includes, but is not limited to, wood, plant
      fibers, leather, plastic, and the like. In a preferred embodiment,
      the diamagnetism of diamagnetic base 120 ranges from -1 to -4,000
      centimeter-gram-seconds (cgs). A tree, for example, typically
      averages -300 cgs. Most naturally occurring diamagnetic materials
      approximates -3,000 cgs.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Paramagnetic layer 130 is deposed over diamagnetic base
      120. In an embodiment, paramagnetic layer 130 is a mixture of
      paramagnetic rock, including andosite, basalt, granite, and the
      like. In another embodiment, paramagnetic layer 130 is magnetic
      tape, which is generally a polyester film (such as, a Mylar(R)
      film available from DuPont) that is coated with a thin layer of
      plastic containing tiny permanent magnets. Paramagnetic layer 130
      can include other types of paramagnetic material that are weakly
      pulled towards an applied external magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an embodiment, an adhesive composition is mixed with the
      paramagnetic material to produce paramagnetic layer 130. The
      adhesive composition can be any combination of materials that
      manifest the creation of a plastic-like insulation between
      paramagnetic layer 130 and diamagnetic base 120. The adhesive
      composition can include a combination of water and alcohol, but
      should not include solvents, such as, gasoline, methylene,
      ethylene, propylene and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In an preferred embodiment, the dielectric constant for
      paramagnetic layer 130 ranges from 2.23 to 3.39 at 1,000 Hz. The
      dielectric constant is the ratio of the susceptibility or
      propensity for paramagnetic layer 130 to be magnetized in an
      external field to the susceptibility of a vacuum or free space.
      However, the dielectric constant can be approximated as the square
      of the refractive index of paramagnetic layer 130 (e.g.,
      1.5&lt;2&gt;). In a preferred embodiment, the paramagnetism ranges
      from 1 to 14,000 cgs. At levels exceeding 14,000 cgs, system
      performance starts to degrade. In an embodiment, ten cm of
      magnetic tape having ten cgs of paramagnetism works effectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Maser 100 also includes cloth 140, which is a burlap, hairy
      or other cloth soaked in the desired control molecule. Cloth 140
      is preferably, but not necessarily, a photonic ionic cloth radio
      amplifier (PICRA) as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No.
      5,247,933, issued Sep. 28, 1993 to Philip S. Callahan and Harry
      Kornberg, and entitled "Photonic Ionic Cloth Radio Amplifier"
      (hereinafter referred to as "the '933 patent"). The disclosure of
      the '933 patent is incorporated herein by reference as though set
      forth in its entirety. As described in the '933 patent, PICRA is a
      burlap or other unbleached hairy cloth that directs molecules from
      the burlap threads into the atmosphere (or free space). As
      described in the '933 patent, the conductivity of cloth 140 can be
      increased by soaking cloth 140 in a saline solution for
      approximately one to six hours and then air dried until it is
      slightly damp. The saline solution preferably consists of an
      isotonic aqueous solution containing a borate buffer system and
      sodium chloride, preserved with 0.1% of sorbic acid and disodium
      (e.g., EDTA). Alternatively, four tablespoons of sea salt per half
      pint of water with the same borate buffer described above can be
      used. However if cloth 140 is very damp or completely dry, cloth
      140 may not be as conductive. Nonetheless for the present
      invention, cloth 140 is not required to be conductive since maser
      100 is not operated by a battery or electrical power source, and
      thus, cloth 140 can be completely dry.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Similarly, saline or sea water can be used to make
      paramagnetic layer 130 more conductive, but, once again, it is not
      required since the maser 100 does not require a battery or
      electrical power source. Nonetheless, the strength and longevity
      of a signal emitted from maser 100 can be increased by dampening
      cloth 140, paramagnetic layer 130, or both with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The control molecule is impregnated or soaked into the
      fibers of cloth 140. Alternatively, the control molecule can be
      placed into the paramagnetic-adhesive mixture of paramagnetic
      layer 130. Irrespectively, cloth 140 is disposed over paramagnetic
      layer 130 as shown in FIG. 1A. In a preferred embodiment, cloth
      140 (impregnated with the control molecule) and paramagnetic layer
      130 are both allowed to harden for at least twenty-four hours,
      prior to positioning cloth 140 over paramagnetic layer 130. An
      adhesive composition can be used to ensure that cloth 140 adheres
      to paramagnetic layer 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In an embodiment, electromagnetic emissions from maser 100
      are varied or modulated by the 156.26 or 506.81 Hz atmospheric
      scatter frequencies (also referred to as the Callahan
      frequencies). These electromagnetic waves (i.e., the Callahan
      frequencies) are Cannabas scatter waves of the atmosphere and can
      be found, all over the world, penetrating both atmosphere and
      earth with little or no absorption. The Cannabas scatter waves are
      spaced by 156.26 Hz. However, 506.8 Hz has been determined by the
      inventors to be a natural harmonic of the 156.26 scatter
      frequency. Other harmonic frequencies of 156.26 can also be used.
      Thus, the emissions from maser 100 can be naturally modulated
      because the Callahan frequencies exists freely in nature.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In an embodiment, the electromagnetic emissions from maser
      100 are tuned by applying or loading 3.2 cm or 10 cm high
      atmospheric, or cosmic, frequencies to the system. The 3.2 cm high
      waves are also found all over the world. They reflect from the
      ground, including sand or rock, and can be directed or amplified
      like a laser. The surrounding atmosphere is typically composed of
      oxygen which tends to be paramagnetic and self-modulating. One can
      easily observe that an oxygen-based atmosphere alters the
      frequency of visible electromagnetic radiation to produce a
      scattering or twinkling effect. This phenomenon can be evidenced
      by observing the twinkling of lights and distance stars. Thus, to
      improve the performance of maser 100, the electromagnetic waves
      radiating from maser 100 must be tuned to match the paramagnetic
      frequency of the surrounding atmosphere to reduce scatter or the
      twinkling effect. The resonant, paramagnetic frequency for oxygen
      is 3.2 cm high. Therefore, maser 100 is tuned to the atmosphere
      (i.e., 3.2 cm resonant air (i.e., oxygen) atmospheric region).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an embodiment, maser 100 ranges between 1 to 6,
      preferably 1 to 2, wavelengths in diameter. This range enables
      maser 100 to match its emissions to the antenna emissions of the
      insect to be controlled. The inventors have discovered that a half
      or quarter wavelength in diameter is not sufficient for matching
      the insect's antennae. As well-known, the amplitude of a signal
      can be measured by the equation A=D/[lambda]0, where D represents
      the diameter of the signal emitter and [lambda]0 is the free space
      wavelength. In a preferred embodiment, the amplitude of the signal
      from maser 100 should be 1 or 2 wavelengths. In other words, for a
      loading frequency of 3.2 cm in an oxygen-based atmosphere, the
      diameter of diamagnetic base 120 should be 3.2 cm for 1 wavelength
      (i.e., A=3.2/3.2) or 6.4 cm for 2 wavelengths.(i.e., A=6.4/3.2).
      Thus, the dimensions of maser 100, namely diamagnetic base 120,
      must be adjusted according to the resonant, atmospheric frequency
      (i.e., oxygen).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 2 illustrates flat plate type configuration of maser
      100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this
      embodiment, diamagnetic base 220 is a flat surface formed in the
      shape of a polygon, as shown, or any other geometric shape.
      Diamagnetic base 220 provides structural support for paramagnetic
      layer 130. Cloth 140 is soaked in the control molecule and
      positioned over paramagnetic layer 130. An adhesive 250 can be
      applied to seal diamagnetic base 220 to paramagnetic layer 130.
      However, adhesive 250 is optional. Adhesive 250 can be any
      adhesive composition, as discussed in reference to FIG. 1A.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 3 illustrates a loop configuration similar to the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 1A. However, in this embodiment, cloth
      140 is positioned in the center of diamagnetic base 120, and
      disposed directly onto diamagnetic base 120. Paramagnetic layer
      130 surrounds cloth 140. An adhesive composition can be used to
      secure cloth 140 and paramagnetic layer 130 to diamagnetic base
      120, but it is not required. As shown, a portion of diamagnetic
      base 120 forms a divider to separate paramagnetic layer 130 from
      cloth 140. However, the divider is optional.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In one embodiment, diamagnetic base 120 of FIG. 3 is red
      and, in a second embodiment, diamagnetic base 120 is blue. The
      inventors have discovered that a blue pumping color tends to
      attracts more insects. However, ants have a propensity to be more
      attractive to a red pumping color. Therefore, the color of maser
      100, namely diamagnetic base 120, provides pumping radiation that
      improves the effectiveness of maser 100 to attract insects.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 4 illustrates another configuration of maser 100 that
      does not include cloth 140. In this embodiment, paramagnetic layer
      130 is impregnated with the control molecule. Diamagnetic base 120
      supports paramagnetic layer 130, but along the side wall of
      diamagnetic base 120 is a layer of dielectric spines 450, such as
      a spined plastic, velcro, and the like. Dielectric spines 450,
      thus, surround paramagnetic layer 130, and can be secured to
      diamagnetic base 120 by using an adhesive composition or other
      conventional methodologies for attaching components (including,
      but not limited to, brazing, soldering, welding, and the like) as
      would be apparent to one skilled in the relevant art(s).
      Alternatively, dielectric spines 450 need not be secured to
      diamagnetic base 120.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In this embodiment, photons of energy radiate from the
      control molecules or paramagnetic layer 130, and flow across
      dielectric spines 450. Spine collisions are formed by the spaces
      between the individual spines of dielectric spines 450 and the
      aligned control molecules. As the photons flow across the
      individual spines and through the spine collisions, the spine
      output (i.e., amount of radiation amplified by dielectric spines
      450) is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 5 illustrates an elongated rod configuration of maser
      100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this
      embodiment, diamagnetic base 120 has a cylindrical shape. Cloth
      140 lines the inner surfaces of diamagnetic base 120, and is
      soaked with the control molecule. Cloth 140 wraps around the base
      of a diamagnetic tube 560 that protrudes from the center of maser
      100. In an embodiment, diamagnetic tube 560 is a plastic material.
      Diamagnetic tube 560 is filled with a paramagnetic material (not
      shown) similar to paramagnetic layer 130 described in reference to
      FIG. 1A. Also included is a lid 540 that fits over cloth 140 and
      can be fastened to diamagnetic base 120. A plurality of vent holes
      580 are drilled into lid 540. Diamagnetic tube 560 extends through
      a tiny opening 570 in the center of lid 540.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The control molecules (e.g., scent) flows out of
      diamagnetic lid 540 along the paramagnetic material-filled
      diamagnetic tube 560 where the electromagnetic waves from the
      control molecules are trapped and highly amplified. The inventors
      have discovered that diamagnetic tube 560 functions as an antenna
      that continues to emit frequencies even after all of the control
      molecules (e.g., scent) have been dispersed. This is attributed to
      the monolayer of oriented molecules fixed on diamagnetic tube 560.
      When maser 100 is amplifying the signal from a scent molecule, the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 5 appears to be better suited for flying
      insects as opposed to ants or cockroaches. To attract mosquitoes,
      maser 100 should use a larger, black diamagnetic tube 560 filled
      with mosquito attractant and rock. The system should be modulated
      at a flickering rate (ELF) of 78.15 Hz harmonic and 156.26 Hz to
      attract the mosquito. It should be noted that 78.15 Hz is an echo
      or harmonic of the 156.26 Hz Callahan frequency.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0058] III.
        Paramagnetic-Diamagnetic Maser Performance</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0059] As known to those skilled in the relevant art(s) when
      electronic components are closer together, zero aperture will
      occur. In a conventional radar system, zero aperture reduces the
      spreading of the radar beam so that, at the point of emission, the
      path length is shortened and produces phase conjugation. Thus, the
      system would be able to achieve almost complete spatial coherence.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As illustrated, maser 100 provides a solid-state system. In
      comparison with the system of the '551 patent or the '049 patent,
      the solid-state design of the present invention creates zero
      antenna aperture. The phase conjugation provided by this design
      improves performance, and increases power because the components
      are closer together and generate minimal loss or scatter. In other
      words, there is no spread of the maser beam, so that at the point
      of emission (i.e., zero aperture), the path length is so short
      (i.e., no spread) that phase conjugation, and complete spatial
      coherence can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The system of the '551 patent uses paramagnetic (e.g.,
      oxygen), diamagnetic (e.g., nitrogen) and contained scent in the
      form of a gas (e.g., atmosphere). The solid-state system of the
      present invention incorporates all the physical parameters of the
      gaseous system of the '551 patent, except, as in the case of any
      solid-state system, the paramagnetic-diamagnetic modulation is by
      a solid-state material (e.g., rock) which is substituted for the
      gas flowing air mixture. This allows a hairy cloth (e.g.,
      simulating, for example, insect sensilla), or red-colored pumping
      radiation, to be incorporated directly into the
      paramagnetic-diamagnetic system without the necessity of flowing
      it. It also allows a reduction in size and form so that the three
      cm antenna dimensions can be matched to the three cm resonance of
      the surrounding air (e.g., oxygen). Therefore, unlike the system
      of the '551 patent, the system of the present invention is an
      efficient, solid-state maser system capable of working over longer
      distances.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] It is possible that the desired frequency is not the only
      frequency emitted from maser 100. However, the emission of other
      frequencies is irrelevant to the effectiveness of the present
      invention. Nor is it relevant whether a few molecules (e.g.,
      insect pheromones) can defuse through air spaces within
      diamagnetic base 120. In fact, if a few molecules escape through
      diamagnetic base 120, maser 100 functions as a more efficient
      device for, for example, attracting or repelling insects, because
      not only does maser 100 emit the desired frequency, but the
      escaped semiochemicals also produce emissions to lure or repel the
      insect in the general area. It is the inventors' belief that
      moths, and insects in general, are attracted or repelled by the
      electromagnetic radiation from pheromones, and not necessarily the
      pheromones, themselves. Therefore, the device of the present
      invention is primarily a frequency emitter that functions like a
      radar. With respect to pest control, the device of the present
      invention is configurable to increase the strength and longevity
      of a molecular control system (e.g., semiochemical and the like)
      that can be used to attract or repel the target pest.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Accordingly, the system and method of the present invention
      provide a highly efficient and effective solution for maintaining
      pest populations below desired threshold levels and protecting
      food supplies, without the use of hazardous pesticides. Moreover
      since the present invention promotes an cleaner technological
      alternative to pesticides, pests can be controlled without having
      to exterminate the animals, utilize ozone depleting or other
      environmentally harmful chemicals, or utilize pesticides that may
      endanger the health of children and adults, alike.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Insects such as fleas, mosquitos, moths, etc. are undesirable
      because they are bothersome, destroy property, and often pose
      health risks. Devices and methods for trapping, killing, and
      disposing of insects are well known in the art. These devices and
      methods have taken many forms and include, for example, fly paper,
      electric insect killers that kill by electrocution, and chemical
      pesticides. Conventional devices and methods have many
      shortcomings. For example, fly paper and electric insect killers
      are both ineffective at attracting insects, and as such, are only
      marginally effective (approximately 5-10%) for eliminating insects
      within a given area. Chemical pesticides are dangerous to both the
      human population and the environment as a whole. Further, chemical
      pesticides are also ineffective at attracting insects.<br>
      <br>
      It has long been known that insects are attracted to specific
      molecules of sex and host plant attractants. For example, Dr.
      Philip S. Callahan (hereinafter<br>
      Applicant) demonstrated conclusively in 1957 that night flying
      moths are not attracted to visible light but rather to the
      infrared scatter frequencies from scents of plants in the air
      stimulated by the visible light from a low intensity light source.

      <br>
      In a series of articles in the mid 1960's, Applicant demonstrated
      that the antennae of insects act as photonic, open resonator
      waveguides to collect and transmit infrared frequencies. See

      <br>
      In 1977, Applicant demonstrated that attractance of night flying
      moths to candles is not due to the insect's eye and the
      candlelight, but is instead due to the insect's dielectric antenna
      and candle water-vapor infrared emissions to which the insect's
      antenna is tuned. See Philip S. Callahan, "Moth and candle: the
      candle flame as a sexual mimic of the coded infrared wavelengths
      from a moth sex scent (pheromone)", Applied Optics, Vol. 16, page
      3089,<br>
      December 1977, and Philip S. Callahan, "Trapping modulation of the
      far infrared (17 - tcm region) emission from the cabbage looper
      moth pheromone (sex cent)," Applied Optics, Vol 16, page 3098,
      December 1977.<br>
      <br>
      For certain insect species, specific attractants (such as
      "pheromones," which are insect produced volatile compounds) have
      been chemically identified and synthesized. The isolation of sex
      and host plant attractant molecules has progressed steadily over
      the past few decades. Attractants have been utilized in various
      conventional traps but with poor results since these traps
      dissipate all of their (pheromone) scent in the air and in only a
      few days are useless.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Patent No. 3,997,785 to Callahan, which is incorporated by
      reference herein, Applicant described a system for vibrating a
      gold coated needle in a molecular scent vapor contained in an
      enclosed chamber in order to stimulate and emit narrow band
      maser-like energy from an infrared transmitting window for control
      of insects. This system, although providing advantages over other
      conventional solutions, was frequently ineffective because it
      failed to produce maser-like frequencies that closely mimicked the
      frequencies produced by the insect being controlled.<br>
      <br>
      There is therefore a need for a device and method that can attract
      and/or control insects within a specified region, is harmless to
      the human population, and is relatively inexpensive and easy to
      operate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention overcomes the problems with conventional
      solutions by utilizing natural (copied) scatter surfaces, natural
      vibratory modulating frequency, and associated pumping radiation
      to generate coherent or semicoherent radiation frequencies to
      control or attract insects. Thus, the present invention applies to
      the control of all insects in nature; such control acting either
      as an attractant radiation (e.g., for trapping) or a frequency
      quenching (i.e., jamming) radiation for insects.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method and apparatus for emitting
      natural millimeter, infrared, visual, UV or UV-X-ray frequencies
      for control of insects. Control may involve attracting the insects
      or repelling them.<br>
      <br>
      Attractance is achieved by emitting attractance frequencies of the
      insect to be controlled. Repulsion is achieved by emitting
      quenching (or jamming) frequencies timed to the photon
      communication system of the insect, or by emitting out of phase
      frequencies that interfere with the molecular communication
      systems of the insects.<br>
      <br>
      These many functions and frequencies are realized with the use of
      a specially designed frequency (wavelength) emitter which utilizes
      the natural semiochemicals of a particular insect, and the
      dielectric scatter surface of the particular insect, to mimic the
      coded wavelength utilized by the organism in its day to day
      reproductive and food searching behavior.<br>
      <br>
      The semiochemical or other behavioral molecules are confined in a
      closed chamber with a window that allows coherent or semi-coherent
      maser-like radiation frequencies to be emitted. In the center of
      the chamber is a plate having an etched scatter surface copied
      from the antenna, thorax, wing or leg of the insect. The plate
      with the scatter surface is mounted perpendicular to the edge of
      the window within the chamber. An adjustable grating is also
      provided to focus the maser-like radiation frequencies for
      emission through the window. The adjustable grating has a
      predetermined number of grooves to match the antenna dimensions
      (dielectric waveguide open resonator) of the appropriate
      insect.The scatter surface is at a right angle to the adjustable
      grating and mounted on a vibrating rod with a control to allow the
      scatter surface to be vibrated in the extremely low frequency
      range (i.e., between 1 Hz and 800 Hz depending on the insect). The
      semiochemicals are circulated over the vibrating scatter surface
      creating coherent or semi-coherent narrow band high intensity
      maser-like emissions that are emitted to the environment through
      the window. The coherent or semi-coherent maser-like emissions are
      used to control, attract, or jam the natural frequencies of
      insects.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the present invention provides a method and
      apparatus for emitting photonic waves which emulate natural waves
      which either attract or repel insects as desired. Emulation is
      accomplished through the use of a power source, a gas discharge
      tube, and a scatter surface soaked in an appropriate attractant.
      In operation, the gas discharge tube is excited by the power
      supply which results in gas discharge emissions. The scatter
      surface is mounted adjacent to the gas tube such that the energy
      resulting from the gas tube discharge is directed onto the scatter
      surface. This may be accomplished by mounting a cylindrical
      scatter surface above the gas tube. Attractant molecules attached
      to (or near) the scatter surface are thereby excited by the
      discharge energy, and begin to oscillate.When sufficient discharge
      energy is absorbed, the oscillation produces a photonic wave (or
      emission). The photonic wave is, in turn, received by the
      dielectric waveguide(s) of an insect (i.e., the insect's antenna).
      By varying the discharge energy, the scatter surface, and/or the
      attractant, the present invention may be "tuned" to achieve
      effective performance with a wide range of insects.<br>
      <br>
      The energy output from the gas discharge tube may be varied in any
      of several ways. The gas used to fill the tube may be varied to
      achieve energy output over a desired spectral range. The energy
      provided by the power source, used to discharge the gas tube, may
      be varied both in terms of frequency (i.e., charging rate) and/or
      amplitude. In addition, the surface of the gas tube may be treated
      to limit discharge emissions to any desired spectral range.<br>
      <br>
      The scatter surface may also be varied in a number of ways. First,
      the physical shape of the scatter surface may be varied to enhance
      ease of construction of the present invention. Next, the spatial
      relationship of the scatter surface with respect to the gas tube
      may also be varied to permit direction of the photonic waves in a
      desired direction. Different substances may be used to construct
      the scatter surface, resulting in differing degrees of attractant
      absorption and/or vibration freedom for absorbed attractant
      molecules.<br>

        Embodiments</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">I. Operational Overview of a
        first embodiment</span><br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present
      invention. The present invention comprises a frequency emitter 5
      which provides a coherent scatter and group soliton waveguide,
      surface enhanced emitter for control of insects. This is
      accomplished by emitting attractance frequencies or conversely by
      emitting quenching (jamming) frequencies timed to the photon
      communication system of the insect. These functions are carried
      out by frequency emitter 5 which utilizes natural semiochemicals
      of a particular insect and the insect's natural dielectric scatter
      surface to mimic the coded wavelength utilized by the insect in
      its day to day reproductive and food searching behavior.<br>
      <br>
      In this document, the term "semiochemicals" is taken to mean any
      molecule from an insect which naturally emits communication
      photons. The term control" is taken to mean the attractance of an
      insect to a confined area where it can be eliminated (e.g., by
      electrocution or insecticides) or the repulsion of the insect away
      from a specified geographic area.<br>
      <br>
      Frequency emitter 5 comprises a chamber 10, a scatter surface 20,
      an adjustable grating 30, a vibrator/rotor motor 40, an air pump
      50, a light pump 60, and an infrared window 70. A functional and
      operational description of these components is given below. In
      brief, the frequency emitter 5 generates narrow band high
      intensity maser-like emissions from semiochemicals contained
      within chamber 10. The semiochemicals are circulated through the
      chamber over the scatter surface 20. The pump flow rate (i.e., the
      rate the semiochemicals are circulated (in a closed system) over
      scatter surface 20) is set to match wind speeds that stimulate
      insects to search and respond to the semiochemicals. Scatter
      surface 20 is vibrated at an appropriate modulation frequency
      (typically in the extremely low frequency range).By circulating
      the semiochemicals over vibrating scatter surface 20, maser-like
      emissions that emulate the natural frequencies generated by an
      insect can be generated and emitted through window 70 into the
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. Structural Description of the
        Present Invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring again to Figure 1, chamber 10 can be any shape, such as
      a cube, globe, or a parabolic structure. However, the preferred
      embodiment is a cube measuring approximately 4 cm by 10 cm by 15
      cm. In the preferred embodiment, chamber 10 is constructed of
      metal, plastic, or glass. However, any solid material can be used
      to construct the chamber 10. Chamber 10 has two holes 54, 55
      formed on opposing sides for in and out air flow, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Chamber 10 is filled with semiochemical molecules or other
      behavioral molecules, such as pheromones or host plant scent
      molecules. Chamber 10 is sealed so that the semiochemical (i.e.,
      attractant or quenching) molecules or other behavioral (e.g.,
      scent) molecules can be circulated in a continuous fashion across
      scatter surface 20. In other words, the frequency emitter 5 is a
      closed system.<br>
      <br>
      Placed in the center of the chamber 10 is a plate 15 having a
      scatter surface 20 etched therein. Plate 15 is made from metal or
      plastic. A micrometer tilt mechanism 85 is provided for adjusting
      the position of the scatter surface 20 in order to focus or fine
      tune the narrow band high intensity maser-like emissions (produced
      by circulating the natural semiochemicals across the natural
      scatter surface) through the window 70. In a preferred embodiment,
      scatter surface 20 is adjustable in all directions (e.g.,
      vertically, horizontally, rotationally, pivotally, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The scatter surface is modeled, for example, after the antenna,
      thorax, wing or leg scatter surfaces found on all species of
      insects.<br>
      <br>
      Present day etching technology has reached a state where
      micrometer dielectric or metal coated forms can be fabricated as
      scatter surfaces and amplifiers for short wave radiation in the
      millimeter, microwave, infrared (IR), visible and ultra violet
      (UV) region of the spectrum. Such miniature open resonator
      dielectric amplify us or surface enhanced scatter configurations
      are now being produced and are described in Jewell et al.,
      "Microlasers," Scientific American, November 1991, Scherer et al.,
      "Lasing in Submicron Wide Vertical Cavity Microlasers," Optics and
      Photonics News, December 1991, Grossman et al., "Lithographic
      spiral antennas at short wavelengths," Appl. Phy. Lett., Vol 59,
      No. 25, December 1991, and John, "Localization of Light," Physics
      Today, May 1991, which are all incorporated by reference herein in
      their entirety.<br>
      <br>
      Modern solid state physics is beginning to demonstrate enhanced
      sensitivity and high amplification of frequencies utilizing array
      "dots." Such dots are microscopic scatter three dimensional
      antenna arrays fabricated and etched by holographic lithography
      onto transistor surfaces. Such etching leaves 3dimensional
      landscapes that "trap" and amplify frequencies. See Heitmann et
      al., "The Spectroscopy of Quantum Arrays," Physics Today, June
      1993.<br>
      <br>
      Insects, for example, have been using such 3-dimensional surfaces
      for frequency amplification for millions of years.<br>
      <br>
      The technique of atom-probe ion microscopy demonstrates that the
      imaging of gas atoms that lie above the surface atoms and occupy
      the more protruding sites are analogous to scatter surfaces of
      organisms. Such a surface has a rough texture with many tiny
      projections, or aspirates. A rough surface is not good for
      imaging, however, unless it is designed with special edges or
      grooves (such as on an insect) to "focus" the atomic energies.
      Insects do not have rough surfaces but designed surfaces that
      enhance frequencies by oscillating surface segregation.
      Photographs of ions taken with a field ion microscope show soliton
      target waves in gases such as helium. Such soliton target waves
      are common at low energies from the atmosphere. See Tien Tsong,
      "Atom-Probe Field Ion Microscopy," Physics Today, May 1993. A
      soliton wave is a varying wave riding another wave.<br>
      <br>
      Typical types of scatter surfaces for insects are listed in Table
      1. Figures 2(a) through 2(f) are photographs showing examples of
      some of the scatter surfaces listed in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      The airtight chamber 10 has a special millimeter, infrared,
      visible, ultra violet, or X-ray window 70 formed therein. Window
      70 is used for emission of the scatter coherent radiation (i.e.,
      maser-like emissions) generated by circulating semiochemicals
      across scatter surface 20 and grating 30 (described below). In a
      preferred embodiment window 70 is constructed using a Krs 5
      infrared window.<br>
      <br>
      The adjustable grating 30 is constructed with the proper number of
      grooves to generally match the natural dimension of the dielectric
      scatter antenna or sensilla (spines) of the organism being
      controlled. The adjustable grating should be gold plated for high
      reflectance in the visible and infrared region of the light
      spectrum. For example, the adjustable grating 30 is constructed
      with 20 groves/mm for cockroaches or 300-600 grooves/mm for small
      ticks or white flies. A list of typical grating dimensions for
      different insects is shown in TABLE 2.<br>

      Adjustable grating 30 is positioned on the side of chamber 10
      opposite to window 70. A micrometer tilt mechanism 90 is provided
      for adjusting the position of grating 30 in order to focus or fine
      tune the narrow band high intensity maser-like emission through
      window 70.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the positions
      of both scatter surface 20 and grating 30 are adjustable (e.g.,
      sideways and up and down) so that they can be positioned to
      stimulate (and/or focus) natural maserlike emissions. The
      maser-like emissions are reflected from scatter surface 20 to
      grating 30. The maser-like emissions are then in turn reflected
      through window 70. These coherent or semi-coherent maser-like
      emissions are used to control a specific type of insect in the
      environment outside frequency emitter 5.<br>
      <br>
      Note, that in a preferred embodiment, after the micrometer
      adjustments have been made to scatter surface 20 and grating 30 to
      correspond to a particular insect (e.g. cabbage looper moth),
      these adjustments can be permanently fixed. Thus, frequency
      emitter 5 with the semiochemicals contained within (e.g.,
      Z-7-dodecene-1-ol acetate pheromone for the cabbage looper moth)
      can be placed on site without any further adjustments necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The etched scatter surface 20 is mounted on a vibrating rod 80
      perpendicular to the edge of window 70 and at a right angle to
      grating 30. Vibrating rod 80 is connected to a vibrator/rotor
      motor 40. Vibrating rod 80 is designed to allow the scatter
      surface tilt rod 85 to be positioned to screw forward and press
      against the plate 15. This configuration assures that small angle
      variations can be made in the surface alignment of scatter surface
      20 in relation to grating 30. Once again, grating 30 can also been
      adjusted using the micrometer tilt mechanism 90.<br>
      <br>
      Vibrator/rotor motor 50 comprises two elements: A low frequency
      oscillator and a rotor motor (described below). The low frequency
      oscillator can be controlled to vibrate rod 80 between 1 Hz and
      800 Hz (depending on the insect being controlled). Table 3 gives a
      list of frequency ranges that may be used to control specific
      insect groups.<br>

      Air circulating pump 50 is provided to allow the semiochemical or
      other attractant or quenching molecules to be circulated across
      the vibrating scatter surface. Note that the chamber 10 is
      initially filled with the semiochemical or other attractant or
      quenching molecules before turning on the air circulating pump 50.
      The air flow is adjusted so that it mimics the air flow to which
      insects respond. That is, semiochemicals blowing at certain speeds
      through the air stimulate insects to search and respond to the
      chemicals. Thus, the semiochemical molecular flow is adjusted to
      match the natural air flow of airborne molecules that stimulate
      insects. In a preferred embodiment, the air flows from the top
      edge of scatter surface 20 to air pump 50 via opening 55, and is
      returned to chamber 10 through opening 54.<br>
      <br>
      A light pump 60 is mounted directly above scatter surface 20.
      Light pump 60 can be any infrared, blue, ultra violet or UV-X-ray
      light source. An ultra violet (3600 A) light source is used in a
      preferred embodiment. Light pump 60 allows low intensity pumping
      radiation (DC) to be directed across scatter surface 20. Light
      pump 60 can be constructed in a number of different ways, such as:
      (1) DC filament source placed behind a filter (e.g., a color
      filter, infrared filter, UV filter etc.); (2) a light emitting
      diode of proper frequency (e.g., millimeter, infrared, light, UV
      or UV-X-ray); (3) a flickering light source (1 to 800 or more Hz)
      in which case the scatter surface 20 can be adjusted to
      synchronize with the flicker of the light pump 60; or (4) an
      etched grating light source which reflects a defined frequency
      from its surface and across scatter surface 20.<br>
      <br>
      If the present invention is used to control insects in a large
      area, yard, field etc., frequency emitter 5 can be rotated 360"
      around a vertical axis using vibrator/rotor motor 40. This allows
      frequency emitter 5 to sweep the emitted radiation from window 70
      across the large area. The rotation is accomplished simultaneously
      with the vibration. Given this configuration, the present
      invention is particularly adaptable to be used in a storage grain
      elevator, for example. Note that the frequency emitter 5 does not
      need a rotor motor to operate correctly. To operate correctly only
      a low frequency oscillator is required.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Tuning the Frequency Emitter 5</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Described below are a number of physical-chemical parameters
      involved in tuning frequency emitter 5 for a particular insect
      (e.g., cabbage looper moth).<br>
      <br>
      In order for the frequency emitter 5 to operate effectively one or
      more of these parameters may be involved. For example, the wrong
      temperature or the wrong concentration of the semiochemical may
      shift the emission out of "tune" diminishing the benefits of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature affects the wavelength of the maser-like emissions
      emitted from frequency emitter 5. As such, changing the
      temperature within the frequency emitter 5 can increase or
      decrease the performance of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the frequency emitter should be operated between 30 to
      120 F.<br>
      <br>
      Higher temperatures produce longer wavelengths and lower
      temperatures produce shorter wavelengths in the maser-like
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      A higher concentration of semiochemicals produces longer
      wavelengths and a lower concentration of semiochemicals produces
      shorter wavelengths in the maser-like emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Modulating the scatter surface at different frequencies can change
      the harmonics of the maser-like emissions. A higher modulating
      frequency results in the harmonics being farther apart, while a
      lower modulating frequency results in the harmonics being closer
      together.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments in the field have demonstrated that semiochemicals
      blowing at certain speeds through the air stimulate insects to
      search and respond to the chemicals. If the velocity (measured in
      miles per hour (MPH)) is too low or too high the molecules do not
      collide and vibrate with the insects scatter surface at the
      frequency to which the insect naturally responds. The efficiency
      of frequency emitter 5 can therefore be increased by changing the
      flowrate that the semiochemicals are circulated through chamber
      10.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments have shown that efficiency has increased by changing
      the flowrate from 0.1 to 0.8 MPH.<br>
      <br>
      Insects fly at different times of night and day. Since the
      environmental radiation (pumping radiation) often changes due to
      overcast or haze etc., the color and intensity of light may change
      from good to bad or vice versa. By changing the wavelength of the
      pumping radiation (i.e., changing the type of light pump 60) the
      amplitude of the maser-like emissions can also be altered to
      correspond to a particular insect.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that the circulating molecules be of the correct
      degree of freedom (i.e., not to close together or to far apart) to
      assure coherent emission at vibrating scatter surface 20. The
      emissions should be directed at a right angle against grating 30
      and reflected out of window 70. Nitrogen may be added to the
      molecular semiochemical (by experimentation) in order to provide a
      carrier for the emitting molecules and to obtain the correct
      degrees of freedom in the diluted vapor.<br>
      <br>
      As seen from above, fine tuning the frequency emitter 5 can be a
      challenging process which includes experimentation within the
      natural environment of the insect. Along with the above
      techniques, Table 4 provides a number of other factors that should
      be considered when operating the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Table 4 1. Efficiency can be increased by applying an electret
      effect (plus and minus charge). The electret effect can be
      obtained from a purchased<br>
      teflon electret, or made by placing a teflon sheet between two
      plates at 2000 volts and slightly heating the sheet. An electret
      effect orients<br>
      molecules. If the molecules form a single layer it is referred to
      as a "monolayer effect." 3. Semiochemical concentration increase
      can broaden the frequency line.<br>
      <br>
      4. Adding (CH)2" in the semiochemical chain can produce a shift in
      the frequency line.<br>
      <br>
      5. Frequency emissions not only occur in large windows (2, 5, 7,
      to 14 Um), but also in micro (e.g., narrow) windows between the
      water<br>
      rotation absorption bands. However, the frequency emissions will
      be quenched if they coincide with the water rotation absorption
      bands.<br>
      <br>
      6. Doping by adding extra (CH)2n or (CH)3n shift or quenches
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      7. Doping with minute amounts of ammonia (NH)3 can increase
      efficiency (i.e., the ammonia acts as a catalytic agent).<br>
      <br>
      8. Medium to weak primary wavelength sidebands are typically
      associated with strong emissions. Adjusting the wavelength of the
      sidebands can<br>
      oftentimes produce better results. For example, an insect might be
      more inclined to be tuned into the stronger wavelengths of the
      sidebands.<br>
      <br>
      The teachings of the present invention can also be extended to a
      photonic waveguide integrated diode circuit having etched scatter
      surface contained therein. The diode can be used to control
      insects since present day technology makes it feasible to reduce
      this entire scatter biological control chamber to a single
      emitting diode.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">C. Examples</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As shown in Figures 3 through 14, emissions from insect
      semiochemicals (pheromone, plant seed, formaldehyde and CO2,
      respectively) can be stimulated to emit narrow band maser-like
      signature frequencies by blowing them across a natural scatter
      surface. These semiochemicals are modulated with the same
      frequencies that the insect vibrates its antenna, as shown in<br>
      Table 3. Given below are a few examples of the type of insects
      that can be controlled with the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Trichoplusiani</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Figure 3 is an example of the scatter surface of the antenna of
      the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni. The sensilla (pheromone
      sensors) dielectric waveguide spines can be seen protruding
      between the ridged cones of the scatter surface. The dielectric
      waveguide sensilla (spines) themselves have corrugated scatter
      surfaces. To control the cabbage looper moth, scatter surface 20
      would be modeled after this surface.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 is a spectrum of the cabbage looper moth pheromone
      Z-7-dodecene1-ol acetate. Chamber 10 is filled with this
      semiochemical molecule and pumped by blue light via light pump 60.
      Since 55 Hz is the antenna vibration frequency of the cabbage
      looper moth, scatter surface 20 located within chamber 10 is
      vibrated at this frequency. A 17 llm water vapor microwindow is
      used. Water vapor (e.g., 2A, 3B, 4A, 5C, etc.) and pheromone
      emission lines 410 and 420 are designated. Pheromone emissions 410
      and 420 frequencies shift from 570 ,tm to 565 m over a 15 minute
      period, respectively, due to deliberate heating in chamber .10
      (i.e., temperature tuning). Concentration tuning is also evident
      by changing the amount of the pheromone.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Plodia interpunctella</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The Indian Meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) destroys millions of
      dollars of stored grain each year all over the world. Typically
      gains include oats, rice, and peas. Figure 5 is a spectrum
      scattered off the surface of the seeds of oats, rice and peas in a
      small container with their surfaces orientated so that a
      spectrophotometer beam illuminated the flat plane of the outer
      surfaces of the seeds. The scent outgassing from the surface of
      each group of plant seeds shows a group of narrowband coded
      emissions (like a bar code). These nonlinear maser-like emissions
      represent acoustic Stokes Brilliouin and Raman scatter from the
      outgassing plant scents. In order to control the Indian Meal moth,
      chamber 10 is filled with one of the semiochemicals shown in
      Figure 5.<br>
      <br>
      Scatter surface 20 is modeled after the antenna surface of the
      Indian Meal moth (shown in Figure 2F), and modulated at 30 Hz
      (i.e., the modulation frequency of the antenna of the Indian Meal
      Moth) to produce narrow band maser-like emissions. These emissions
      emitted through window 70 can be used to control (and consequently
      eliminate within a given area) the Indian<br>
      Meal moth.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Plecice nearctia</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Figure 6 is a spectrum of formaldehyde flowing across a 3600A
      Blacklight UV bulb. Formaldehyde is a powerful attractant to the
      Love bug (Plecice nearctia), a nuisance insect that is attracted
      to highways by the aldehydes in exhaust fumes.<br>
      <br>
      Spectrum A is a scan with the formaldehyde modulated at 130 Hz
      (i.e., the antenna vibration frequency of the lovebug antenna).
      Spectrum B is formaldehyde also modulated at 130 Hz but with the
      vapor blowing at high speed (10 mph) across the interferometer
      infrared beam. The pumping radiation is still 3600A UV. The
      Rayleigh center scatter line which is narrowband (maser-like) at
      380cm becomes a group wave with a Gaussian distribution at fast
      air speeds. Such group waves can be utilized to amplify or quench
      the organisms semiochemical communication systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Mosquitoes</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Figure 7 is a spectrum of the well known CO2 rotation line at 14.9
      ym. This line can be stimulated to emit very strongly the
      vibration frequency of many species of mosquitoes, stable, and
      horse flies by modulating it at 210 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Emission is stimulated by a slight nitrogen purge, a gentle
      breeze, and the 210 Hz modulated frequency. Addition of a trace of
      lactic acid causes slight amplification and more signals to emerge
      in this region. Many insects that attack animals are attracted to
      CO2-lactic acid. The pumping radiation is near infrared in the 1
      &amp; 2 ym region.<br>
      <br>

        Frequency Emitter 5</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The frequency and or harmonics emitted from frequency emitter 5
      may be detected by a high resolution Fourier analysis
      interferometer spectrophometer (not shown). In a preferred
      embodiment, the maser-like emissions can be detected by the
      apparatus described in a U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
      Number 08/047,486, filed 4/19/93, entitled "Photonic Ionic Cord
      Detector of Group Waves," by inventor Philip S. Callahan. The '486
      patent application is hereby incorporated by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 8 is an oscilloscope recording of a group soliton
      atmospheric ELF wave useful for modulating molecular scatter
      radiation and discovered by the<br>
      Applicant on trees and human skin surfaces. Such group soliton
      waves are also observed as stimulated emission from insect
      semiochemicals attractants (e.g., Fig. 6), and are a part of the
      control configuration of such emissions for biological organisms.
      That is, the group soliton wave is a universal frequency that can
      be used to control insects. Although experimentation may indicate
      that other frequencies are more suited for a particular insect the
      group soliton wave has been shown in experiments by Applicant to
      control a wide range of insects.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, frequency emitter 5 can be adapted to emit a gaussian
      distributed scatter group wave to quench (jam) an attractant or
      unwanted frequency.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">II. Operational Overview of
        Another Embodiment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Figure 9 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention.
      In this embodiment, the present invention comprises a discharge
      gas tube 910, a strobe circuit 920, a condenser 930, a tube shield
      940, a scatter surface 950, and supports 960. In operation, the
      discharge from gas tube 910 provides pumping radiation which is
      directed onto scatter surface 950. Gas tube 910 may be any
      radiation or light source capable of producing a discharge output
      covering a desired spectral range (i.e., that portion of
      environmental radiation spectrum to which the insect to be
      controlled is naturally sensitive). Gas tube 910 is preferably a
      Radio Shack Xenon Strobe Part No. 61-2506. The gas contained
      within gas tube 910 is therefore selected to ensure that the
      characteristic pumping frequency of the insect to be controlled is
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      Strobe circuit 920 and condenser 930 provide the energy required
      to excite gas tube 910, as well as control the duration of each
      strobe and the time interval between strobes. Tube shield 940
      protects gas tube 910 from shock, and may also be treated to limit
      transmission of only selected frequencies (spectral energies) upon
      discharge of gas tube 910.<br>
      <br>
      Scatter surface 950 is exposed to semiochemicals or any suitable
      attractant or quenchant molecules (hereafter "attractant"), and
      provides a medium for excitation of the attractant. Scatter
      surface 950 is preferably soaked in attractant, and thereby
      retains attractant molecules through adhesive and/or cohesive
      bonding forces. By varying the material and/or construction of
      scatter surface 950, the present invention may be further tuned to
      accommodate various insects. Supports 960 suspend scatter surface
      950 above gas tube 910 so as to permit discharge radiation to
      excite attractant molecules on (or near) scatter surface 950.
      Power for strobe circuit 920 may be derived from any suitable
      power source, including DC batteries contained within strobe
      circuit 920, an external DC source (not shown), or an external AC
      source (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. The Pumping Mechanism</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As stated above, the present invention controls insects by
      exciting attractant molecules at characteristic frequencies
      associated with various insects. The excited molecules, in turn,
      emit a maser-like photonic wave which is sensed by nearby insects
      and which may have an attractive or a repellant effect (depending
      on whether a semiochemical, attractant, or quenchant is used).<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of the present invention therefore derives
      directly from the coherency and/or intensity of these maser-like
      photonic emissions. By varying different parameters of the
      invention, the photonic emissions may be tuned to optimize the
      performance of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Towards this end, several of the parameters that may be varied are
      discussed in detail below. First, discharge gas tube 910 is
      considered. As shown in<br>
      Figure 9, gas tube 910 provides the excitation energy used to
      directly excite the attractant molecules. By controlling the
      spectral output of gas tube 910, excitation of the attractant
      molecules may be increased within any desired spectral region.
      Several methods are preferred for accomplishing this.<br>
      <br>
      First, the gas contained in gas tube 910 may be selected to
      provide discharge energy within a particular spectral range. For
      example, Xenon gas is ideally suited for attracting mosquitos
      because of its strong discharge emission within the frequency
      range to which mosquitos are especially sensitive (Near-IR).<br>
      <br>
      In addition, tube shield 940 may be treated to limit the emissions
      from the discharge of gas tube 910 to any spectral range(s) of
      interest. For example, by coating tube shield 940 with an IR
      passing filter, the relative intensity of molecular excitation in
      the desired IR energy band is increased. In addition, any flash or
      glare that may be annoying to humans is eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      Next, additional variation of the gas discharge excitation energy
      may be achieved by varying the intensity and/or pulse rate of the
      discharge of gas tube 910. Gas tube 910 is discharged when the
      energy stored on condenser 930, supplied from strobe circuit 920,
      is sufficient to excite the gas. By varying the size of condenser
      930, the stored energy (which is ultimately dissipated by the
      "strobe" of gas tube 910) may be varied. In addition, the time
      interval between "strobes" may be controlled by varying the charge
      rate of strobe circuit 920. Experimentation has demonstrated that
      good results are achieved when the delay interval between strobe
      bursts is in the range of about 1 second to 30 seconds, depending
      in part on ambient conditions.As will be immediately recognized by
      one skilled in the art, the size of condenser 930 as well as the
      charging rate of strobe circuit 920 may be varied to control the
      strobing of gas tube 910.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. The Scatter Surface</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Beyond the spectral discharge, the effectiveness of the present
      invention is also directly dependent on the construction of the
      scatter surface which is used to support generation of the
      maser-like photonic waves. Referring again to Figure 9, scatter
      surface 950 is shown supported above gas tube 910. While this
      orientation is useful to permit convenient orientation of the
      constituent parts of the invention, any number of alternative
      arrangements are possible.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 11, 12, and 13 represent other preferred arrangements,
      which are discussed more fully below. The common requirement among
      these preferred arrangements is that the discharge energy from gas
      tube 910 is able to interact with the attractant on and/or around
      the scatter surface.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 9, scatter surface 950 is preferably a 1/8 inch thick
      cardboard roll, approximately 4 cm in diameter and approximately 8
      cm in height. The cardboard roll is soaked in anractant before it
      is exposed to the discharge radiation from gas tube 910. Figure
      10, a high magnification closeup of scatter surface 950, shows the
      multiplicative array 1010 formed by the cardboard material. When
      soaked in attractant and then exposed to discharge radiation,
      molecules of the attractant on (and suspended near) the
      multiplicative array 1010 are excited and emit maser-like photonic
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      The intensity and coherency of these waves, dependent in part on
      the discharge radiation, is also influenced by the geometry of the
      scatter surface.<br>
      <br>
      Cardboard has been shown to work well, in part because of the
      degree of vibrational freedom afforded to attached attractant
      molecules as well as due to the porosity of the material (which
      can therefore hold many molecules of attractant).<br>
      <br>
      As stated above, other scatter surface configurations may be
      employed to vary the coherency and/or intensity of emitted
      maser-like photonic waves. Almost any scatter surface
      configuration may be utilized, subject to the requirement that the
      surface selected be able to support molecules of attractant with
      some degree of vibrational freedom. For example, Figure 11 depicts
      a configuration where gas tube discharge source 910 is essentially
      surrounded by the scatter surface 1110. In this configuration,
      scatter surface 1110 must be sufficiently porous to allow the
      discharge energy from gas tube 910 to excite attractant molecules
      on scatter surface 1110. Similarly, Figure 12 depicts a scatter
      surface 1210 essentially encasing gas tube 910. Like scatter
      surface 1110, scatter surface 1210 must permit discharge energy
      from gas tube 910 to excite attached attractant molecules.Supports
      1220 are used to position scatter surface 1210 near gas tube 910,
      as detailed above. Referring to Figure 13, a configuration
      particularly suitable for varying photonic coherency is presented.
      Scatter surface 1310 is curved, only partially surrounding gas
      tube 910, so as to focus emitted photonic waves in a desired
      direction. Supports 1330 are used to position scatter surface 1310
      in any desired orientation. Furthermore, the radiant surface 1320
      of scatter surface 1310 may be covered with velcro, or a similar
      material. The velcro "hooks" or "loops" provide both desired
      attractant retention as well as vibrational freedom in such a
      fashion as to align the molecular vibration of the attractant
      molecules. A focussing effect is therefore realized, producing
      increased intensity and coherency of the emitted maser-like
      photonic waves.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">C. The Attractant</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As stated above, the scatter surface of the present invention must
      be soaked in (or treated with) a suitable semiochemical,
      attractant or quenchant. The particular solution used depends on
      the insect to be controlled. For example, excellent results were
      achieved in mosquito attracting tests when the attractant used was
      a saline solution which approximated human sweat. A preferred
      composition for this saline solution is presented in Table 5
      (below).<br>

      An apparatus has been disclosed for generating coherent or
      semi-coherent radiation frequencies to control or attract insects.
      While the invention has been particularly shown and described with
      reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood

      The invention overcomes the problems with conventional solutions
      by utilizing natural (copied) scatter surfaces (20), dielectric
      spine (sensilla) forms, correct pumping radiations (60) and
      correct vibratory modulating frequency (40) to generate coherent
      or semi-coherent radiation frequencies to control or attract
      insects. Such control acting either as an attractant (e.g., for

      The present invention includes an apparatus and method for
      generating, duplicating, and transmitting biophotonic radio
      frequencies that propagate along the atmospheric boundary layer of
      the human skin and the earth's atmosphere. These biophotonic radio
      frequencies are applied to a human patient for therapeutic
      purposes. This function is realized with the use of a series of
      oscillators (i.e., electronic function generators) designed to
      produce modulated or unmodulated sine and square wave photons. The
      oscillators are further adapted to emit the modulated or
      unmodulated sine and square wave photons from a dielectric or
      metal antenna built as loops into the walls of a
      diamagnetic-paramagnetic chamber. When a person is seated in the
      chamber, the photons of energy from the waves generated along the
      loop antenna penetrate the human body and provide a variety of
      therapeutic benefits. Among these therapeutic benefits are relief
      of rheumatic muscular pain, slowing the metabolism, increasing the
      efficiency of the immune system, eliminating certain psychosomatic
      ailments, and suppressing cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to an electronic photonic
      method and apparatus for using natural radio frequencies for
      therapeutic purposes, and more particularly, a system and method
      for generating a highly amplified radio signal comprising
      extremely low frequency or very low frequency radio signals for
      feedback into the human body for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Discussion of Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention described herein is based on the early work
      of Snape, d'Arsonval, Rabinovitch, and Leduc. In particular, Snape
      pioneered the use of extremely low radio frequencies (ELF) as an
      anesthetic in dental extraction (Snape, J., On electricity as an
      anesthetic in dental extractions, Trans. Odont. Soc. Gr. Brit.,
      pp. 287-312. (1869)). Subsequently, in 1890, Arsine d'Arsonval
      demonstrated that ELF pulsed electrical currents, ranging from
      2500 Hz to 10,000 Hz, induced general anesthesia in humans.
      Similarly, in 1902, Leduc demonstrated that a pulsed electrical DC
      current applied to the central nervous system could effectively
      induce anesthesia. Rabinovitch did extensive work in the area of
      electric analgesia sleep and resuscitation (Rabinovitch, L. G.,
      Electric Analgesia Sleep and Resuscitation Anesthesia (chap. XVI),
      ed. J. T. Gwatheny. D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York, pp. 628-643
      (1914)). More recently, Czaja demonstrated that treatment in the
      ELF frequency range enhances the immune system (Czaja, W.,
      Comparative Studies of Electro-analgesia and Barbiturates, Polski
      Archirum Weterynaryjne, pp. 205-224 (1986)).<br>
      <br>
      Between 1965 and 1973 Applicant demonstrated that antennae
      sensilla on insects act as photonic waveguides to collect and
      transmit infrared frequencies. From this early research, Applicant
      postulated that living systems (e.g., insect spines and plant
      fibers) also utilize the radio portion of the frequency spectrum
      to energize photons from radio and infrared emitting molecules.
      The requirement for detecting and or stimulating infrared and
      radio emissions from living systems is the ELF modulation of the
      organic and gaseous interface located at the waxy surface of the
      system. That is, living systems store coherent photon emissions
      from the external environment which become part of the
      self-organization of the living system. It has been demonstrated
      that ELF frequencies in living systems range from 10@3 Hz in nerve
      action potentials to 10@-2 Hz for physiological functions.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these principles, Applicant has determined that radio
      waves in the ELF region of the radio spectrum are propagated along
      the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin. ELF in the range
      of 800 Hz to 5200 Hz averaging 1000 Hz, with narrowband 10,000 Hz
      to 150,000 Hz sideband ELF radio signals are natural to the skin
      surface. The 700 Hz to 10,000 Hz region of the frequency spectrum
      is the region of so called radio "whistlers" (i.e. radio signals)
      from atmospheric lightning strikes around the world. It is this
      atmospheric electricity that modulates the frequencies from the
      atmospheric boundary layer of the skin. These modulation
      frequencies are equivalent to the 3 Hz to 40 Hz oscillations
      discovered by W. O. Schumann stimulated by lightning. These
      flicker modulations (which are approximately 3 Hz to 6 Hz) can be
      observed on an oscilloscope while measuring the 1000 Hz and 10,000
      sidebands present on the human skin.<br>
      <br>
      In 1952, Schumann calculated the atmospheric cavity resonance
      between the earth and ionosphere as being in the low ELF region
      (e.g., 1 to 40 Hz). In 1962 H. L. Koening measured these photonic
      radio waves and pointed out that some of them fall in the same
      region as human EEG frequencies between 0.5 and 3 Hz. In 1974 M.
      A. Persinger found ELF field effects on mammals and persons. A
      summary of the therapeutic effects of ELF is given in Ehrmann et
      al., "Influence of Altering Magnetic Fields [Frequencies Between 1
      and 20 Hz] on Psychosomatic Ailments", presented at the second
      Bioclimatological Colloquium (1976).<br>
      <br>
      The above work deals with the effect of radio frequencies on the
      diseased body. However, these articles do not consider the
      modulation of waves by lower frequencies or the wave form of the
      treatment frequencies. Nor do they contemplate a specific
      environment for applying radio frequencies to the diseased body
      for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      These and other advances concerning electricity and its effect
      upon living systems, as well as the discovery that radio waves in
      the ELF region are propagated along the atmospheric boundary layer
      of the human skin are utilized by the present invention. The
      present invention includes an apparatus and method for generating
      the biophotonic radio frequencies that propagate along the
      atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin. The present
      invention further includes a method and apparatus for using these
      radio frequencies for therapeutic purposes. In addition, exact
      human-atmospheric, stone, sand, and plant frequency ranges, their
      modulation parameters, and their exact waveforms are elucidated
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      These functions are realized with the use of a series of
      oscillators (i.e., electronic function generators) designed to
      produce modulated sine wave and square-like wave photons wave
      photons. The oscillators are further adapted to emit the modulated
      sine and square wave photons from a dielectric or metal antenna
      built as loops into the walls of a diamagnetic-paramagnetic
      chamber. When a person is seated in the chamber, the photons of
      energy from the waves generated along the loop antenna penetrate
      the human body and provide a variety of therapeutic effects. Among
      these therapeutic effects are relief of rheumatic muscular pain,
      slowing the metabolism, increasing the efficiency of the immune
      system, eliminating certain psychosomatic ailments, and
      suppressing cancer.<br>

        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Radio waves in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) and Very Low
      Frequency (VLF) region are propagated along the atmospheric
      boundary layer of the human or mammalian skin, rock surfaces, sod
      (soil), and plants (in particular trees). These radio waves occur
      between 0.5 Hz and 20,000 Hz in the Schumann, electrical
      anesthesia, and electronic induction portion of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, these radio waves sometimes
      show narrow 10,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz narrow sidebands that vary from
      person to person, plant to plant, etc., due to the health of the
      living animal or plant, the time of day, and the weather
      conditions. The highest peak of these emissions occurs at dawn and
      dusk (i.e. between 0630 to 0930 hrs and from 1830 to 2130 hrs). In
      other words, these radio waves tend to increase in amplitude
      during these peak dawn and dusk times.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1(A) shows a front sectional view of a treatment chamber 10
      constructed in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 1(B)
      shows a top sectional view of the treatment chamber 10. The
      treatment chamber 10 is built in a hexagon shape of Navajo hogan
      design. The treatment chamber can be built to any dimensions so
      long as a human can comfortably sit in the treatment chamber 10
      without making contact with the walls of the treatment chamber 10.
      A recommended size is 8 feet by 8 feet. In a preferred embodiment,
      the treatment chamber 10 is made of wooden logs or architect
      square logs each of which are approximately six inches thick. Wood
      is used because it is an excellent diamagnetic material (i.e., it
      is repelled by a magnetic field). In other words, the treatment
      chamber 10 is constructed from a material that helps insulate the
      patient sitting in the treatment chamber 10 from outside magnetic
      forces.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment chamber 10 has a roof 20 constructed from corbled
      logs and/or wood. The entire treatment chamber 10 is covered with
      paramagnetic earth (200 centimeter-grams, per second (cgs) or
      above--cgs defined generally as the amount of time one gram of a
      material will move towards a magnet placed one centimeter away).
      The earth mound is sodded with a living grass. The treatment
      chamber 10 could also be covered with bricks instead of earth so
      long as the bricks are paramagnetic. In other words, the treatment
      chamber can be covered by any material that is paramagnetic. The
      floor of the treatment chamber 10 is constructed from hardened
      compact clay or earth. The floor is also covered with a wool
      carpet 95 since wool does not store a magnetic charge.<br>
      <br>
      The configuration of the treatment chamber 10 provides a layered
      system since the earth covering is paramagnetic and the wood is
      diamagnetic. In this document the term paramagnetic is defined as
      a material that is susceptible to magnetism. The material does not
      store the magnetic force, rather if brought in contact with a
      magnet it would be drawn towards it. Diamagnetic is the opposite.
      A diamagnetic material is repelled by a magnet. Diamagnetic
      materials also do not store a magnetic force.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments by the Applicant in volcanic areas with paramagnetic
      soil (e.g., Ireland) and in diamagnetic areas with little or no
      soil (e.g., Upper Amazon) have shown that a combination of a
      diamagnetic layer (e.g., plant material) and a paramagnetic layer
      (e.g., volcanic earth or clay brick) tend to focus or concentrate
      the radio waves (describe below) that are introduced into the
      treatment chamber 10. It appears that diamagnetic-paramagnetic
      layers act as a condenser for storing and discharging the ELF and
      VLF energy.<br>
      <br>
      An antenna loop 30 is imbedded in the wall of the treatment
      chamber 10. The antenna loop 30 is formed from thin copper wire or
      of 1/4 inch hemp rope which has been soaked for one day in a sea
      salt solution. Other materials that could be used to construct the
      antenna loop would be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna loop 30 encircles the treatment chamber 10 within a
      diamagnetic fiberboard wall 40. The antenna loop 30 is spaced with
      the individual loops one inch apart from floor to ceiling.<br>
      <br>
      The leads from the antenna loop 30 are passed through the
      fiberboard wall 40 and connected to a wave generator 50. FIG. 2
      shows a block diagram of the wave generator 50. The wave generator
      50 includes an oscillator 55 (oscillator 55 is also referred to as
      a function generator), an amplifier 60, an arbitrary function
      generator 70, a mixer 80, and a computer 90. Each of these
      components will now be described in detail.<br>
      <br>
      The arbitrary function generator 70 is controlled by the computer
      90. The arbitrary function generator 70 is an instrument which
      generates periodic waveforms that duplicate various types of
      defined mathematical functions. In other words, the arbitrary
      function generator 70 is computer programmable to duplicate any
      known frequency or waveform. Function generators are well known in
      the art, and for the sake of brevity, the programming and
      operation of the arbitrary function generator 70 will not be
      described in detail here. In operation, a user programs the
      computer 90 to provide a particular waveform to the arbitrary
      function generator 70. The arbitrary function generator 70
      duplicates the waveform provided by the computer 70 and produces
      waveform S1.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternate embodiment, an antenna 65 is connected directly to
      the arbitrary function generator 70. As discussed above, there are
      a variety of radio waves that are natural to the atmosphere. The
      present invention is based on the theory that these natural waves,
      if applied in an amplified form to the human body, can provide
      therapeutic benefits. Thus, the antenna 65 can be connected
      directly to the function generator 70, which in turn duplicates
      the exact waveform of the radio waves that are propagating within
      the atmosphere. The preferred antenna used for detecting these
      natural radio waves can be found in a patent application filed
      Apr. 19, 1993, in the name of Dr. Philip S. Callahan, entitled
      "Photonic Ionic Cord Detector of Group Waves" U.S. patent
      application Ser. No. 08/047,486, which is hereby incorporated by
      reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      The arbitrary function generator 70 is connected to the amplifier
      60. Amplifiers are very well known, and for the sake of brevity a
      detailed description of the amplifier 60 will not be given. The
      amplifier 60 amplifies the waveform S1 produced by the arbitrary
      function generator 70. The amplifier 60 produces amplified
      waveform S2. The amplifier 60 is connected to the oscillator 55
      which stabilizes the amplified waveform S2. Note that the
      amplifier 60 can be connected directly to the antenna 30, but the
      waveform might not be as stable.<br>
      <br>
      The oscillator 55 is connected to the antenna 30. Thus, the
      duplicated amplified waveform is provided to the antenna 30. These
      waveforms are transmitted into the treatment chamber 10 by the
      antenna 30. It is these waveforms that provide therapeutic
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      The waveform S1 can take many forms, including a sine wave or a
      sine wave riding another sine wave. The first signal S1 is
      typically a modulated millivolt signal. The modulated millivolt
      signal is amplified by the amplifier 60 up to volt ranges.<br>
      <br>
      It has been determined by Applicant that the natural radio waves
      that propagate throughout the atmosphere, as well as the natural
      waves that propagate along the surface of the human body if
      amplified and provided to a diseased body can aid in the treatment
      of diseases or medical ailments. Consequently, it is these natural
      radio waves that should be duplicated and generated by the
      arbitrary function generator 70. Some of these waveforms are
      described briefly below.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3(A) through 3(H) illustrate eight different exemplary
      waveforms (i.e., radio waves) that can be produced by the
      arbitrary function generator 70. All eight radio waves occur
      naturally in the atmosphere or along the surface of the human
      body. The computer 90 is programmed by a user to generate the
      desired waveform. Such programming would be apparent to a person
      skilled in the relevant art based on the following description of
      exemplary waveforms. As discussed above, this waveform is
      duplicated by the arbitrary function generator 70. These signals
      are described briefly below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3A illustrates an unmodulated waveform. The unmodulated
      waveform can have resonant peaks at 4, 8, 14 or 28 Herts (Hz).
      FIG. 3B illustrates a modulated 2,000 Hz sine wave carried on a 4
      to 8 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3C illustrates a modulated 100 Hz sine
      wave carried on a 4 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3D illustrates a modulated
      600 Hz square wave carried on a 120 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3E
      illustrates a modulated 8700 Hz sine wave with 20,000 Hz spikes
      generated and carried randomly along its fixed frequency. FIG. 3F
      illustrates a modulated 600 Hz grounded square wave with 20,000 Hz
      spikes generated and carried randomly along its fixed frequency.
      FIG. 3G illustrates a soliton target or group waves, of a very
      specific form, varying between 0.5 Hz and 1000 Hz with a band gap
      of between 1 Hz and 10 Hz in the middle as given in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      A group wave is the sum of many phase waves. For a more derailed
      discussion of group waves see Brillouin and Sommerfield, Wave
      Propagation and Group Velocity, Academic Press, New York, 1960.
      These radio waves have been so named because the varying group
      wave frequencies modulate a basic phase Schumann wave. Note that
      Schumann waves vary with geographic region. Since a soliton is a
      wave riding another wave and the varying group wave between 0.5 Hz
      to 170 Hz is superimposed (frequency modulates) on the standard
      geographical Schumann wave. The soliton is considered by Applicant
      to be a special sum group (sometimes called target waves) of the
      natural unpolluted atmosphere. (See Allowiz and Segur, Solitons
      and Inverse Scattering Transform, Siam Publishers, Philadelphia,
      1981.) The radio group soliton waves have recently been discovered
      by Applicant in nature. In a preferred embodiment, the wave
      generator 70 is programmed by computer 90 to duplicate and
      generate the soliton group wave (see FIG. 4) since Applicant
      believes this wave provides the most beneficial therapeutic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      The amplifier 60 may be connected to a plurality of arbitrary
      function generators 70 each producing a different waveform S1. A
      first switch 65 is provided so that one of the signals S1 or a
      mixed signal S3 can be selected and fed into the amplifier 60. A
      second switch (not shown) is provided to allow multiple waveforms
      S1 to be input into the mixer 80.<br>
      <br>
      The mixer 80 is capable of producing a variety of different
      signals that are deviations from the waveforms S1. Note that if
      the mixer 80 is used the first switch (not shown) does not select
      a waveform S1 from the arbitrary function generators 70. The mixer
      80 emits single or mixtures of the duplicated waveforms emitted by
      the arbitrary function generators 70. This mixed waveform is
      labeled S3. The emitted waveform S3 from the mixer 80 is provided
      to the amplifier 60. Note that the signals from the arbitrary
      function generators 70 do not have to pass through the mixer 80.
      Rather the signals from the arbitrary function generator 70 can
      be, and most frequently are, passed directly to the amplifier 60.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment chamber 10 should be located at least 1/2 mile from
      an AC power source (60 Hz or greater). The wave generator 50
      should be DC battery operated.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred means for the patient to absorb the therapeutic
      frequencies is to sit in the center of the treatment chamber 10
      without contacting the surrounding loop antenna (i.e., without
      contacting the surrounding walls of the treatment chamber). Thus,
      only the atmospheric-skin boundary frequencies emitted by the loop
      antenna 30 are absorbed by the patient. The wave generator 50 is
      tuned depending on the specific therapeutic treatment. The tuning
      of the wave generator 50 is based on previously proven wave forms
      (see Ehrmann cited above), or by experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      In short, the treatment chamber 10 is imitating nature but in a
      more amplified manner. By providing an environment that contains
      an atmosphere that is saturated with amplified radio signals that
      are natural (i.e., propagate within the earths atmosphere or along
      the surface of the human body), the patient can obtain a
      significant therapeutic benefit.<br>
      <br>
      An alternate method of using the teachings of the present
      invention is to feed the radio waves that are output from the
      antenna 30 directly into the human body by grounding the feet and
      placing the antenna lead in one hand of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been particularly shown and described with
      reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood
      by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes
      in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

      A method and apparatus for detecting radio waves that propagate
      along the atmospheric boundary layer of human skin. This function
      is realized with the use of a photonic cloth constructed of flax
      and wool, soaked in a saline solution and air dried, and
      subsequently placed upon the human skin. The radio waves can then
      be monitored by connecting the photonic cloth via a set of probes
      to an oscilloscope.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus
      for detecting the radio frequencies that propagate along the
      atmospheric boundary layer of human skin.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Discussion of Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention described herein is based on the early work
      of Snape, d'Arsonval, Rabinovitch, and Leduc. In particular, Snape
      pioneered the use of extremely low radio frequencies (ELF) as an
      anesthetic in dental extraction (Snape, J., On electricity as an
      anesthetic in dental extractions, Trans. Odont. Soc. Gr. Brit.,
      pp. 287-312. (1869)). Subsequently, in 1890, Arsine d'Arsonval
      demonstrated that ELF pulsed electrical currents, ranging from
      2500 Hz to 10,000 Hz, induced general anesthesia in humans.
      Similarly, in 1902, Leduc demonstrated that a pulsed electrical DC
      current applied to the central nervous system could effectively
      induce anesthesia. Robinovitch did extensive work in the area of
      electric analgesia sleep and resuscitation (Robinovitch, L. G.,
      Electric Analgesia Sleep and Resuscitation Anesthesia (chap. XVI),
      ed. J. T. Gwatheny. D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York, pp. 628-643
      (1914)). More recently, Czaja demonstrated that treatment in the
      ELF frequency range enhances the immune system (Czaja, W.,
      Comparative Studies of Electroanalgesia and Barbiturates, Polski
      Archivum Weterynaryjne, pp. 205-224 (1986)).<br>
      <br>
      Between 1965 and 1973 applicant demonstrated that antennae
      sensilla on insects act as photonic waveguides to collect and
      transmit infrared frequencies. From this early research, applicant
      postulated that living systems (e.g., insect spines and plant
      fibers) also utilize the radio portion of the frequency spectrum
      to energize photons from radio and infrared emitting molecules.
      The requirement for detecting and or stimulating infrared and
      radio emissions from living systems is the ELF modulation of the
      organic and gaseous interface located at the waxy surface of the
      system. That is, living systems store coherent photon emissions
      from the external environment which become part of the
      self-organization of the living system. It has been demonstrated
      that ELF frequencies in living systems range from 10@3 Hz in nerve
      action potentials to 10@-2 Hz for physiological functions.<br>
      <br>
      From this prior research, applicant has determined that radio
      waves in the ELF region of the radio spectrum are propagated along
      the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin. ELF in the range
      of 800 Hz to 5200 Hz averaging 1000 Hz, with narrowband 10,000 Hz
      to 150,000 Hz sideband ELF radio signals are natural to the skin
      surface. The 700 Hz to 10,000 Hz region of the frequency spectrum
      is the region of so called radio "whistlers" (i.e. radio signals)
      from atmospheric lightning strikes around the world. It is this
      atmospheric electricity that modulates the frequencies from the
      atmospheric boundary layer of the skin. These modulation
      frequencies are equivalent to the 3 Hz to 10 Hz oscillations
      discovered by Schumann stimulated by lightning. These flicker
      modulations (which are approximately 3 Hz to 6 Hz) can be observed
      on an oscilloscope while measuring the 1000 Hz and 10,000
      sidebands present on the human skin.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 of the appended drawings are readings of an
      oscilloscope showing the radio signals in the 700 Hz to 10,000 Hz
      portion of the ELF radio spectrum that are emitted from normal,
      healthy human skin. These signals were detected by touching the
      oscilloscope probe to the photonic ionic cloth radio amplifier and
      touching the face of a cathode ray tube with the hand. A battery
      (DC) operated 222 Tekronix hand held digital storage oscilloscope
      and capacitance coupling, with no AC interference, was used for
      detecting these frequencies in this manner. At a 5 mV range and a
      1 mS sweep time the amplitude ranges from 1/2 mV (weak signal) to
      30 Mv (strong signal).<br>
      <br>
      The oscilloscope sweep shown in FIG. 1 has approximately two main
      1000 Hz frequencies (between approximately 800-1200 Hz), shown at
      C1 and D1, which are 180 DEG out of phase and occur exactly 8.4 Ms
      apart. At high amplitudes the two main broad band frequencies
      generate a series of narrow sidebands of approximately 10,000 Hz,
      shown in FIG. 1 between A1 and B1. The 10,000 Hz sidebands are
      emitted when the two main 1000 Hz frequencies reach an amplitude
      of 15 Mv or higher. As shown in FIG. 2, there may be as few as one
      sideband, as shown at A2, to as many as fifteen sidebands. At
      extremely high amplitudes there is a main band frequency
      splitting. As few as one sideband to as many as eight sidebands
      emit from the region of the 1000 Hz signal under such high
      amplitude conditions. FIG. 3 shows an example of an oscilloscope
      sweep at an extremely high amplitude, having two sidebands, shown
      at A3 and B3.<br>

        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      These and other advances concerning electricity and its effect
      upon living systems, as well as the discovery that radio waves in
      the ELF region are propagated along the atmospheric boundary layer
      of the human skin are utilized by the present invention. The
      present invention includes a method and apparatus for detecting
      the radio frequencies that propagate along the atmospheric
      boundary layer of the human skin. This function is realized with
      the use of a photonic cloth constructed of flax and wool which is
      soaked in a saline solution and air dried, and subsequently placed
      upon the human skin. When the photonic cloth is placed in contact
      with the skin it has an electroanesthesic effect on the body.<br>

        DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, radio waves in the ELF region are
      propagated along the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin.
      In particular, 1000 Hz (between approximately 800 Hz to 5200 Hz)
      and narrowband 10,000 Hz to 150,000 Hz sideband ELF radio signals
      are natural to the surface of the skin of the human body. The
      narrow sidebands vary from person to person (e.g., due to the
      health of the person), time of day and weather conditions,
      although the 1000 Hz and 10,000 Hz sidebands are continuously
      emitted from the skin's atmospheric boundary layer. The highest
      peak of these emissions occurs at dawn and dusk (i.e. between 0630
      to 0930 hrs and from 1830 to 2130 hrs). The 1000 Hz and 10,000 Hz
      sideband frequencies can be detected, and amplified, by the
      photonic ionic cloth of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4, one embodiment of the photonic cloth of the
      present invention is shown generally at 400. Photonic cloth 400 is
      constructed as a plain weave, comprising warp yarns 405 made of
      flax and weft or filling yarns 410 made of wool. Each warp yarn is
      a single yarn, while each filling yarn consists of three smaller
      yarns combined to form a single yarn. The flax used to form yarns
      405 is natural and untreated (i.e., Linum usitatissimum).
      Similarly, weft yarns 410 should be made from natural, untreated
      wool. Thus, both the flax and wool should be unblended and
      unwashed so that the lanolin remains in the wool, and the waxy
      outer layer remains on the flax. The natural flax acts as a
      dielectric waveguide (i.e. it is photonic) due to its waxy
      characteristics. Although one yarn of flax is sufficient as warp
      yarns 405, experiments have shown that two or more yarns in
      combination will also detect and generate the 1000 Hz and 10,000
      Hz sideband frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The photonic cloth can be any size. However, in the preferred
      embodiment of the present invention, cloth 400 is approximately
      two inch by six inch to six inch by fifteen inch. In the
      alternative, the cloth could be woven as a belt approximately
      three inch by forty-eight inch long.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to weaving, the cloth could be knitted using any known
      technique utilizing natural and unblended flax as the warp yarns
      and natural and unblended wool for the filling.<br>
      <br>
      To enhance the ability of the cloth to stimulate and/or detect the
      radio emissions from the skin surface, it is soaked in a saline
      solution for approximately one to six hours and then air dried
      until it is just slightly damp. The saline solution preferably
      consists of an isotonic aqueous solution containing a borate
      buffer system and sodium chloride, preserved with 0.1% of sorbic
      acid and disodium (EDTA). An alternative is to use four
      tablespoons of sea salt per 1/2 pint of water with the same borate
      buffer as described above. Ocean or sea water could also be used.
      The saline content in the damp cloth acts as an ionic detector for
      the radio energy emitted from the human skin. In particular, the
      hollow and fanshaped (i.e., branched) wool fibers act as an
      insulator, storing and feeding moisture to the waxy flax which
      absorbs the salt and thus becomes a photonic waveguide detector.
      Furthermore, the wool acts a condenser by keeping the system
      electrically charged above what it would be charged if the cloth
      was made of saline treated flax alone. Thus, the cloth should be
      kept slightly damp during use. In order to maintain this slight
      dampness, the cloth may be placed between two polyethylene layers
      or their equivalent and sealed to retain the slight moisture. It
      is important to maintain the cloth in a slightly damp condition,
      because if the cloth is completely dry or very damp the cloth will
      not function properly.<br>
      <br>
      Turning now to FIG. 5, an oscilloscope recording taken at 0702
      from a piece of saline-soaked, air dried woven photonic cloth is
      shown. This reading was taken with a 2214 digital storage
      oscilloscope at 1.times. magnification and 10.times. amplitude.
      The woven photonic cloth was soaked in saline solution for three
      hours and dried for six hours. FIG. 5 shows two 1000 Hz
      frequencies, shown at A5 and B5, which are 8.4 Ms apart, and
      riding an AC interference. FIG. 6, which is a magnification of the
      recording shown in FIG. 5 (taken at 0710, at 10.times.
      magnification and 10.times. amplitude), shows the two 1000 Hz
      frequencies, shown at A6 and B6, with peak to peak separation.
      FIG. 7 is a magnification of the details of the first 1000 Hz
      frequency shown at A6 in FIG. 6. The recording in FIG. 7 was taken
      at 0725 at 50.times. magnification and 10.times. amplitude. FIG. 8
      is a magnification of the details of the second 1000 Hz frequency
      shown at B6 in FIG. 6. The recording in FIG. 8 was taken at 0720
      at 50.times. magnification and 10.times. amplification. The
      oscilloscope used to make the recording shown in FIGS. 5, 6, 7 and
      8 was set at a 5 Mv range with a 1 Ms Sweep. The oscilloscope
      sweep shown in FIG. 8 demonstrates that the human body acts as an
      antenna to transmit the E field back and forth across space as an
      ELF radio wave. The ELF radio signals are capable of penetrating
      six layers of human skin (approximately 1/4" each), two feet of
      stacked fabric, and 2" of solid rock, with no attenuation
      whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 9, an oscilloscope sweep is shown which was
      taken from a six inch by fifteen inch sample of saline-soaked
      photonic woven cloth with one hand of a test person held
      approximately one foot from the photonic cloth and the thumb
      capacitance coupled to the 222 Tekronix digital storage
      oscilloscope at the cathode ray face. Two 1000 Hz frequencies are
      shown at C9 and D9 8.4 Ms apart. Both 1000 Hz frequencies have two
      10,000 Hz sidebands. An example of a pair of 10,000 Hz sidebands
      is shown at A9 and B9. Similarly, FIG. 10 shows an oscilloscope
      sweep taken from a two inch by six inch knitted piece of
      saline-soaked photonic cloth with the thumb capacitance coupled to
      the cathode ray face and the hand of the tester directly touching
      the cloth. The oscilloscope sweep shown in FIG. 10 demonstrates
      that with the body of the tester directly touching the photonic
      cloth, there is a tremendous increase in the amplitude of the 1000
      Hz and 10,000 Hz sidebands signal, as opposed to the oscilloscope
      sweep shown in FIG. 9. The first main 1000 Hz signal shown at B10
      has one sideband signal of 10,000 Hz shown at A10 ; the second
      main signal shown at D10 also has one sideband signal of 10,000 Hz
      shown at C10.<br>
      <br>
      When the photonic cloth is placed against the human skin, the
      radio energy between the skin and the cloth are coherent. The
      photonic cloth has spacial coherence because the antenna aperture
      is zero. The 1 Ms sweep and fixed position of the waves
      demonstrate that there is temporal coherence as well. Furthermore,
      because the signal reaches an extremely high amplitude when the
      photonic cloth touches the skin, the signal also becomes a phase
      conjugated signal.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been particularly shown and described with
      reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood
      by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes
      in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

      insect sex scent attractants and host plant or animal scent
      attractants is converted into narrow band high intensity maserlike

      surrounded by vapors of said attractants and vibrated (modulated)
      in an infrared source of electromagnetic energy at 1 to 30 mu m
      and at the antenna vibrating frequency of the insect. The narrow
      band maserlike emission and harmonies thereof are emitted through
      the IR window and detected by a spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND OF
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It has long been known that insects are attracted to specific
      molecules of sex attractants. The isolation of sex and host plant
      attractant molecules has progressed steadily over the past three
      decades. The electromagnetic dielectric antennae theory of insect
      sensing by means of resonating pits was put forth by Grant in 1948
      (Grant, G. R. M. The Sensory Pits of Insects Considered As
      Dielectric Waveguides and Resonators to Infrared Rays. Proceedings
      of the royal Society of Queensland 60 (8): 89-98, 1948). Callahan
      elaborated on a similar theory in 1965 (Callahan, P. S.,
      Intermediate and Far Infrared (FIR) Electromagnetic Theory of
      Communication and Sensing in Moths and Its Relationship to the
      Limiting Biosphere of the Corn Earworm, Annals of the
      Entomological Society of America 58 (5): 727-745, 1965),
      (Callahan, P. S., Far Infrared Emission and Detection by Night
      Flying Moths, Nature 207 (4989:1173, 1965), (Callahan, P. S., A
      Photoelectric-photographic Analysis of Flight Behavior in the Corn
      Earworm Moth, Heliothis Zea, and Other Moths, Annals of the
      Entomological Society of America 58(2): 159-169, 1965) and
      presented a theoretical model of the insect spine sensilla as
      dielectric wave guides and or resonators in the 1 to 30 .mu.m
      infrared region. He then postulated the emission of narrow band
      "maserlike" luminescence emissions from sex scents in the
      intermediate and far IR water vapor windows. Subsequently, he
      demonstrated with electrophysiological techniques the detection of
      modulated narrow band electromagnetic energy by an insect antenna.
      Work continues in the detection of these theorized infrared
      maserlike emissions in the 2 to 5 .mu.m, 7 to 14 .mu.m, and 17
      .mu.m and 26 .mu.m microwindows. A Fourier analysis spectrometer
      is used to detect and plot the narrow band maserlike emissions
      and/or reflections.<br>
      <br>
      The theory, method and apparatus were proved out in the laboratory
      as shown by FIGS. 1, 2, and 3.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECTIVES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is the object of this invention to provide a system or method
      for the attraction of insects. More specifically, it is the object
      of this invention to provide a system of attracting insects or
      jamming infrared frequencies from insect scents, using the optimum
      infrared portion of spectrum from insect sex scent attractants and
      host plant or animal scent attractants and converting into narrow
      band high intensity maserlike infrared emissions. Another object
      of this invention is to emit narrow band maserlike emissions and
      harmonics through the IR window and detect them by a spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to show that the wave
      properties of an insect sex or host scent are propagated forward
      through the 1 to 30 .mu.m infrared window.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 4, the wave properties of an insect sex or
      host scent are propagated forward through infrared window 3 which
      is 1 to 30 .mu.m. Said window is in the center of a vertical side
      of cube 2. Cube 2 is one inch cubed, but can be any multiple
      thereof, and substantially forms a chamber. A bulb of similar
      diameter can also serve adequately as a chamber. The chamber can
      be constructed from or blown from glass. A three-quarter inch
      diameter innfrared window 3 (1 to 30 .mu.m transmittance) of
      suitable window material and 2 to 5 .mu.m thin is sealed in window
      3 of cube 2. Cube 2 is evacuated of air to approximately one-half
      room atmosphere and 50 percent relative humidity by pin of air
      outlet 7 which is connected to an external evacuation means (not
      shown). At the center of cube 2 or approximately 1/2 inch behind
      the 1-30 .mu.m IR window, a silver or gold or aluminum reed
      vibrator 4 is positioned so that it bisects the center or lies
      along the edge of the 1 to 30 .mu.m IR window. Reed 4 is
      one-sixteenth of an inch wide and three-quarters of an inch long
      or may be a 250 .mu.m diameter steel pin. Said reed or pin is
      coated with a monomolecular layer (single layer) of a suitable
      insect sex attractant (pheromone) or host plant attractant or the
      chamber is filled with vapors of said attractant. The inside of
      the chamber and/or bulb is painted with a silver reflective coat.
      Vibrating reed or pin 4 is connected through the sealed cube
      and/or bulb to a low frequency oscillator 1 with an adjustable
      duty cycle of from 5 to 700 cycles per second. Approximately
      1/2-inch behind the reed vibrator and centered in front of the
      back mirrored surface of the cube and/or bulb, and in the center
      of the front of the 1 to 30 .mu.m IR window is a tungsten filament
      heating element 5. The heating element is wired through the
      partially evacuated cube or bulb to an adjustable heating unit 6
      variable from 300 to 1000 K (absolute) temperature. In place of
      the variable temperature source 5 and in the same position a 1
      .mu.m emitting diode or other suitable coherent diode (1 to 30
      .mu.m) may be substituted as an energy source. For certain insect
      sex or host scents the 1 .mu.m or other IR wavelength emitting
      diode is preferable.<br>
      <br>
      The infrared energy from the adjustable temperature filament 5
      and/or coherent diode is focused by the surrounding silver coated
      cube and/or bulb onto the monomolecular layer coated or vapor
      surrounded reed vibrator.<br>
      <br>
      The monomolecular layer and/or vapors of a suitable insect
      pheromone or host attractant is stimulated to emit by reproducing
      the vibrating frequency of the antenna of the insect from which
      the pheromone was obtained and/or the host attractant of the
      insect. The stimulated IR frequencies and/or harmonics of the
      frequencies from the monomolecular layer on the reed and or vapors
      surrounding the reed are directed forward from the surface of the
      vibrating reed facing the IR window. Each stimulated line of IR
      radiation emits as a single lobe of radiation and is transmitted
      in a forward direction through the suitable 1 to 30 .mu.m infrared
      window 3.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency and or harmonics thereof may then be detected by a
      high resolution Fourier analysis interferometer spectrophometer
      (not shown).<br>

      life along with water and light but finds one of its most
      purposeful uses after that: the creation of organic matter,
      helping transform and conserve it, as opposed to what their stray
      descendants are doing: dumping, wasting and leaching, suffocating
      and fouling it, sawing off the limbs they ripened (and rotted?)
      on.<br>
      <br>
      There are many ways to apply rock dust to the soil. It can be
      spread by hand, by mechanical means, sprayed with a mechanical
      sprayer end blown on during wind stillness (avoid inhaling
      it)...Improvising with fine mesh sieves, stockings and wet brushes
      for small amounts is lots of fun.<br>
      <br>
      Combining rock dust with organic materials in compost can be a
      good way to solve application problems. Rock dust assimilates
      quicker in compost than in poor soils, where you can expect
      miracles, but not as quickly.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Composting Tips</span><br>
      <br>
      For compost Helmut Snoek recommends 1 lb per3 sq ft on each layer
      of a 2/3 ft high and a little less when the dust is extra fine.
      Don't forget a handful of dirt to inoculate with organisms and try
      to keep the N-C ratio 1-10. If there is a lot of manure around,
      you can't mix it with rock dust too soon for immediate improvement
      of the air and end product. Raw manure is a health hazard til
      properly composted. Rock dust ties down and absorbs the volatile
      ammonia compounds, 40-80% of which can gets lost to the air
      otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      This is why the Swiss bio farmers spread it in their stables,
      apart from hoof stability it keeps the air purer<br>
      <br>
      Some remarks from the Lubkes (soil specialists often appearing in
      Acres, U.S.A.) on compost:<br>
      <br>
      Compost heats up faster than rock dust. Do not allow to exceed 130
      degrees to prevent heat loss. Rock dust improves aeration end
      structure end therefore prevents rotting. Aim for a compost with
      30-50% organic material. 60-80 lb of fine ground rock dust per ton
      of compost is considered optimal.<br>
      <br>
      Rock Dust and compost have much in common; they are ready food for
      life's smallest beginnings and from there on up the whole food
      chain. To both soil-making life-savers applies the rules of thumb,
      if you ask me the rule of the most common denomination, and
      therefore deserving to score highest on any scale of human
      aspiration (especially desert(born and/or influenced) cultures)
      the more diverse and varied the elements and ingredients, the
      richer and more fertile the results (This truth was alluded to 4
      times in the first two episodes of a PBS series called The Making
      of a Continent). Multiculturalism is therefore a more valid
      concept on microscopic scale than a few notches and 'field
      magnitudes' with more refined and diversified ways away. The
      problem is than these borderlines can not ever be drawn sharply
      cause the micro-mini-minimal molecules floating down the mountain
      streams and joining up down river are perhaps part of one and the
      same watershed but join forces with contributions from so many
      nooks, crannies, folds, valleys and bioregions, that they are
      bound to see a lot of compromises since they are not in Kansas
      anymore having traveled further afield then most bigger organisms
      therein ever do.<br>

      <br>
      Martin Gasteiger in Unterlohen, Bavaria in Germany has been doing
      organic farming since 1973 and has reduced the cost dramatically.
      Yearly he uses10 tons of rock dust at a cost of about $ 400 a year
      And he gets 7000 liters per hectare (2 1/2 acres) of milk. His
      cows become 10 years old or twice the age of the average cow end
      have twice as many calves as the average in Bavaria. How does
      Gasteiger manage to be so successful with so little means?<br>
      <br>
      He tries to take as good care of the soil as possible. He
      fertilizes only with small amounts of liquid manure, 10 cubic
      meters per hectare and only if the soil is dry. He collects all
      organic matter from his farm and household and composts it
      together with the calves manure, rock dust and soil and uses this
      mixture as bacterial nutrients for the field and farmland. He uses
      this compost as a bacteria supplier for the field and crop land.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid manure is treated especially with rock dust in the
      stable so that organic and mineral substances are combined and no
      toxicity arises. Then in a special container, a clay humus mixture
      is added end it is then aerated. This clay humus mixture is liquid
      end mixed in a concrete mixer. Out of the clay humus brew, every
      5-6 days, for every 20-25 cubic meters of liquid manure, one
      wheelbarrow of clay humus and some manure compost are added.<br>
      <br>
      Gasteiger says the bacteria in the humus act like an inoculation
      so that the rotting bacteria in the liquid manure increase
      dramatically. The aeration gives the necessary oxygen and the
      finely ground clay material in the concrete mixer and the rock
      dust have a great active surface that bind toxic elements so that
      they cannot interfere with the growth of the bacteria in the
      liquid manure. These clay particles also bind nutrients like
      nitrates so that they cannot be washed away in the groundwater.<br>
      <br>
      "Instead of buying expensive liquid manure additives, I make my
      own", says Martin Gasteiger.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid manure thus treated cannot be compared with the urine
      and manure. To prove this Gasteiger holds his hand in the
      container, washes it off under cold water without soap and holds
      it under our noses. There is not the slightest smell. And besides
      that it does not harm the soil life nor does it burn the grass
      land, even when the temperature goes above 90 degrees end above
      all, the animals like to eat the grass grown.<br>
      <br>
      It is applied only in dry weather under the motto, "little but
      often", about a liter per sq. meter (10sq ft to a meter). He
      succeeds in taking care of the earthworms, so they multiply end
      work for trim. The clover stays and manufactures nitrogen through
      the nitrogen collecting bacteria at the roots of the clover.<br>
      <br>
      Per hectare he adds 5 dt (dt= 1/10 ton) rockdust each year and
      every three years he adds 5-10 dt. His rock dust is Diabas, a
      volcanic rock of 55% selesium oxide from Kitzbuhl, Austria- with a
      guaranteed fineness of 0.09 mm end 1/3 of it is under 0.02 mm in
      size.<br>
      <br>
      An employee of the Bureau of Agriculture of Bavaria commented in
      an article on Gasteiger's results very cynically, if he had used
      conventional fertilizers with as much enthusiasm, his profit would
      be just as great!<br>
      <br>
      In response to this published comment 26 people wrote letters to
      the paper protesting this offhand comment- brushing aside of
      Gasteiger's method and success. They pointed out that people like
      Gasteiger should get all the help possible as they do something
      positive end naturel without subsidies!<br>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><small>Irish Round Tower<br>
        </small></h2>
      <p> Irish round towers are early medieval stone towers of a type
        found mainly in Ireland, with two in Scotland and one on the
        Isle of Man. Though there is no certain agreement as to their
        purpose, it is thought they were principally bell towers, places
        of refuge, or a combination of these. Generally found in the
        vicinity of a church or monastery, the door of the tower faces
        the west doorway of the church. In this way it has been possible
        to determine without excavation the approximate site of lost
        churches, where the tower still exists. $3</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">Some interesting
        Far-Out theories...</p>
      <p class="style1"><span class="style3">This idea that the round
          towers were erected and used primarily as watch towers and
          places of protection is strongly debated by an American
          scientist, Philip Callahan.Writing in his book, Ancient
          Mysteries, Modern Visions, Callahan discusses research which
          indicates that the round towers may have been designed,
          constructed and utilized as huge resonant systems for
          collecting and storing meter-long wavelengths of magnetic and
          electromagnetic energy coming from the earth and skies. Based
          on fascinating studies of the forms of insect antenna and
          their capacity to resonate to micrometer-long electromagnetic
          waves, Professor Callahan suggests that the Irish round towers
          (and similarly shaped religious structures throughout the
          ancient world) were human-made antenna which collected subtle
          magnetic radiation from the sun and passed it on to monks m</span><span
          class="style3">editating in the tower and plants growing
          around the tower's base. </span></p>
      <p>The round towers were able to function in this way because of
        their form and also because of their materials of construction.
        Of the sixty-five towers, twenty-five were built of limestone,
        thirteen of iron-rich, red sandstone, and the rest of basalt,
        clay slate or granite - all minerals which have paramagnetic
        properties and can thus act as magnetic antenna and energy
        conductors. Callahan further states that the mysterious fact of
        various towers being filled with rubble for portions of their
        interiors was not random but rather may have been a method of
        "tuning" the tower antenna so that it more precisely resonated
        with various cosmic frequencies.</p>
      <p>Equally intriguing, Callahan shows that the geographical
        arrangement of the round towers throughout the Irish countryside
        mirrors the positions of the stars in the northern sky during
        the time of winter solstice. Archaeological excavations at the
        bases of the towers have revealed that many towers were erected
        upon the tops of much older graves and it is known that many of
        the tower sites were considered sacred places long before the
        arrival of Christianity in Ireland. These facts compel us to
        wonder if the ancient Irish, like the Egyptians and the Mayans,
        understood there to be an energetic resonance between certain
        terrestrial locations and particular celestial bodies. This
        certainly seems to be the case. All across the Irish countryside
        certain locations were chosen, precisely designed structures
        were erected to gather and store various energies, and a
        tradition of humans' spiritual use of the sites arose over the
        millennia. While many of the round towers are now crumbling and
        therefore their antenna function may no longer be operative, a
        field of holiness still permeates the sites today.</p>

      Callahan discusses research which indicates that the round towers
      may have been designed, constructed and utilized as huge resonant
      systems for collecting and storing meter-long wavelengths of
      magnetic and electromagnetic energy coming from the earth and
      skies. Based on fascinating studies of the forms of insect antenna
      and their capacity to resonate to micrometer-long electromagnetic
      waves, Professor Callahan suggests that the Irish round towers
      (and similarly shaped religious structures throughout the ancient
      world) were human-made antenna which collected subtle magnetic
      radiation from the sun and passed it on to monks meditating in the
      tower and plants growing around the tower's base.<br>
      <br>
      "At every tower we measured there was a direct correlation between
      tower door height and the strongest waves.....That the highly
      amplified waves occur in the meditative and electrical anesthesia
      portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is of utmost significance.
      In 1963, G. Walter researched brain EEG waves from 0.5 to 3 Hz
      (Delta region) and found anti-infectious effects."<br>
      <br>
      "It is remarkable how little the main dimensions vary. In the
      great majority of towers the circumference at the base lies
      between 14 meters and 17 meters and the thickness of the wall at
      the lowest point at which it can be measured varies from 0.9
      meters to 1.4 meters. Doorways, windows, storey heights and
      diameters also follow clearly defined patterns, and we may well
      conclude that most of the towers were the work of teams of
      builders who moved from one monastery to another using standard
      designs." Barrow goes on to say that: "Most doorways are raised
      1.5 meters to 4.5 meters above the ground....but it is possible
      that the stability of the tower had as much to do with the door
      heights. The higher you could build before making an opening in
      the wall the stronger the base would be. Very often the towers
      were filled in, even as high as the doorways."<br>
      <br>
      The principles used in construction of the towers is always the
      same: two walls of block and mortar construction are built a few
      feet from one another and the space between is filled in with a
      core of rock rubble. <br>

      Belleek is a small town in County Fermanagh, known for its fine
      porcelain. During the Second World War it was also an ideal
      position for a top secret radio range station. As a 20-year-old
      GI, Phil Callahan was responsible for keeping the radio range
      operational. This station,&nbsp; the first of its kind, enabled
      RAF Coastal Command to maintain 24-hour cover over the Western
      Approaches.<br>

      to any major scientific breakthrough. His contribution to science
      has been massive, yet. as most of his work has been in the less
      than glamorous field of agriculture, it has largely gone unnoticed
      by the general public. Callahan's expertise covers entomology,
      ornithology and VLF/ELF radio waves; he is a leading light in
      non-invasive methods of insect control. It is this broad knowledge
      that allows a cross-fertilisation of ideas to occur, reminiscent
      of the way natural philosophers like Faraday, Newton and Tyndall
      worked.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed much of Callahan's pre-eminent work in the infrared
      spectrum and with paramagnetism is a continuation of the
      discoveries made by the Englishman Michael Faraday and his Irish
      friend John Tyndall.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio waves affect human
        behaviour</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Callahan discovered that radio signals in the far infrared
      spectrum are a crucial element in insect behaviour. He also knew
      that radio signals could affect human behaviour and well-being.<br>
      <br>
      During a particularly severe winter storm in Ireland in 1944 the
      young GI was on night duty alone at the station when both the
      primary and back-up transmitters failed. With ten aircraft out
      over the Atlantic dependent on his signal to get back, it was a
      fraught moment.<br>
      <br>
      'I couldn't make any sense of it. Both machines were working fine,
      but there was no signal transmitting. Callahan shakes his head at
      the memory. 'But then I remembered what an old Arctic radio man
      once told me about how ice-coated insulators could earth the
      signal. So I climbed up the antennae poles and whacked the ice off
      with a broom stick. It did the trick. But by the time I'd finished
      I could hardly stand up; the radio energy had made me drunk."<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As a climber Callahan was familiar with climber's high' -a feeling
      of calmness and peace combined with a high level of mental and
      bodily energy sustainable over long periods of time. He had become
      convinced that the feeling of elation he had when climbing was
      more to do with the power of the rock than anything else. When he
      visited his first round tower at Devenish on Loch Erne he
      experienced a similar feeling to climber's high.<br>
      <br>
      I've always been drawn to mystical places - spots on Earth that
      induce a feeling of awe or wonder, a feeling of oneness, where
      there is no real sense of time. Ireland has many of these places.
      The round tower at Devenish is one.'<br>
      <br>
      It was the feeling from Devenish, along with the incident at the
      radio station, that created the impetus for Callahan's round tower
      research.<br>
      <br>
      The Irish round towers were constructed by monks towards the end
      of the great period of monastic expansion, between the fifth and
      the seventh centuries. When they were built they would have been
      the only stone structures in the monastery. Today 25 or more
      towers stand upright in perfect form, and the remains, or stubs,
      of another 43 dot the countryside.<br>
      <br>
      I remember asking what special power was hidden in these towers;
      and could we ever understand this power?'<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discovering the star map</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Some years before, Callahan had bought Professor Barrow's Irish
      Heritage pamphlet on round towers which included a fine map of the
      still-standing towers.<br>
      <br>
      'I was lying on a couch looking at the map. There was something
      very familiar about it - apart from it being a map of Ireland!
      After about five or ten minutes it suddenly flashed into my mind -
      insight I believe it is called - exactly why the map appeared so
      familiar. The towers formed a star map of the northern night sky.
      I have used that sky map dozens and dozens of times hiking around
      in the deserts of the world. It is gouged like a carved woodblock
      into my brain.'<br>
      <br>
      One of the best preserved monasteries is Clonmacnoise in the
      centre of the great plain of Ireland. It is on the Shannon River
      and is widely assumed to have been the centre for the entire
      monastic movement. Callahan surmised that it was placed to
      represent the north star Polaris. All the other star groups then
      fell into place -Ursa Major, Draco, Cassiopeia, Camelopardalis and
      Lynx, far to the south (Figures 1 &amp; 2).<br>
      <br>
      What Callahan had drawn was an almost perfect sky for the December
      solstice. The imperfections in the round tower star plot lie
      mainly in the fact that the monks had to fix their towers
      according to the lie of the land.<br>
      <br>
      What is astonishing about the round tower star map of Ireland is
      that there were two great ecclesiastical centres during the early
      days of Christianity in Ireland: one at Armagh in the north and
      one at Clonmacnoise in central Ireland. In relation to the round
      tower plot of Draco, Armagh is exactly at the point of the
      ecliptic centre. This demonstrates very clearly that the Celtic
      peoples of Ireland knew not only that the Earth was round, but
      also about precession - the slow wobble of the Earth around a
      theoretical or ecliptic centre of the sky, a circular movement
      which takes 25,800 years to complete.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to speculate that the knowledge of astronomy, and
      especially of precession and the ecliptic centre, was carried to
      Ireland by the .Ancient Egyptians. The Denderah circular zodiac
      (300 BC). for example, proves they too had this knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      'The technocrat, who is high-energy, inorganic-slanted, will of
      course scoff at my star map of round towers and say that the
      correlation is coincidental.' Callahan shrugs. For the
      high-energy' technocrat every phenomenon that does not hit one on
      the head with an inorganic hammer is a coincidence. Coincidence is
      the cop-out word of the century used to put low-energy organic
      researchers in their place.'<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural radio receivers</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Could there have been any other purpose than this star map to the
      construction of round towers? Above all the Celts were a practical
      people, and to undertake this huge effort just to demonstrate an
      esoteric knowledge seems unthinkable.<br>
      <br>
      The tower on Devenish island, similar to many others, is a finely
      jointed structure of sandstone. It is 25 metres high and has a
      base circumference of 15.14 metres. In the fifth (and top) floor
      are four square-headed windows facing east-northeast,
      south-southeast, west-southwest and north-northwest. The lower
      four floors each have either one or two windows facing in various
      directions. The doorway is approximately three metres above the
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      Callahan found that all the round towers were made of paramagnetic
      stone: that is stone that resonates positively in a magnetic
      field. He also noticed that all these towers were to be found in
      diamagnetic areas - areas of much weaker, and opposite, negative,
      susceptibility.<br>
      <br>
      It was Michael Faraday and John Tyndail who discovered these very
      subtle forces of para-magnetism and diamagnetism.<br>
      <br>
      Strangely enough, although physicists have spent years measuring
      these energies, and utilising them to explain theoretical atomic
      forces, nowhere in the scientific literature has anyone - chemist,
      physicist, or biologist - asked what these two opposite forces
      mean to life. Like Mark Twain once said, "everybody talks about
      the weather but nobody does anything about it. "<br>
      <br>
      In 1956 Callahan discovered that moths were not attracted to
      visible light, but rather to the infrared emission from scent
      molecules that became 'peaks' or resonant radiation when they hit
      the moth's vibrating antenna. Moths navigate by molecular radio
      laser or maser technology.<br>
      <br>
      It was the antenna with all its hundreds of strange-shaped spines
      (called sensilla) that was doing the work by feeling the
      radiation. So, for example, the reason why moths spiral rather
      than fly direct into a light source is that different parts of
      their sensilla pick up slightly different wavelengths of the
      emission, depending on how closely they approach the source
      (Figure 3).<br>
      <br>
      Callahan s breakthrough came quite suddenly and totally
      unexpectedly.<br>
      <br>
      'I was just admiring how clever the builders were to make a tower
      that had a very slight taper of three degrees. Then it dawned on
      me how similar these towers looked to certain insect antennae. It
      was a complete revelation.'<br>
      <br>
      Obviously round towers are not conventional antennae. They are in
      fact built of limestone, mica schist or sandstone blocks and are
      therefore closer to silicon semi-conductors than to metallic
      conductors. As the towers have dielectric (insulative) properties,
      the}' act as DC rectifiers and are able to detect and store
      incoming cosmic electromagnetic/magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      (Fig. 4) Two carborundum round towers. The tower on the left is
      modelled after Devenish tower and the one on the right after
      Turlough round tower. Note the very fine field lines of
      concentrated salts around both towers. On the Turlough tower the
      salts concentrated heavily at the levels where floors and windows
      are located.<br>
      <br>
      The physics of dielectric systems is extremely complex. However,
      they can be formed into tubular or rectangular waveguides to
      collect and direct energy in the same manner as a metallic radio
      or TV antenna. The size of antennae determine the length of radio
      waves with which they are able to resonate. Since round towers are
      of the order of metres in length they must be, according to
      Callahan, collectors of cosmic radio waves of a few metres
      magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      Using a scale model of a round tower, made from paramagnetic
      carborundum paper and placed in a high frequency-oscillator called
      a Klystron, Callahan showed that the model actually increased
      (amplified) the radio energy from 6dB to 9dB. In another
      experiment it also detected differences in radiation at night and
      from the sun.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most controversial questions concerning these towers is
      the usual high placement of the doors, with varying amounts of
      infill inside up to door level. Historians who have attempted an
      explanation have cited the need for defense. But round towers are
      indefensible, and not large enough to withstand a protracted
      siege. If the towers are viewed as antennae, then the infill can
      be seen as a way the monks could fine-tune the tower to assure
      sharp resonance.<br>
      <br>
      That the monks could detect this energy seems, from the
      perspective of a high-tech society, incredible. But all they were
      doing was tuning in to nature; using their bodies as antennae,
      feeling the energy. In a further experiment a model of the
      Turlough round tower was soaked in a diamagnetic solution of Epsom
      salts and then allowed to dry naturally. Thin force lines spaced
      evenly at one millimetre appeared up the tower. On the conical
      roof at the top the force line spiralled up to the point. At
      certain heights up the tower the force lines became much thicker
      bands. These correlate precisely with the floor levels in the
      actual tower (Figure 4).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural energy for health and
        soil fertility</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      So where is the energy coming from and how do we utilise it?<br>
      <br>
      Energy has been detected from three sources: the night sky, the
      sun, and lightning.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The night sky</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The towers are aligned with the stars of the night sky at the
      winter solstice and we know that cosmic microwave radiation at
      14.6 metre wavelengths is emitted from that region of the
      universe.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The sun</span><br>
      <br>
      The towers also pick up particles of energy which are separated by
      sun-flare activity into north and south magnetic poles. At this
      temperature magnetic poles are torn apart and then stay apart
      until they become adsorbed (molecules stick to the surface). South
      'monopoles' (S) are adsorbed by paramagnetic stone and soil and
      north monopoles (N) by plants, just like a battery. Oxygen also
      stores south monopoles; it is the most para­magnetic of gases.
      Most organic or diamagnetic substances store north monopoles
      {Figure 5).<br>
      <br>
      Over the aeons the charge trickles out. The south monopoles in the
      soil meet the north monopoles of seeds or roots, and with the
      catalyst of nitrogen and water set growth and photosynthesis on
      their way. It is the fundamental force behind nature.<br>
      <br>
      Round towers, then, act as stone antennae to collect many more
      south magneto-electric monopoles than the surrounding soil. They
      release these mono-poles, so stimulating better growth in crops
      around their base.<br>
      <br>
      A small model round tower placed in the centre of a
      non-paramagnetic plastic flower pot, with seedling radishes
      planted around the base of the tower, will stimulate the seedlings
      to grow many more fine rootlets than a pot with the same soil but
      no central round tower. Already a farmer in the north of England
      is using round tower technology and getting significant increases
      in crop yield.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lightning</span><br>
      <br>
      The third source of energy is from lightning. There are over 4,000
      strikes a minute around the world and these set up a very
      high-frequency standing wave of 60,000 Hertz (cycles/ sec) in the
      atmosphere. Callahan has shown that the towers reduce this
      frequency to various slower frequencies which -we can use. The
      amplification factor or strength of signal is between 150 to 200
      times the energy outside. The lowest he has discovered is around
      8Hz a minute. Recent American medical research has found this
      frequency in human bodies and has termed it the primary
      respiratory function. It is vital to our existence.<br>
      <br>
      There are ELF radio frequencies in the 4-14 Hz range, or
      brain-wave region. During meditation our brains emit waves around
      8Hz/sec, so these towers would enhance the ability of monks to
      meditate. These frequencies also have an anti-infection property.<br>
      <br>
      Frequencies are also found around 2.000Hz - the
      electric-anaesthesia region - and around 250KHz, the region for
      electronic heat induction. In the 19th Century some dentists in
      America were using machines to generate 2,000Hz for dental
      extraction. Research in Poland in 1986 showed that these types of
      radiation enhance the auto­immune system and reduce pain. In other
      words, the towers aid healing, and could have been places where
      -women -would go to reduce their birth pains.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Head of the International Institute for
      Biophysics, Professor Fritz-AlbertPopp, ProfessorCallahan's
      discovery concerning the Irish round towers is one ox the most
      important discoveries of the century. The low-energy implications
      for our health, well-being and nutrition are far reaching.'<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mirrors in the landscape</span><br>
      <br>
      There is more to come. In antenna technology form follows
      function, so different shapes will resonate to different
      frequencies. Obtain an accurate geological survey map of a
      favourite area, and with a hard steel stylus trace and cut the
      contours into a sheet of carborundum paper. Immerse the sheet in a
      saturated solution of Epsom salts for 24 hours. Then allow to dry
      naturally. In a few days an energy map of growing force lines
      appears. The lines of force will concentrate in the most energetic
      spots on the carborundum map. Even more strangely, if the map is
      put aside and observed for six months or a year, the crystals of
      diamagnetic Epsom salts will begin to grow and produce little
      hills and mountains. It is an accurate template of the real
      landscape.<br>
      <br>
      'Since the crystals will reproduce and grow, who is to say that
      the forces of rock and soil are not living!' Callahan gestures to
      the map. The beauty of these experiments is that anyone can show
      how these weak forces can grow and accumulate energy.<br>
      <br>
      'You can even detect differences in behaviour in various
      populations, dependent on the paramagnetic nature of the sub-rock.
      Take Belfast for instance. The sub-rock under that city is basalt,
      which is highly paramagnetic, and the sub-rock under Dublin is
      diamagnetic limestone. We know that Dubliners are more laid-back.
      It's the same difference with the population of North and South
      Vietnam and, say, between New York and Florida.'<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stone circles, steeples, pyramids
        - are they all antennae?</span><br>
      <br>
      Callahan's findings concerning the Irish round towers uncover a
      major reason for the construction of stone circles, church
      steeples, pagodas, chedi, minarets and pyramids. They are all
      antennae - tapping into natural radic energy for healing,
      meditation and so on.<br>
      <br>
      But whatever man has created as an antenna, nature was there first
      (Figures 6 to 11).<br>
      <br>
      The Egyptians had two hieroglyphics for stone - both take the
      exact proportions of the building stones found in the Great
      Pyramid. One Hieroglyph is open like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , the
      other has lines across it like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , in the
      same way as Callahan's model paramagnetic round tower has force
      lines across it. Both symbols represent the same syllable for
      stone, aner. The hieroglyph for prepared stone is aner sept (two
      syllables) and is:<br>
      <br>
      (Fig. 6) Burmese stupas. (inset fig. 7) Many diptera (flies) have
      stupa or pagoda-tapered sensilla on their antennae.<br>
      <br>
      It contains a feather for levitation, waves, a mouth (source of
      diamagnetic breath), a stone (with paramagnetic force lines) and
      finally a pyramid (Septih, the Dog Star). The little circle is the
      sign for sand from which the rocks are made, the bar the sign for
      symmetry, and the three lines ||| for plural (many building
      stones).<br>
      <br>
      The hieroglyph for black granite is:<br>
      <br>
      Below: (fig. 12) An Egyptian priestess raising her hands above the
      outstretched body of a pharaoh. Opposite: (fig. 13) Another panel
      showing a pharaoh levitating off the couch. Similar to the panels
      referred to in the text.<br>
      <br>
      This word is similar to prepared granite except that the pyramid
      sign (Septih), forthe Dog Star, is replaced by the symbol for a
      wing (many feathers), a much stronger levitation force than one
      feather . In other words black granite is a paramagnetic battery
      for the force. Every Egyptian word for different types of
      para-magnetic stone, eg. aner-en-rut (sandstone),<br>
      <br>
      (Fig. 11) The antenna sensilla of a wasp showing pyramidal
      sensilia and corrugated sensilla - two of the best configurations
      for focusing and concentrating the paramagnetic force. The
      species, Polistes metricus, is a vespid wasp. Although seldom
      mentioned in the popular literature, the vespid hieroglyph is even
      more common in Egyptian lore than the sacred scarab beetle.<br>
      <br>
      aner-en-hatch&nbsp; (white limestone), aner-en-bekbenu (porphyry),
      aner-en-moat (stone of truth) etc., has the
      symbol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with force field lines in it.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible that the knowledge and engineering skills were
      passed down to the Celts from the Ancient Egptians. It was in
      Egypt, perhaps, that man reached a pinnacle of subtle-energy
      manipulation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scientific proof for levitation?</span><br>
      <br>
      Callahan suggests that the outer limestone portion of the Great
      Pyramid at Giza serves as a giant condenser lens - as in a
      photographic enlarger - to diffuse and concentrate paramagnetic
      waves. The full pagoda construction of the King's Chamber is made
      from the most highly paramagnetic of all stone, pink granite. Its
      succession of stone floors or lenses serves to concentrate the
      cosmic para-magnetism (like light waves; down into the actual
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Suspended model round towers are very sensitive energy detectors,
      responding to the paramagnetic-infrared aura of the human body. To
      prove his theory Callahan took one into the King's Chamber.<br>
      <br>
      'Usually the model would swing through about 60 or 70 degrees to
      point to an approaching human. I found that in the King's Chamber
      the same model would move 200-300 degrees in a steady sweep to the
      human aura. That's telekinesis. The sensor was five to ten times
      as sensitive inside the Pyramid. The model also rocked violently
      up and down every time a human body approached it; this is, in
      effect. levitation.'<br>
      <br>
      Callahan says that since the outer smooth tura limestone casing of
      the Great Pyramid has been destroyed it will never again stimulate
      total levitation of a heavy body. Certainly, in my opinion, one of
      the reasons for its construction was to induce levitation.' He
      refers to a beautiful series of ancient stone-wall reliefs which
      show an Egyptian priestess raising her hands above the
      outstretched body of a pharaoh. In the next panel the pharaoh is
      six inches off the couch (see figures 12 &amp; 73).<br>
      <br>
      'Deep in the Great Pyramid the priests breathed out that mixture
      we call breath - but which the Orientals call the spirit of life,'
      Callahan explains. 'They chanted to modulate the potent vapour
      which was then energy magnified by the great stone paramagnetic
      pyramid. Ever so gently they rose in the air. Their very own wall
      pictographs tell us that this is so.' <br>
