      <p>The idea of the channelwing pre-dates most of those who are
        reading this site. It all began in the 1920s, when Willard
        Custer took shelter in a barn during a near hurricane velocity
        storm. Much to his surprise and fascination, the roof of the
        barn suddenly lifted off, and soared through the air. He
        wondered why an airplane had to gather speed on a runway, while
        a barn roof, a poor airfoil by any reckoning, could fly from a
        standing start. He soon came to the realization that it was the
        speed of the air over the surface, not the speed of the surface
        through the air, that created lift. Bernoulli principle in both
        cases, but an application that had eluded aviation up to that
        time. He settled on the idea of<b> pulling the air through
          channels that were, in fact, the lower half of a venturi</b>.
        He was reversing the normal method of powered flight.<b> Instead
          of using the engines to move the airfoil through the air, he
          used the engine to move the air through the airfoil. His
          channel had the effect of going several hundred miles per
          hour, due to the induced air flow,while standing still.</b>
        The airflow over the surface of the channel created conventional
        lift, and a lot of it. It was at this point that Custer settled
        on<b>," It's the speed of the air, not the airspeed"</b>, which
        became his mantra of, <b>"aerophysics"</b>. </p>

      <p>Many experiments followed with all nature of devices. The first
        real aircraft to which he applied his princi;ple, was the CCW-1,
        or Custer Channelwing number one, which now hangs at the Garber
        facility of the Smithsonian. It is still strangely modern, even
        after all these years, with a smoothly rounded fuselage, and a
        wrap around plexiglass canopy. But, close inspection reveals the
        channels appended with two by four struts. Two 75 HP engines
        were fitted into the two six foot diameter half-barrel like
        channels, and the tests were started. First flight was November
        12, 1942. The CCW-1 was used for test purposes only, to prove
        the concept. More than 300 hours of flight tests did prove that
        the Custer not only flew, but was capable of flight without
        wings.<b> After the first flights proved stability, the wings
          were progressively cut off or had spoilers attached to the
          point of having no lift from the wings at all. The test pilot
          noticed no difference because the channels furnished all the
          lift needed</b>! Most of these tests were low, straight ahead
        hops. A demonstration took place in Beltsville Maryland for
        Brigadier General W. E. Gilmore. Gilmore was noted for his gruff
        temperament, but after seeing the demonstration, was excited
        enough to place a call to Orville Wright, asking that he come
        out to witness the Custer phenomenon. Orville didn't make it,
        but the plane was placed in a military test program. The results
        of these tests proved to be typical of the many government tests
        the Channel wing received over the years. The Army Air Force
        technical report concluded that the lift generated by the
        channels was similar to normal induced lift created by other
        wing /propeller arrangements. Although this was a complete
        falsification, the damage was done, and Custer was on the
        defensive. What they forgot to mention, was that the <b>channelwing








          created more static lift than the weight of the test vehicle,
          and was, in fact, capable of vertical takeoff</b>! The report
        stated that the channelwing was inferior to the helicopter in
        creating static lift and did not show sufficient promise of
        military value to warrant further testing. This was at a time
        when every conceivable concept from flying wings to rocket ships
        was being tried. The conclusion, both then and now, seems
        incomprehensible to say the least. To Custer, it was obvious
        that the tests had been too good, and consequently helicopter
        interests were pushing him out of the picture. That seems to be
        the most likely scenario, as later<b> tests proved the
          channelwing to outlift helicopters of the day, with 13.8
          pounds of lift per horsepower recorded.</b> Custer was a good
        inventor, but a little naive about politics and government
        contracts. He also felt that the engineering staff and theorists
        just didn't understand the Custer phenomenon, as they didn't
        understand "aerophysics". But, if faith in the government was
        dimmed, faith in himself wasn't. Over the next forty years, he
        obtained financial backing for a series of aircraft from CCW-2
        to CCW-5. He had enough data and tests to convince enough
        investors to bring him near full production on at least two
        occasions. </p>
      <p>In 1951, he co-operated with the Baumann Aircraft Company, and
        modified one of their twin pusher aircraft to a Custer
        configuration. This was the CCW-5, and had two 225 HP engines,
        and weighed en excess of 4300 pounds. Walker Davidson made the
        first flight of the CCW-5 in July of 1953. As usual, the
        aircraft was highly successful. Demonstrations repeatedly showed
        hair raising<b> maximum performance takeoffs, nose high climbs
          at speeds so low it seemed obvious that the Custer would fall
          out of the sky. Three second takeoffs, with nose high steep
          turns of 45 to 60 degrees bank, at speeds below 30MPH</b> gave
        the CCW-5 the ability to take off and do a 180 before most
        planes could lift off. Video of these flights still confound
        experienced pilots. Although I have personally logged 20,000+
        hours, in all nature of aircraft, I was absolutely stunned the
        first time I saw the videos of the Custer doing a<b> 150 foot
          takeoff,</b> roll into a steep bank at speeds that would have
        insured a stall - spin - crash,in any other plane, and leave
        town going the other way, while staying within what appeared to
        be about a 250' square area. Slow flight was a specialty, and
        the CCW-5 <b>flew at a measured 22 MPH</b> and on August 27,
        1954<b> hovered against an 11 MPH wind</b>, although it was not
        modified to use maximum lift potential. <b>Cruise speed
          remained a normal 170 mph.</b> </p>
      <p>These tests attracted more investors, and it seemed that Custer
        and Noordyun Aircraft Ltd. of Canada were going to do a
        production run of at least 100 aircraft. On the strength of this
        proposal, a production version of the CCW-5 was built and rolled
        out on July 4 of 1964. Although it looked like the original
        Baumann conversion, the second model was built from scratch,
        rather than modified from an existing aircraft. Now came the
        securities and exchange commission who claimed the stock was not
        issued correctly, and the deal fell through, in a manner
        reminiscent of the Tucker car. </p>
      <p>Since then, the Custer channelwing has virtually disappeared,
        and few have even heard of the aircraft, let alone its'
        capabilities. It has taken me 15 years to amass all the
        information on the Custer. I now have in my possession reports
        from Langley, Wright Patterson, several universities, several
        independent engineering consultants, flight videos, use of the
        CCW-5, reports from test pilots, and contact with Harold
        "Curley" Custer. Curley is the son of Willard Custer, and has
        more time in channelwings than any other man on earth. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">&nbsp;Custer Channelwing: The Facts</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Too Good to be True ???</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In this section, I will show you the facts, as I have found
        them. I know that I was a bit more than skeptical as I
        researched the channewing. To me, it was obviously, "too good to
        be true". As I uncovered more and more information, one thing
        was constant - everyone who has firsthand knowledge of the
        channelwing says, "yes, it works just as advertised". So that
        you might join the ranks of, "true believers", this section will
        contain only research data or pure verifiable facts, with the
        documentation to prove it. Obviously there is too much data on
        the channelwing to reproduce completely, but I hope to whet your
        appetite with the following figures and data. But, before you
        read this section, I will ask you to think of this exercise.
        Design a simple (not even flaps) five passenger plane with<b>
          450 HP, capable of slow flying at 20 mph, 160mph cruise, 200''
          takeoff and landing, with extreme load carrying ability</b>.
        If you can do it, you know more than any aeronautical
        department, or aircraft manufacturer, and I'd like to see the
        plans. On the other hand, the Custer CCW-5 did exceed all those
        parameters, and did it many years ago. Take a look! </p>
      <p><b>1.&nbsp; The custer channelwing is capable of vertical
          flight.</b> </p>
      <p>CCW-2 tied to a windsock standard and levitating! As shown, it
        is approximately <b>1000 pounds and powered by two 90 HP
          engines. The aircraft would levitate at 2400 rpm. </b></p>
      <p>Because Custer had extreme difficulty in convincing aviation
        academics and manufacturers that the channelwing created a great
        deal of static lift, he concocted this demonstration. The CCW-2
        was tied to a windsock standard on a calm day, and run up. As
        you can see, the aircraft levitated with the tie down rope
        parallel to the ground. It was lifted on the channel power
        alone. Even this did not convince the many skeptics. It was
        thought to be swinging on a pendulum, or some kind of trick. It
        was a classic case of NIH. (not invented here). They saw what
        they believed, not believed what they saw. This would help
        explain why Willard Custer had a tendency to lose his patience.
      </p>
      <p><b>2.&nbsp; The channelwing is capable of hauling very heavy
          loads.</b> </p>
      <p>The following NACA report shows the ability of a Custer channel
        to liftloads: </p>
      <p>Angle of Attack&nbsp; 0°&nbsp; 20°&nbsp; 46° <br>
        Velocity&nbsp;&nbsp; lift (lb)&nbsp;&nbsp; thrust

        11.5 mph&nbsp;&nbsp; 385&nbsp;&nbsp; 745&nbsp;&nbsp;
        735&nbsp;&nbsp; 540&nbsp;&nbsp; 980&nbsp;&nbsp; 190 </p>
      <p>26 mph <br>
        &nbsp; 470&nbsp;&nbsp; 590&nbsp;&nbsp; 940&nbsp;&nbsp;
        395&nbsp;&nbsp; 1375&nbsp;&nbsp; -210 </p>
      <p>Data recorded at Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley field
        VA. and published in a 1953 NACA Research Memorandum RM L53A09.
      </p>
      <p>These tests were conducted at less than full power (2450 rpm)
        for reasons unknown, so they do not show full capability of the
        CCW-2 lift capability. Because the CCW-2 was a "tail dragger",<b>
          the angle of attack while sitting on the ground was 20°. This
          gives 580 pounds lift and 635 pounds thrust on the channel</b>.
        No channelwing ever built was configured for vertical flight,
        and consequently, on the CCW-2 the pilot had to hold back on the
        power until enough speed was gained to make the controls
        effective. Because of this, the CCW-2 required a<b> ground run
          of 60 feet</b>. Curly Custer did say that he flew the -2
        without any form of aileron, and rolled with differential
        throttle. He also has pictures to back up this claim. </p>
      <p>I have heard that a modern flap system with leading edge flaps
        and slats coupled with trailing edge slotted flaps can generate
        a coefficient of lift of 5.5. But, I have never heard or even
        imagined a <b>co-efficient of lift of 23</b>! </p>
      <p><b>3.&nbsp; The unaided Custer channel is capable of generating
          8.4 pounds static lift per horsepower.</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;In 1944, the USAAF issued a technical report on the
        channelwing. The data was compiled in the 5 foot wind tunnel at
        Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. The tests were on the CCW-1 and
        scale model channels driven by electric motors. remembering that
        the CCW-1 was the first real attempt at flying the channels and
        was in a rather embrionic state of development. It weighed 1375
        pounds and was powered by two 75 HP engines. Even so, it was
        reported the channels lowered the takeoff speed to 36 mph from
        51 mph if the the channels were replaced by normal wing
        sections. The experimental channel models, which were much
        better finished, showed 8.4 pounds lift per horsepower. For some
        reason, this was compared to a helicopter rather than other
        fixed wing aircraft. Helicopters of the time could generate 15.2
        pounds of static lift per horsepower, so the conclusion was that
        the Custer channelwing was, "markedly inferior to the
        helicopter, but <b>superior to other wing-propeller
          arrangements in producing both static lift and lift when
          forward velocity exists</b>". Consequently, the final
        conclusion was, "The present device does not show sufficient
        promise of military value to justify further development by the
        Army Air Forces". An astounding conclusion! For instance, a
        channelwing fighter with the 1500 HP P-51 engine could develop
        1500 X 8.4 = 12,600 pounds static vertical lift. The max TOGW
        for the Mustang was only 11,600 pounds. A bomber with four 1200
        HP B-17 engines would have had 1200 X 4 X 8.4 = 40,320 pounds
        static vertical lift. Max TOGW for the B-17 was 65,500 pounds. A
        channelwing cargo plane with two 1200 HP C-47 engines would have
        developed 20,160 pounds static lift. The max. TOGW for the C-47
        was 28,000 pounds. Admittedly, there are complications with
        using the Custer channel, but to say there would be no use to
        the military is beyond reason! At about this point, it is easy
        to sense the frustrations Mr. Custer must have felt. </p>
      <p>USAAF test stand at Wright Field 1947. (USAAF technical Report
        5568) This configuration demonstrated 13.8 lbs/HP static lift
        with Custer channel. Note flaps used to further deflect channel
        airflow. </p>
      <p><b>4.&nbsp; The augmented channel with deflector vanes
          generated 13.8 pounds lift per horsepower.</b> </p>
      <p>The Custer channel with deflection vanes mounted behind the
        prop was measured to have a vertical lift capability of 13.8
        pounds per horsepower. This was recorded in 1945 at Wright
        Patterson, and is documented in an AAF memorandum. It was noted
        that the channel and deflectors gave a considerable nose down
        pitching moment. This might change the design, but the extra
        lift would seem well worth the effort. </p>
      <p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruise speeds are largely unaffected by the
          channels</b> </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;The Custer channel is a wing when unpowered, and
          generates approximately 10% greater lift than a straight wing
          the diameter of the channel.</b> This was verified by the L.
        H. Crook Laboratories report 557, in 1943. As speed increases,
        the coefficient of lift increases dramatically, as shown in the
        NACA report referenced in section 2 above. This allows less
        straight wing, hence less drag. This area has not been
        researched to a final conclusion, but it would seem logical that
        an aircraft with less wetted area would have equal or less drag.
        Harold Custer stated tha<b>t at high speeds, the extreme
          downwash behind the channels did tend to push the nose down</b><b>.
          To obtain high speeds without having to create negative lift
          on the elevator, it would appear that the prop / channel
          clearance would have to be changed in flight. Several fixes in
          this area have already been shown effective. </b></p>
      <p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; The channelwing is cheaper to build and
          maintain than normal STOL.</b> </p>
      <p>With modern methods and composites, the Custer channel is much
        easier to build than the normal STOL.This is because the Custer
        has no trailing or leading edge flaps and associated control
        systems. The CCW-5 and other plans from that era show the
        channel in the wing. This would be difficult and expensive.
        However, if the channel is placed in front of the wing, it is
        both simple and cheap. Notice the design for the P-20 Raider or
        the P-50 Devastator in the Dreams and Schemes section for an
        explanation. </p>
      <p><b>7.&nbsp; The Custer is far cheaper to build and maintain
          than a helicopter.</b> </p>
      <p>While a Custer has never been designed to hover, it would not
        be as difficult a task as it was to hover a helicopter. (my hat
        is off to mr. Sikorsky) If we were to build such a machine, it
        would have no moving parts, other than the prop, and flight
        controls. In effect, it would be a,"solid state", helicopter.
        Because of the simplicity, operating costs would be far lower,
        and utilization would be far higher. Added to this, would be
        speeds as much as double the speed of a helicopter. An example
        would be to replace the V-22 Osprey tilt rotors with Custer
        channels. Maximum takeoff gross weight for the Osprey is 47,500
        pounds with two 6150 HP turbine engines. If we theorize we could
        match the 1944 tests, at 8.4 pounds static lift per horsepower,
        or the 1945 Wright Patterson tests that show 13.8 pounds static
        lift per horsepower, with augmented channels, the comparison
        would be: </p>
      <p>V-22 Osprey as built&nbsp; // V-22 with Custer channels 8.4
        #/hp lift (1)&nbsp; // V-22 augmented CusterChannels 13.8lbs/hp

        * Vertical lift allowing for one engine out on takeoff </p>
      <p>Because of the higher cruise speed with the same engine, range
        would be increased 25% over the Osprey. In reality, because the
        Custer version would have far more lift from the wing, range
        would be even greater. Ferry range would be vastly improved, due
        to the ability of the Custer version to lift more fuel on
        takeoff. Notice the Custer version could lift an additional
        22,656 pounds (1) or 55,866 pounds (2) of fuel or cargo.And
        remember, this is done without tilt engines, folding props, and
        the associated cost and maintenance. </p>

      <p>Over the years,a number of attempts have been made to revive
        the Custer. They are shown in this section to demonstrate newer
        ideas, and improvements in Channelwing theory. Only ideas that
        have been researched and designed by aerodynamic professionals
        are included. These aircraft are capable of being built and
        flown to design specifications, according to research data
        mentioned earlier, and competent research conducted since. </p>
      <p><b>Designs by Product Development Group</b> <br>
        <b>The P-20 Raider and the P-50 Devastator</b> </p>
      <p>Sometime in the late 1980s, an international consortium called
        the Product Developement Group was formed to design and build
        aircraft for the U.S. military. These designs incorperated up to
        date technology and new innovation for the channelwing. After a
        great deal of searching, I have found the full production
        drawings for the two aircraft. It would appear that they were to
        compete with the V-22 "Osprey", but the project fell through
        with the death of the major backer. I have many pages of "demo"
        drawings such as these, along with performance data, tooling
        requirements, etc. These are truly impressive aircraft by any
        standards. This performance coupled with the reliability would
        seem to place them far ahead of the V-22 Osprey. Although they
        could be designed for vertical takeoff, it would seem of little
        use considering the slow approach and takeoff speeds. You will
        note the channel is placed in front of the wing, with a stub
        wing behind it. This gives a very strong structure ( +8, -4 G)
        that would make the P-50 a real contender for close support or
        high speed attack roles. Judge for yourself, keeping in mind
        that these designs were the product of University studies,
        competent engineering, and hundreds of hours of flight testing,
        rather than the wishful dreams of a novice. </p>
      <p><b>The Rhein Flugseubau Company RFV-1</b> </p>
      <p>In the 1960's, The channelwing was studied by Rhein Flugseubau
        Company of Monchengladbach, West Germany, for the German
        government. Their chief engineer, Hanno Fisher, was recognized
        as one of the finest engineers in germany. He added several new
        concepts to the Custer. On the RFV-1 he placed<b> a single
          channel on top of the aircraft, on centerline. This removed
          the need to cross shaft the two engines, which drove a single
          prop behind the channel, and erased any roll problem
          experienced in case of an engine out on takeoff, or during low
          speed operation</b>. This was seen as a plus, even though<b> a
          single channel creates less static vertical lift</b>. Fisher
        also added<b> an annular duct around the prop, which
          transitioned into the Custer channel. This added low speed
          thrust and channel lift, while helping solve the critical,
          prop tip / channel clearance, at various power settings.</b>
        He also added an <b>"oberflügel" in front of the duct, and in
          the channel, which added extra static lift</b>. Considerable
        research was done at the University of Aachon, 20 miles from
        their production facility along with 100 actual flight tests.
        work on the RFV-1 progressed through these flight tests, but
        apparently didn't survive fine tuning. According to one
        knowledgeable source, Rhein Flugseubau decided to add<b> extra
          width to the fuselage, to gain passenger space. The added
          structure interfered with the airflow into the channel,
          reducing the efficiency</b>, and eventually dooming the German
        project, due to an austerity program by the government in the
        60's. This caused a lack of funds to re-work the passenger area
        and the project was dropped sometime in the late 60's, in order
        to work on more profitable projects, and the aircraft was
        parked. I have no knowledge of the disposition of the aircraft
        at this time. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Willard Custer Ideas, Ready for the
              Aviation World?</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;Engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology Research
        Institute in Atlanta, U.S.; are quietly researching the
        possibility of applying a Channel Wing Configuration technology
        to the designs of future aircrafts platforms. The Channel Wing
        Configuration, when implemented on the wing design, would give
        the aircraft the ability to generate a high volume of lift,
        which could open the path to many design possibilities. The idea
        of configurating the wing design to be able to generate more
        lift has been around since the birth of aviation early in the
        1900s. Preliminary studies by aviation engineers on the subject
        in the mid-to-late 1910s resulted in experimentation with
        various form of wing configurations and settings. Eventually,
        advances on airframe deign and a premium on engine performance
        took center stage, thus neglecting the concept of wing
        modification to achieve greater lift. For years, research into a
        greater lift-generating wing design was shaped by traditionalist
        aviation engineers and designers. Thus, radical new ideas were
        never fully pursued, that was until a brilliant Maryland
        inventor came forward with a new concept in 1935. </p>
      <p>Willard Custer was one of the first true champions of the lift
        principal called aero physics. He stated that the amount of lift
        generated by any aircraft is determined by the speed on which
        the air flows over the wing, not solely on the speed of the wing
        moving thru the air as articulated by many. If a wing
        configuration were to be designed with deep channels, dropping
        like a couple of "smiles" under the propellers; then the
        aircraft would generate more lift with it than a conventional
        wing configuration. For Custer, the idea was simple enough. An
        aircraft can generate lift with zero forward speed utilizing the
        engines to provide the necessary airflow to sustain the plane in
        the air, thus achieving an impressive amount of Short Take-Off
        and Landing (STOL) capability. Additionally, with the channel
        wing shape, the engine thrust is propelled downward, providing
        the aircraft with the ability to perform short take-offs, and,
        as an added bonus; maintaining air control at relative slow
        speeds. The idea that an aircraft can achieve virtually vertical
        take-off and landing capabilities by re-designing its wing
        configuration a was radical concept in the late 1930s. </p>

        <p><img src="7-Custer%20CCW-1.jpg" height="181" width="300"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The aviation community did not think much of Cluster's Channel
        Wing Concept. That's the risk someone takes when propelling
        radical new ideas. Nevertheless, Custer marched on. In the
        summer of 1943, his first aircraft design with channel wings was
        demonstrated to the United States Army Air Forces in Maryland.
        Immediately, the CCW-1, as the plane was designated, was a media
        darling. Stories of this strange-looking aircraft, nearly
        hovering over the ground, fascinated many in the country.
        Unfortunately, the US Army was not one of them. They branded the
        CCW-1 impractical because of the extreme nose-up attitude
        requirement for landing. There were also issues about the
        survival of the CCW-1 in combat. Test flights showed that if one
        of the engines were to be lost, the pilot could not maintain
        effective control over the aircraft. </p>
      <p>Despite the setback, Custer persevered, and in the fall of
        1959; he presented his new aircraft, the CCW-5 to the Marine
        Corps. Again he was turned down. Mainly, for the reasons stated
        in 1943; the concept seemed to hit the wall. No major research
        was invested on the channel wing concept until 1995, when the
        idea was resurrected by Dennis Bushnell, Chief Researcher at
        NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. For years Bushnell
        mulled over how to fit an aircraft in tight locations off the
        ground. He researched the accepted principals of direct thrust
        and rotary wings, but they were not able to produce the desired
        results, as recent experimentation had shown. But Bushnell had
        an ace. For years he had known and studied the work of Custer on
        the Channel Wing; and he wondered if a combination of control
        circulation, a method from which lift is generated utilizing jet
        of air to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing,
        and the channel wing, could be the answer. Either of these
        systems, by themselves, could not provide the aircraft with the
        necessary characteristic he desired, but combining the two was
        seen by Bushnell as the way forward. </p>

      <p>A new research program commenced in 1999 and lasted until 2004.
        The research focused on the Coanda Effect, named after its
        founder; Romania researcher Henri Coanda, who in August 1910
        discovered that hot gases exiting a jet followed the contour of
        the plates installed to deflect it. Circulation Control follows
        a different path. Simply put it, circulation control works when
        compressed air is directed over a curve or leading edge to
        generate greater lift capacity. Researches believed that
        circulation control, could in the future rend obsolete moving
        surfaces on aircrafts. The next step in the developmental
        process for Circulation Control is the replacement of mechanical
        lift augmenters with air hoses to make the aircrafts lighter,
        quieter and maintenance friendly. For all of this to take
        effect, surface system needed to be introduced, and here is
        where the Channel Wing Concept comes into play. </p>
      <p>Current computing systems used to measure fluid dynamics of
        aircrafts' surfaces had established the feasibility that a
        Channel Wing configuration with enhance Circulation Control,
        could produce a serviceable and stable super-STOL platform. Wind
        tunnel testing and computer animations had confirmed the Channel
        Wing design payoffs in ways that Custer could not have done in
        his time. Custer clearly understood the airflow needed to
        generate lift could come from two different sources: the engine
        or the airframe forward motion. What he lacked was an
        understanding of what happened to the air stream once it hit the
        channel. The end result is turbulence. This is why both the
        CCW-1 and 5 failed to achieve major air-control properties. At
        low speeds, the flow of air is detached form the traveled
        surface; leading to the aircraft to lose differential pressure
        that is the cause of lift. At Custer's time, there was no method
        accurate enough to calculate when this effect comes to play or
        how to design an aircraft that used this effect in its
        advantage. The solution: Circulation Control. One of the most
        challenging arenas for the CCWs models were the high angle of
        attack that the aircraft needed to be flown, a dangerous
        proposition because the pilot will temporarily loss the ability
        to see over the plane's nose. Another problem was the lost of an
        engine. If the aircraft were to loss the use of one of its
        engines, the aircraft will be subject to high stall degrees and
        rolls, without the necessary energy to compensate for them.
        Circulation Control can solve this problem. </p>
      <p>At present, Bushnell and his team had been pressing for
        sometime to design and aircraft that incorporates both concepts,
        but like Custer before, without much success. Skeptics' rapidity
        pointed out that all the research data done during the past five
        decades had failed to produce a serviceable aircraft design,
        thus leading them to the conclusion that the concepts are
        incompatibles. The Channel Wing concept may need to wait until
        advances in technology can undisputable show that an airworthy
        aircraft can be achieve; but the Circulation Control concept is
        already been use by various countries in the design on unmanned
        air vehicles. Even a naval application was found for the
        concept. Submarines could use jets instead of conventional dive
        planes and rudders to change aspect ratios. </p>
      <p>Custer's idea was years ahead of his time, and seems today,
        that is still ahead of us. Further research and data collection
        maybe needed, but with the current military situation, a premium
        is been place on the ability of aircraft to perform short
        take-off and landing s procedures, its only a matter of time
        before the next great engineering breakthrough comes along and
        Custer's idea will probably be at the center of it. </p>

        <p><b>THEORY OF CHANNEL WING AIRCRAFT:</b> <br>
          <b>SPEED OF AIR</b> </p>
        <p><b>By</b> </p>
        <p><b>Willard R. Custer</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Most headlines about aviation have been concerned with new
        speed and altitude records. Today’s airplane, already faster
        than yesterday’s, will fly still swifter tomorrow. Forgotten is
        the fact that it is much more difficult to make planes fly
        slower than it is to make them go faster. For example: Take a
        medium-size stone in your hand, and throw it with all your might
        up through the air for perhaps a hundred and fifty feet. As long
        as the speed lasts it stays in the air; however, when the speed
        is lost it falls quickly. Now take the same stone and try to
        throw it the same distance in slow motion. </p>
      <p>It is tougher to keep a heavy plane in the air in slow motion
        also, yet retain its high-speed qualities. It requires a new
        concept in wing design, making it an aircraft. This new design,
        the CUSTER CHANNEL WING, is a versatile airfoil, and utilizes
        the forces of “Aerophysics,” atmospheric pressure, gyroscopical
        action, impact pressure, thrust, etc., to sustain flight at low
        speeds, yet retains the very desirable features of low drag and
        boundary layer control for high speeds. </p>
      <p>The airplane industry has been handcuffed to the word
        “airspeed” since the beginning of flight because airspeed was a
        requirement before lift could be thought of. Perhaps the term
        “Lift” needs a new cant for the directional “lifting force”
        induced aerophysically when dynamic airflows are passed through
        a channel wing. Accordingly, the induced pressure differential
        can be manipulated by angle of attack of the wing and deflection
        of Thrust velocities to provide a varying angle directionally
        for the resultant force. </p>
      <p><b>Airspeed vs. Speed of Air</b> </p>
      <p>To clarify, let us compare the principles of aerodynamic flight
        with what I shall call aerophysics “flight”: Airspeed versus
        speed of air. The importance of understanding velocity relations
        and the directional forces and reactive forces associated with
        aerodynamic flight cannot be overstressed. A better than average
        knowledge is necessary before one can delve into the basis of
        aerophysics “flight” which, in some cases, requires complete
        rejection of aerodynamic results to obtain full conception. </p>
      <p>Essentially, aerodynamic lift occurs due to differential
        velocities of air above and below a wing. Direct Thrust forces
        are used to propel the airplane only, and it is a secondary
        effect of the resulting motion that provides any air movement
        whatsoever to the air envelope. The only motion imparted to the
        air surrounding a lifting airfoil is a disturbance resulting
        from friction as the wing separates the air mass while being
        “pushed” through it. The shape of the parting surfaces induces a
        differential air velocity of low magnitude no matter what the
        relative velocity of the moving airfoil. The salient belief that
        the air is in motion, and with a high velocity, is the greatest
        misconception of the aircraft industry. </p>
      <p>It is necessary to understand that the air is static, and that
        the airfoil alone moves, before the connotation of aerophysics
        “lifting force” can be perceived and evaluated. For this reason,
        applications of aerophysics “flight” have remained long in
        infancy, and improvements in aerodynamic flight have been
        contingent on power plant development. </p>
      <p>Basically, for air to move there must be changes in pressure;
        therefore, if air moves, there IS a change in pressure. The
        higher the velocity of air in motion, the greater the pressure
        differential becomes normal to a surface of a structure which
        has this surface—only—exposed to the airflow. In correct
        application of a channel wing the dynamic impact pressure of
        high-velocity airflow is applied normal to the inside periphery
        of the channel. (No “airfoil section” is needed.) At zero
        forward velocity of the aircraft (relative to the stationary air
        envelope or the ground) the resultant impact pressure
        differential across the channel is greatest because of spread in
        relative velocities (mass air in motion within the channel
        relative to still air outside of the channel). This force—a
        force that is not truly aerodynamic lift—is a collapsing force
        on the channel and is counteracted by structural design and
        strength to transmit the pressure as a directional force. </p>
      <p>(Additional controls provide deflection of this force away from
        the mean normal. When deflected as a “lifting force” the
        differential pressures provide an “impossible” Lift when viewed
        in an aerodynamic concept. For correct appreciation this force
        must be viewed in the light of a hydraulic force upon a sealed,
        evacuated half-cylinder submerged in a dense liquid.)… </p>
      <p><b>The “Lifting Force”</b> </p>
      <p>In front of the propeller the available “Lifting force” is
        determined by the mean airflow velocity (relative to the inner
        surface). A correctly designed propeller provides high-velocity
        air through a channel and a denser than normal air mass with
        propulsive efficiency behind. However, some Thrust force will
        always be exerted normal to the propeller disk. This is a
        secondary effect of the power applied to “lift” rather than
        “push” the aircraft, and it provides a satisfactory method for
        directional control in the longitudinal plane by forming a
        resultant force with a “Lifting force”. </p>
      <p>The resultant of the “Lifting force” and the residual Thrust is
        always of greater magnitude than the basic Thrust force of the
        propeller when out of the channel. At low aircraft velocities
        (relative to the ground or the air envelope) the resultant is in
        excess of 45 degrees. Thus a “hovering” condition can be reached
        when the resultant force equals the weight, the power applied
        being proportionate to the rate of Thrust dissipation. In this
        condition, with other forces remaining constant, rearward flight
        results whether from an increase of power or an increase in
        angle of attack. </p>
      <p>As the angle of attack decreases the resultant force vectors
        toward Thrust augmentation and the supporting forces require
        redistribution to remain aloft. This can be accomplished by the
        addition of power with a Thrust dissipation or, more simply with
        existing developments, the establishing of aerodynamic Lift on a
        supplementing wing or a channel wing with an airfoil section.
        With the channel wing the “Lifting force” of the velocity
        differentials across the channel approach “unity” as aerodynamic
        flight is approached… </p>
      <p>The aerodynamic Lift coefficient of a channel wing is always
        positive with some negative angle of attack. This means that …
        there is a negative pressure at the advancing edge which tends
        to nullify the normal compression of air at this point. Thus a
        velocity increase is permitted for a power application that is
        not normal in aerodynamic flight… Terminal velocity is not a
        function of “sonic compressibility” due to this laminar air
        being displaced during a velocity relationship above “unity”
        across the channel. Acceleration, however, will vary according
        to the rate of improvement in propulsive efficiency—once again
        contingent on propeller design. </p>
      <p>It is comprehensible that only a small percentage of the power
        used in aerodynamic flight is converted into the work of
        “Lifting”. The greatest percentage of power is used to overcome
        the “drag” caused by the airplane velocity. On account of its
        “push” application power must be increased on an exponential
        curve of the “cube” to provide aerodynamic flight of doubled
        velocities. The power requirements curve, which does not follow
        the aerodynamic “cube” scale (in the channel wing), is also
        flattened toward a straight-line increase because of the unique
        Lift coefficient of the wing. The “overpower” requirement at the
        compressibility area is thus also avoided, or rather obviated,
        for velocity calculation in design in the Channel Wing… </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>Summarizing, although both applications are affected by the
        same basic laws, aerodynamic and aerophysics principles follow
        different paths to attainment of “flight” results that are
        dissimilar: </p>
      <p>In aerodynamic flight, power is applied exponentially to
        produce singular velocity relationship of the airfoil to the
        stationary air. Any deflection from the plane of optimum flight
        reduces the supporting forces. High velocity is restricted by
        air compressibility, low velocity is hampered by the
        relationships required to obtain Lift and “Hovering” requires a
        Thrust force of greater magnitude than the weight. Best “flight”
        results are obtained by power plants providing maximum mass
        acceleration of a Thrust force with low propulsive efficiency in
        conditions of greatest fuel consumption (high energy less
        applications). </p>
      <p>In aerophysics, Channel Wing omni-directional “flight”
        velocities are of fourth-dimensional relationship; associated
        with aircraft attitude, Thrust dissipation, and amount of energy
        invoked. Power is applied to “induce” the major supporting force
        and to provide deflective forces which augment either the
        supporting force or the propulsive force; thus increased power
        requirements approach the straight-line curve. Low relative
        velocity of the aircraft is possible and “hovering” occurs for
        weights much greater than Thrust force by conversion of
        “horsepower” energy. Velocity “spread” is contingent upon
        induced vacuum as attained by an efficient propeller, efficient
        power plants of reliable design to “flight” power requirements.

      <p><b><i>Popular Mechanics,</i> May 1947</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">The Wing that Fooled the Experts</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Front cover With stubby wings like half barrels flanking its
        fuselage, it resembles nothing you've ever seen in the air
        before--but it flies! Some experts who've seen it still can't
        understand why. </p>
      <p>And before you recover from the shock of watching this strange
        craft perform in the sky, its inventor, Willard R. Custer, has
        many more surprising claims to make. </p>
      <p>He says planes of this design can: take off and land at 15
        miles an hour in 50 feet of space, lift twice the pay load of
        present transports using the same power, and either hover
        overhead or pierce the supersonic speed zone. And he supports
        his claims with results from Army and privately conducted tests.
      </p>
      <p>Heart of this remarkable performance is the Custer Channel
        Wing, adaptable to any type air craft, and to piston, jet or
        rocket power. In contrast to conventional airfoil, it is shaped
        like the lower half of a tube and has an adjustable-pitch
        propeller at the rear. The propeller's tips sweep almost the
        entire trailing edge. </p>
      <p>Simply stated, an ordinary wing is fashioned so that air
        pressure--or lift--is built up beneath it and decreased above
        it, as the plane speeds along the runway, until a slight
        difference between the two makes the plane fly. Atmospheric
        pressure on all sides of the wing is a constant 14.7 pounds per
        square inch at sea level when the plane is standing perfectly
        still. Modern transports like United Air Lines' DC-6s reach 125
        miles an hour and use over 3800 feet to get off the ground, and
        they touch down at 100 miles an hour, using more than 1800 feet
        to stop. </p>
      <p>Custer's method is to relieve the pressure above the wing by
        the propeller's sucking action at the rear of the channel, and
        let the undisturbed pressure of nearly a ton per square foot
        below the wing lift the plane off the ground. Instead of moving
        the plane to achieve lift he gains it by moving air masses
        through the channel. To better control the lower- pressure air
        thus created within the wing, he has built up its sides above
        the propeller's center and slightly constricted the forward
        portion. </p>
      <p>This funnels more air to the propeller, increasing its
        efficiency so much that the pitch has to be adjusted to absorb
        unused horsepower, Custer says. In contrast to this concentrated
        lift, a conventional wing's efficiency varies along its entire
        length. Since the channel will lift 75 percent of the plane's
        weight without forward motion, very little movement is needed to
        add the 25 percent that makes the craft airborne. </p>
      <p>His unorthodox attack on the problem of finding more efficient
        ways to fly can probably be laid to the fact that Custer is an
        auto mechanic by trade, not an aeronautical engineer. So he cut
        a simple and unique path to his solution. He uses familiar
        objects instead of complex technical formulas to illustrate his
        arguments. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has many important potentialities if
        completely successful, Custer prefers to stress the safety
        features that will further popularize flying. With it, he points
        out, planes can sink slowly to earth through the worst weather,
        onto deep snow or any other kind of unprepared ground, at
        landing speeds slower than a man runs. The crash hazards of
        blind approaches and landings at high speeds are eliminated.
        Another important item is that all the controls of the channel
        wing plane are conventional and it is easy to fly. </p>
      <p>While most experiments with the wing have been in wind tunnels
        and laboratories, a test ship flew more than 100 hours over a
        government field at Beltsville, Md., using 75-horsepower
        engines. The engines and propellers were mounted on metal
        supports extending across the upper rear section of each
        channel. </p>
      <p>During those first test flights the plane, weighing only 1785
        pounds with pilot, was held to a top speed of 60 miles an hour.
        Take-offs and landings were made under 100 feet, upwind,
        downwind and crosswind. </p>
      <p>Two series of nonflying tests were later made by the Air
        Materiel Command at Wright Field. One fact established during
        trials was that the wing's lift increased even when its chord,
        the distance from front to rear, was reduced by half. Frank D.
        Kelley, president of the National Aircraft Corporation, said
        that a second flying model using a short channel wing will be
        ready for flight tests this fall at Hagerstown, Md. </p>

        possible safe 15-mile-an-hour take-offs and landings and doubles

        <p><b><font size="+1">Custer's Production Model Takes Bow</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>[ Original Article with Photos :&nbsp; Page 1 ... Page 2 ]</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a fitting example of independent, persevering aeronautical
        pioneering, on July 4th, the first production model of the
        5-place Custer Channel Wing CCW-5 was rolled out of the
        company's hangar at the Hagerstown, Md., Municipal Airport,
        christened and demonstrated. Although this gleaming all-metal
        aircraft is entirely new, its design is not. Designer Willard R.
        Custer has spent 25 years in full-time research and development
        of the vertical lift concept embodied in the half-moon wing
        configuration. Single and twin engine scale models were built
        and test flown from 1927 through 1940; these were followed by
        test flights of single and twin engine aircraft from 1943 to
        1952. The prototype twin-engine all metal CCW-5 (photo, upper
        left), flying since 1953, took off in less than 100 feet on its
        maiden flight, and the company reports that it has hovered at
        from zero to 11-mph, although the craft is actually a STOL type.
        (Remaining six photos here are of the latest Custer). </p>
      <p>The Custer Channel Wing is unconventional in that its wing
        channels replace such conventional aerodynamic devices as wing
        flaps and slots to provide required lift. In the Custer system,
        the powerplant is suspended in the channel with the propeller at
        the trailing edge. By drawing the air through the semi-circular
        wing at high velocities, pressures over the curved lifting
        surface are decreased to a much greater degree than in
        conventional wing configurations. </p>
      <p>Actually, the Custer utilizes a Boundary Layer Control effect
        to create its greater lift. According to Custer, conventional
        aircraft obtain lift coefficients of approximately 3 through the
        use of high lift devices, whereas the CCW craft have
        demonstrated power-on lift coefficients of 5. Designer Custer
        further claims 100% greater lift capabilities for his, using
        standard airfoil section, propellers and engines, compared to
        other aircraft using similar airfoil/power combination. </p>
      <p>Depending upon climatic conditions and weight, the Channel Wing
        configuration permits the craft to take-off in distances ranging
        from a 75 foot ground roll, down to virtually zero length,
        although high temperatures (95 degrees) will boost the run to
        250 feet. </p>
      <p>The CCW-5 is conventional all-metal aircraft construction,
        except for the compound curve section of the channels, which are
        of fiberglass. The channels, a web and rib structure using a
        main and secondary spar, are made of aluminum. Each spar has two
        sets of cap angles. The ribs tie into the cap angles and web.
        The metal and fiberglass channel skins are wrapped around the
        ribs. The engines are suspended in the channels by tubular steel
        frameworks with the frames mounted to the wing spars and two
        pylons supporting each engine. </p>
      <p>The Custer Channel uses a 4418 airfoil section with a 6 foot
        chord. Each propeller, located slightly aft of channel trailing
        edge, is a thin tipped 7 foot diameter full-feathering Hartzell
        with its tips trimmed. In rotation the tips deflect forward to
        close the channel; at 2625-rpm air is sucked through the channel
        over the airfoil at 115-mph to provide the BLC and lift effect.
        Designer Custer reports that about 15 years work went into his
        channel/propeller set-up. </p>
      <p>The prototype CCW-5 utilized a redesigned Baumann "Brigadier"
        airframe; the production prototype was constructed from the same
        jigs. Later craft incorporates only a few changes, mainly
        fairings at the channel roots and configuration change of the
        wing trailing edge, plus latest version of the 260-hp
        Continental engines which were moved slightly aft. The CCW
        Corporation reports initial orders for 40 CCW-5's, 20 of which
        are slated for a West Coast distributor to be sold as executive
        and utility craft. FAA Type Certificate is expected by July
        1965, at which time 6 to 8 craft should be well along on a
        production line. Price is $65,000 with standard equipment. </p>

      <p>After forty years of pioneering a new concept of lift, Willard
        R. Custer's ideas are now in the forefront of STOL aviation! </p>
      <p>Author's Note: The Custer Channel Wing concept, after almost 40
        years of public attention, is still so controversial that this
        article must be written in two sections. The first covers
        development of the idea from 1927 to its present (and possibly
        future) status. The second presents the engineering opinions,
        pro and con, which have fueled the controversy. Both are
        included in this article. </p>
      <p>Willard R. Custer is a man straight out of American folklore.
        He is the prototype Yankee inventor, smart, tough, resourceful,
        unafraid of the machinations of big government, big business, or
        fate. He believes in his invention, and he knows that sooner or
        later he will prevail. </p>
      <p>Custer is a genuine innovator, for although designers have
        tried virtually every combination of wing size and shape, and
        every permutation of engine/propeller placement, it remained for
        him to combine the two elements in his famous Custer Channel
        Wing. </p>
      <p>The inventor is a friendly, persuasive, energetic,
        single-minded man who has pursued a fifty year dream with a
        charming tenacity that has weathered many disappointments. He is
        convinced that he is right, that he has been right, and that the
        world has been denied the benefits of the Custer Channel Wing by
        a combination of misfortune, lack of vision, and, sadly in some
        instances, simple bad faith. </p>
      <p>It's hard to be around Willard Custer for more than a few
        minutes before beginning to believe with him in his concept. He
        is so evidently sincere, so deeply convinced and so determined
        to win through that he converts even the most ardent
        skeptics--at least temporarily. He's an exhausting man to
        interview, for he flies around his small but neat
        shop/laboratory, grabbing an air hose to "fly" a screwdriver
        around to prove a point, picking up a 40 year old model, shoving
        a jet engine test rig out of the way, all the time telling you
        of the fundamental simplicity of his own
        science--"aerophysics"--and never tiring of the main topic of
        conversation, his patented channel wing. </p>
      <p>In some respects these engaging characteristics may work
        against him in today's cold business climate. Times have
        changed, and aviation is more sophisticated, more finance
        oriented, and its engineering requirements are vastly more
        extensive. It may be that the very qualities which have
        sustained him in his battle against convention are not the ones
        which persuade a modern businessman to put up the necessary
        financing. </p>
      <p>No matter; he has succeeded in his own mind, and the minds of
        many qualified engineers. More important, there are current
        indications that his concepts may yet be recognized. </p>
      <p>The Custer saga began during a near-hurricane. A young Willard
        R. Custer was taking shelter in a barn, when suddenly the roof
        sailed off. Instead of being frightened, Custer wondered where
        the power to lift the roof came from. He'd been fascinated with
        aircraft for a long time, and knew that they had to accelerate
        down a runway to generate enough lift to take-off, while the
        barn roof, a poor airfoil, had lifted off "just sitting there".
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Custer soon came upon a distinction that has eluded other
        inventors, postulating that when air passes over an object, as
        in the barn roof incident, that is "speed of air". However, when
        an aircraft flies through the air, that is "air speed". </p>
      <p>Now don't just put this off as semantics, not just yet, anyway.
        It is Custer's theory, and it is best to use his words to
        describe it, i.e., "it is the speed of the air and not the speed
        of the object which counts. The airfoil was designed to obtain a
        reaction from the air mass through which it is moved. The
        [channel wing] was designed to obtain a reaction from the air
        mass moved through it." </p>
      <p>In essence, Custer says that in his wing, the movement of air
        through the channels reduces air pressure in those channels, and
        that atmospheric pressure on the bottom of the channel airfoil
        then creates lift in direct proportion to the pressure reduction
        in pounds per square foot. </p>
      <p>Other engineers have said it better for Custer, but his
        comments are essentially correct. In stricter terms, an engineer
        might say the following: "Greater lift coefficients are obtained
        by the effect of the propeller slipstream deflecting the air
        mass through which the wings are moved, by suppression of the
        boundary layer with high velocity slipstream, allowing the wing
        to fly at higher angles of attack before stalling, and by the
        vertical lift component due to the inclination of propeller
        thrust at high angles of attack." </p>
      <p>I like Custer's way better. </p>
      <p>Speaking again in more practical terms, the pusher propeller,
        tailored closely to almost touch the lip of the channel (Custer
        has experienced "channel shaving" in some of his experimental
        propellers) sucks air through the big half-tubes, and the
        Bernoulli principle does the rest. The propeller/channel
        juncture is critical, and some of the most efficient results
        have been obtained when the juncture was temporarily sealed by
        pouring water into the channel. </p>
      <p>All of the above might sound like double talk, if Custer had
        not demonstrated his principle in several models and four full
        size aircraft, or if extensive testing had unquestionably
        refuted his claims. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the testing has been ambiguous, and while it has
        not refuted the claims, neither has it sustained them. Part of
        the problem is that the tests have not been designed to prove or
        disprove the ability of the channel wing aircraft to perform,
        but have only investigated certain aspects which were amenable
        to contemporary testing techniques. Another part of the problem
        is that Custer has understandably maintained such tight control
        over his patents that full development programs have not been
        possible. </p>
      <p>There are additional factors which will be covered in the
        second part of the article, which are more difficult to define.
        On the one hand, government reaction to Custer through the years
        has ranged from mildly patronizing to outraged; it is fairly
        evident from the correspondence that Willard Custer's native
        engineering talents didn't receive the same respect that would
        have been accorded an established manufacturer. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, Custer has probably been too optimistic
        about the potential of his invention, while soft-pedaling some
        of the real problem areas. His reluctance to let professional
        engineers tell his story in objective, conventional, engineering
        terms, clearly delineating both advantages and disadvantages,
        has undoubtedly cost him some credibility. </p>
      <p>As we shall see, engineering opinion is still divided about the
        Custer Channel Wing, but that doesn't inhibit an examination of
        the airplanes themselves, which constitute a unique line in
        American aviation. <br>
        Custer had translated his hurricane/barn roof idea into a
        working model by 1928, and obtained his first patent by 1929. At
        about the same time he coined the word "aerophysics" to use
        instead of "aerodynamics" to emphasize his concept that it was
        the removal of air pressure above the channel rather than the
        movement of the airfoil that was important. </p>
      <p>In 1937 Custer built a single engine model which demonstrated
        vertical lift, and by 1939 he had formed a corporation, the
        first of many business entities which would sustain the idea
        over the years. </p>
      <p>In 1940 he was able to demonstrate a twin engine model to his
        potential stock holders, obtaining enough financing to begin
        construction of the first full size channel wing, the CCW-1. </p>
      <p>This aircraft was (is, actually, for it is now in storage at
        the National Air and Space Museum's Silver Hill facility) an
        amazing combination of futuristic lines and modest test
        expectations. Custer is an excellent woodworker, and the
        streamlined fuselage and carefully built channels are beautiful
        examples of art. </p>
      <p>The airplane had 202.5 square feet of wing area, spread over a
        most unusual surface. Semi-circular, detachable wing tips were
        added to a straight chord wing surface, for a total length of
        nine feet four inches; a six foot channel was attached between
        the outer panel and the fuselage. Total wing span was 32' 10-1/2
        ". The channels were hung under the wing like huge nacelles, and
        the two Lycoming 75 horsepower four cylinder air cooled engines
        were mounted about midway in the channel. The 19'11" egg shaped
        fuselage seemed disproportionately short, and the aesthetics
        were not helped by a low aspect ration "T" tail empennage. The
        stumpy landing gear looked like an afterthought. </p>
      <p>Yet, despite this unusual appearance, the CCW-1 logged more
        than 300 hours in a restricted test program aimed primarily at
        learning how the channels worked, and what new flying techniques
        were required to guide the channel wing. </p>
      <p>Curiously, Willard Custer made the first flight in the aircraft
        on November 12, 1942, entirely inadvertently. Custer is not a
        pilot and his test pilot, E.Kenneth Jaquieth was not in town on
        the day financial backers came to the Custer laboratory to see
        the airplane. The backers wanted to take some pictures, and
        asked Custer to taxi the CCW-1 to the small field where Jaquieth
        had been conducting taxi tests. </p>
      <p>The field was only about 200 feet away, up a slight hill, and
        Custer felt qualified to move the plane. He applied power to get
        up the incline, and was somewhat disconcerted to see the trees
        on the horizon disappear. He was airborne, a non-pilot on the
        first flight of a brand new kind of aircraft. Custer throttled
        back abruptly, and the CCW-1 settled in, bending the landing
        gear. </p>
      <p>Instead of being upset, the backers were delighted, for their
        dark horse had flown, albeit briefly. </p>
      <p>The CCW-1 was later flown in demonstration for the military at
        the Beltsville, Maryland airport, where gruff, hard boiled
        Brigadier General W.E. Gilmore was excited enough to authorize a
        test program. Custer recalls that Gilmore actually phoned
        Orville Wright, who was in Washington at the time, urging him to
        come out and witness the new development. </p>
      <p>The testing program which began on June 6, 1944 proved to be
        typical of the entire series of government tests of the channel
        wing concept, generating mixed conclusions, controversy and zero
        satisfaction to anyone. </p>
      <p>The report, Army Air Forces Technical Report No. 5142,
        concluded that the lift generated by the channel was similar to
        the increment of lift generated by normal slipstream velocity in
        conventional wing/propeller arrangements. Unfortunately, the
        conclusion did not restate the point made in the report that the
        channel generated more lift than the conventional arrangement.
        The report stated further that while the channel was markedly
        inferior to the helicopter in producing static lift, it was
        superior to conventional wing-propeller arrangements in this
        regard, and in producing lift with forward velocity. </p>
      <p>The final conclusion was startling, for the report stated that
        "the device does not show sufficient promise of military value
        to justify further development by the Army Air Forces." This is
        surprising in that the improvement of static lift over a
        conventional wing/propeller arrangement was marked, and high
        lift devices in the form of flaps, slats and slots were under
        intensive development at the time. </p>
      <p>The verdict typified the testing process, which never validated
        or denied what should have been the basic question, i.e. "Did
        the channel wing have characteristics of sufficient value when
        compared to other high-lift devices to warrant further
        development?" </p>
      <p>Instead, the government denied that the channel wing was as
        good as a helicopter, and Custer compounded the problem by
        insinuating that it was indeed as useful as a helicopter. </p>
      <p>Custer made an immediate and lasting interpretation of the test
        results, one which did not help the controversy. He inferred
        that perhaps the results were too good, and might actually be a
        threat to the then infant helicopter industry, which was
        receiving tremendous backing from the armed services. The first
        reaction to a charge like this is to shrug -- it sounds too much
        like the stories of "60 miles per gallon carburetors" which have
        allegedly been suppressed over the years. Yet there are other
        arguments which makes (sic) one wonder. </p>
      <p>The most cogent of these are the later Wright Field tests,
        conducted in 1945 and 1947, which were cautiously optimistic
        about the channel wing concept. There is also the testimony of
        the Wright Field engineer, Don Young, who conducted the tests.
        He testified in a Washington Federal District Court that the
        channel wing was in fact capable of direct lift, and largely as
        a result of his testimony, Custer was granted additional
        patents. </p>
      <p>These optimistic test interpretations are reinforced by results
        from independent engineering firms which have investigated the
        theory and found it to have merit. </p>
      <p>The brutal truth is that the government would have rendered
        itself and Custer an inestimable service if it could have
        structured tests which would have proved, beyond any shadow of a
        doubt, that the channel wing was either (A) absolutely worthless
        or (B) had some promise. In case A, Custer could have turned to
        other things, while in case B, he might have been able to obtain
        adequate capitalization. </p>
      <p>Custer persisted, however, and built an engineering test
        vehicle, the CCW-2, in response to some of Young's test report
        recommendations. The CCW-2 used a Taylorcraft fuselage and
        empennage, with six foot channels in lieu of wings. Conforming
        to Young's suggestions, the channels were shorter, and the
        propeller was placed at the extreme rear edge of the surface.
        The CCW-2 was extensively tested in free flight, tethered, and
        in the NACA wind tunnel. </p>
      <p>Harold R. Custer, Willard's son, made the first flight of the
        new aircraft on July 3, 1948. Harold is as energetic and
        determined as his father, and has the unique distinction of
        having logged more channel wing time than any other pilot --
        over 1,000 hours. </p>
      <p>Harold totaled 100 hours flying time in the CCW-2, which could
        take off in 45 to 65 feet, and land in the same distance.
        Lateral control of the wingless vehicle was obtained by
        differential use of the throttles. </p>
      <p>The flight test program was not without its highlights. The
        C.A.A. insisted that wings be mounted on the test bed, and short
        stubs were attached. These neither helped nor hindered the
        aircraft, according to Custer, but did mollify the bureaucracy.
        More significantly, the aircraft demonstrated vertical lift in
        zero wind conditions, while tethered. </p>
      <p>The wind tunnel tests at Langley are another subject of
        controversy and conjecture. Apparently the tests were well
        conducted, and the results reported accurately. Unfortunately,
        the conclusions seem to have been erroneous. Critics of the
        report indicate that it stated the primary increment of lift
        came from thrust, rather than from the lift, due to increased
        velocity in the channels, even though the plotted data showed
        this not to be the case. Also, the conclusions dealt with the
        CCW's hovering characteristics, rather than its STOL (short
        takeoff and landing) characteristics, an unfortunate view, for
        the channel wing was clearly designed for STOL, not helicopter
        style operation. </p>
      <p>During the whole arduous process of design and testing, one
        thing definitely was not happening. Willard R. Custer was not
        making a lot of money; he has invested not only all of his own
        funds, but all of his life in the channel wing, and the material
        rewards to date have been small. </p>
      <p>But Custer's tenacity and his almost messianic belief in his
        program enabled him to secure backing from a series of
        investors, and in 1951 he was able to employ the Baumann
        Aircraft Corporation to modify a Baumann Brigadier to the CCW
        configuration. </p>
      <p>The result was the prototype CCW-5, a rather handsome five
        place aircraft using two Continental 0-470-A engines of 225
        horsepower each. The standard Baumann fuselage and empennage
        were retained, and a 41 foot span wing with two seven foot wide
        channels was attached. </p>
      <p>First flight of the CCW-5 took place on July 13, 1953, with
        Walker J. Davidson at the controls. The company then spent the
        next several years performing demonstrations for civil and
        military audiences. These demonstrations consisted largely of
        maximum performance take-offs, with a terrifyingly steep climb
        out, using steep turns to the right and left at a high angle of
        attack and at speeds well below the stall speed of conventional
        aircraft to impress the audience. Motion pictures of the
        demonstration are heart-stopping; you know that an aircraft in
        that attitude, at that altitude and airspeed, is going to crash
        -- but the CCW just keeps on turning. </p>
      <p>Slow flight was a specialty, with speeds as low as 22 mph being
        measured. On August 27, 1954, in a remarkable display of the
        channel wing's ability, the CCW-5 was actually hovered against
        an 11 mph wind. The demonstrations would then conclude with a
        steep approach, an incredibly short landing, with the turnoff
        not at the first intersection, but at the approach end of the
        runway. </p>
      <p>Take-off technique is critical in the CCW-5, for the pilot has
        to rotate sharply after the first 100 feet of roll, so that the
        high velocity air stream passing through the channel does not
        bounce off the runway against the undersurface of the horizontal
        stabilizer. If this happens, the nose can be forced down,
        considerably lengthening the take-off roll. </p>
      <p>The prototype CCW-5 had an empty weight of 3,000 pounds, a
        gross of 4,925 and a maximum gross of 5,400 pounds. Maximum
        speed was quoted at 200 mph, with a 180 mph cruise; these were
        probably optimistic figures, but most manufacturers tend to err
        on the bright side. </p>
      <p>The performance of the aircraft was good enough to interest
        several firms in its manufacture, the most promising being the
        Custer Channel Wing (Canada) Ltd., which secured the rights from
        the Custer-Frazer Corporation, and planned to build the plane in
        association with Norduyn Aircraft, Ltd. The short field
        capability of the CCW-5 was attractive to bush pilots, and an
        initial production run of 100 was planned. </p>
      <p>This operation, like several other potential manufacturing
        plans, fell through, primarily because of problems synchronizing
        FAA approval of the aircraft, and SEC approval of the financing.
      </p>
      <p>Custer undertook to build the 1st production CCW-5 at
        Hagerstown, Maryland, using Baumann Brigadier drawings as a
        start point, but modifying these as necessary to suit the
        different construction and stress requirements of the channel
        wing configuration. This, the fourth channel wing airplane, was
        rolled out on July 4, 1964, and it appeared that after many
        years of struggle the Custer Channel Wing was finally going to
        be marketed. </p>
      <p>Fate intervened in the form of the Securities Exchange
        Commission, which took exception to the manner in which the
        corporation stock had been issued, and the rug was pulled out
        from under the venture. </p>
      <p>The production aircraft was outwardly similar to the prototype,
        but building it from the ground up rather than converting
        existing Baumann components permitted considerably reducing
        drag. There were external differences, too; the engine nacelles
        were more streamlined, the wing had 2" less span, the nacelle
        strut bracing was simplified, the ailerons were moved further
        outboard on the wings, and rudder and aileron travel were
        increased slightly. </p>
      <p>In the steps toward FAA certification, it became necessary to
        raise the position of the horizontal surfaces, which impaired
        STOL performance. As previously noted, the CCW pilot has to get
        the horizontal surfaces below the vectored slipstream as soon as
        possible for optimum results. </p>
      <p>Performance figures for the production CCW-5 varied little from
        the prototype, with the same top end performance indicated.
        Power on stalling sped was listed as 22 mph, initial rate of
        climb, 1,600 feet per minute, with a 22,000 foot service
        ceiling. </p>
      <p>A single engine service ceiling of 5,000 feet was obviously a
        limiting factor in performance, and Custer planned to remedy
        this with improvements in the propeller/channel trailing edge
        juncture. A moveable sleeve has been suggested, one which would
        maintain a tight seal at the channel for STOL work, but which
        could retract for higher cruise performance. </p>
      <p>And so engineering rears its ugly head again -- if the
        advantages of the CCW derive from the channel section with its
        relative lack of mechanical complexity compared to slots and
        flaps, what does the addition of a moveable surface do? This and
        other similar questions will be covered in the engineering
        discussion. </p>
      <p>Where does the program stand now? It still has its advocates,
        and there have been proposals for putting channels on everything
        from Curtiss C-46s to Fairchild F-27s, to executive jets. As
        indicated above, there is a real possibility that full scale
        testing of the production aircraft by a government agency will
        take place. But whatever occurs, you can be sure that Willard R.
        Custer will not stop fighting the good fight, nor will he be
        convinced that his discovery is not, still, the coming thing. </p>
      <p><b>The engineering side -- pros and cons.</b> </p>
      <p>It is surprising to discover how sensitive and controversial
        the Channel Wing is today, after all its many years in the
        public eye. In an attempt to determine what the real merit of
        the Channel Wing is, I went to several engineers who had taken
        part in the testing and development of the device over the
        years. I interviewed participants of three different kinds.
        First were government representatives who had either conducted
        or interpreted the official tests. Second were engineers who had
        seen development potential in the channel wing, and who had a
        positive interest in its commercial success. Third was an
        engineer who was completely objective having neither a financial
        or government interest. </p>
      <p>Because of the controversy, and because some legal action may
        still be forthcoming, I've been asked not to name the
        participants involved. </p>
      <p><b>The Pro Side:</b> Proponents of the Custer Channel Wing say
        that first of all, the true capabilities of the idea were not
        susceptible to test because appropriate engineering theory had
        not yet been developed to explain its demonstrated performance.
        In other words, the airplane was physically doing things for
        which aerodynamic formulas had not yet been evolved at the time
        of testing. Such formulas have since been developed, and further
        testing could be done in a more scientific manner. </p>
      <p>Because adequate theory was lacking, the CCW was tested for
        features and modes of flight which were in reality peripheral to
        its main intent, simply because there was theory to test these
        items. </p>
      <p>The pro-channel wing faction maintains that the channel wing's
        pusher propeller arrangement not only forces circulation over
        the airfoil, taking advantage of the Bernoulli principle, but it
        also minimizes loss due to reverse flow around the trailing
        edge, and then across the ventral surface. </p>
      <p>The NACA tests, they say, erroneously failed to reveal that the
        principal source of lift is due to the increased velocity in the
        channels, and further, the tests should have highlighted the
        findings that the static lift exceeded the weight of the test
        vehicle. This basic fact underlies the most salient advantages
        of the Custer Channel Wing, its simplicity, and its ability to
        operate in the STOL mode without expensive high lift devices. </p>
      <p>The initial cost of the Custer Channel Wing aircraft -- of any
        type -- is probably slightly greater than a conventional
        aircraft of the same type, but less than that of an equivalent
        STOL aircraft using flaps, slots, etc. Its advantage stems from
        the fact that its operating costs would be far lower than those
        of the STOL alternative, because of the lessened maintenance
        requirements. Its greatest advantage, however, lies where it can
        be employed in helicopter operations, i.e. those situations in
        which helicopters are presently used, but with suitable
        modification in technique or landing area, a CCW could be
        substituted. The reason for this, of course, is the horrendously
        high cost of helicopter operation. </p>
      <p>The CCW could be used for larger aircraft, and with jet
        engines. The increased drag of the channel wing undoubtedly
        would reduce top speeds, but in the correct application this
        would not be significant. "Correct application" includes STOL
        airline transportation over relatively short stage distances;
        use in remote areas where the ability to fly in and out of short
        airstrips with heavy loads is important, or where revenues
        dictate against the use of a high operating cost vehicle. </p>
      <p>In sum, the CCW proponents say that the concept provides an
        economic, efficient solution for certain applications that are
        not presently met by conventional STOL aircraft or helicopters.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Con Side:</b> Those who take a negative view of the
        Custer Channel Wing do so persuasively and authoritatively.
        Their initial reaction is usually: "Oh no, not the channel wing
        again," followed by a measured explanation that there is not and
        never has been any emotional or economic prejudice against
        Custer's ideas. If, they say, the Channel Wing had shown merit,
        it would have been in the national interest to develop it, and
        it would have been so developed. </p>
      <p>In more specific terms, the opponents of the Channel Wing say
        that it has less potential now than when it was first evaluated
        and found to be inferior to other approaches to STOL
        performance. The anti-Custer group concedes that the channel
        wing's lack of flaps results in a simpler, more economic system,
        and that the generation of high lift by the configuration is
        accompanied by a low pitching moment compared to conventional
        wing/flap arrangements. </p>
      <p>The virtually viceless stall of the CCW is also acknowledged,
        as is the fact that ground personnel are exposed to less hazard
        by the propellers shielded by channels than by conventional
        propellers. </p>
      <p>These are about the only advantages, however, and there are
        more than off-setting drawbacks, which the anti-CCW view lists
        as follows: </p>
      <p>(a) Higher aerodynamic drag due to the increased wetted area
        resulting from the channels and, particularly, from the juncture
        of the channel to the fuselage. </p>
      <p>(b) The very simplicity of the CCW arrangement prevents
        changing the wing aerodynamic characteristics to different modes
        of flight. In other words, the thicker CCW is optimized for one
        mode, while a wing with a well designed flap can be optimized
        for both slow flight, cruise and higher speeds. </p>
      <p>(c) The requirement for cross shafting of the engines to avoid
        uncontrollable assymetric forces in the event of an engine
        failure when at a low airspeed, high angle of attack flight
        condition. (Custer concedes that production aircraft will be
        cross shafted.) This requirement of course dilutes the CCW claim
        for simplicity. </p>
      <p>(d) A substantially lower power-off lift coefficient compared
        to a conventional wing/flap arrangement. This means a higher
        landing speed is required for a power-off landing. (Custer
        counters this with statistics on the relative infrequency of
        power off landings in any multi-engine aircraft.) </p>
      <p>(e) Increased structural complexity of the wing. </p>
      <p>(f) A lack of engineering investigation into the problems of
        stability and control, and the use of rather simplified
        engineering theory to explain the complex CCW aerodynamics.
        (This, as noted above, is a two-edged sword.) </p>
      <p>So there you have it. Two points of view, both basically
        honest, and both vulnerable to the assertion that the CCW has
        not been amenable to really valid testing. </p>
      <p>What is the answer? Perhaps the future will tell, for more
        testing, presumably this time with more sophisticated
        techniques, is in the offing. It will be interesting to see,
        after all these years, who is really right. </p>
