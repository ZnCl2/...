        Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I’m looking into

        Sincerely,<br>

        <b>Jan. 19, 2017, Update:</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        On Jan. 6, 2017, Orna, a professor of chemistry at the College
        of New Rochelle, New York, and member of the executive committee
        of the American Chemical Society Division of the History of
        Chemistry, sent a letter to Nelson, on behalf of the author
        team.<br>
        <br>
        “My co-author, Marco Fontani … found the text of [Nelson’s] book
        on a Web site and, when he could not locate any reference to an
        author or source, thought it acceptable to proceed as he did,”
        Orna wrote. “I concur that this was not acceptable professional
        and scholarly practice.”<br>
        <br>
        “Orna’s statement that she ‘could not locate any reference to an
        author or source’ is pure bovine effluvia,” Nelson told New
        Energy Times. But the plagiarism, he said, is the least of his
        concerns.<br>
        <br>
        “The prima facie plagiarism is blatant and extensive,” Nelson
        wrote. “Worse yet is the disgraceful, insidious way in which the
        authors dismiss the successful experimental results obtained by
        Wendt and Irion. It adds injury to insult, and it sabotages
        science.”<br>
        <br>
        According to the Orna letter, Oxford University Press intends to
        do the following:<br>
        <br>
        1. Dispose of all existing stock of The Lost Elements in its
        warehouse.<br>
        2. Reprint the book with proper quotation marks and attribution
        to [Nelson’s] work.<br>
        3. Correct and reissue the electronic version of the book to
        include the proper use of quotation marks and attribution to
        [Nelson’s] work.<br>
        <br>
        The proposed remedy does not address the manner in which the
        history of chemistry has been misrepresented in the book. A more
        factual representation of that history has been published in the
        2016 Krivit book Lost History.<br>

          </font><br>
          <b>By Steven B. Krivit</b><br>
          <b>Publisher and Senior Editor, New Energy Times</b><br>
        </div>
        <b></b><br>
        In 2014, Oxford University Press published a book written by
        Marco Fontani, Mariagrazia Costa and Mary Virginia Orna, and
        edited by Jeremy Lewis, called The Lost Elements: The Periodic
        Table’s Shadow Side. Fontani and Costa are chemists at the
        University of Florence, Italy. Orna is a professor of chemistry
        at the College of New Rochelle, New York.<br>
        <br>
        The 530-page book is an eloquent, interesting description of
        supposed discoveries of new elements that turned out to be
        illusory. The dust jacket reads, "Throughout its formation, the
        periodic table of elements has seen false entries, good-faith
        errors, retractions and dead ends. In fact, there have been more
        falsely proclaimed elemental discoveries throughout history than
        there are elements on the table as we know it today."<br>
        <br>
        The book contains a 33-page section called "Modern Alchemy: The
        Dream to Transmute the Elements Has Always Been With Us." This
        section is primarily about elemental transmutation research that
        took place in the 1910s and 1920s. The authors also briefly
        discuss modern science experiments in the field of low-energy
        nuclear reaction (LENR) research.<br>
        <br>
        When I learned about the Lost Elements book, I had just
        completed the manuscript for my book Lost History: Explorations
        in Nuclear Research, Vol. 3. Lost History describes the
        elemental transmutation research that took place in the 1910s
        and 1920s.<br>
        <br>
        By 1930, the research from the previous two decades had largely
        been dismissed as errors and mistakes. However, very few
        confirmed errors or mistakes were ever identified. The reason
        the research was dismissed was that the results were not
        theoretically understood and the experiments were difficult to
        repeat. Consequently, the research was omitted from subsequent
        scientific reference material.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Another Author</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        News of this forgotten body of research didn't resurface until
        the 1980s, when a researcher and author named Robert Nelson
        spent many days poring through Chemical Abstracts at the
        University of California, Berkeley. Nelson suspected that the
        research had merit, and a chapter in my book discusses Nelson
        and his quest.<br>
        <br>
        In the mid-1980s, Nelson began publishing his research findings,
        first in a photocopied version and later on his Web site in a
        collection called Adept Alchemy. Nelson appears to be the only
        person who has found and documented this body of lost research —
        at least in the English language — since the 1930s.<br>
        <br>
        In 2012, I began writing my book Hacking the Atom: Explorations
        in Nuclear Research, Vol. 1, describing nuclear transmutation
        work performed during 1990-2015. At that time, I was aware of
        only a fraction of the 1910s and 1920s research. As I began
        checking that research, I found Nelson's research and
        discovered, through his work, that a substantial additional body
        of important scientific history existed.<br>
        <br>
        I decided that it was of sufficient scope and importance to
        merit its own book, and this led to my critical analysis of that
        research and my book Lost History. Although I have done my own
        research and investigation for Lost History, Nelson provided the
        road map for me as well as many of the bibliographical
        references that led me to the original scientific papers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Another Book</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        In August 2015, one of my editors was checking facts and brought
        Fontani's book, Lost Elements, to my attention. I was surprised
        to learn that Lost Elements broadly (but superficially)
        discussed most of the transmutation experiments that took place
        in the 1910s and 1920s. I assumed that Fontani, Costa and Orna
        had performed their own research, analysis, and writing. The
        book is well-written and appears to be a scholarly reference.<br>
        <br>
        I noticed that some of the facts in the Fontani-Costa-Orna book
        conflicted with facts I obtained from my own investigation. I
        began to check references that the authors had cited. Rather
        quickly, I began to suspect that Fontani, Costa and Orna had not
        performed their own research, analysis or writing for that
        section of their book.<br>
        <br>
        The structure of the Fontani-Costa-Orna "Modern Alchemy" section
        not only mirrors the scope of coverage in Nelson's research but
        also duplicates, without attribution, many complete sentences
        and paragraphs, some with tiny changes and others verbatim
        duplications without attribution. The authors knew of Nelson's
        research. In their "Modern Alchemy" section, they provide more
        than 100 references to sources. Yet despite directly copying a
        great deal of Nelson's text without attribution, they cite
        Nelson's 1998 research as one of their sources. They also list
        his Web site in their bibliography, and they say nothing more
        about Nelson.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The Same Text</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Within a few pages, the pattern became clear to me. When
        Fontani, Costa and Orna discussed specific technical details of
        the 1910s and 1920s research, they copied text directly from
        Nelson without giving him any credit.<br>
        <br>
        I did a few spot checks farther into the "Modern Alchemy"
        section. Not only did I find that the plagiarism in this section
        recurred, but I also found that the authors made strategic
        omissions and changes in the descriptions they appropriated from
        Nelson in order to bolster their thesis that all of these
        reported transmutations were invalid. In some cases, Fontani,
        Costa and Orna made statements that appear to be incorrect,
        though they are not fully to blame; some of these errors were in
        the original Nelson text.<br>
        <br>
        The Fontani-Costa-Orna book was produced with the financial
        support of Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze. In the
        acknowledgments, the authors cite assistance from people at the
        University of Siena, the University of Florence, the University
        of Illinois, Oregon State University, the Italian Chemical
        Society, the Committee of the International Congress of History
        of Chemistry, the Italian Society for the Advancement of
        Science, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Japan Isotopes
        Data Institute, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, the American
        Chemical Society, and the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from
        Alternative Sources (Canada), among others. The authors even
        acknowledged people who assisted with the book but who have
        since died.<br>
        <br>
        The authors give a special thanks to Peter van der Krogt, "who
        published the specialized Web page dedicated to the chemical
        elements and their history." Yet among the more than 100 named
        individuals, the authors did not acknowledge Robert Nelson, nor
        did Fontani, Costa and Orna identify any assistants who did
        research and writing on their behalf. I do not know whether all
        three authors were involved in the plagiarism. I have not
        examined other sections of the book for similar problems.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Nelson's Work</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Nelson, on the other hand, was meticulous in citing his sources.
        He was professionally trained as a paralegal who specialized in
        contracts, and his expertise is evident in his citations of
        sources. His precise bibliography made it very easy for me to
        conduct my own research.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna wrote in the acknowledgments that an
        Italian version of their book was published in 2009 by the
        Italian Chemical Society. That 544-page book is De Reditu Eorum:
        Sulle Tracce Degli Elementi Scomparsi, [On Their Return: On the
        Trail of the Missing Elements], by Marco Fontani and Mariagrazia
        Costa.<br>
        <br>
        Nelson appears to have produced his photocopied version of Adept
        Alchemy in 1998. Not only do Fontani, Costa and Orna cite
        Nelson's work but his work is also cited by Mark Morrisson in
        Modern Alchemy, published by Oxford University Press. Nelson's
        work is cited, but not dated, in Joseph Farrell's self-published
        2009 book Philosopher's Stone. In 1998, Nexus magazine published
        one of Nelson's chapters, "The Transmutation of Mercury Into
        Gold," in its Oct.-Nov. issue.<br>
        <br>
        Nelson registered the domain name for his Web site in 2000, and
        at some point, perhaps in 2005 (but certainly no later than May
        2006), he published an Internet version of his research at the
        address http://rexresearch.com/adept/aacont.htm. According to
        the Internet Archive (http://tinyurl.com/oyznkz9), Nelson's
        research was online by May 10, 2006. Nelson has graciously given
        me permission to upload a copy (PDF) of his research to the New
        Energy Times Web site.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Insidious Changes</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        I began my review of the Fontani-Costa-Orna book on Page 451 and
        examined the next three pages in detail. Once I saw the pattern
        of blatant plagiarism, I made only spot checks on Pages 461, 468
        and 476. Each of those three pages showed the same pattern of
        plagiarism, and I did not see the need to check any other pages.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna also made several insidious changes that
        distort and misrepresent this history. The first one I noticed
        was on Page 451 of their book. They discuss the work of chemists
        Gerald Wendt and Clarence Irion at the University of Chicago.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna wrote two sentences about Wendt and
        Irion without citing sources: 1) "Their work was viewed with
        suspicion at the time and, today, cognizant physicists have
        commented that their experimental design was faulty" and 2) "The
        harsh criticism of Harkins and Allison was a hard blow for
        Wendt, one that eventually interrupted his research activities."<br>
        <br>
        Although Fontani, Costa and Orna borrowed ample text from Nelson
        on this page, they omitted Nelson's quote of Wendt which gives
        the actual reason for his and Irion's termination of the work:
        "The work was stopped by the failure of the health of the senior
        author."<br>
        <br>
        Nelson, in turn, had quoted (and cited) Wendt from a primary
        source. The Wendt/Irion paper published in the Journal of the
        American Chemical Society, and Footnote 8, Page 1893 reads: "The
        work was stopped by the failure of the health of the senior
        author, necessitating a complete rest for a year or more."<br>
        <br>
        On Sept. 9, 2015, before I had any idea about the plagiarism, I
        sent an e-mail to Fontani and asked him for his sources on the
        uncited statements above. Fontani replied the following day with
        a secondary source that was published 73 years after the fact:
        "We consulted the original papers of the persons you mention in
        your email, and we also consulted several secondary sources,
        listed below: Le bugie della Scienza. Perché e come gli
        scienziati imbrogliano by Federico Di Trocchio (1995), Genio
        incompreso by Federico Di Trocchio (1996)"<br>
        <br>
        That's when I began to examine the Fontani-Costa-Orna text more
        closely and found the duplications. On Fontani, Costa and Orna's
        Page 468, I found another insidious change on the topic of
        unexplained production of neon and helium in vacuum tubes.<br>
        <br>
        Here is Nelson's original text: "... neon in vacuum tubes. The
        matter has not been resolved. The first such report ... "<br>
        <br>
        Here is the changed Fontani, Costa and Orna text: "... neon in
        vacuum tubes. Eventually, when the phenomena could not be
        reliably reproduced, most scientists concluded that the results
        were due to contamination. The first report ... "<br>
        <br>
        I published this report on New Energy Times on Dec. 20, 2016. At
        that time, I notified Fontani, Costa, Orna, Nelson, the Oxford
        University Press office in the U.K. Lewis, the OUP editor in the
        U.S., and Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffman, who wrote the
        preface to Lost Elements.<br>

        Steven B. Krivit's Explorations in Nuclear Research three-book
        series (Hacking the Atom, Fusion Fiasco, Lost History) describes
        the emergence of a new field of science, one that bridges
        chemistry and physics. The books give readers an understanding
        of low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) research and its history
        and provide a rare behind-the-scenes look at the players and
        personalities involved. <br>
