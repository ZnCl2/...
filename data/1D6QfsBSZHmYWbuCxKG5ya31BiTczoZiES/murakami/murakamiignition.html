      You've "seen it all" when it comes to ignition enhancements -
      until now!<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, the standard Kettering Spark Ignition can be as
      low as 0.01% efficient in converting power to a spark at the gap,
      which runs almost every gasoline powered engine in the world.<br>
      <br>
      Peaking Capacitors are MASSIVELY more efficient at converting the
      standard spark ignition power to a spark - upwards to 50%
      efficient! Notice that is 50% and NOT one-hundredths of one
      percent. That is quite a difference, but is all the hype
      justified?<br>
      <br>
      Capacitive Discharge Ignition systems have a separate power supply
      and are the prime choice for serious results. The dense blue ball
      at the gap is substantially more powerful than the peaking cap but
      it is hard to tell from the picture.<br>
      <br>
      MURAKAMI IGNITION method uses the SAME amount of power as the CDI
      system but is so much brighter and more powerful that it is beyond
      words. It isn't even a spark or an enhanced spark - it is in a
      category all by itself - it is a bright white ball of wonder!<br>

      A plasma ignition system is described herein that can produce
      plasma ionization around a spark plug gap using a single power
      circuit for the spark and plasma ionization. The system results in
      fewer components and higher reliability, allowing the system to be
      more easily integrated with existing ignition circuitry or in new
      ignition system designs. The plasma ignition system adds a one-way
      current path between the primary and secondary windings of the
      high voltage transformer. This allows energy stored within the
      capacitor after the creation of the spark to flow out of the
      capacitor, across the one-way current path, and through the spark
      plug gap. Thus, the plasma ignition system provides a dramatically
      better ignition spark with relatively little increase in
      components.; The system does so without requiring a secondary
      power supply circuit to generate the current for producing plasma
      ionization.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines generally operate by compressing a
      fuel and air mixture then firing a spark that ignites the mixture
      to produce the controlled explosion that powers the engine. The
      spark is typically produced by sending a high voltage to a spark
      plug that has a specified gap size. The high voltage causes
      electrons to jump across the gap, and the resulting spark ignites
      the fuel. The efficiency and pollution characteristics of an
      internal combustion engine are determined in part by the
      completeness of burning the fuel. If an engine does not burn all
      of the fuel or fails to produce a spark so that none of the fuel
      is burned, the unburned fuel is expelled as exhaust from the
      vehicle using the internal combustion engine. Whether an engine
      completely burns the fuel is determined in part by the robustness
      of the spark. Years of research have gone into creating ever more
      durable and reliable spark generation systems to ensure reliable
      spark production. Modern ignition systems typically include
      platinum tipped spark plugs that can reliably produce a spark for
      100,000 miles or more.<br>
      <br>
      One area of research that has dramatically improved spark
      performance is the production of plasma at the spark gap of the
      spark plug. Plasma is ionization of the air around the gap to a
      point where the spark is no longer just between the two electrodes
      on either side of the spark plug gap, but is also in a ball of
      charge surrounding the gap. This larger spark produces a more
      complete burning of the fuel, and leads to more power and
      efficiency from the engine. While a spark is produced by high
      voltage that causes electrons to jump the spark plug gap, a plasma
      ionization is produced by feeding high current across the spark
      plug gap. Although a spark plug gap is initially an open circuit,
      once the spark crosses the gap the gap is a similar conductor to a
      wire, and a high current fed to the gap after the initial spark
      will result in plasma ionization.<br>
      <br>
      Although typical ignition systems are good at generating high
      voltage, they are not typically designed to produce high current.
      Current plasma ignition systems therefore typically include a
      second power supply circuit that feeds the current used for plasma
      ionization. While the combined circuitry produces a much better
      spark, the increase in components and cost is a disadvantage of
      such dual energy ignition systems. A typical plasma ignition
      system includes two isolated DC-DC convert circuits the first DC
      DC converter circuit is a high voltage transformer that converts
      12 VDC battery supply to generate a 20 to 80 KV ignition spark
      that ignites the fuel and the second DC DC converter, converts 12V
      DC battery to charge a 600V capacitor that discharges the follow
      on current to increase the energy of the ignition spark generated
      by the first DC DC converter circuit. This method results in
      additional components that increase the cost of the system and
      increase breakdown risk. In addition, modern ignition systems have
      moved to a coil-on-plug (COP) system that includes the traditional
      coil of a primary ignition system on top of the spark plug itself,
      to reduce radio frequency (RF) interference to other components of
      the vehicle and to reduce power loss inherent in transmitting a
      high voltage over a greater distance. For COP systems, it is
      difficult to fit a second power supply for high energy plasma
      ionization on top of the plug with the other electronics.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A plasma ignition system is described herein that can produce high
      energy plasma ionization around a spark plug gap using a single
      power circuit for the spark and high energy plasma ionization. The
      system results in fewer components and higher reliability,
      allowing the system to be more easily integrated with existing
      ignition circuitry or in new ignition system designs.<br>
      <br>
      A conventional ignition system typically provides a single high
      voltage capable of causing a discharge between the two electrodes
      of a conventional spark plug. Common systems for providing such a
      high voltage include transistorized coil ignition (TCI) and
      capacitive discharge ignition (CDI) systems. These systems are
      effective in providing the high voltage for the initial discharge.
      Capacitor discharge ignition systems generally employ a discharge
      capacitor that is alternatively connected between a source of
      direct current and the primary winding of a high voltage
      transformer having its secondary winding connected to the ignition
      device (e.g., a spark plug). The capacitor in such systems may
      receive direct current from a storage device or from a coil
      disposed in flux-cutting proximity to a magnetic element movable
      in response to rotation of the engine. The switch means
      customarily employed to alternatively connect the capacitor to the
      source of direct current and to the primary winding of the high
      voltage transformer may be of solid state type, e.g., a silicon
      controlled rectifier or a thyristor, and operable in response to
      engine rotation by means of a trigger coil disposed in
      flux-cutting proximity to the same magnetic element as the current
      source. Alternatively, the switch may be breaker points
      mechanically operable in response to engine rotation in a
      conventional manner. In applications that are more modern this
      signal may emanate from a vehicle's onboard Engine Control Unit
      (ECU) in the form of a voltage high/low indicator.<br>
      <br>
      Current capacitor discharge ignition systems suffer from the
      disadvantage that all of the energy in the capacitor is applied to
      the ignition device through the high voltage transformer. While
      the impedance of the primary side of said high voltage transformer
      is generally quite small upon the initial application of the
      discharge pulse, the impedance of the high voltage transformer
      becomes quite large as the passage of current through the windings
      of the transformer is sustained. The impedance of the high voltage
      transformer thus significantly reduces the potential applied to
      the ignition device and increases losses in the system yielding
      poor conversion of the input energy at the spark.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma ignition system adds a one-way current path between the
      primary and secondary windings of the high voltage transformer.
      Before a spark has occurred, the spark plug gap is electrically an
      open circuit. The one-way current path between the primary and
      secondary sides of the transformer thus has little effect. Upon
      generation of a spark, however, the spark plug gap becomes
      electrically like a low resistance wire, completing a path to
      ground. This allows energy stored within the capacitor after the
      creation of the spark to flow out of the capacitor, across the
      one-way current path, and through the spark plug gap. Even though
      the voltage of the capacitor is small compared to that produced by
      the secondary windings of the transformer, the current produced
      through the spark plug gap can be quite large due to Ohm's Law and
      the low resistance of the completed circuit of the spark plug gap.
      This high current produces ionization of the air around the spark
      plug gap, thus resulting in plasma generation and a more effective
      higher energy spark. In addition, the circuit is very efficient
      because it utilizes energy already stored in the capacitor that
      would be wasted dissipating across the primary windings of the
      transformer in prior ignition systems. Thus, the single mode
      plasma ignition system provides a dramatically better higher
      energy ignition spark with relatively little increase in
      components. The system does so without requiring a secondary power
      supply circuit to generate the current for producing plasma
      ionization.<br>
      <br>
      Because the current path is one-way, a high voltage blocking
      element protects the capacitor from the high voltage discharge
      from the secondary of the high voltage transformer. The high
      voltage high current plasma flow across the spark gap generated by
      this method is suitable for all fuel combustion applications such
      as in internal combustion engines, industrial boilers, fuel
      stacks, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram that graphically illustrates the
      components of the single mode plasma ignition system, in one
      embodiment. Although individual components are described, it will
      be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various components
      can be replaced by other components or multiple components
      providing substantially the same function for various reasons
      (e.g., because a particular component is more readily available at
      lower cost or has other desirable characteristics). The circuit of
      FIG. 1 includes a primary charging circuit 105, a coil driver
      circuit 140, and an ignition circuit 170.<br>
      <br>
      The primary charging circuit 105 provides the voltage and current
      to the primary side of an ignition coil causing the secondary side
      to discharge spark and plasma. The primary charging circuit 105
      includes a voltage supply 110, a blocking diode 115, an inductive
      element 120, and a capacitor 125. The voltage supply 110 charges
      the capacitor 125. The coil driver circuit 140 includes the
      capacitor 125, a silicon-controlled rectifier 145 (SCR), the
      primary side 150 of a high-voltage transformer 165 (e.g., an
      ignition coil), and a high voltage blocking element 155. The
      silicon-controlled rectifier 145 provides a switching mechanism
      that can be triggered by an external signal to discharge the
      capacitor 125 into the primary side 150 of the ignition coil. For
      example, the ECU of an engine may trigger the silicon-controlled
      rectifier to cause ignition in a particular engine cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      The ignition circuit 170 includes the secondary side 175 of the
      high-voltage transformer and a spark plug or other ignition device
      180. Upon the initial application of the discharge pulse (e.g.,
      caused by signaling of the SCR), the impedance of the high voltage
      transformer 165 becomes quite large as the passage of current
      through the windings of the transformer is sustained. The
      impedance of the high voltage transformer 165, ensures that the
      capacitor 125 drains at a slow enough rate that a secondary
      parallel path protected by a high voltage blocking element 155,
      that connects the output of the Capacitor 125, directly to the
      spark gap 180 allows for the remaining energy in the capacitor to
      directly discharge across the initial plasma arc even though the
      capacitor is at a lower voltage than the secondary output of the
      high voltage transformer. This current expands the plasma kernel
      thereby increasing spark energy, ionizing more gas (air/fuel
      mixture) and ensuring complete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Most vehicles use a negative voltage ignition system rather than a
      positive one, and those of ordinary skill in the art will
      recognize that the circuit of FIG. 1 can operate in both cases.
      Having the spark jump from a hotter surface to a colder surface
      typically produces better ignition and may improve the wear patter
      of the spark plug. By using a negative voltage, the system can
      ensure that the spark jumps from the center electrode of the spark
      plug to ground. The voltage can be reversed to have the spark jump
      in the opposite direction. In a negative voltage ignition system,
      the blocking element 155 can be reversed and placed between the
      ground side of the spark plug 180 and the lower side of the
      capacitor 125.<br>
      <br>
      The coil driver circuit 140 and ignition circuit 170 can be
      replicated for as many cylinders as there are in an engine. In
      most engines, a single primary charging circuit 105 and capacitor
      125 are used to supply discharge power for the spark in each
      cylinder. A silicon-controlled rectifier 145 for each cylinder is
      signaled (e.g., by an ECU) upon ignition time for that cylinder.
      Each cylinder can have a high blocking element 155 that allows
      excess current from the capacitor 125 to flow across the spark
      plug gap producing plasma ionization. Once the conducting path has
      been established across the spark gap 180 by the initial spark,
      the capacitor 125 quickly discharges its remaining charge through
      the parallel path protected by the high voltage blocking element
      155 directly across the spark gap 180, providing a high power
      input, or current, into the initial plasma arc. The blocking
      element 155 (or elements) electrically isolates the ignition coil
      165 secondary side 175 from the capacitor 125 preventing reverse
      current flow. Without the high voltage blocking element 155, the
      high voltage output of the secondary side 175 would ground itself
      through the capacitor 125 and the conventional high voltage spark
      across the spark gap 180 would not occur, preventing ignition. In
      some embodiments, the plurality of silicon-controlled rectifiers
      145, ignition coils 165, and high voltage blocking elements 155
      (for each cylinder) are mounted as a coil over plug assembly for
      use in internal combustion engines. This ensures that the energy
      stored in the capacitor 125 is available to produce high-energy
      plasma at any of the individual spark plugs 180 by the appropriate
      triggering of its associated silicon-controlled rectifier 145
      switching control device.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the system includes a resistor 185 that
      suppresses radio frequency interference from the ignition coil 165
      and to prevent a low resistance current path between the voltage
      source 110 and the spark gap 180. The resistor 185 may also be
      replaced by a diode that prevents current from flow from the
      blocking element 155 through the secondary side 175 of the high
      voltage transformer 165. This variation also allows the high
      voltage blocking element 155 to be connected before the
      silicon-controlled rectifier 145 (e.g., directly to the capacitor
      125). This may be useful, for example, where the system is added
      to an existing ignition system, and a connection before the
      silicon-controlled rectifier 145 is more readily accessible than a
      connection after. Because the spark gap is initially an electrical
      open circuit and the path through the secondary side 175 is
      blocked by a diode or other blocking element, no current will flow
      through the high voltage blocking element 155 until the spark
      occurs, thereby bridging the spark gap and completing a circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The follow on current that expands the plasma kernel is supplied
      by the same capacitor that also discharges across the primary side
      150 of the ignition coil 165 that generates the initial plasma
      channel across the spark gap 180. Prior systems are not able to
      produce a plasma channel with a single input power supply system.
      Using a single power supply system results in more efficient
      plasma generation with lower cost and fewer components. The system
      also limits losses due to mutual induction and reactive impedance.
      In some embodiments, the circuit includes a second or more
      circuit(s) coupled to the primary circuit that provides an
      additional follow on current pulse across the spark gap 180 and
      causes the plasma kernel to further grow coupled with the follow
      on current. The circuit of this embodiment may also include a
      second capacitor coupled in parallel with the spark gap 180 across
      the secondary side 175 of the high voltage transformer 165.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram that graphically illustrates
      components of a secondary support circuit for the plasma ignition
      system, in one embodiment. Although the circuit of FIG. 1 can
      operate alone to produce plasma ionization around a spark gap,
      sometimes it is useful to use a secondary circuit to boost the
      plasma ionization. In some cases, a manufacturer may already
      include plasma ionization through a secondary circuit on a
      vehicle, and an aftermarket vendor may provide an add-on component
      that allows the primary circuit to operate more efficiently and
      contribute to the plasma ionization. FIG. 2 includes the circuit
      290 of FIG. 1, plus a secondary charging circuit 205, and a low
      voltage discharge circuit 250. The secondary charging circuit 205
      (similar to the primary charging circuit of FIG. 1) includes a
      voltage supply 210, a blocking diode 215, an inductive element
      220, and a capacitor 225. The voltage supply 210 charges the
      capacitor 225.<br>
      <br>
      The low voltage discharge circuit 250 includes the capacitor 225,
      one or more diodes 255, and an ignition device 260 (e.g., a spark
      plug). The ignition device 260 is the same as the spark plug 180
      of FIG. 1. One the primary circuit creates a spark that bridges
      the spark gap 210, the secondary support circuit produces an
      additional follow on current that grows a plasma kernel
      surrounding the spark. The voltage of the secondary circuit can be
      adjusted to produce a greater or lesser plasma kernel, and in some
      embodiments may be modified dynamically by an ECU or other
      monitoring circuit to produce particular ignition characteristics
      within the engine. The robustness of the ignition spark can affect
      timing and other characteristics of the engine, and the ECU or
      other monitoring circuit may modify the plasma-producing current
      along with other engine characteristics to produce particular
      engine behavior (e.g., better fuel economy, avoid knocking, and so
      on).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a flow diagram that illustrates processing of the plasma
      ignition system to generate plasma ionization, in one embodiment.
      Beginning in block 310, the system charges an energy storage
      device with a charge for creating a spark. For example, a system
      may include a power supply that charges a capacitor that stores
      charge for discharging into an ignition circuit at an appropriate
      time. The spark may be used to ignite a fuel/air mixture in an
      internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing in block 320, the system discharges the energy storage
      device into a high voltage conversion device that converts a first
      voltage of the energy storage device into a second higher voltage
      suitable for ionizing air between a spark gap. For example, the
      system may discharge the capacitor into a high voltage transformer
      or coil that converts the applied voltage (e.g., hundreds of
      volts) to a higher voltage (e.g., thousands of volts) to create a
      spark. In some embodiments, the discharge is controlled by a
      timing device that produces the spark at an appropriate time based
      on a mechanical state of an engine (e.g., the degree of rotation
      of a crankshaft and the state of one or more valves in a
      four-cycle engine).<br>
      <br>
      Continuing in block 330, the system produces a spark across the
      spark gap by generating sufficient voltage at the spark gap to
      cause one or more electrons to jump across the gap. The voltage
      created by the high voltage transformer quickly reaches a level to
      bridge the spark gap with a spark. The spark gap may include a
      spark plug with a gap determined to produce an appropriate spark
      for igniting a combustible substance.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing in block 340, the system directs remaining energy in
      the energy storage device across the spark gap without passing
      through the high voltage conversion device to create a current
      through the spark gap that causes air to ionize and generate a
      greater spark. For example, the system may connect the capacitor
      to the spark gap with a diode that allows current to flow across
      the spark gap once the initial spark has turned the spark gap from
      an open circuit to a completed circuit across which current can
      more easily flow. In some embodiments, the system may also direct
      a secondary energy supply across the spark gap to produce an
      enhanced ionization field around the spark gap, thereby producing
      a greater spark and more robust combustion of fuel near the spark
      gap.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing in block 350, the system prevents a reverse flow of
      current from the high voltage conversion device from flowing
      through the energy storage device. For example, a diode connected
      between the capacitor and spark gap will allow current to flow in
      one direction from the capacitor through the spark gap, but not in
      the reverse direction back to the capacitor or power supply. After
      block 350, these steps conclude.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates a device for applying the plasma ignition
      system to an existing automotive ignition system, in one
      embodiment. The figure shows a spark plug extender 410 that can be
      inserted between an existing ignition wire 420 or coil on plug
      assembly and a spark plug 430. The spark plug extender includes a
      blocking element 440 and a wire 450 for supplying a secondary
      current to increase energy across the spark plug 430 gap to create
      a greater spark through plasma discharge. The wire 450 provides an
      external follow on current supply to increase the energy of the
      plasma discharge across the spark gap. The spark plug extender 410
      allows the plasma ignition system to be inserted into an existing
      ignition system. Whereas prior to the system the ignition wire 420
      would typically be connected directly to the spark plug 430, the
      extender 410 allows the plasma ignition system to insert
      additional electrical circuitry into the ignition process and to
      control the application of the existing ignition circuitry to the
      spark plug 430.<br>
      <br>
      The extender 410 includes a slightly elongated body formed of heat
      resistant and electrically insulating material that extends
      between a spark plug engagement end 460 and a spark plug wire boot
      connector end 470. Although particular shapes and arrangements of
      components are shown for illustration of the concepts described
      herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that
      variations can be made to place the extender in a suitable
      location for a particular vehicle. For example, some applications
      may have height limitations or other obstructions that work better
      with a differently shaped extender 410 than that shown.<br>
      <br>
      The blocking element 440 may include a diode or other circuitry
      and is located within the body of the extender 410. The blocking
      element 440 includes a fitting 480 adapted to make an electrical
      connection to a source of follow on current directly to the spark
      plug terminal. The blocking element 440 enclosed by the spark plug
      extender 410 prevents the low-voltage, high-current power supply
      that provides the follow current from discharging into the
      conventional capacitive discharge (or other) ignition system. The
      system may also include a blocking element within the extender 410
      or at the other end of wire 450 that prevents current from the
      conventional ignition system from flowing into the source of
      follow on current.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the plasma ignition system reduces the
      production of oxides of nitrogen that contribute to air pollution.
      Dilution of the gas mixture, which is most commonly achieved by
      the use of water mist injection with either excess air (running
      the engine lean) or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), reduces the
      formation of oxides of nitrogen by lowering the combustion
      temperature. Oxides of nitrogen play a significant role in the
      formation of smog, and their reduction is one of the continuing
      challenges for the automotive industry. Dilution of the gas
      mixture also increases the fuel efficiency by lowering temperature
      and thus reducing the heat loss through the combustion chamber
      walls, improving the ratio of specific heats, and by lowering the
      pumping losses at a partial load. Cyclic variations are caused by
      unavoidable variations in the local air-to-fuel ratio,
      temperature, amount of residual gas, and turbulence. The effect of
      these variations on the cylinder pressure is due largely to their
      impact on the initial expansion velocity of the flame. This impact
      can be significantly reduced by providing a spark volume that is
      appreciably larger than the mean sizes of the in-homogeneities. A
      decrease in the cyclic variations of the engine combustion process
      will reduce emissions and increase efficiency, by reducing the
      number of poor burn cycles, and by extending the operating air
      fuel ratio range of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the plasma ignition system improves cold
      starts of internal combustion engines. For vehicles used in cold
      weather, such as cars and snowmobiles, starting the engine is
      often a problem because cylinders are cold and producing initial
      combustion is more difficult. The robust spark produced by plasma
      ionization is particularly helpful for ensuring that combustible
      material in the engine burns quickly and completely, and can
      produce a dramatic increase in the likelihood of successful firing
      of the engine during a cold start. This increases reliability of
      engines used in cold conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the plasma ignition system includes
      components for detecting failure of the plasma generation circuit.
      Because a traditional spark is sufficient to create ignition of a
      combustible substance surrounding the spark gap, a failure of the
      circuitry that produces plasma ionization may initially go
      undetected and manifest as a slight decrease in efficiency in the
      engine or increased emissions from a less complete burn of the
      combustible substance. While this can be handled by traditional
      means of a routine maintenance schedule (e.g., replacement of
      parts at a specified interval), it is also useful to detect the
      condition early so that the engine can operate at higher
      potential. Thus, the system may include additions to other
      circuits, such as measurement of oxygen levels through a vehicle
      oxygen sensor or timing of the capacitor discharge with a
      microprocessor or other circuit (described further with respect to
      ionization detection herein), to detect failure of the plasma
      generation circuit. The system may provide a warning to a user
      through an ECU (e.g., a check engine light) or other indication
      that the circuit is not functioning correctly.<br>
      <br>
      Although described herein in the example application of an
      internal combustion engine, those skilled in the art will
      recognize numerous other applications for the plasma ignition
      system. For example, satellites are currently moved in space by
      the use of plasma thrusters that generate a slight thrust by
      placing Teflon in an arc between a spark gap. The presence of a
      spark around the Teflon creates gases that move the satellite in a
      desired direction. Because the plasma ignition system allows for
      more efficient generation of plasma ionization around a spark gap,
      the system allows the movement of satellites using less power and
      without introducing costly new components. Efficient use of power
      and reducing component breakdown are often significant
      considerations for space-bound technology. Numerous other
      applications are possible, such as toys (the generation of a
      plasma spark can produce a loud pop powered by a common battery),
      defibrillators, tasers, and other areas where efficient spark
      generation is useful.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ionization Detection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A side effect and benefit of the plasma ignition system described
      herein is an increased ability to detect ionization activity
      within the cylinder of an engine by monitoring the capacitor that
      discharges the follow on current. Typical internal combustion
      engines fire a spark some amount of time before a piston reaches
      the top of its stroke. This is usually referred to as the timing
      of the engine and is expressed as a number of degrees (e.g.,
      typically 15-20 degrees) before top dead center (BTDC) of the
      piston, where top dead center is the top of the piston's stroke.
      An earlier timing allows combustion to start before the piston is
      at the top of the stroke so that combustion is robust during a
      longer portion of the power stroke of the engine. However, timing
      that is too early can cause undesirable engine behavior, such as
      knocking, and in extreme cases counter rotation (firing the piston
      backwards in the wrong direction) and damage to the engine. For
      this reason, timing of an engine is often set conservatively by a
      manufacturer to avoid risk to the engine. However, research in the
      area of engine monitoring has shown that increased information
      about ionization inside the cylinder can safely allow more
      aggressive timing that increases engine performance (adding 50
      horsepower to a stock car in one experiment).<br>
      <br>
      Ionization detection operates on the principle that gases in the
      engine cylinder cause a small current through the spark gap most
      or all of the time. This current is referred to as ionization
      current. Because of the connection between the low voltage side of
      the circuit shown in FIG. 1 and the spark gap, it is possible to
      introduce monitoring circuitry between the capacitor and the spark
      gap that allows very precise measurement of the ionization
      current. In addition, by measuring a rate of discharge of the
      capacitor it is possible to determine the ionization effectiveness
      in the cylinder. This information provides a view into what is
      occurring in the cylinder far greater than is possible today.
      Combined with the advanced computer control of modern engines, the
      plasma ignition system can apply the information gathered in a
      feedback loop to precisely tune the performance of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, a simple current detection circuit senses the
      leakage current due to the ions across the spark gap flowing from
      the same capacitor that produces the spark and enhanced
      ionization, thus allowing the inference of various conditions and
      events in the immediate environment of the spark gap such as
      engine misfire, combustion duration, engine knocking, approximate
      air/fuel ratio, indications of spark plug fouling, and
      pre-ignition. This method of plasma ignition with ionization
      detection is a significant improvement over the state of the art
      as it can utilize a single capacitor to generate the high voltage
      energy spark to ignite the fuel as well as supplying additional
      voltage to generate an ionization current, which allows for
      miniaturization so the entire circuit can be mounted as a coil on
      plug ignition system for modern automobiles in a cost effective
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between spark plug gap ionization and engine
      misfire is well understood in the automotive industry. When the
      plug sparks, the gases around the plug are ionized and the
      electrical conductivity within a spark plug gap increases
      following successful ignition due to the ionization of hot
      combustion gases. Measuring and analyzing the ionization current
      provides information about the combustion process. The existence
      of a sizeable ionization current is known to indicate combustion.
      Low or zero current is likewise known to indicate a misfire. The
      occurrence of engine knock, approximate air/fuel ratios, spark
      plug fouling, and other combustion characteristics can be derived
      from measurements and analysis of the ionization current.<br>
      <br>
      There exist several types of ionization current detection systems
      for detecting combustion with ionization current sensing across
      the spark gap inside the combustion chamber of an internal
      combustion engine. These systems typically employ two
      substantially decoupled energy sources where the function of a
      first energy source is to generate a spark across a spark plug gap
      and the function of a second energy source includes delivering
      current to the plug gap and providing a voltage across the plug
      gap such that an ionization current results and can be detected
      and measured by a detection circuit. The use of two energy sources
      employs two high voltage diodes to decouple the ionization circuit
      from the primary ignition circuit in addition to two DC-DC
      converters to energize the two decoupled energy sources that are
      typically capacitors. Such dual capacitor charging circuits are
      costly given the high expense of the high voltage diodes, DC-DC
      converters, long lasting metallized film capacitors and additional
      components that make up the charging circuit for each power
      source. Furthermore, if one of the diodes breaks down, there will
      be no ignition in the corresponding cylinder. If any of the
      components that energize the second energy source fails then
      ionization sensing and the plasma arc can no longer take place.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, the plasma ignition system can include an ionization
      current sensing circuit that is inexpensive to produce, has
      relatively few components, and produces a smooth current
      ionization output signal using a single energy source. Coupling
      between the ionization current sensing circuit and the high
      voltage spark circuit is minimized by providing a supplemental
      path that connects the primary discharge side of the capacitor
      directly to the spark gap that is connected across the secondary
      windings of the ignition coil or high voltage transformer through
      a blocking element to ensure one-way flow of current. The single
      energy source provides energy for a spark across the spark plug
      gap as it discharges across the primary windings of the
      transformer. Owing to the high impedance of the primary windings
      of the ignition coil, the energy source discharges the remainder
      of its energy across the high voltage spark through the
      supplemental path that connects the primary discharge side of the
      single energy source directly to the spark gap through a blocking
      element, thus causing a high current plasma arc. Subsequent to
      providing the spark and secondary source of current to the arc,
      the single energy source is immediately recharged to apply a
      voltage across the spark gap. This applied voltage results in an
      ionization current through the spark plug gap. Detection,
      measurement and analysis of the ionization current alongside data
      such as ignition trigger time and the cycle the cylinder is in,
      provides information about the combustion process.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the circuit of FIG. 1 is modified to provide
      efficient and economical ionization measurement, while maintaining
      all of the advantages inherent in a dual energy ignition system or
      the single energy ignition system of FIG. 1. In some embodiments,
      the detection circuit includes a resistor through which the
      ionization current flows at times when the fuel has not been
      ignited by triggering a high voltage spark. The resulting voltage
      drop across the resistor provides an ionization signal, indicative
      of the degree of ionization of the gases in the cylinder, which
      can be filtered, digitized, and analyzed by a processor to derive
      combustion characteristics. The processor analyses may be stored
      for future use, such as historical determination of engine timing.
      The monitoring circuit may further include a Zener diode that
      allows the arc current to bypass the resistor in the event of a
      successful ignition event and allows for greater measurement
      accuracy and ignition efficiency. Few additional parts are used
      and accurate measurement is provided.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram that illustrates a plasma generating
      circuit with ionization current sensing, in one embodiment. The
      figure adds an ionization detection circuit 505 to the circuit 590
      of FIG. 1. The blocking element 510 is reproduced from FIG. 1, and
      the other illustrated components are new to the ionization
      detection circuit 505. In the illustrated embodiment, at least
      part of the ionization detection circuit 505 is placed in series
      with the blocking element 510, allowing the circuit 505 to detect
      current and voltage changes across the spark gap. The ionization
      detection circuit 505 utilizes the same energy source as that of
      FIG. 1 to create and detect the ionization current in the spark
      gap. The ionization detection circuit 505 utilizes the energy
      stored in the capacitor of FIG. 1 as the voltage source for the
      ionization current which in turn travels via resistor 515 thus
      making this current measurable. The detection circuit 505
      comprises a resistor 515, the spark gap, the high-voltage diode
      510, and the capacitor. After the spark and the plasma arc occur,
      the capacitor is quickly re-charged by the primary charging
      circuit. The energy stored in the re-biased capacitor provides a
      voltage across the spark gap.<br>
      <br>
      Any current that results is termed the ionization current, and is
      a function of the ionization levels present around the spark gap
      in the cylinder. If the current exceeds a certain threshold, then
      combustion occurred. If the threshold is not reached, then partial
      combustion or a misfire occurred. The ionization current is
      measured via the voltage across the resistor 515. This voltage
      drop provides an ionization signal 520. Problems occur when trying
      to analyze ionization signal 520 because of noise during charging
      the capacitor and DC bias across resistor 515 during discharging
      of the capacitor. Being selective as to when to read the voltage
      across resistor 515 is a solution to both problems. An analog
      multiplexer 525 can supply the proper DC bias to a high pass
      filter 530 most of the time. The analog multiplexer 525 then
      supplies the ionization signal 520 to the high pass filter 530
      during the combustion process. Therefore, the noise and the DC
      bias are removed from the ionization signal 520 before entering an
      amplifier 535. Another method of eliminating the noise is to use a
      low pass filter in addition to or in place of the multiplexer 525.
      Once amplified by amplifier 535, a signal processor 540 analyzes
      the ionization signal 520 to determine various characteristics of
      the combustion process, including detection of misfire. A memory
      unit 545 stores the analysis data from the processor 540 for
      future use.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the ionization detection circuit 505 also
      includes a Zener diode 550. The Zener diode 550, in parallel with
      the resistor 515, serves to limit the voltage drop across the
      resistor 515. Because the arc current is relatively large,
      accurate measurement of the small ionization bleed current can be
      difficult. The Zener diode 550 protects the amplifier circuit and
      allows a higher/more sensitive resistor 515 to be used, thereby
      providing for better measurement of the ionization signal 520. The
      Zener diode 550 also avalanches in reverse mode and provides a low
      impedance path, bypassing resistor 515, for the arc current
      discharged from the capacitor. This allows efficient operation of
      the ignition system. Without the Zener diode 550, the arc current
      would face significant impedance caused by the resistor 515.
      Reducing circuit impedance increases the peak current and the arc
      intensity across the spark gap.<br>
      <br>
      The following provides component values for an illustrative
      embodiment. In this embodiment, a 4.7 µF capacitor is charged to
      650 volts by the power source, which includes a 12 volt to
      600-volt DC-DC convertor. The trigger circuit includes a 1,000
      volt 35 amp SCR. The step-up transformer has a winds ratio of
      1:100. A supplemental path is provided directly connecting the
      primary discharge side of the capacitor to the spark plug gap,
      through the high-voltage diode 510 rated at 50,000 volts and one
      amp with a 50-amp surge. A 3.3 volt Zener diode 550 in parallel
      with a 1 k resistor 515 serves to limit voltage drop across the
      resistor 515 to 3.3 volts. For the purpose of electromagnetic
      interference (EMI), shielding is preferably utilized. In addition,
      components are preferably placed close to the spark plug to
      shorten the high current, EMI generating discharge path (antenna).<br>
      <br>
      Characteristics of the combustion process can be determined from
      the ionization signal 520. One simple example is the duration of
      combustion, which is simply how long the ionization signal 520
      exceeds a certain threshold. Another example is engine knock.
      Engine knock occurs when combustion exceeds the speed of sound.
      Engine knock is a sound wave in the 5-8 kHz range and can be
      detected in the ionization signal 520. The processor 540 can be
      used to isolate and analyze ionization signal waves in the 5-8 kHz
      range. Presence of such waves indicates that engine knock has
      occurred. This processor analysis data may also be stored in the
      memory unit 545. Another example of a combustion process
      characteristic that can be derived from the ionization signal 520
      is the air/fuel ratio. There is a correlation between ionization
      and air/fuel ratios. The duration of the ionization measurement
      and the rate of ionization signal 520 decay provide an indication
      of air/fuel ratio. Therefore, ignition system testing yields a
      reference curve correlating ionization levels to various air/fuel
      ratios for particular engine designs. By providing the processor
      540 with these correlation data, the processor 540 can analyze the
      ionization signal 520 and derive an approximate air/fuel ratio.
      Again, this may be stored for future use in memory unit 545.<br>
      <br>
      Two additional examples of characteristics of combustion
      determinable from the ionization signal 520 are spark plug fouling
      and pre-ignition. These characteristics are indicated by the
      presence of ionization currents during certain engine cycles where
      combustion is not supposed to occur. In particular, spark plug
      fouling is indicated when the ionization signal 520 persists for
      too long. The other characteristic, pre-ignition, occurs when
      combustion begins before the ignition has fired. Thus, if the
      ionization signal 520 indicates combustion before sparking has
      occurred, pre-ignition is indicated. Once again, the manifestation
      of these characteristics may be stored for future use in memory
      unit 545. Another useful measurement is engine angular position.
      Means for providing this data is well known to those skilled in
      the internal combustion engine art. Engine angular position
      provides a reference point for processor data derived from the
      ionization signal 520. For example, when engine knock is detected
      (via the analyzed ionization signal 520) there is a corresponding
      engine angular position. If the corresponding engine angular
      position is also stored in the memory unit 545 along with the
      engine knock analysis, a technician can later utilize this
      information for engine repair, adjustment, and the like. An
      onboard computer or ECU can also use this information to
      dynamically tune the engine (e.g., by adjusting engine timing).<br>
      <br>
      Similar angular position information corresponding to misfire,
      combustion duration, engine knocking, air/fuel ratio, and
      pre-ignition is likewise a useful diagnostic tool. Furthermore,
      once the engine angular position is determined, the angular
      position of peak pressure can be approximated because it closely
      corresponds to the peak of the ionization signal 520. An
      approximation of the position of peak pressure is very useful for
      optimizing two engine efficiency parameters. First, in order to
      generate the greatest torque from a given amount of fuel, the peak
      pressure in the combustion chamber should occur approximately
      between 10 and 15 degrees after top dead center (TDC). Second, to
      lower the temperature of combustion and to lower emissions (e.g.,
      oxides of Nitrogen), the peak pressure should occur after 15
      degrees TDC. This allows for the possibility of emissions control
      using the ionization signal 520.<br>

      <b>Coil on Plug Adaptation</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to provide enhanced ignition performance and limit
      electromagnetic emissions, modern spark-ignited combustion engines
      usually employ an ignition coil mounted directly on each of the
      spark plugs. Various styles of directly mounted ignition coils
      such as pencil, stick, cigar, plughole, or coil-on-plug are used,
      eliminating the need for long flexible high voltage leads. While
      directly mounted ignition coils provide numerous advantages over
      other types including elimination of high voltage leads that cause
      EM emissions, elimination of waste spark mode, more precise
      timing, and packaging benefits, they cannot be easily adapted for
      dual energy ignition systems for plasma ionization.<br>
      <br>
      The following describes a variation of the plasma ignition system
      described herein in which a conventional coil on plug assembly is
      modified to include features of the system described herein. The
      variation is a coil on plug ignition assembly that includes a
      housing containing a primary winding, a secondary winding, and a
      bypass path with a blocking element that connects to an add-on
      external energy source such as a capacitor charged by a DC-DC
      converter. In addition, a second blocking element connected to the
      high voltage secondary output prevents the external energy source
      from discharging into the secondary winding of the coil on plug
      assembly. The coil on plug assembly can be integrated with a resin
      inside a single enclosure to ensure electrical insulation between
      the parts and to prevent misfires and arcing internal to the
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      Previous dual energy ignition systems can only be connected to a
      distributor-based ignition system with high voltage leads and
      cannot be used in conjunction with direct coil on plug ignition
      systems. The adaptation described herein allows application of a
      single or dual energy plasma-producing ignition system to be in a
      coil on plug package. This adaptation provides a coil on plug
      high-energy ignition device that permits simplification of the
      wiring by incorporating all the blocking elements inside the
      housing of a coil on plug ignition assembly so a user can connect
      any external energy source thereby converting a regular single
      mode ignition system to a high energy dual mode ignition system.
      The coil on plug ignition assembly provides the advantages of a
      dual mode ignition system along with the advantages of direct
      coil-on-plug type ignition coils, and avoids the shortcomings of a
      distributor-based dual mode ignition system, which can lead to
      failures because of faulty cables, complicated wiring, EMI/RF
      interference, diminished energy, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      Dual energy systems involve the use of blocking elements or diodes
      to ensure proper operation. The first blocking element (typically
      rated in kilovolts) ensures one-way flow of current from the dual
      or second energy source and protects the second energy source from
      the high voltage output of the ignition coil. The second blocking
      element (typically rated at a few thousand volts) prevents the
      second energy source from discharging its energy into the ground
      path through the secondary windings of the ignition coil. If the
      second blocking element is not included, the second energy source
      in a dual energy system will constantly discharge across the
      secondary windings of the ignition coil resulting failure of the
      ignition coil due to overheating. Because of the plasma ignition
      system described herein, dual energy or dual mode ignition systems
      can now be installed on engines with coil on plug ignition
      components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific
      embodiments of the plasma ignition system have been described
      herein for purposes of illustration, but that various
      modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and
      scope of the invention. For example, although capacitive discharge
      ignition (CDI) system components are used in examples herein,
      those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the application
      of the plasma ignition system to other ignition systems, such as
      transistorized discharge ignition (TDI) systems. Accordingly, the
      invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.<br>

        Benefits</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The large plasma kernel of the SparkAmp pulsed power modules
      brings about rapid ionization of the airfuel mixture in the 'golf
      ball sized' vicinity of the spark which, akin to the phenomenon of
      lightning, unleashes a pressure wave and flamefront that is 40%
      larger and faster than that initiated by a regular spark. This
      results in fuel in the far corners of the cylinder burning and
      thus releasing its energy in the form of added power even at the
      highest engine speeds. The key benefits include:<br>
      <br>
      Increased Horsepower and Torque<br>
      Increased Fuel Economy<br>
      Reduced Hydrocarbon, Carbon Monoxide, and NOx emissions<br>
      Better burning of Heavy Fuels (Multi Fuel Capability)<br>
      Enhanced Lean Burn capability<br>
      Better Cold Starting<br>
      Prevention of spark 'blow out'<br>
      Prevention of spark plug fouling<br>
      Smoother and Cleaner Engine Performance<br>
