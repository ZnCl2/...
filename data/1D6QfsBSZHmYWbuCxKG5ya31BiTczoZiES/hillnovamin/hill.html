        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      The $3bn (£1.5bn) global market for toothpaste is on the verge of
      a shake-up as new biotechnologies come through that not only
      curtail sensitivity problems but will also enable teeth to re-grow
      to fill in small cavities.<br>
      <br>
      Today's toothpaste comes in a plethora of flavours and can of
      course whiten teeth but from a medical viewpoint, little has
      progressed in the 40 years since fluoride was added to fight
      decay.<br>
      <br>
      Now though scientists in various countries have developed
      differing technologies that produce similar results to deaden
      sensitivity and recalcify the teeth, problems that have increasing
      significance as populations age.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have found fluoride ceases to be as effective with
      older people. That's because the elderly have more difficulty
      generating the large amounts of saliva – loaded with calcium and
      phosphate - necessary to combine with fluoride to resist the
      demineralisation of teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Also, said Richard Bernholt, managing director of west
      London-based dental care company Periproducts: "The older you are
      the more likely you are to have gums receding and sensitivity
      problems because of what you eat."<br>
      <br>
      Periproducts, which sells Retardex products in the UK, has
      licensed NovaMin technology from a Florida firm of the same name
      and hopes to be the first company to have it formulated in a
      retail brand in the UK later this year.<br>
      <br>
      Periproducts plans to launch its new toothpaste in October at the
      British Dental Trade Association exhibition at NEC Birmingham. The
      company wants to get its as-yet-unnamed toothpaste with dentists
      and into the retail chain before the big names in oral hygiene –
      Colgate-Palmolive, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp; Johnson,
      Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble reformulate their products with
      NovaMin or competing calcium phosphate compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Periproducts chose NovaMin because it had a long history of
      successful clinical trials. "It's a product that actually works,"
      said Mr Bernholt.<br>
      <br>
      It differs from market leader Sensodyne because it doesn't deaden
      a tooth's nerve-endings but builds a calcium shell to protect the
      nerves from potentially painful hot and cold liquids. NovaMin
      repairs the tiny holes in teeth that allow the pain to happen,
      instead of just covering the sensation of pain.<br>
      <br>
      For its part NovaMin the company is in serious discussions with
      two of the Big Five, said its CEO, Randy Scott. It is also
      discussing licensing deals with another 50 or more companies
      around the world and Mr Scott expects growth to explode in the
      next nine to 12 months.<br>
      <br>
      The genesis of the technology goes back to the Vietnam War era.
      American scientists developed a material that helped in bone
      regeneration for combat-wounded troops. Later two dental
      scientists at the University of Maryland took that bioactive
      compound and found a way to adapt the same technology for renewing
      teeth.<br>
      <br>
      That bioactive glass was eventually licensed by a company called
      US Biomaterials, which then spun off NovaMin, the company, to
      capitalize on what Scott says is a $2bn opportunity. The company
      is backed with $8m in venture capital.<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, interest in NovaMin has grown as competitors have
      emerged with other types of calcium phosphate formulae. One such
      product is Recaldent, which was developed at the University of
      Melbourne in Australia.<br>
      <br>
      Britain's Cadbury Schweppes has acquired the worldwide rights to
      that technology but at the moment seems more interested in using
      it in chewing gum than in toothpaste. The company says that last
      year, largely driven by Recaldent gum, it was the fastest growing
      gum company in Japan, which is the world's second largest gum
      market.<br>
      <br>
      Recaldent-based gums under Cadbury's Trident brand are also big
      sellers in Thailand and Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      The company has licensed companies in Australia and the US to make
      dental products with Recaldent but spokesman Rowan Pearman says
      there are no plans for such products in the UK.<br>
      <br>
      He added though: "As more dental professionals become aware of
      Recaldent and its benefits, you might expect the number and
      variety of applications to increase exponentially."<br>

      The present invention relates to a multicomponent oral health care
      composition, comprising a source of a fluoride ion, a source of a
      calcium ion, a source of a phosphate ion, and stabilised chlorine
      dioxide, that can be used as a toothpaste, oral spray or a mouth
      wash/oral rinse formulation. The different components in the
      composition act synergistically together to clean the teeth and
      mucous membranes of an oral cavity of a subject, perfuming them or
      protecting them in order to keep them in good condition, change
      their appearance or correct unpleasant odours. They achieve this
      by inhibiting caries, promoting teeth remineralisation, and
      helping to alleviate dentine hypersensitivity, gingivitis and
      periodontal disease.<br>

      <b>Multicomponent Oral Care Composition</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a multicomponent oral health care
      composition that can be used as a toothpaste, oral spray or a
      mouth wash/oral rinse formulation. The different components in the
      composition act synergistically together to clean the teeth and

      their appearance or correct unpleasant odours. They achieve this

      helping to alleviate dentine hypersensitivity, gingivitis and
      periodontal disease.<br>
      <br>
      Tooth mineral in humans and animals is based on calcium apatite,
      Ca5(P04)3OH.<br>
      <br>
      Natural tooth apatites are heavily solid substituted, and the Ca
      cations in the crystal lattice may be replaced by, for example,
      Sr&lt;2+&gt;, Mg&lt;2+&gt; or Zn&lt;2+&gt;, or by two Na&lt;+&gt;
      cations. The phosphate (P04)&lt;3"&gt; anions may be replaced by
      carbonate ions (C03&lt;2"&gt;), with an associated Na&lt;+&gt;
      cation replacing a Ca cation or the associated loss of a hydroxyl
      ion (OH&lt;"&gt;). The hydroxyl ion may also be replaced by a
      fluoride ion (F&lt;"&gt;). This latter substitution occurs readily
      in tooth enamel and has several beneficial effects. In the crystal
      structure of calcium apatite, the hydroxyl ion is displaced
      slightly above the plane of a triangle of Ca(II) ions (as depicted
      in Figure 3), whilst the smaller fluoride ion sits in the centre
      of the Ca(II) triangle. This results in hydroxyapatite (HA) having
      a slightly distorted monoclinic crystal structure, whilst
      fluorapatite has a more symmetric hexagonal crystal structure.
      This difference leads to fluorapatite being:<br>
      <br>
      i) More stable to acid dissolution and more resistant to the acids
      produced bycaries forming bacteria; and<br>
      <br>
      ii) Formed more readily, since fluorapatite has a lower solubility
      product than hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      As a consequence of these two factors, soluble fluoride salts have
      been added to toothpastes, mouth rinses and drinking water for
      over fifty years, and fluoride has a well- documented and
      recognised role in anti-caries treatment. The use of fluoride as a
      preventive measure is well established.<br>
      <br>
      It is generally recognised that plaque that forms on teeth as a
      result of the activity of bacteria is not completely removed by
      the act of brushing teeth. The plaque may act as a reservoir for
      fluoride in the mouth, where it is thought to form fluorite-like
      species, such as calcium fluoride (CaF2). The accumulation of
      dental plaque biofilms, whilst it may possibly be desirable as a
      fluoride reservoir, is also the source of the acid-producing
      bacteria that cause caries and gingivitis, which can progress to
      become periodontal disease. Their presence is therefore
      undesirable. However, fluoride becomes integrated within the
      hydroxyapatite crystals, creating enlarged and less soluble
      crystals. Because these crystals are less soluble and less
      reactive, as they are more stable to acid dissolution and more
      resistant to the acids produced by caries-forming bacteria,
      dissolution of tooth structure by acid by-products of
      microorganism metabolism cannot occur as readily. The action of
      fluoride on hydroxyapatite crystals therefore makes it an aid in
      the prevention or minimisation of dental caries and periodontal
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, free fluoride in saliva is rapidly diluted by
      salivary flow and exchange. Salivary flow rates vary enormously
      from individual to individual and vary during the course of the
      day, reducing almost to zero during sleep. Salivary flow rates are
      typically about 0.25 to 1.2 ml/min during the day, while the
      salivary volumes are typically about 1-10 ml. Additionally,
      salivary flow rates are observed to reduce with age and with
      smoking.<br>
      <br>
      Fluoride uptake into enamel, and into incipient caries lesions and
      the resulting formation of fluorapatite, is retarded by the
      presence of plaque. The plaque acts as a barrier to fluoride
      uptake. In the absence of plaque, fluoride uptake into enamel is
      extremely rapid. It is important to note that remineralisation
      requires a source of both Ca and P04 &lt;"&gt; ions in addition to
      fluoride in order to form fluorapatite. Fluoride is proposed to
      enhance the precipitation of fluorapatite crystals in solutions
      containing calcium and phosphate and therefore tends to prevent
      the demineralisation of teeth. Evidence has linked fluorite to
      enhancing iron absorption. The calcium and phosphate may come from
      the saliva itself. However, particularly in individuals with low
      salivary flow rates, such as the elderly and smokers, or during
      night times when salivary flow rates are reduced, it is preferable
      to have an additional source of F&lt;"&gt;, Ca&lt;2+&gt;, and
      P04&lt;3"&gt; within the toothpaste itself. This may be provided
      by soluble forms of F&lt;"&gt;, Ca , and P04 or more preferably
      particulate, sparingly soluble forms that give rise to controlled
      release of calcium and phosphate as a result of the particles
      adhering to the teeth and gingivae and slowly dissolving. Examples
      include bioactive glasses, and particularly hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      Studies have demonstrated that oral gram-negative anaerobic
      bacteria and several species of other oral bacteria can produce
      volatile sulphur compounds (VSC), such as hydrogen sulphide methyl
      mercaptan and dimethyl sulphide. Malodorous VSC are generated
      primarily through the putrefactive action of oral microorganisms
      on sulphur-containing amino acids, peptones or proteins found in
      the oral cavity of a human or animal subject. These substrates are
      readily available in saliva and dental plaque, or may be derived
      from proteinaceous food particles, as well as exfoliated oral
      epithelium food debris.<br>
      <br>
      Stabilised chlorine dioxide (C102) is an aqueous solution
      containing chlorite ions and stabilisers. The stabilisers may
      comprise, for example, a carbonate or bicarbonate buffering
      system. When the pH of stabilised chlorine dioxide falls below a
      neutral pH, the molecular chlorine dioxide radical is released.
      The chlorine dioxide has bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effects
      on the bacteria in the oral cavity of a human or animal subject.
      Stabilised chlorine dioxide reacts with the cell walls of
      microorganisms (changing the proteins and fats in the cell wall
      membrane), acts as a strong oxidising agent (oxidising the
      polysaccharide matrix that keeps the biofilm together) and
      effectively kills pathogenic microorganisms such as fungi,
      bacteria and viruses.<br>
      <br>
      Chlorine dioxide has a well proven role in destroying the bacteria
      involved in plaque formation, caries, gingivitis and periodontal
      disease, as well as eliminating halitosis. As chlorine dioxide
      destroys the plaque-forming bacteria, it is particularly effective
      in plaque removal, in conjunction with physical tooth brushing.
      Removal of this plaque will remove the physical barrier to
      fluoride, calcium and phosphate ions being able to reach the
      demineralised tooth surface, and thus promotes and enhances
      remineralisation of the tooth surface.<br>
      <br>
      However, there is always a need and a desire in the technical
      field to provide oral care compositions which are more effective
      still in effecting the minimisation of the amount of plaque within
      the oral cavity and facilitating the remineralisation of teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in accordance with the present invention there is
      provided an oral care composition comprising:<br>
      <br>
      i) A source of a fluoride ion;<br>
      <br>
      ii) A source of a calcium ion;<br>
      <br>
      iii) A source of a phosphate ion; and<br>
      <br>
      iv) stabilised chlorine dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      These components have, to date, never been employed together in a
      single oral care composition. The combination of the components is
      surprisingly able to exhibit a synergistic effect over and above
      the effects observed when using each component on an individual
      basis, or when using a composition which does not contain all of
      the components.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment of the invention, the source of a
      fluoride ion is typically a soluble fluoride salt. Exemplary
      sources of fluoride ions which are envisaged by the present
      invention include, but are not limited to, sodium fluoride,
      potassium fluoride, disodium monofluorophosphate, tin (II)
      fluoride (stannous fluoride), dipotassium fluorophosphates,
      calcium fluorophosphates, calcium fluoride, ammonium fluoride,
      aluminium fluoride, hexadecyl ammonium fluoride,
      3-(N-hexadecyl-N-2-hydroxy- ethylammonio) ammonium difluoride, N,N
      ,N -Tris(polyoxyethylene)-N-hexadecyl-
      propylenediarrrinedihydrofluoride disodium hexafluorosilicate,
      dipotassiumhexafluorosilicate, ammonium hexafluorosilicate,
      magnesium hexafluorosilicate, or ammonium fluorophosphates, or any
      combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the source of fluoride ions has a
      concentration of fluoride between about 20 and about 1500 ppm as
      fluorine.<br>
      <br>
      The source of fluoride ions may have a concentration in the range
      of between about 0.1% to about 3.0% (w/v) in the oral care
      composition, typically between about 0.25% to about 2.0%) (w/v),
      more typically between about 0.50% to about 1.5% (w/v), still more
      typically between about 1.00% to about 1.2% (w/v).<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, both the calcium
      ions and the phosphate ions are typically provided by an apatite
      species, such as a nano-crystalline apatite. Nano-crystalline is
      defined herein as where the crystallites have a size of less than
      about 100 un.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the crystallite sizes of the apatites
      are determined from X-ray diffraction line width data using the
      Scherrer Line broadening method. In this method, the width at half
      height of the 002 reflection ß002 is inversely proportional to
      crystallite length in the c-axis direction (Cullity 1956) and is
      given by the equation:<br>
      <br>
      Where D is the crystallite size in nm; ? is the wavelength of the
      incident X-rays, 0.154nm; ß002 is the width at half height of the
      002 reflection and cos6 is the cosine of the X- ray incident angle
      (25.85°). The 002 reflection is a term well known to a person
      skilled in the art, and is explained in, for example, the textbook
      'Elements of X-Ray Diffraction', (3rd Edition); B.D. Cullity
      (2001); Addison- Wesley Chapter 2; ISBN-10: 0201610914.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that this method neglects instrumental line
      broadening which is negligible for small nm sized crystals, and
      also neglects strain effects in the lattice and solid substitution
      effects. It is the unique combination of fluoride, calcium,
      phosphate, and stabilised chlorine dioxide, in one single oral
      care composition, that is able to act synergistically together to
      inhibit caries, promote remineralisation of the teeth, and help
      with dentine hypersensitivity, gingivitis and periodontal disease.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the composition contains an
      appropriate buffering system. Exemplary buffer systems which are
      envisaged by the present invention include, but are not limited
      to, those comprising one or more of acetate, carbonate, citrate or
      phosphate salts.<br>
      <br>
      The oral care composition may be contained within, for example, a
      toothpaste, oral spray or a mouth wash/oral rinse formulation, or
      in any other formulation which may be used for the improvement of
      oral hygiene. Such formulations will of course be readily apparent
      to a person skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The oral care composition of the invention is able to achieve
      remineralisation of incipient caries lesions much more effectively
      than when the components therein are utilised individually or
      separately. The fluoride source provides fluoride ions for forming
      fluorapatite, whilst the hydroxyapatite can provide both the
      calcium and phosphate ions, and the chlorine dioxide kills the
      bacteria forming the plaque. Use of this composition substantially
      elnriinates the plaque and facilitates the uptake of Ca&lt;2+&gt;,
      P04&lt;3"&gt; and F&lt;"&gt; ions into the tooth structure and
      enables remineralisation to occur. The effect of the composition
      is further enhanced when employed in combination with physical
      brashing of the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the apatite is based on the
      formula M5(P04)3X, wherein M may be Ca, Sr, Zn or Mg, and X may be
      F, CI or OH. Specific apatite compounds used in accordance with
      the invention may therefore include, but are not limited to,
      substituted or unsubstituted hydroxyapatites, substituted or
      unsubstituted fluorapatites, or substituted or unsubstituted
      hydroxycarbonated apatites, such as calcium hydroxyapatite,
      strontium hydroxyapatite, calcium hydroxycarbonated apatite,
      strontium hydroxycarbonated apatite, calcium fluorapatite,
      strontium fluorapatite, mixed strontium/calcium apatites or a
      mixed hydroxyfluorapatite, zinc substituted hydroxyapatite, zinc
      carbonated hydroxyapatite, zinc fluorapatite, or octacalcium
      phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      The stabilised chlorine dioxide solution may have a concentration
      in the range of between about 0.05% to about 2.0% (w/v) in the
      oral care composition, typically between about 0.075% to about
      1.0% (w/v), more typically between about 0.10% to about 0.5%
      (w/v), still more typically between about 0.12% to about 0.2%
      (w/v), and/or may have a pH or be buffered to a pH of between
      about 6.0 and about 8.0, typically between about 7.0 and about
      8.0.<br>
      <br>
      When the composition is to be used as toothpaste formulation, the
      source of fluoride ions may have a fluoride ion concentration of
      between about 300 ppm and about 1500 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      When the composition is to be used as mouth wash or oral rinse
      formulation, the source of fluoride ions may have an active
      fluoride ion concentration of between about 5 and about 500 ppm.
      By 'active' fluoride ion concentration is meant the amount of
      fluoride ion that is free and available for reaction and
      involvement in the remineralisation process. Depending upon the
      fluoride ion source used, this may be less than the total fluoride
      ion concentration in the overall oral composition.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided in accordance with the present invention is the use
      of a stabilised chlorine dioxide solution in combination with a
      source of calcium ions, a source of phosphate ions and a source of
      fluoride ions, to generate gaseous chlorine dioxide within the
      oral cavity without the use of extra oral sources of
      acidification. The calcium ions and phosphate ions may be provided
      together by an apatite species as detailed hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the apatite may be present in an
      amount of from about 0.5 to about 30 weight percent of the oral
      care composition. Alternatively, or in addition, the apatite may
      have a particle size distribution such that at least about 3% of
      the mass of the particles have a size less than about 5 microns
      and where the apatite has a crystallite size of less than about
      200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the apatite may
      be present in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 25 weight
      percent of the composition. Alternatively, or in addition, the
      apatite particle size distribution may have at least about 15% of
      the mass of the particles below about 5 microns and where the
      apatite crystallite size is from about 30 to about 50 nm.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the apatite may be present from
      about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of the composition.
      Alternatively, or in addition, at least about 50% of the mass of
      the particles may have a particle size less than about 5 microns.<br>
      <br>
      The composition of the invention may also contain other components
      selected from one or more of a solvent, a thickening agent or
      viscosity modifier, an abrasive, a flavour, an aromatic component,
      a humectant, a sweetener, a carrier, a remineralising agent, a
      film forming agent, a buffering agent, a cooling agent, a pH
      adjusting agent, an oxidizing agent, and a colorant. Exemplary
      such compounds which may be added to the composition of the
      invention may include, but are not limited to, glycerol, water,
      hydrated silica, cellulose gum, trisodium phosphate, sodium
      saccharin, mentha extracts, citric acid, limonene, linalool, and
      titanium dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment of the mouth wash or oral rinse
      foraiulation of the invention, this formulation may also comprise
      a linear polysaccharide polymer with a high yield value that
      exhibits pseudoplastic flow to stabilise the HA in suspension.
      Typically, a linear polysaccharide gum where one or more hydroxyl
      groups on the monosaccharide is substituted with a functional
      group that comprises a carboxyl group (R-COOH), an acyl group
      (RCO-) or a sulphate group (R-OS03&lt;"&gt;) is used. Examples of
      such types of substituted polysaccharide include, but are not
      limited to, algin, xanthan gum, gellan gum and carrageenan.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided in accordance with the present invention is the use
      of an oral care composition in the cleaning of teeth and mucous
      membranes of the oral cavity of a subject, perfuming them or
      protecting them in order to keep them in good condition, change
      their appearance or correct unpleasant odours.<br>
      <br>
      A second aspect of the invention deals with dentine
      hypersensitivity. Dentine hypersensitivity is felt when nerves
      inside the dentin of the teeth are exposed, and results in pain
      associated with mechanical stimuli, such as that caused by the
      intake of hot or cold foodstuffs into the mouth. This typically
      affects more than 40% of the population. It is a result of fluid
      flow in exposed open dentinal tubules that results in pressure
      changes that trigger nerve transmission within the pulp chamber of
      a tooth. Dentinal tubules become exposed as a result of three
      causes:<br>
      <br>
      i) Gingival recession where the gums recede exposing the dentine;<br>
      <br>
      ii) Loss of the enamel as a result of caries or acid erosion; or<br>
      <br>
      iii) Loss of the enamel as a result of abrasive wear accompanying
      tooth brushing.<br>
      <br>
      Treatment generally involves sealing or blocking the dentinal
      tubules. This is often achieved using specialised toothpastes that
      are designed to occlude the dentinal tubules. The dentinal tubule
      openings are typically about 2-5 microns in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      One way these tubules can be blocked is to precipitate a material
      onto the surface over the top of the tubules. Another approach,
      i.e. that used by the present invention, is to have particles
      comparable in size to the openings of the dentinal tubules, so the
      particles are able to enter into the tubules and occlude them. It
      is important that there are sufficient particles of the required
      size present to give effective numbers penetrating the dental
      tubules.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided in accordance with the present invention is an oral
      care composition as defined herein above in the remineralisation
      of teeth or in the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is
      provided a method of cleaning teeth and mucous membranes of the
      oral cavity of a subject, or perfuming them or protecting them in
      order to keep them in good condition, comprising applying an oral
      care composition as defined hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the apatite may be present in an
      amount of from about 0.5 to about 30 weight percent of the oral
      care composition. Alternatively, or in addition, the apatite may
      have a particle size distribution such that at least about 3% of
      the mass of the particles have a size less than about 5 microns
      and where the apatite has a crystallite size of less than about
      200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the apatite may
      be present in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 25 weight
      percent of the composition. Alternatively, or in addition, the
      apatite particle size distribution may have at least about 15% of
      the mass of the particles below about 5 microns and where the
      apatite crystallite size is from about 30 to about 50 nm.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the apatite may be present from
      about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of the composition.
      Alternatively, or in addition, at least about 50% of the mass of
      the particles may have a particle size less than about 5 microns.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided by the present invention is a toothpaste comprising
      an oral care composition of the invention as defined hereinabove.
      The apatite species in the toothpaste, such as a nano-crystalline
      hydroxyapatite, comprises small crystallites having a size of less
      than about 100 nm and a large surface area to facilitate
      dissolution. However, the larger particles which can occlude the
      dentinal tubules comprise many hundreds of crystallites aggregated
      together to form an approximately spherical particle with
      dimensions in the range 0.1 to 5 microns, and thus are similar in
      size to the openings to the dentinal tubules.<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 summarises the particle size data from a range of
      nano-crystalline hydroxyapatites in terms of the D10, D50 and D90
      values which represent the volume fractions below the specified
      values. It can be seen from the particle sizes in the Table that
      they are of a similar size to the openings to the dentinal
      tubules, and are therefore able to occlude dentinal tubules. <br>
      <br>

      </b>Figure 1 shows a scanning electron micrograph of open dentinal
      tubules. One way these tubules can be blocked is to precipitate a
      material onto the surface over the top of the tubules. This is
      shown in Figure 2, which depicts a material (in this instance,
      Colgate ProRelief) over the top of the tubules. As can be seen,
      not many of the openings of the tubules are blocked.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 shows a scanning electron micrograph of acid etched
      dentine, i.e. a molar tooth cut through the mid coronal section,
      which has been acid etched using 6% citric acid for 2 minutes. The
      tubules are clearly visible. The scanning electron micrograph in
      Figure 4 shows these same tubules after a composition according to
      the invention comprising 7.5 wt% hydroxyapatite has been applied
      to the tooth. It can be seen that the dentinal tubules are
      substantially blocked by the particles in the composition, thus
      preventing the fluid flow through the dentinal tubules and
      minimising pain for the subject.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 5, the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite, it can be
      seen that the smaller fluoride ion sits in the centre of the
      Ca(II) triangle, while the hydroxyl ion is displaced slightly
      above the plane of the triangle of Ca(II) ions.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 6, there is a comparison between the X-ray powder
      diffraction patterns of a nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA)
      and of a larger microcrystalline hydroxyapatite. It can be seen
      that the diffraction pattern of the nHA shows pronounced line
      broadening compared with that of the microcrystalline
      hydroxyapatite. Using Sherrer line broadening analysis, the nHCA
      has a crystallite size of 30 to 50nm.<br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The method of manufacture of a typical toothpaste formulation
      according to the invention may be carried out in accordance with
      the following procedure:<br>
      <br>
      To a vessel, purified water BP is added and stining commences.
      Sodium saccharin, trisodium phosphate and sodium
      monofluorophosphate are added and allowed to dissolve. Glycerin
      and cellulose gum are premixed thoroughly and added to the main
      vessel using high shear mixing. Hydrated silica, hydroxyapatite
      and titanium dioxide are added and mixed under high shear until a
      smooth homogenous paste is created. The vessel has a jacket which
      is cooled with chilled water to ensure the contents remain below
      40°C.<br>
      <br>
      Menthol, peppermint oil BP &amp; spearmint oil BP are premixed in
      a separate vessel to create the flavour blend. This is
      subsequently added to the paste in the main vessel with mixing.<br>
      <br>
      Chlorine dioxide 5% solution (proprietary blend) is added to the
      paste with mixing, and the pH of the paste is adjusted to comply
      with the specification using a citric acid/purified water BP
      premix and adequate stirring.<br>
      <br>
      The final toothpaste formulation contains 1250 ppm of chlorine
      dioxide, 10900 ppm of sodium monofluorophosphate (which equates to
      1428 ppm of fluoride in the monofluorophosphate, calculated by
      using the respective atomic and molecular weights of fluorine and
      sodium monofluorophosphate, which are 19 and 145, respectively),
      and 75000 ppm of hydroxyapatite. Example 2<br>
      <br>
      The method of manufacture of a typical oral rinse or mouth wash
      formulation according to the invention may be carried out in
      accordance with the following procedure:<br>
      <br>
      To a vessel, purified water BP/EP is added and is heated to 8o°c
      (±5°C). The water is then stirred and recirculated through an
      in-line high shear homogeniser.<br>
      <br>
      Kelcogel HA (high acyl content gellan gum - a polysaccharide
      consisting of glucose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid repeat units
      and with a substituent glycerate moiety on every glucose unit and
      an acetate moiety on every second glucose moiety) and Cekol 4000
      (a carboxymethyl cellulose polymer, used to minimise flocculation
      and aid bioadhesion) are pre-mixed in glycerol to wet-out. The
      glycerol containing the pre-mix is then added to the hot water.
      The resultant mixture is stirred and homogenised for 15 minutes
      before cooling.<br>
      <br>
      When the temperature of the water reaches &lt;65°C, sodium
      monofluorophosphate is then added to the vessel, followed by
      sodium citrate, tridsodium citrate and sodium saccharin. The
      introduction of Na&lt;+&gt; ions to the mixture causes the high
      acyl content gellan gum to thicken and form a fluid, highly mobile
      gel. The mixing and homogenising is continued.<br>
      <br>
      When the temperature of the mixture in the vessel reaches
      &lt;55°C, hydroxyapatite is added. The stirring and homogenising
      is continued until the mixture is fully dispersed and free from
      lumps. The homogeniser is then turned off and the mixture is
      stirred as it cools further.<br>
      <br>
      In a separate vessel, a flavour pre-mix is prepared by adding
      polysorbate 20, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, Frescolat MGA and
      Coolmint FL72627. These components are mixed thoroughly until a
      clear solution is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      When the temperature of the mixture in the vessel reaches
      &lt;40°C, sodium benzoate is added, and is allowed to fully
      dissolve with mixing. The flavour pre-mix is then also added to
      the main vessel, and the mixing continues.<br>
      <br>
      When the temperature of the mixture in the vessel reaches
      &lt;35°C, chlorine dioxide solution is added. The homogeniser is
      turned back on and the mixture is allowed to mix and homogenise
      for at least 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Citric acid is then added, and the mixture is allowed to mix for a
      further 15 minutes, to ensure that the pH of the product is
      8.0-8.5. The homogenising and stirring then ceases, and the
      resultant product is protected from exposure to sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      The final mouth wash or oral rinse formulation contains 1250 ppm
      of chlorine dioxide, 5000 ppm of sodium monofluorophosphate (which
      equates to 655 ppm of fluoride in the monofluorophosphate, again
      calculated by using the respective atomic and molecular weights of
      fluorine and sodium monofluorophosphate), and 50000 ppm of
      hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      One of the key aspects of the present invention is the use of
      chlorine dioxide combined with the use of an apatite and fluoride.
      The chlorine dioxide role in the formulation is to remove plaque
      and biofilm from the tooth surface and particularly from exposed
      dentine surfaces; this serves to open the dentinal tubules and
      facilitates the subsequent occlusion of the dentinal tubules by
      the apatite particles. Conventionally, in laboratory studies of
      dentinal tubule, occlusion of mid coronal sections of human molars
      this is achieved using 6% citric acid or 35% orthophosphoric acid.
      Chlorine dioxide fulfils the same purpose within the toothpaste or
      oral rinse.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7a shows an SEM of a mid-coronal section of a human molar
      treated with 6% citric acid for 2 minutes to open the dentinal
      tubules then painted with a 2.5% solution of mucin, a common
      salivary protein, air dried and then followed by a stabilisation
      treatment with 10% formalin solution. The process was repeated to
      produce a water stable protein biofilm. It can be seen (Figure 7b)
      that following treatment the tubules are occluded with the
      biofilm. A toothpaste based on Table 2, but where the occluding
      agent in the formulation, hydroxyapatite, is replaced by silica
      powder was then applied to the tooth surface for 2 minutes,
      followed by rinsing with distilled water. It can be seen (Figure
      7c) that the chlorine dioxide in the toothpaste breaks down the
      protein layer and opens the dentinal tubules. However, it must
      also be noted that the silica added to replace the hydroxyapatite
      in the toothpaste acts in a negative manner to partially occlude
      some of the dentinal tubules. Application of formulations without
      the chlorine dioxide failed to result in opening of the dentinal
      tubules.<br>
      <br>
      One of the key aspects of the invention is the ability of the
      apatite to work in conjunction with a source of fluoride to
      promote ren ineralisation. This is particularly important with
      regard to replacing lost tooth mineral due to acid erosion,
      incipient caries, or to promote the conversion of the apatite
      occluding the dentinal tubules to more durable fluoridated
      apatite. This is illustrated by two techniques:<br>
      <br>
      i) Surface micro-hardness measurements, since an increase in
      mineral content results in an increase in hardness; or<br>
      <br>
      ii) Direct evidence of the formation of the formation of
      fluoridated apatite using &lt;19&gt;F solid state nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy using enamel slices and associated weight
      changes and fluoride measurements. Quantification of the Enamel
      Remineralisation by Micro-hardness Test<br>
      <br>
      Studies were carried out according to the following experiment
      protocol. Fifteen human molars were collected, disinfected,
      embedded in resin, polished down to reveal longitudinal section
      and finished with 1 micron diamond paste. Enamel hardness was
      evaluated using a microhardness tester (Duramin-l/-2; Struers,
      Copenhagen, Denmark) with a Vicker's indenter (a square pyramid
      diamond shape indenter) under a load of 50 g for 15 seconds. 10
      indentations per sample were taken. The two diagonal indentation
      lengths were measured and then used for microhardness calculation
      using the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      F 1.85 F<br>
      HV<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;where F is in kilogram-force (kgf) , A is the area of the
      point of the indenter, and d is the average length of the diagonal
      left by the indenter in millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      The teeth specimens were demineralised in a demineralisation
      solution (pH = 4.5, 50 mM acetic acid to mimic an acidic challenge
      during a caries attack) and the hardness was then again measured.<br>
      <br>
      The toothpaste of the invention was then applied to the tooth
      surface and the hardness again measured. Figure 8 shows the
      hardness values. Following the acid challenge the hardness
      decreases significantly, but increases significantly after
      exposure to the toothpaste providing clear evidence of

      <b>F MAS-NMR Study of the Fluorapatite Formation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Caries-free first molar and premolars were collected and stored in
      3% sodium hypochlorite solution for 24 hours. Teeth were mounted
      in acrylic resin, and sliced using an annular diamond blade
      (Microslice 2, Malvern Instrument, UK) to get enamel sections
      (approximately 6 x 5 1 mm&lt;3&gt;). Excess dentine area was
      removed by polishing against P600 silicon carbide paper.<br>
      <br>
      The enamel blocks were then rinsed off with de-ionized water,
      dried in air for 30 minutes and weighed using a digital
      microbalance. Each enamel section was immersed in 50 ml acetic
      acid solution (0.1 M, pH = 4.0) and agitated at a rate of 60 rpm
      in a 37°C incubator (KS 4000 I control, IKA) for 24 hours. The
      enamel specimens were then immersed in the toothpaste according to
      the invention, Ultradex Toothpaste (diluted 1 :10 with acetic acid
      solution (pH = 4.0) to give a 0.1M final solution, to mimic the
      real mouth situation), or in the mouth wash according to the
      invention, Ultradex Recalcifying and Whitening Oral Rinse
      treatment solution (diluted 1 :2 both with 0.2 M acetic acid
      solution (pH = 4.0) to mimic the real mouth situation), placed
      back in the incubator, and agitated at a rate of 60 rpm for 96
      hours. After treatment, the enamel blocks were cleaned, dried and
      weighed. The enamel weight loss was presented in percentages.
      Enamel samples (no treatment, 24 hours demineralised and
      demineralization followed by the treatments) were ground to powder
      using a vibratory mill (MM200, Glen Creston Ltd, UK) with a 25 ml
      zirconia grinding jar for 15 seconds under 20 Hz. The powder was
      then used for solid-state NMR experiments using the 600 MHz (14.
      IT) Bruker spectrometer. The &lt;19&gt;F solid state NMR
      measurements were run at the resonance frequency of 564.7 MHz with
      a 2.5 mm rotor spun at 18 and 21 kHz. Spectra were obtained by
      overnight scans with 8 preliminary dummy scans and 60 seconds
      recycling delay. The chemical shift was referenced using the
      signal from the 1M NaF solution scaled to -120 ppm relative to the
      CF3C1 primary standard.<br>
      <br>
      The NMR. spectra showed flat lines for both the non-treated enamel
      sample and the demineralised enamel sample (Figures 9 and
      10).Therefore, there was no fluoride detected for both samples.
      This indicated that no significant fluoride was present in the
      original tooth samples. The spectra were then run for the
      toothpaste and oral rinse samples. The toothpaste with both HA and
      monofluorophosphate (MFP) showed the presence of fluorapatite with
      a chemical shift of -103 ppm, the position being almost identical
      to the chemical shift of the fluorine in fluorapatite (-102 ppm),
      as did the toothpaste with MFP alone treated samples. The HA
      toothpaste alone gave a very small signal close to that of
      fluorite, which was probably present in the original tooth. The
      oral rinse treated enamel sample showed a broad peak centered at
      around -103 ppm, This demonstrates that after demineralisation
      treatment, the Ultradex Recalcifying and Whitening Toothpaste and
      Oral Rinse treatment of the invention led to fluorapatite
      formation. The reference spectrum for the fluorapatite was based
      on synthetic pure fluorapatite, which demonstrates a distinct
      sharp peak with a chemical shift at -102 ppm. The apatite that
      comprises the tooth enamel is a solid solution formed rather than
      stoichiometric. It could contain different ions such as Magnesium
      (Mg ) and Manganese (Mn&lt;2+&gt;) substituted for Ca&lt;2+&gt;,
      fluoride (F&lt;"&gt;) substituted for hydroxyl (OH&lt;"&gt;), and
      carbonate (C03 &lt;"&gt;) substituted for phosphate (P04
      &lt;"&gt;). The crystal structure is therefore distorted. With
      demineralisation and subsequent remineralisation, the fluorapatite
      crystals formed could therefore be slightly disordered. This may
      explain why the spectrum for the Ultradex Recalcifying and
      Whitening Toothpaste and Oral Rinse of the invention treated
      enamel showed broader peaks when compared with the fluorapatite
      reference. Fluoride promotes remineralisation and the fluorapatite
      formed is more acid resistant compared with the hydroxyapatite and
      carbonated hydroxyapatite. However, high concentrations of
      fluoride with insufficient phosphate ions may result in the
      formation of the undesirable calcium fluoride phase.<br>
      <br>
      An Ultradex Recalcifying and Whitening Oral Rinse/mouth wash of
      the invention contains 660 ppm F&lt;"&gt; in the form of
      monofluorophosphate, with a 1:2 dilution, the total available
      F&lt;"&gt; was 330 ppm. However, the actual available F&lt;"&gt;
      detected by a fluoride selective electrode (ORION 9609BN PH/ISE
      meter model 710 A, USA) (Figure 11) was only 24.5 ppm. The
      F&lt;"&gt; after the remineralisation was 19.5 and this gave an
      F&lt;'&gt;loss of 5 ppm. This further confirms fluoride is being
      incorporated into the apatite.<br>
      <br>
      The weight loss of the sample toothpaste specimens are given in
      Figure 12. Both MFP and HA acted to reduce weight loss and enamel
      demineralisation. However the biggest reduction in weight loss was
      found for the Ultradex Recalcifying and W tening Oral Toothpaste
      treatment (z. e. the composition of Table 2). This indicates that
      the fluoride acts synergistically with the HA to inhibit
      demineralisation and promote remineralisation.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the scanning electron micrograph in Figure 13 clearly
      demonstrates that a tooth specimen that is treated over a period
      using the mouth wash of the invention - in this case over 1 day,
      with 4 lots of 2 minutes' worth of treatment with the mouth wash,
      followed by the remineralisation - achieves the aim of
      successfully occluding the dentinal tubules, and thus reduce
      dentine hypersensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 14, it can be seen from the graph that there is a
      reduction in fluid flow through dentinal tubules following tooth
      brushing with a toothpaste according to the invention, thus
      indicating that the tubules have been successfully blocked by the
      action of the fluoride in the remineralisation process. This is a
      test that is routinely used as a measure of the efficacy of a
      hypersensitivity toothpaste.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in summary, it can be seen that the composition of the
      invention provides technical advantages over existing formulations
      lacking any one of the defined components. Application to the
      surface of teeth of formulations containing no chlorine dioxide
      results in a failure to break down the biofilm and open up the
      dentinal tubules to be filled, as illustrated in relation to
      Figure 7c above. Application of formulations containing no
      hydroxyapatite (i.e. a source of both calcium and phosphate ions)
      and using another component instead results in the opened tubules
      being undesirably partially occluded, thus Mndering their
      refilling during the remineralisation process, and thus hindering
      the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity. Finally, it is clear
      that formulations lacking any fluoride ion source would not be
      able to provide any remineralisation of the tooth at all.<br>
      <br>
      It is of course to be understood that the present invention is not
      intended to be restricted to the foregoing examples which are
      described by way of example only.<br>
