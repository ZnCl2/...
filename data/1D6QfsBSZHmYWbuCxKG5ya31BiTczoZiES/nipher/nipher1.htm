      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A new theory as to
          gravitation will be announced soon before the St. Louis
          Academy of Sciences by Professor Francis E. Nipper, retired
          head of the Department of Physics of Washington University.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It will be shown that
          gravitational attraction between masses of matter not only has
          been diminished into zero, but has been converted into
          repulsion which is more than twice as great as normal
          attraction."</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">New Gravitation Theory ~</font></i>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Professor Nipper made his
          experiments with bodies suspended horizontally toward each
          other. By introducing electricity into the atmosphere he
          converted normal attraction into repulsion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If electricity can alter
          the gravitational attraction of the bodies used in my
          experiments," he said, "the same force can alter the earth's
          attraction. If the negative electricity could be drawn from
          the earth's surface, gravitational attraction suddenly would
          cease and the cohesion of the earth's surface would be
          disastrously affected."</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Is it possible to nullify,
          and further to even reverse, the effect of gravity by
          electricity? This scientific conundrum seems about to be
          solved, at least to a certain extent. To begin with, everybody
          is familiar with that law of physics which states that "all
          particles of matter attract each other with a force which is
          greater the nearer the particles are together", and to be
          still more definite, Newton's law says that bodies behave as
          if every particle of matter attracted every other particle
          with a force that is proportional to the product of their
          masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
          distance between them. It is the gravitational attraction
          between the earth and the bodies upon it which causes the
          latter to have weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This fact is often lost
          sight of and should be well understood by every student. To
          make the matter more clear let us imagine that a man's body is
          (as by flying, jumping, diving from a high point, etc.) for
          the moment separated from the surface of the earth. As soon as
          the mass of the body is separated from the earth,
          gravitational attraction is set up between the two masses. The
          earth pulls the man's body, and also his body pulls the earth,
          but as the mass of the earth is infinitely greater, its
          movement cannot be detected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The scientists of today
          believe that in some mysterious way the minute electrical
          charges existing on the particles making up molecules and
          atoms are definitely linked up and concerned with such basic
          phenomena as gravitation. Since all bodies are made up of
          atoms it would seem to logically follow that the forces of
          gravity must depend in some way upon attractions which atoms
          exert upon each other, and due to the fact that the atoms are
          separated, at least in solids and liquids, by extremely small
          distances, we might expect these inter-atomic forces to be
          relatively more powerful than are those of ordinary
          gravitation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Until recently, however, the
          mystery linking this inter-atomic activity with the force of
          gravitation baffled all attempts at solution, although many
          scientists had tackled it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But at last experimental
          proof has been forthcoming through the untiring labors of
          Professor Francis E. Nipher, of the St. Louis Academy of
          Science. In a pamphlet issued November 8, 1917, Prof. Nipher
          supplies experimental evidence that gravitational attraction
          can not only be suspended or nullified by the electrical
          current, but it actually can be transformed into
          "gravitational repulsion"!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All during the summer of
          1917, Prof. Nipher had his apparatus in almost continuous
          operation, and the experiments have been repeated time and
          again, always with the same result.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prof. Nipher's mechanical
          apparatus resembled that used in the "Cavendish experiment",
          by which it was first experimentally proved that Newton's law
          of universal gravitational attraction applied to small bodies
          in their action upon each other at short distances, just as
          well as it did to small terrestrial bodies under the influence
          of the earth. This apparatus consists of a delicate torsion
          suspension fiber (<b><a href="#n1fig3">Figure 3</a></b> &amp;
          <b><a href="#n1fig4">Figure 4</a></b>), a light, rigid arm at
          the lower end of the fiber suspension, and at either end of
          this bar two small lead spheres of known mass. Two equal large
          balls of solid lead are placed close to the small suspended
          spheres in the manner shown. Now, remembering our law of
          physics stated above -- that every body in space attracts
          every other body proportionally to their respective masses and
          inversely as the distance between them -- then it is evident
          that when this apparatus is set up, that the small suspended
          spheres will be slightly attracted by the larger, stationary
          balls. This condition is represented in <b><a href="#n1fig1">Figure



              1</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before connecting any form
          of electric current to the modified Cavendish apparatus, Prof.
          Nipher took special precaution to carefully screen the moving
          element from any electrostatic or electromagnetic effects. His
          apparatus briefly consists of two large lead spheres ten
          inches in diameter, resting upon heavy sheets of hard rubber.
          Two small lead balls, each one inch in diameter, were now
          suspended from two silk threads, stationed at the sides of the
          two large lead spheres, from which they were separated by a
          little distance. Moreover, the suspended balls were insulated
          elaborately from the large spheres by enclosing them first
          airtight in a long wooden box, which was also covered with
          tinned iron sheets as well as cardboard sheets. There was,
          furthermore, a metal shield between the box and the large
          metal spheres. The large metal lead spheres now exerted a
          certain gravitational pull upon the suspended small lead balls
          as indicated in <b><a href="#n1fig1">Figure 1</a></b>, and
          the small lead balls were slightly pulled over towards the
          large spheres.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In his first experiments
          Prof. Nipher applied a high tension current from a static
          machine to the large lead balls (<b><a href="#n1fig2">Figure 2</a></b>).



          No difference was noted whether the positive or negative
          terminals were applied. In one of these experiments the masses
          were "repelled" (normal gravitational attraction had been
          nullified and changed to repulsion) by a force nearly twice as
          great as the initial gravitational repulsion. The effect is
          shown in <b><a href="#n1fig3">Figure 3</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In further experiments Prof.
          Nipher decided to check his results. To do this he replaced
          the large solid lead spheres with two metal boxes, each filled
          with loose cotton batting. These hollow boxes (having
          practically no mass) rested upon insulators. They were
          separated from the protective screen by sheets of glass and
          were grounded to it by heavy copper wires. The metal boxes
          were then charged in every way that the solid lead spheres had
          been, but not the slightest change in the position of the lead
          balls could be detected. This would seem to prove conclusively
          that the "repulsion" and "gravitational nullification" effects
          that he had produced when the solid balls were electrically
          charged were genuine and based undoubtedly on a true
          inter-atomic electrical reaction, and not upon any form of
          electrostatic or electromagnetic effects between the large and
          small masses. If they had been, the metal boxes, with no mass,
          would have served as well as the solid balls.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another interesting
          experiment was conducted with low frequency alternating
          current applied to the large lead spheres. Spring contact
          brushes were fastened to the wooden blocks supporting the
          large spheres as shown in <b><a href="#n1fig4">Figure 4</a></b>,
          one brush on either side of the ball. This permitted sending
          current through the ball from one side to the other. First, a
          direct current of 20 amperes as sent through the two large
          masses, but no effect on the suspended masses could be
          detected. Next, an alternating current of 20 amperes was sent
          through the two masses (See <b><a href="#n1fig4">Figure 4</a></b>),
with
the




          result that the gravitational attraction was quickly reduced
          to zero, and not only that but in 15 to 20 minutes the small
          lead spheres had moved over one-half as much to the opposite
          direction as the distance they had been attracted originally
          towards the large masses. Thus gravitation had not only been
          completely nullified, but it was actually reversed.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In former papers above
          referred to, an experimental study of explosive effects due to
          a discharge from a large condenser through a small lead wire
          was discussed. The wire was sealed within a glass tube filled
          with coal oil. This work has been continued in a modified
          form. Four quarter ampere wire fuses of lead were placed in
          multiple across a gap, 5 cm in length in a line leading from
          either terminal of an influence machine to a water-pipe
          system. The other terminal was grounded on a gas pipe. The
          lead wires were clamped between the leaves of two small brass
          door hinges, one lead of each hinge being soldered to one of
          the ends of the rods at the gap. Between the gap in which the
          leaves were mounted and the ground was placed a large battery
          jar filled with 4 liters of a solution of common salt. The
          wire was parted at this point, and the ends were immersed in
          this solution which thus formed part of the ground circuit.
          One of the wires penetrated the liquid to a depth of about
          half a cm. Between the gap in which the wires were mounted and
          the machine was a spark gap, between knobs of equal radius.
          The condenser consisted of 40 large sheets of glass (36 x 36")
          having upon them 2 x 40 sq ft of tinfoil. The machine was
          driven by a single-phase electric motor. Below the lead wires
          a sheet of white paper was laid upon a plate of glass.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was found that there was
          a marked difference between the effect of the positive and the
          negative discharge, or the compression wave, would cause the
          lead wire to fuse and drop in hot globules upon the paper
          below. The effect upon the paper is shown in Plate XLIV,
          Figure 1. [Not available]</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the same adjustment,
          the positive discharge3 causes the lead wires to rise in a
          cloud of dust. If the paper were placed 3 cm below the wires,
          it would usually be practically unaffected when the positive
          discharge was used. In a few cases, as in Figure 2, it was
          slightly discolored by the lead fumes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course the discharge
          could be made greater, so that either discharge would cause
          the lead to be dissipated in a cloud. It could be made less,
          so that fused metal would fall upon the paper when the
          positive terminal was connected with the ground containing the
          wire. In all cases the cloud effect was the more marked in the
          case of the positive discharge, and the fused metal falling
          upon the paper was less marked.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In case of the positive
          discharge there is of course a heat effect. Part of the result
          is due to this cause. But if we are to consider the positive
          terminal as an exhaust terminal, into which the negative
          electrons are suddenly drained and thence into the positive
          sheets of the condenser, we may explain the result as an
          explosive condition which is suddenly impressed upon the lead.
          When deprived of negative corpuscles, each atom repels every
          other. The negative term in question (1) has become very much
          greater than positive, when applied to inter-atomic attraction
          under these conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The negative discharge,
          which is to be regarded as a compression wave could not give a
          super-charge to atoms within the wire, causing them to repel
          each other. The super-charge is on the outside of the wire.
          The one-fluid theory seems to furnish a more rational
          explanation of these phenomena than the two-fluid theory, as
          in the case in the phenomena of the Crookes tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some work has been done in
          the examination of the effect of the electrification of air
          within a glass vessel, upon the pressure of the air on the
          walls of the containing vessel. A large 3-necked Wolff's
          bottle was used, the 3 openings being provided with rubber
          stoppers which had been treated with vacuum wax. The bottle
          had a volume of 9.6 liters. Through the central stopper was
          passed a copper wire to which were attached 150 pins whose
          heads were soldered to one of its faces. This many pointed
          terminal could be placed directly in front of either of the
          large knobs of the machine, at a distance of 10 cm, the other
          knob, or terminal, being grounded.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A U-shaped water gauge was
          mounted in another stopper of the flask. In the third stopper
          of the flask a tube with a bulb containing calcium chloride
          was mounted, this tube being provided with means for
          connecting the confined air with the outer air. The condensers
          were wholly removed from the machine. The glass bottle was
          placed upon a sheet of heavy plate glass.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the discharge-knobs of
          the machine were near enough together so that the brush
          discharge between them was accompanied by faint disruptive
          effects, the pressure within the flask could be increased by
          about 2 gr-wt per sq cm, the effect of the negative
          electrification being somewhat greater than that of the
          positive.&nbsp; When the knobs were far enough apart to
          prevent disruptive discharges, no luminous effects being
          observed within the flask, the change in pressure due to
          either terminal was reduced to 1 and 2 mm as shown by the
          water gauge. After the pressure due to electrification of the
          air had reached a final limit, a transfer of the may pointed
          collector of the front of the other terminal, would result for
          a time in a slow decrease in pressure, and then in a slow
          increase to the former limit. The decrease in pressure did not
          begin until the discharge from the other terminal had begun.
          Heat effects had been practically eliminated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the gas contains moisture
          a permanent decrease in pressure at once results, due to
          condensation of vapor upon the sides of the vessel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These results seem to
          indicate that there is an electrical condition of the gas, for
          which the Boyle-Gay-Lussac constant is at a minimum. When this
          condition is reached, the second term of equation (1) is zero,
          as applied to molecules of gas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An attempt has been made to
          determine whether or not the value of the gravitational term
          of Eq. (1) can be affected by electrical action, when the
          effect represented by the final term is eliminated. The
          apparatus used was a modified form of that used by Cavendish.
          The suspended masses consisted of 2 lead tubes, each being
          about 15 cm length, each having a mass of 50 grams. They were
          mounted around the ends of a bras tube 91 cm in length, and
          having a mass of 30 gr. This tube was suspended upon 2 loosely
          twisted threads of silk fibers, 180 cm length, whose distance
          apart was approximately 0.4 cm, the twist was removed from
          these threads by hanging upon each a mass of 65 grams. This
          formed a very sensitive bifilar suspension. The suspended
          masses were wholly surrounded by a metal shield of rectangular
          form 10 x 12.5 cm in cross section. The suspension fibers were
          enclosed in a metal tube, having a torsion head at the top,
          thus providing means for properly adjusting the position of
          the brass tube. The ends of the rectangular shield were
          provided with metal caps, fitting closely into its ends. They
          entered the shield a distance of 2.5 cm. An opening at the
          middle of the shield, in front of a mirror mounted upon the
          suspension wire, served for observation of position by means
          of a telescope and scale. This opening was covered by a sheet
          of glass which was sealed to the shield by means of sealing
          wax. The window was covered with a metal wire screen having
          about 5 wires per running cm. The mirror was observed through
          this wire screen, the telescope being focused upon the scale
          at the telescope. A change of one scale division represented a
          change of 2.36 minutes of arc in the position of the suspended
          tube. The suspended masses and the brass tube on which they
          were mounted were surrounded by sheets of asbestos paper,
          which fitted into the caps at the ends of the shield, and
          fitted loosely the interior of the shield. These two linings
          formed extensions of the end caps and were intended to prevent
          a convection of the air within the shield.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The larger masses each
          consisted of two 50-pound weights placed one upon the other
          and mounted upon heavy columns of rubber. They were separated
          from the metal shield by a space of about 2 cm. In this space
          was placed a sheet of paper and 3 layers of asbestos paper.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The shield was mounted upon
          a heavy piece of timber and rested directly upon a sheet of
          glass. It was also wrapped with asbestos paper. The long
          suspension tube was held in stable position by 3 heavy silk
          cords attached to surrounding cases, and loaded with a series
          of distributed masses varying from 50 to 100 grams each. The
          metal shield was loaded with two 10-pound masses of iron and
          its sides were clamped with wooden clamps in order to quiet
          any vibrations in the shield. The large iron masses and the
          metal shield were connected with each other by large copper
          wires, leading to a spark-knob mounted upon a massive table.
          The floor of the room was of reinforced concrete. The
          discharge terminal was connected with the influence machine in
          an adjoining room, by means of brass rods hung upon silk
          cords. The machine was operated by a synchronous electric
          motor. The discharge knobs at the machine were separated so
          that no disruptive discharges were possible. One terminal of
          the machine was grounded. There were no condensers on the
          machine terminals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The time interval of a to
          and from vibration of the suspended masses was 485 seconds.
          When at rest there appeared to be no disturbance of any kind.
          The reading would sometimes remain constant for hours. At
          other times the reading slowly changed. It often varied
          throughout a day through 20 scale divisions. It was found that
          the large masses appeared to attract the suspended masses with
          a varying force, even when the former were hung from the
          ceiling above. Sometimes they appeared to repel the suspended
          masses. These varying effects were finally traced to very
          moderate changes in the temperature of the room. It was found
          that the flame of a wax candle, placed 14 inches from either
          of the suspended masses, exerted a marked apparent attraction
          for them. When a sheet of glass and two sheets of asbestos
          paper were placed between the candle flame and the metal
          shield, it being provided with a wrapping of asbestos paper in
          addition to the inside lining of the same material, an
          apparent attraction resulted. Fluctuations in the flame of the
          candle due to the condition of the wick produced observable
          effects. When the outer wall of the screen was rising in
          temperature more rapidly on one side of the suspended mass
          than on the opposite side, this mass moved towards the warmer
          side. This was apparently due to the convection effect of air
          within the lining of the metal screen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The suspended rod bearing
          the small masses was below the central axis of the enclosing
          shield. If one side of the shield was warmer than the opposite
          side the suspended rod would be in a slowly drifting current
          of air, which would urge it towards the warmer side of the
          screen, or away from the colder side. The temperature of the
          large masses lagged behind that of the screen in the small
          daily changed in the temperature of the room.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The effect of a noiseless
          discharge from the pin-point terminal into the air around the
          knob connected with the screen and the large masses, was to
          produce an apparent decrease in the attraction of the large
          masses for the suspended masses. This result was obtained when
          no trace of disruptive discharge could be detected. After the
          extreme displacement thus produced had been reached, the
          distance between the pin-point terminal, and the knob
          connected with the shield and the large masses, was increased
          from 15 to about 90 cm, the charged bodies being then
          grounded. This was done by means of a fine wire attached to an
          insulated rod, which could be laid upon the floor of the room,
          or lifted into contact with a rod, one end of which rested
          upon one of the large masses. The pin-point terminal was
          meantime made to face another grounded conductor. The
          suspended masses then swayed to the other extreme position
          during the next four minutes. By a repetition of this
          operation, the arc of vibration could be increased from 1 or 2
          scale divisions to 26 in the interval of an hour. The average
          of the extreme readings of consecutive vibrations, usually
          showed slow progressive changes of 2 to 5 scale divisions per
          hour. Sometimes the average reading showed a decrease and
          sometimes an increase. The results were of the same order of
          magnitude whether the masses were connected with the negative
          or with the positive terminal of the machine, although most of
          this work has been done by the positive "discharge".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was suspected that this
          result might be due to a slight rise in the temperature of the
          walls of the metal shield. If this were the case it must be
          assumed that while the gap at the pin-point terminals was
          least, the rise in temperature was least in that part of the
          sides of the metal screen facing the large external masses.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to examine this
          influence, a delicate air thermometer was extemporized. The
          bulb consisted of an oil-can having a capacity of 4.5 liters
          (1 gal). Connected by a rubber hose with the nozzle of the can
          was a horizontal tube of glass, having a length of 75 cm and
          an internal diameter of 0.76 mm. Within this tube was a short
          column of water, serving as an index. The entire device was
          insulated upon glass supports. A candle flame 20 inches
          distant from the can was electrified and in electrified
          contact with the large masses and shield, no change in the
          position of the index column could be detected when observed
          by means of a telescope.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The large masses were then
          wholly enclosed in two metal boxes, from which the masses were
          insulated. The masses rested upon rubber blocks placed upon
          the bottom of the boxes, and each box was mounted upon rubber
          blocks which rested upon plates of glass. The masses were in
          the same position as in the work described above. The boxes
          were separated from the shield, enclosing the suspended masses
          by the plates of glass and the asbestos paper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two metal boxes and the
          metal shield were then electrified precisely as has been done
          before. It was then found impossible to increase the arc of
          vibration of the suspended masses, although the operation was
          continued for several hours. If the former results had been
          due to heat effects, they should have produced the same
          results in this case. The large masses were removed from the
          enclosing boxes. The empty boxes and screen were then
          electrified as before.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No change in the amplitude
          of vibration could be produced.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These results seem to
          indicate clearly that gravitational attraction between masses
          of matter depends upon their electrical potential due to
          electrical charges upon them. To assume a special case, such
          as exists when the gravitation constant is being determined,
          Newton's law holds only when the common potential of the two
          bodies is such that their gravitational attraction for each
          other is at a maximum. If the two masses are not separated by
          a metal shield and their common potential is that of the
          earth, these masses and their common potential is that of the
          earth, these masses will repel each other by a force
          represented by the final term in Eq. (1) and the value of <i>K</i>
          will also be diminished, if the above conclusions are correct.
          If the two masses are separated by a metal shield, this final
          term will be eliminated, but the value of <i>K</i> will be
          diminished and may seem to be variable, if there are local
          variations in the potential of the earth. By adjusting the
          potential of the attracting masses by well known means we may
          hope that the real value of <i>K</i> and the absolute
          potential of the earth may be determined. This is a problem
          for the future to solve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the work discussed in
          this paper an effort has been made to eliminate heat effects
          from all sources. It may be that alternating discharges from a
          high potential transformer would produce more marked effects
          than have been observed by the methods above described. The
          surging of negative electrons within the large attracting
          masses would be greatly increased. This would also involve
          heat disturbances, the effect of which would cast a doubt upon
          the results. Under the conditions in which this work was done
          the amplitude of vibration of the suspended masses sometimes
          changed in a way that seemed to discredit the above
          conclusions. It was finally found that variations in the
          illumination of clouds in the northern sky produced marked
          effects upon the position of the suspended masses. The
          apparatus was fifteen feet distant from five large windows in
          the north wall of the room. The variation in radiation from
          such clouds was occasionally followed by a marked change in
          the amplitude of consecutive vibrations. After such
          disturbances and others not here referred to had been
          eliminated, there still remained distinct evidence that the
          value of the gravitation constant as it has been determined,
          is dependent upon the electrical potential of the attracting
          masses, when the effect represented by the final term in
          equation (1) is wholly eliminated by a metal screen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Plans are now being prepared
          which will, it is hoped, result in a determination of the
          change which can be produced in the value of the gravitation
          constant, by electrification of the larger masses.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(*1: <i>Trans. Acad. of

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"These results seem to
          indicate clearly that gravitational attraction between masses
          of matter depends upon electrical potential due to electrical
          charges upon them."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Every working day of the
          following college year has been devoted to testing the
          validity of the above statement. No results in conflict with
          it have been obtained. Not only has gravitational attraction
          been diminished by electrification of the attracting bodies
          when direct electrical action has been wholly cut off by a
          metal shield, but it has been made negative. It has been
          converted into a repulsion. This result has been obtained many
          times throughout the year. On one occasion during the latter
          part of the year, this repulsion was made somewhat more than
          twice as great as normal attraction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The large masses used in
          this work were spheres of lead ten inches in diameter. They
          were mounted upon blocks of dry wood, which were mounted upon
          caster-roller bearings. The wheels rested upon heavy sheets of
          hard rubber. The suspended masses were two spheres of lead,
          having a diameter of one inch, mounted upon the ends of a
          brass tube. Their distance apart, from center to center, was
          91.5 cm. They hung upon two untwisted threads of silk fibers,
          forming a bifilar suspension. The length of the threads was
          179 cm, and the distance between them was about 3.4 mm. Near
          the top of the long metal cylinder enclosing these suspension
          fibers, was a lateral brace formed of two bars of hard rubber,
          about 30 cm in length. The ends of these bars formed a right
          angle against which the vertical suspension cylinder was
          pulled. These rubber bars formed the ends of two long bars of
          wood attached to the tops of instrument cases along adjoining
          sides of the room. The bars were also supported by a framed
          structure. Silk cords attached to the cases ran along the two
          bars and were tied to the suspension cylinder. Weights
          distributed along these cords served to hold the cylinder
          against the ends of the rubber bars. Vibrations of the
          suspension cylinder were thus wholly eliminated. The torsion
          head forming the top of the cylinder was provided with a rod
          which extended radially outward to a distance of about 20 cm.
          By this means the torsion head could be turned in order to put
          the suspended masses into vibration. The top of the suspension
          cylinder had a similar rod clamped to it having an upward
          projecting stop, by means of which the torsion head could be
          returned to the original position. Change in the temperature
          of the air within the shield resulting in a change in volume
          was provided for by the outflow or inflow around the torsion
          head.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The enclosing case was of
          the general form used by Cavendish. In the early part of the
          year it was formed wholly of metal. It rested upon insulating
          blocks of rubber, which were mounted upon two long pieces of
          timber having a cross section of 4x4 inches. These timbers
          rested upon a massive table, which was on a floor of
          reinforced concrete within a building having granite walls. At
          the central part of the metal shield the dimensions were 5x5
          inches. A narrow slit on one side covered by a small plate of
          glass sealed to the shield, served for observing the movement
          of the suspended masses by means of a telescope and scale. At
          the outer ends of the shield, the lateral dimension was about
          15 inches. This form was chosen in order that the suspended
          masses and the brass tube upon which they were mounted could
          be inclosed by a cylinder of copper wire gauze, between which
          and the outer screen was very loosely packed cotton fiber. A
          thin layer of cotton was placed at the ends of the screen,
          being also held in place by wire netting. This was designed to
          diminish convection effects.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The body of the observer was
          wholly below the level of the table. Radiation of heat from
          the head to the screen was cut off by sheets of heavy
          cardboard.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two rooms used for this
          work were wholly disconnected from the heating system of the
          building. During the day the temperature of the large masses
          was usually slightly lower than that of the shield around the
          suspended masses. This temperature difference never exceeded
          1.5 C.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The large masses were placed
          at the ends of the screen or shield in line with the rod upon
          which the small masses were mounted, in order to determine
          their effect upon the time of vibration of this bifilar
          pendulum. The large masses and screen were in direct metallic
          connection, and the air around them was electrified by a
          discharge from pin-points. A disc armed with 150 pins was
          placed with the pin-points 4 cm. from each of the large
          masses. A noiseless discharge was delivered from the points of
          the pins.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On a former occasion, when
          the bifilar suspension different, it was found that placing
          metal vessels containing a liter of water having a temperature
          of 28 C. at the beginning of the experiment, and 24 at the
          close, in positions occupied by the large masses, the
          temperature of the air and shield being 13,8, the value of <i>T</i>
          was increased&nbsp; from 644.2 sec. to 652.5. The warm vessels
          were in contact with the shield.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the metal vessels
          contained water and ice, temperature of the air and shield
          being 12.0, the value of <i>T</i> was decreased by 25
          seconds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These results seem to
          indicate clearly that convection of the air within the shield
          had no material effect upon the values of the quantities used
          in computing the value of <i>n</i> in Eq. 4.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It apparently follows that
          the value of the gravitational constant was made negative by
          the process described. Attraction was converted into a
          repulsion. The influence machine was unusually active by
          reason of fresh dry material in the case in which it was
          enclosed. On other days the value of <i>G</i> was decreased
          by 16, 23, 27, 69, 77, 134 and 184 per cent of its initial
          value. It is not claimed that these are results of any high
          degree of precision. During the first week while the bifiar
          method above described was being tested, the time of vibration
          during a period of two hours was found to be very constant.
          For example, in the first determination made on October 23,
          the mean position of the suspended masses was determined from
          readings of the extremes for several vibrations. The key was
          then snapped for six readings while the mean reading passed
          the cross-hair of the telescope. The mean reading was
          determined in each case by a computation from previous
          readings. It was found to be very constant. After lunch the
          same operation was repeated. This gave six readings of the
          time interval of 7 complete to and fro vibrations, with data
          for determining the probable error of the mean. The result was
          653.45 +- 0.062 seconds. The probable error was sometimes
          three times as great as the above value and the mean value
          varied from the above value on other days by between one and
          two seconds. An error in the value of n might amount to three
          or four per cent. The cause for the variations proved to be a
          difficult problem. The silk threads were very loosely wound,
          and before they were put in place a weight equal to half the
          weight of the entire suspended mass was hung upon each of them
          for several days. They then seemed to be in permanent
          condition. The breaking stress was about five times that which
          was thus applied to them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The causes for the variation
          in the time of vibration were thought to be possibly due to a
          breaking of some of the fibers in the threads which might
          result in an entanglement between the two threads, or which
          might result in an unequal division of the load between them.
          It&nbsp; was sought to eliminate the former source of error by
          applying vaseline to the threads. This did not appreciably
          change the result. It was finally decided to check the results
          above described by placing the large masses on alternate sides
          of the suspended masses and observing the deflection doe to
          gravitational attraction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to maintain
          equality of stresses in the two threads, which had been hung
          around a hook attached to the torsion head, they were hung
          around a pulley, having a diameter of one inch. Below were two
          adjustable pulleys. The threads approached each other around
          these two pulleys, and their distance apart could be so varied
          as to make the threads parallel within the suspension
          cylinder. The metal shield before described was replaced by
          one having equal width from end to end. The top, bottom and
          ends were of wood 1/8 inch in thickness. A sketch of this wood

          applied by means of a hot iron. The entire device as thus
          described was then enclosed by a metal shield. A cross section

          upon the insulated rods by metal hooks. At one end this line
          of rods terminated in a disc of metal upon which 150 pins were

          drop in the reading at 11:20 that the reading would begin to
          decrease. The upper diagram of this plate shows results
          obtained on May 4. Here the positive terminal was first
          applied at 9:35&nbsp; a.m. The terminals were reversed at
          10:24 and the machine was stopped at 11 :20, the readings
          being continued to 12:05 p.m. In this work the conductors upon
          which the 800 pins were supported were directly connected with
          the large masses and shield.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When direct contact was made
          between the pin-conductors and the large masses, the changes
          took place more rapidly than when the air surrounding the
          masses was supercharged with negative corpuscles emitted from
          the pin points, or when the reverse action took place, this
          alone being depended upon to change the potential of the
          masses. The most interesting feature of this work is the
          complete elimination of the possibility that the apparent
          decrease in the attraction between these masses was due to the
          convection currents of air resulting from heat effects.
          Reversing the terminals would not reverse the heat effects.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The possibility that one
          terminal of the machine produced greater heat effects than the
          other, the deflecting effect being decreased when the terminal
          producing the lesser heating effect was applied is also
          eliminated. It matters not which terminal is first applied.
          The result is the same, and has been obtained many times.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the afternoon of May
          4 the operation represented in the upper curve of Plate XLV
          was repeated, the positive terminal being first applied. A
          result of precisely the same kind was obtained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The upper curve of <b><a
              href="#n3plate">Plate XLV</a></b> also means that the
          gravitational attraction between the masses at 9:35 a.m. had
          been decreased by about 110% at 10:10 a.m. Gravitational
          attraction had been decreased to zero, and had then been
          converted into a repulsion. An hour later it had regained its
          initial value. On the afternoon of June 1, 2:30 p.m., it was
          decided to change the electrical condition of the suspended
          masses. One of the end caps forming the outer metal shield of
          Figure 2 was removed. A hole which had been bored through the
          wood frame, and which had been closed by a rubber stopper, was
          opened. A glass tube was passed through the opening, about two
          centimeters beyond the inner surface of the wood frame. A
          copper wire to the end of which the head of a pin had been
          soldered, was passed through the tube, the point of the pin
          projecting slightly beyond the end of the tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wire was about six
          inches in length. The apparatus was arranged as shown in <b><a
              href="#n3fig3">Figure 3</a></b>. The positive terminal of
          the machine was used in draining negative corpuscles from the
          air within the shield around the suspended masses. A slow
          change of 1.2 cm. or 12 scale divisions in the scale reading
          was produced. The terminal was disconnected when this
          deflection had been produced and the machine was stopped. The
          tube was removed, the end cap of metal was replaced and the
          large masses and shield and the pin-point conductors were
          grounded until the next day. The mean rending had not been
          appreciably changed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At 10:25 a.m., June 2,
          readings were taken until 10:43 a.m. The suspended masses were
          at rest. The positive terminal was then applied. The result is
          shown in Plate XLVI. The arrangement of the apparatus was that
          shown in <b><a href="#n3fig3">Figure 3</a></b>. A sudden
          decrease in the attraction occurred. It was so sudden that
          forced vibrations were impressed upon the suspended masses.
          The vibrations were small, and only occasional readings of
          consecutive extremes were recorded. At 2:20 p.m. the terminals
          were reversed and at 2:32 p.m. direct contact of the pin-point
          conductors and the large masses and shield was made.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The attraction at once
          increased very rapidly. The absolute zero of potential was
          reached and passed in a less time than that of a
          semi-vibration. Forced vibrations were impressed upon the
          suspended masses as the attraction began to decrease. These
          vibrations were observed, and the extremes were read until
          3:30 p.m. The masses were then being repelled by a force
          nearly twice as great as the initial gravitational attraction.
          Direct contact between the discharge points was removed, but
          the masses were not grounded. On Monday, June 4, at 9:20 a.m.,
          the masses were vibrating over a very small arc (about one
          scale division). Readings were taken at some of the extremes
          of vibration, which were sufficient in number to show that the
          mean reading was constant until 11 a.m. These readings are
          represented in Plate XLVII. The masses were still repelling
          each other, with a force about 50 per cent greater than the
          initial attraction on the morning of June 2. This conclusion
          seemed beyond belief at the time but subsequent results on
          that day seemed to make it a necessary conclusion. At 11:03
          a.m. the positive terminal was applied and direct contact
          between the large masses and the pin-point conductors of <b><a
              href="#n3fig3">Figure 3</a></b> was made. The time is
          represented by the arrow marked +DC on Plate XLVII.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At once the attraction began
          to increase. The masses were swaying in the opposite direction
          at the time when contact was made. A maximum reading was
          obtained at 11:18 a.m. and the masses swayed in the opposite
          direction during the next 14 minutes. Forced vibrations were
          again impressed upon the suspended masses, but they were less
          violent in character than those at the close of the
          observations; represented in Plate XLVI. At 12 observations
          were discontinued until 12:48 p.m., when the reading showed
          only a slight decrease. At 1:00 p.m. the terminals were
          reversed and the direct contact was removed. The conditions
          then were as represented in <b><a href="#n3fig3">Figure 3</a></b>.
          At this time the apparent decrease in the initial attraction
          which existed at the beginning of the observations on June 2,
          was about 340 per cent. In other words the apparent repulsion
          was then more than twice the initial attraction. This
          conclusion seems to be fully justified by the amazing increase
          in the attraction which at once resulted. At 1:53 p.m. direct
          contact between the pin-point conductors and the shield and
          large masses was made by dropping a wire into position. It was
          removed at 2:02 p.m. Forced vibrations were again impressed
          upon the suspended masses. The machine was stopped at 2:19
          p.m. and I was called away for an bour. A few readings taken
          between 3:12 and 3:22 p.m. shown at the close of Plate XLVII
          indicate that the attraction had then approached closely to
          the initial value on the morning of June 2.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will of course be
          understood that no attempt has been made to secure results of
          precision in this work. The only aim has been to determine
          whether or not it would be justifiable to construct the much
          more expensive apparatus which will be required for such
          results. The suspended masses must be capable of being
          electrified independently and the enclosing walls must
          surround them in symmetrical form, so that their inductive
          action will not produce deflection of the surrounded masses.
          If they are suspended in highly rarefied air, it may be
          necessary to use a metal wire rather than a quartz fiber,
          which must then be attached to an insulated torsion beam. A
          modified form of the apparatus used by Boys will be required.
          The necessity for such a construction seems to be justified by
          the evidence already obtained, that if the potential of either
          of the attracting masses M and m' is zero absolute,
          gravitational attraction between them will not be affected by
          varying the potential of the other mass. The gravitation,
          constant as it has been determined by methods which made use
          of some form of the Mitchell-Cavendish apparatus, would have a
          maximum value when either or both of the masses had a
          potential of zero absolute.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Neglecting the inductive
          effect which electrified masses have upon each other, it is
          possible that the amended equation for gravitational
          attraction between them is:</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="n3form5.jpg" height="48" width="237"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It seems possible that the
          effect of the charges Q and Q' upon gravitational attraction
          between the masses m and m' may be a surface effect. If so the
          values of Q and Q' may be replaced by RV and R'V', where R and
          R' are the radii of the two masses and V and V' their
          potentials due to those charges.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above equation may also
          be written:</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="n3form6.jpg" height="47" width="235"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here it is assumed that the
          masses are so electrified as to diminish their normal
          attraction for each other by n per cent. From these two
          equations the values of m and m' being replaced by their
          values in terms of volume and density.</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="n3form7.jpg" height="44" width="258"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If this equation really
          represents the conditions imposed upon the masses, it appears
          that for any given decrease in gravitational attraction the
          potentials of the masses must be directly proportional to the
          surface areas of the masses. Small planets having high and
          perhaps varying potentials might not follow Newton's law. The
          value of <i>n</i> would be large and variable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the work represented in
          Plate XLVI, if we assume that when n was l00, the attraction
          between the masses being reduced to zero, the potential of the
          large masses was 30,000 volts, or 100 E.S.C.G.S. units, and
          that of the suspended masses was 10 volts or 1/30 E.S.C.G.S.
          unit, then the last equation would give for <i>K</i>':</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>K</i>' = 165800 <i>K</i></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This result is based upon
          assumptions and estimates. One inference may be drawn from it.
          There is nothing here to indicate that the force whose action
          is represented by Newton's term, should not be the main factor
          in determining the motion of the masses in our planetary
          system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The large masses represented
          in <b><a href="#n3fig1">Figure 1</a></b> were replaced by
          boxes of metal, filled with loose cotton batting. They rested
          upon insulators. They were separated from the screen by sheets
          of glass, and were put in metallic contact ,vith it by means
          of copper wires. Precisely the same treatment was applied to
          this system as was given when the large masses were in place.
          No change in the position of the suspended masses could be
          detected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The large masses being in
          position as before described, spring contact brushes were
          fastened to the blocks of wood upon which the large masses
          rested. They made contact with the large masses at points
          midway between the top and bottom of the spheres. A direct
          current of 20 amperes was sent through the two large masses.
          The axis of the line of flow was in one case practically
          coincident with the line through the centers of gravity of the
          two masses nearest to each other. The direction of flow was
          either from the outside contact, to the one nearest the
          screen, or the reverse, the direction of flow being reversible
          by means of a double switch. The screen was insulated from the
          two large spheres. No effect upon the suspended masses could
          be detected. If any effect was produced it was very small. The
          large masses were turned 90 in position, with a like result.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An alternating current of 20
          amperes was applied. No effect could be detected when the
          masses were in the latter position. When the lines through the
          points of contact with the brushes with the large spheres was
          coincident practically with the line through the centers of
          gravity of the two masses nearest to each other, the
          gravitational attraction was quickly reduced to zero, and made
          negative. When the double switch was opened, so that the large
          masses were wholly separated from the source, and the masses
          were grounded it required between two and three hours for the
          large masses to recover from the shock which they had
          received. This has been repeated many times, with no
          discordant results. It may be that the parts of the large
          spheres which are most affected by the alternating current are
          those parts near the brushes. If there are heat effects, they
          tend to oppose the observed effect. Burning candles replacing
          the large masses cause a change in reading in the opposite
          direction from that of the alternating current, the glass
          plates being removed. This is due to convection currents
          within the screen.</font> </p>

          described, the apparatus used was a modified form of that used
          by Cavendish, as shown in the former paper, published by the
          Academy of Science of St. Louis, Vol. XXIII, pp. 183-185.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wood frame was in this
          case covered with tin-foil, within and without. The sheet
          metal forming the sides of the shield were clamped to the wood
          frame, by bars of wood which were also covered with tin-foil.
          All joints were sealed with wax before the tin-foil was put in
          place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The whole shield was then
          surrounded by two end caps of metal which meet at the middle
          or the shield and are scaled together by means of tin-foil. A
          layer of air was thus formed between the two metal shields
          surrounding the suspended masses. Either of these two metal
          shields was considered ample protection to prevent the
          suspended masses from being acted upon electrically by the
          large masses. The layer of air between the two shields was
          designed to diminish convection effects within the shield due
          to changes in the temperature of the room, and changes in the
          temperature of the air within the room were made as small as
          possible by cutting off all sources of artificial heat. It did
          not usually vary more than 1.5 degrees C. during the day. The
          temperature was determined by means of a thermometer placed
          near the large masses. The reading was by means of a
          telescope. The reading could be made accurately to tenths of a
          degree C and hundredths of a degree could be estimated with
          fair precision. The air within the shield was electrically
          charged by means of a wire armed with a pin which was thrust
          through the end of the shield about an inch above the level of
          the suspended masses, and was sealed in place. The inner end
          of the tube was drawn to a small diameter, being only large
          enough to admit the end of the pin. This could be withdrawn at
          any time and the outer end of the tube could be covered with a
          metal tube which was closed with a metal plug at its outer
          end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Convection effects, due to
          changes in temperature, have been very carefully studied. When
          the masses have not been electrically charged for several
          days, the rise in the temperature of the room during the day
          caused a very slow increase in the scale reading which
          determined the position of the suspended masses. This change
          in position decreases the distance between the suspended
          masses and the large masses. When a door opening into the
          hallway was opened for four minutes this change is larger and
          more abrupt. When an outside window was opened, admitting cold
          air, a sudden decrease in the reading results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The room containing the
          apparatus was always entered from an adjoining room, from
          which heat from the heating system was wholly cut off.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to decrease
          convection effects, the large masses and shield were covered
          on all sides with a pile of cotton batting, forming a layer of
          about 6 to 8 inches thickness. This was permissible by reason
          of the fact that the electric machine in the adjoining room
          was discarded as a source of electricity. It was replaced by
          the earth, which had been found to be equally effective, and
          which has a much greater capacity. The large masses and
          shield, and when necessary, the injection pin were connected
          by wire with a copper lightning rod on the outside of the
          building. This rod formed the ground connection for a steel
          tower used for wireless. Its top was 100 feet above the
          ground. This tower is mounted upon the roof of the physics
          building, the walls of which are red granite. The room
          containing the apparatus is on the second floor of this
          building, and below the tower.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Twelve copper wires about
          ten feet in length were soldered to the lower part of the
          lightning rod, and spread over the ground, their ends being
          injected a few inches into the soil. The wire leading from the
          masses within the building to the rod was also soldered to it.
          Connected with this wire within the room containing the
          gravitating masses were metal rods surrounding the apparatus
          which were hung sheets of metal to which were attached about
          one thousand pins. Small holes were punched through the metal,
          the pins were inserted, and the heads were soldered to the
          metal, This was intended as a means to put all of the air in
          the room in an electrical condition as near uniform as
          possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With such an apparatus a
          determination of the gravitation constant would be utterly
          impossible, the position of the suspended masses changes from
          day to day and from night to day by greater amounts than was
          at any time possible when the plate glass machine was used for
          the electrification of the masses. Their position depends upon
          the weather and upon the moisture in the surface of the earth.
          The changes were often greater than was ever caused by the
          removal or replacing of the large masses. Results obtained on
          December 12 last are alone sufficient to establish the fact
          that enormous local changes in the earth's potential are
          constantly occurring, and that these changes produce
          variations in gravitational attraction between the large
          masses and the suspended masses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On December 5 and 6 over an
          inch of rain and sleet fell, and on December 8 and 9 there was
          a light fall of sleet. The minimum temperature gradually fell
          from 28 on the 5th to 1 on the 10th. The ground was covered
          with a thin layer of ice and snow on the 12th. On that day the
          morning temperature was 20 but rose to 56. The ground around
          the lightning rod between the building and a walk about 12
          feet from the building was very dry, having been shielded by
          the building. During the forenoon the large masses and the
          injection pin for electrification of the air within the shield
          were connected with the lightning rod. Between 8:50 a.m. and
          11:45 p.m. the scale reading decreased very slightly but with
          no vibrations. The temperature of the air around the shield
          increased by 1.5 C. The injection pin was then withdrawn and
          the glass tube was covered with the metal cap. Vibrations of
          the suspended masses at once began. The scale reading varied
          through about three divisions of the scale. This amplitude had
          diminished to about two divisions of the scale at 1:20 p.m.
          The time of a complete vibration was about 9 minutes. The
          frozen ground outside of the walk was then covered with a thin
          layer of water. Eight buckets of water were splashed over the
          ground around the lightning rod, covering the area over which
          the copper wires were spread, this wet area thus formed being
          finally connected with the wet ground beyond the walk. The
          scale reading abruptly diminished during the next three
          vibrations. The change in the average reading was about 80% of
          the change formerly produced by the removal of the large
          masses to a position of no deviation in the position of the
          suspended masses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This determination of the
          deviation, due to the large masses, was obtained before
          electrification of the mass was begun. They were, however,
          then above the surface of the earth, and subject to the
          inductive action of the atmosphere.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The results described in
          this paper indicate that the disturbances here discussed would
          be greatest if the work were done on a barren island, in a
          building above the level of the surrounding water. It is under
          such conditions that the phenomenon known as St. Elmo's fire
          is commonly observed. On land each blade of grass and the
          leaves of trees have a function similar to that of the masts
          of ships provided with lightning protection. They are
          individually less effective, but they are far more numerous.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to eliminate these
          disturbing effects the work should be done in a room below the
          surface of the earth the walls, ceiling and floor being of
          metal. Insulate copper wires within copper tubes should be
          connected with the masses. Those connected with the suspended
          masses should terminate in a cup of mercury. A flexible chain
          of metal attached to the middle of the bar carrying the
          suspended masses, should be provided at its lower end with a
          fine platinum wire, making contact with the mercury surface.
          These protected copper wires should be grounded in a well of
          water. The water in this well must be protected from any
          inductive action of the atmosphere.</font> </p>
