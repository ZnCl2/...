      &nbsp;<br>
      ... On one such evening I had just finished a sign and was
      cleaning the brushes prior to going home when the telephone rang.
      I said, "Hello!" into' it, but there was no response; so I said,
      "Hello!" several times. Still no reply, so I put it down.
      Immediately, however, I had the urge to lift the receiver and
      listen again. I did so, and there was no dial tone; the circuit
      was still disconnected.<br>
      <br>
      I listened for a few moments and was about to replace the receiver
      when I heard a high-pitched buzzing sound coming from it. I put it
      back to my ear, but after a few seconds it stopped. Then I put the
      telephone down and forgot about it.<br>
      <br>
      As I was preparing to lock up I received a sudden and strong
      impulse to remain in the shop. Then almost mechanically I began to
      move about, pick up pieces of wood, other materials, and set about
      con­structing something—just what I didn't know. Whatever I was
      doing, I seemed to be controlled and directed, working as if I had
      a set of blueprints right in front of me and knew exactly every
      move to make.<br>
      <br>
      I set the materials I had assembled on the bench. Using a 24-inch
      plywood base, I drilled a hole halfway through the center. In the
      hole I placed securely the carbon rod of a broken flashlight cell.
      Next I obtained a large nail of like diameter and wound the nail
      with 50 turns of very fine copper wire. When I had slid the
      finished coil off the nail, the unwound ends of wire remaining
      measured about eight or 10 inches. I soldered two extra
      connections: one from the top and one from the bottom; two of the
      ends were connected to a small pen flashlight battery. I stapled
      some of the wires to the plywood base to hold the assembly in
      position. <br>
      <br>
      Next I took the small brass cap off the larger flashlight battery
      cell and glued it in the exact center of a 10-inch aluminum disc,
      which had been put on the jig-saw and placed in a balanced
      position directly on top of the carbon rod. I do remember
      definitely that four ends of the wire pointed at the edges of the
      disc directly opposite each other in the form of a cross, and
      approximately one-eighth of an inch from the edge of the disc. All
      of the equipment was set up in accordance with an imaginary shape
      of a pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      Then I made two connections at the bottom of the apparatus, which
      apparently completed the circuit—for the disc immediately was
      en­veloped by a bluish, spinning light! Then, to my utter
      amazement, it rose from the platform, crashed through the 12-foot
      ceiling, which was made of aluminum paper, apparently bounced off
      the peak roof and then came down again through the same hole
      through which it had made its ascent!<br>
      <br>
      It crashed with more force than the weight of the aluminum would
      normally permit, almost completely destroying itself so far as
      recon­struction of that particular model was concerned.<br>
      <br>
      I was so surprised and shocked I sat down in complete silence and
      thought for several minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Did the electrons which came from the small battery start
      some­thing in the atmosphere in the form of some type of energy
      which took over, once the machine had been "primed"? The small
      amount of power from the battery surely never could have moved the
      object in any way. angely-sveta.ru<br>
      <br>
      I was too shaken to do any more work that night, but the next
      morn­ing I tried to duplicate the experiment,—without success. I
      just couldn't remember where I had been apparently shown to make
      the various connections. Later I was able to duplicate the
      experiment to the extent that the disc glowed; but never did it
      move. I am writing this with the hope that some open-minded
      physicist or electronics engineer will, in my brief account above,
      detect a key which will open the door to some type of free primary
      energy which the space people say is avail­able all around us,
      waiting to be tapped...<br>
      <br>
      ... One of my latest experiments involved a thing people have
      called impossible—a "one-pole magnet." The minute someone says
      some­thing is impossible, I am presented with a challenge, as I
      was in this case.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Does a magnet with only one pole refute Newton's third law of
      mo­tion, which states that every force or every action produces an
      equal or opposite reaction? Whether or not it does, many witnesses
      saw me demonstrate the "one-pole magnet" during a recent lecture,
      sponsored by Dr. Alfred Smith of The Space Seekers Society in
      Philadelphia.<br>
      <br>
      As with the so-called free energy motor, a series of these magnets
      have turned a small direct current generator and lighted a small
      flash­light bulb. In my opinion, this is an example of harnessing
      a free energy to impart work of its own accord, generating a
      secondary energy in the form of what we term electricity or
      electrons, which, in turn, pro­duces light energy or heat.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic phenomena in the form of what we call attraction is not a
      pull, but a push from a surrounding unseen funnel of magnetic
      vor­tex enveloping this planet, which in itself represents a
      balance of mo­tion in the form of imbalance which continually
      seeks an equilibrium —an effect presenting itself as secondary
      energies seen and unseen, originating from a Cause Unseen which is
      Infinite...<br>

      ...Howard Menger once advertised plans for a "perpetual motion
      machine" consisting of a flywheel and a ring magnet on an axis,
      with an external horseshoe magnet straddling the magnet via its
      repulsive field. The horseshoe magnet was free to swing a little
      within the limits of a spring keeping it in place. The swinging
      horeshoe magnet and spring once again act like a random trigger
      factor keeping a magnetic system going... <br>
