            ( Air to Water Harvest )</span> technology extracts the
          humidity in air and converts it into liquid water. &nbsp; A2WH
          is a new generation of solar powered atmospheric water
          generator device (AWG) which are also known as water maker
          devices (WM) and Water Air Extraction Devices (WAED).
          &nbsp;&nbsp; A2WH uses a revolutionary patent pending solar
          heat design which does not require refrigeration.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This allows A2WH to operate cost effectively directly from
          renewable energy and makes A2WH ideal for off grid deployment,
          remote cabins, islands and other locations where electricity
          is abnormally expensive. <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> ... A2WH has designed a patent pending solar
          thermal powered system which is fundementally different than
          common refrigeration based units. The A2WH design allows allow
          us to absorb moisture from relatively dry air with a much
          lower energy cost.&nbsp; We use solar heat which keeps the
          energy costs low.&nbsp;&nbsp; A major difference is that we
          can condense at ambient which eliminates the need for
          refrigeration which is the big electricity consumer in most
          other WAED units. </div>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="indent1" align="left">This
        allows A2WH to be deployed in large scale and to provide much
        lower operational costs. These combine to make A2WH scalable
        from a few liters per day through millions of gallons. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="indent1" align="left"> A2WH
        requires full sun exposure. This means it must be installed
        outside in areas without significant shade. </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left"> With a single acre
        of land the A2WH A2WH units can produce in the range 1,000 to
        2,500 gallons per day of water without having any impact on the
        local water company or drawing any power from the local utility
        company...<br>
        <br>
        ...The A2WH A2WH units do not impact the local ground water and
        they are using a resource that is completely renewable so there
        is no risk of running out in the future...<br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">A2WH Product Overview</big></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">The A2WH system
        produces pure potable water from air using only solar energy.
        &nbsp;It operates with a much lower operating cost than other
        AWG systems because it does not require large amounts of
        electricity.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">The A2WH system absorbs
        moisture at night when humidity is relatively high and converts
        what it absorbed the prior night into liquid water the following
        day using solar thermal heat. Well over 90% of the energy used
        in the system is solar heat.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">In this system all
        condensing occurs at near ambient and it does not require any
        refrigeration. High quality filters are used to filter the air
        before the absorption at night which keeps the interior of the
        system very clean.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">A HEPPA grade filter is
        used for the gas entering the condenser chamber which keeps the
        water quality near surgical grade. The system includes an
        automatic mode where it sterilizes the condensing area on days
        when there is sufficient solar energy to reach pasteurization
        temperatures.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">A small amount of
        energy is delivered by Photo Voltaic panels which operate a
        microcomputer control system, sensors, blowers, pumps, etc...</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left"><big
          style="font-weight: bold;">How does A2WH work?</big><br>
        <br>
        The A2WH system uses a desiccant to absorb moisture from the
        air.&nbsp;&nbsp; The higher the humidity the more water our
        desiccant can absorb per pass which increases
        production.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        We use solar heat to drive both the airflow for the absorption
        process and to provide heat during the regeneration process
        which extracts the moisture from the desiccant and allows us to
        capture the water in liquid form.<br>
        <br>
        A sophisticated micro controller based sensor system determines
        when to switch between absorption and regeneration
        modes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use different types and amounts of
        desiccants depending on the local conditions to optimize the
        performance of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small
        Photo Voltaic solar panel provides power for the micro
        controller, sensors, various valves,
        etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        We have an optional enhancement that uses wind energy (wind over
        4.5 MPH) to drive circulation at night when the relative
        humidity is higher.&nbsp; &nbsp; To make this work best we
        increase the weight of the desiccant used in the
        system.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some areas with good nightly wind this
        allows the unit to work in areas with daytime humidity as low as
        10%&nbsp; We have optional enhancements which allow electric
        fans and heaters to augment or replace the solar heat. <br>
        <br>
        The input air is filtered before it enters the absorption
        chamber where the desiccant absorbs water out of it.&nbsp; The
        air is re-filtered when heated for regeneration.&nbsp; A final
        stage of filtering is used as the air enters the condensation
        phase where the H2O is turned into liquid water.&nbsp; As a
        result the output water is very pure.&nbsp;&nbsp; We still
        recommend treatment&nbsp; using a NSF 54 grade filter prior to
        consumption because we do not have any control over the
        cleanliness of the storage tank....<br>
        <br>
        <big style="font-weight: bold;">Our difference from common
          market units.</big><br>
        <br>
        Most Air to water systems use refrigeration to chill air to the
        dew point that means that as the dew point drops the more the
        unit must do more work to sufficiently chill the
        air.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This causes them to use large amounts of
        electricity. &nbsp;It is fairly common for electric units to
        consume of 2.2Kwh per gallon produced which gives them a high
        variable operating costs which can exceed 40 cents per gallon. <br>
        <br>
        We designed A2WH units to operate entirely from solar
        energy.&nbsp; This is mostly solar heat with a small amount of
        solar electricity used to operate valves,&nbsp; sensors and the
        electronic control system.&nbsp; This allows our system to
        operate much more efficiently which is especially important in
        areas where electricity is expensive such as islands where
        electricity is generated using imported fuels.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Most AWG systems are built around a refrigeration system which
        is very similar to that used in small electric air
        conditioners.&nbsp; The best units consume 600 to over 3,000
        watt hours per gallon of water they produce. &nbsp; &nbsp; The
        industry average trends&nbsp; show&nbsp; consumption over 2,2000
        watt hours per gallon which rise rapidly as humidity drops.
        &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        A2WH functions with no external electricity.&nbsp; This saves
        3,000 watts per gallon. Our novel design and control system
        allows it to efficiently extract water in a wide range of
        conditions including conditions where electric AWG units become
        inefficient or do not work at all.<br>
        <br>
        Our units can reduce carbon emissions by over 5 pounds of carbon
        per gallon produced as compared to grid powered electric
        systems.&nbsp; (2.2 pounds carbon per KWh saved *&nbsp; 3000
        watts per gallon = 6.4 pounds of carbon per gallon&nbsp; of
        water).&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a small 6 gallon per day system this
        adds up to nearly 11,000 pounds reduced carbon emissions per
        year. <br>
        <br>
        Our system uses solar thermal heat to harvest water from air
        even when the air has low humidity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike radiant
        condensation systems this system actually produces during the
        dry months even when there is no dew and it's production can go
        up in windy locations which can prevent radiant chilling systems
        from working at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our technology can work in
        conditions where the dew point is far below the chilling level
        delivered by radiant chilling panels. <br>
        <br>
        Our most important difference is the compatibility of the core
        design for scaling efficiently into millions of gallons per day
        at a reasonable cost. &nbsp; It's other major benefit is
        compatibility with remote areas where grid power is either
        unavailable or expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some areas our units
        can be installed in mountains outside of towns and provide both
        water pressure and electricity for the town.&nbsp; Rather than
        exaggerate summer power shortages our system can actually help
        reduce these shortages. <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> The present
        work suggests a non-conventional method of water production from
        atmospheric air, on a 24-h basis using a compact system. The
        operation of the system is described and its efficiency is
        defined. The system performs under forced convection absorption
        and regeneration through a packed tower. The packed tower
        consists of two identical columns, each of them is packed with
        an identical bed. Each bed consists of vertical multi-layers of
        cloth material impregnated with calcium chloride solution of
        different concentrations. A numerical model, based on the
        experimental results, has been developed to predict the
        performance of the system under various operating conditions.
        The system efficiency is found to have peak values at certain
        cycle times, desiccant final concentration, regeneration
        temperature and absorption air stream velocity. It is also found
        that the maximum efficiency increases with initial concentration
        and decreases with the increase of the regeneration air stream
        velocity and absorption temperature.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> A method
          and apparatus for removing moisture from within an electronics
          enclosure is provided. In particular, dehumidification is
          accomplished by removing air from the enclosure, cooling the
          air thereby causing condensation of water vapor from the air,
          then heating the dehumidified air and returning the heated and
          dehumidified air to the enclosure. A single heat pump provides
          cooling and heating functions, effectively recouping heat
          extracted from the air to be cooled, and transferring the
          extracted heat to the air prior to its return to the
          enclosure. In this manner, electronics within the enclosure
          may be operated at temperatures below the dew point of ambient
          air surrounding the enclosure, without requiring a thermally
          insulated enclosure. Devices are provided to collect and purge
          condensate from the system, either in a continuous or periodic
          manner.; Embodiments employing conventional vapor compression
          cycle heat pumps and thermoelectric heat pumps are described.
          A defrost cycle is provided to eliminate frost that may
          accumulate on the heat exchanger associated with the heat pump
          normally cold element. Defrost is accomplished by reversing
          heat pump polarity, heating the normally cold element. Control
          mechanisms and logic are provided to automate system
          operation. In preferred embodiments, dehumidification and
          defrost modes are activated by a controller monitoring the dew
          point within the enclosure, and the air pressure at the
          normally cold element. Dehumidification is performed
          intermittently, when the enclosure dew point exceeds a set
          point. Substantially sealing the enclosure against ingress of
          ambient air reduces the system's operational duty cycle.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The present invention relates, in general, to the removal of
          moisture from within an electronics enclosure, and in
          particular to a method and apparatus employing a single heat
          pump to dehumidify and thermally condition the air within an
          electronics enclosure. <br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of Related Art
          </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Electronic devices, which are cooled to below ambient
          temperatures and which operate in an environment in which
          water vapor is present, are subject to condensation problems
          which may cause corrosion and short circuits. It is therefore
          desirable to remove water vapor from the environment in which
          electronic devices operate. While corrosion and short
          circuiting may be caused by water vapor within the environment
          surrounding the electronic devices regardless of the device or
          environment temperatures, the problems intensify for devices
          operating at lower temperatures, as water vapor may begin to
          condense on the cooled surfaces of the electronic devices. <br>
          <br>
          As is known, CMOS circuit performance may be improved by
          reducing the temperatures at which the circuits operate, i.e.
          the chip junction temperature. As the chip junction
          temperature decreases, however, the outer surface temperature
          of the chip package also decreases. The package outer surface
          includes the electrical interconnections between the package
          and the next level of assembly, such as a board: the
          temperature of these interconnections also decreases as chip
          junction temperature decreases. Heat transfer through these
          electrical interconnections, therefore, decreases board
          temperatures. As chip junction temperatures decrease further,
          eventually the temperature of one or more portions of these
          exposed surfaces (package outer surface, interconnections, and
          board) falls below the dew point temperature of the ambient
          atmosphere surrounding the components. At this point,
          condensation forms on the module and board surfaces, including
          electrical interconnections, unless preventive actions are
          taken. Therefore, dehumidification is highly desirable for
          environments containing electronic devices operating at
          temperatures below ambient dew point. <br>
          <br>
          Two basic approaches have been taken to eliminate condensation
          on cold module surfaces: maintain the external module surfaces
          at temperatures above room ambient dew point, or condition the
          atmosphere within the enclosure such that its dew point is
          lower than the electronic components' external surface
          temperatures. <br>
          <br>
          The first method, maintaining module surface temperatures
          above dew point, may be accomplished by providing sufficient
          insulation around each module, such that the external surface
          temperature of the insulation remains above room ambient dew
          point. This approach is discussed in a United States patent
          application entitled "Inflatable Sealing System for Low
          Temperature Electronic Module," Ellsworth et al., Ser. No.
          09/360,727, having a filing date of Jul. 27, 1999, assigned to
          the same assignee as the present application and hereby
          incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and which is
          not admitted to be prior art with respect to the present
          invention by its mention in this Background Section. As the
          chip temperature decreases, however, more insulation is
          required around each module to maintain external surface
          temperatures above the dew point. At some point, as chip
          temperatures are decreased far below dew point, it may also be
          necessary to provide auxiliary heaters at the external
          surfaces of the insulation in order to maintain the module
          insulation surface temperature above the dew point. <br>
          <br>
          The second method, lowering the dew point of air within the
          enclosure below the external surface temperature of the cooled
          modules, prevents condensation without requiring insulation
          around the modules. This approach is discussed in a United
          States patent application entitled "Sub-Dew Point Cooling of
          Electronic Systems," Chu et al., Ser. No. 09/281,135, having a
          filing date of Mar. 29, 1999, assigned to the same assignee as
          the present application and hereby incorporated herein by
          reference in its entirety, and which is not admitted to be
          prior art with respect to the present invention by its mention
          in this Background Section. In order to lower the dew point
          temperature of the ambient atmosphere within the enclosure,
          some method should be employed to remove moisture from the
          atmosphere within the enclosure, preferably providing the
          ability to further remove the moisture from within the
          enclosure itself. Further, in order to decrease the burden on
          the moisture removal device, it may be desirable in some
          applications to provide an enclosure that is at least somewhat
          sealed against entry of ambient air. While sealing the
          enclosure may not be required in all applications, a well
          sealed enclosure requires less frequent (i.e. lower duty
          cycle) operation of the moisture removal device than would be
          required in a poorly sealed enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          Depending upon the specific application and the moisture
          removal method used, the enclosure air temperature may be
          lowered as a byproduct of the moisture removal process. The
          temperature reduction may be caused by reduced heat transfer
          between enclosure air and ambient air, as a result of
          partially sealing the enclosure against ingress of ambient
          air. Heat transfer from ambient air to enclosure air tends to
          mitigate the effect of heat transfer from the enclosure air to
          the cooled surfaces within the enclosure. Alternatively, the
          temperature reduction may be caused by the use of a cold heat
          exchanger to dehumidify the enclosure air. For some
          applications, the presence of other mitigating factors may
          maintain the enclosure air temperature within acceptable
          limits. For other applications, however, continued system
          operation may result in enclosure air temperatures below room
          ambient dew point, eventually causing the temperature of the
          enclosure outer surface to drop below room ambient dew point,
          resulting in the formation of condensation on the enclosure
          outer surface. <br>
          <br>
          In such applications, two methods have been employed in the
          art to prevent condensation from forming on the external
          surfaces of the enclosure. One method involves insulating the
          enclosure, such that the external surface remains above
          ambient dew point. A second method involves the use of an
          auxiliary heater to heat the enclosure air. <br>
          <br>
          For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for methods and
          devices capable of preventing the formation of condensation on
          the cooled surfaces of electronic components, without
          insulating the electronic components or the enclosure. There
          is, therefore, a need for methods and devices capable of
          removing water vapor from the atmosphere within an electronics
          enclosure and further from the enclosure itself, without
          lowering the temperature of the atmosphere within the
          enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus
          for conditioning the air within an electronics enclosure,
          without external condensation, and without the need to
          insulate the enclosure or to provide an auxiliary heat source.
          Toward this end, a recuperative environmental conditioning
          unit is proposed which dehumidifies the air within the
          enclosure by causing the air to pass over a heat exchanger in
          thermal contact with the cold element of a heat pump, and
          reheats the air prior to returning it to the enclosure by
          causing the air to pass over a heat exchanger in thermal
          contact with the hot element of the same heat pump. In this
          way, moisture is removed from the air within the enclosure,
          eliminating the need for insulation around the electronic
          components. Since the dehumidified air is warmed prior to
          returning to the enclosure, the enclosure temperature remains
          above the room ambient dew point temperature, eliminating the
          need to insulate the enclosure. Further, since the air is
          heated by the hot element of the heat pump, no auxiliary heat
          sources are required. By using the same heat pump to cool and
          heat the enclosure air, the heat extracted during cooling is
          recouped. Finally, the conduit forms a sump or collection
          area, from which the condensate is purgeable to the external
          environment. <br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment of the present invention, a closed loop air
          conduit is formed beneath the electronics enclosure. A heat
          pump is situated beneath the enclosure, each element of the
          heat pump having a high thermal conductivity path to the air
          contained within a different portion of the conduit. An air
          moving device causes air to circulate from the enclosure into
          an inlet port of the conduit, through the inlet side of the
          conduit, through a sump or condensate collection section of
          the conduit, then through the outlet side and outlet port of
          the conduit, and finally from the outlet port back to the
          enclosure. Within the inlet side, the air flows through a heat
          exchanger in thermal contact with the normally cold element of
          the heat pump, cooling the air and causing moisture to
          condense on the normally cold heat exchanger. Within the
          outlet side, the air flows through a heat exchanger in thermal
          contact with the normally hot element of the heat pump,
          heating the air prior to its return to the enclosure. As
          condensate collects on the normally cold heat exchanger, it
          falls from the heat exchanger and is collected in the sump
          portion of the conduit. A mechanism, such as a valve or a
          wick, which allows periodic removal of the condensate is
          disposed near the bottom of the sump. A mechanism such as a
          baffle is provided within the enclosure to cause air entering
          the enclosure from the conduit outlet port to circulate around
          the enclosure before reentering the conduit inlet port. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment of the present invention, the
          recuperative environmental conditioning unit is disposed
          entirely within the enclosure: only the mechanism which
          removes condensate from the sump area, or some portion of this
          mechanism, extends outside of the enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment of the present invention, the heat pump
          device is a vapor compression cycle heat pump. In a preferred
          embodiment, the heat pump is a thermoelectric device. <br>
          <br>
          In other embodiments of the present invention, air circulation
          within the enclosure is accomplished by extending the conduit
          inlet port or the conduit outlet port, or both, so as to cause
          air to return to the enclosure some distance away from the
          location where the conduit removes air from the enclosure. In
          this way, air entering the enclosure from the extended outlet
          port circulates through the enclosure prior to entering the
          conduit inlet port, thus eliminating the need for an airflow
          baffle. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments of the present invention, control
          mechanisms are provided to handle certain functions. In one
          aspect, a humidity or dew point sensor measures the humidity
          within the enclosure, and a controller monitoring the humidity
          sensor activates the heat pump and air moving device when
          humidity within the enclosure exceeds a setpoint. The
          controller continues to monitor the sensor, deactivating the
          heat pump and air moving device when the dew point is at or
          below a setpoint. In another aspect, a control mechanism
          operates the condensate removal valve when the condensate
          level reaches an upper threshold. <br>
          <br>
          In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a defrost
          mode is provided to remove frost from the normally cold heat
          exchanger. The defrost mode may be initiated and terminated
          manually; however, in preferred embodiments a controller
          monitors a sensor to identify a restricted airflow condition
          at the normally cold heat exchanger, restricted airflow being
          indicative of frost accumulation on the heat exchanger. Upon
          detection of such a condition, the controller initiates the
          defrost mode. During defrost, the controller reverses the
          direction of heat flow through the heat pump, causing heat to
          flow from the normally hot element to the normally cold
          element. At the same time, the controller initiates a change
          in airflow at the inlet and outlet sides of the conduit. The
          conduit inlet side, normally in airflow communication with the
          conduit inlet port, is now sealed off from the inlet port (and
          therefore from the enclosure) and put in airflow communication
          with an ambient inlet vent, the ambient inlet vent being in
          airflow communication with the ambient air surrounding the
          enclosure. In analogous fashion, the conduit outlet side,
          normally in airflow communication with the conduit outlet
          port, is sealed off from the outlet port (and therefore from
          the enclosure) and is placed in airflow communication with an
          ambient outlet vent, the ambient outlet vent being in airflow
          communication with the ambient air surrounding the enclosure.
          As a result of these changes, air no longer flows to and from
          the enclosure, the enclosure being sealed off from the inlet
          and outlet sides of the conduit. During defrost, room ambient
          air enters through the ambient inlet vent, into the conduit
          inlet side, where it flows over the normally cold (now hot)
          heat exchanger, through the sump, over the normally hot (now
          cold) heat exchanger, and finally through the outlet side and
          ambient outlet vent, into the ambient environment. The
          controller terminates the defrost mode upon determining that
          the restricted airflow condition has been eliminated. The
          controller then returns the system to its normal operating
          state: the conduit is sealed off from the ambient, the conduit
          inlet side is placed in airflow communication with the inlet
          port, the conduit outlet side is placed in airflow
          communication with the outlet port, thereby restoring airflow
          between the enclosure and the conduit, and the heat pump is
          again reversed such that the heat pump causes heat to flow
          from the normally cold element to the normally hot element. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments employing control mechanisms to
          initiate dehumidification and defrost, contention is managed
          by prioritizing the defrost process. <br>
          <br>
          It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
          a method and apparatus to remove moisture from within an
          electronics enclosure, without lowering the temperature of the
          air within the enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          It is a further object of the present invention to accomplish
          the moisture removal with a single heat pump, heating the
          dehumidified air prior to returning the air to the enclosure,
          without the use of an auxiliary heat source. <br>
          <br>
          It is a further object of the present invention to automate
          the moisture removal process, by monitoring the moisture
          levels within the enclosure and activating the conditioning
          unit when the dew point exceeds a threshold. <br>
          <br>
          It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
          automatic mechanism for removing condensate from the
          enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          It is a still further object of the present invention to
          provide an automated defrost cycle, to remove frost from the
          normally cold heat pump element, venting the resulting vapor
          to the external environment. <br>
          <br>
          The recitation herein of a list of desirable objects which are
          met by various embodiments of the present invention is not
          meant to imply or suggest that any or all of these objects are

            DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG. 1A</span> illustrates
          the environment in which the recuperative environmental
          conditioning unit (RECU) of the present invention functions.
          The environment comprises an enclosure 171, containing an
          electronics compartment 172. Enclosure 171 is substantially
          sealed against ingress of ambient air, however a hermetic seal
          is not required. Compartment 172 may contain electronic
          modules 192 cooled by forced air, or electronic modules 181 in
          thermal contact with an evaporative cooler 182, or both as
          shown. Forced air cooling is accomplished by using one or more
          air moving devices 193 to create a cooling airflow over the
          modules 192 and board 191, thereby removing heat from modules
          192 and board 191. The heated air then passes through an
          evaporative cooler 194, transferring heat from the air to the
          cooling fluid within the evaporative cooler 194. The cooled
          air circulates back through the air moving device 193, then
          back over the modules 192 and board 191. Evaporative cooler
          182, in thermal contact with module 181, transfers heat from
          module 181 to the cooling fluid within the evaporative cooler
          182. The evaporative coolers 182 and 194 are as known in the
          art, each having fluid connections to and from an external
          refrigeration system. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG. 1A</span> further
          illustrates the design and placement of RECU 100 within the
          electronics environment, per one embodiment of the present
          invention. As shown in FIG. 1A, RECU 100 comprises a closed
          loop conduit 102, extending below the enclosure, and an
          airflow baffle 101 extending upwards into the enclosure. As
          illustrated by the arrow indicating the flow of air through
          conduit 102, airflow baffle 101 causes air exiting conduit 102
          to circulate through compartment 172 prior to reentering
          conduit 102. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG. 1B</span> provides a
          detailed view of the embodiment of FIG. 1A during normal
          operation. Conduit 102 is comprised of several sections: an
          inlet port 111, a conduit inlet side 103, a conduit sump 105,
          a conduit outlet side 104, and an outlet port 112. The inlet
          port 111 is in airflow communication with the electronics
          compartment 172, and also with the conduit inlet side 103. The
          conduit inlet side 103 is further in airflow communication
          with conduit sump 105, sump 105 also being in airflow
          communication with conduit outlet side 104. Conduit outlet
          side 104 is further in airflow communication with outlet port
          112, outlet port 112 also being in airflow communication with
          electronics compartment 172. A closed loop airflow is
          therefore provided from compartment 172, through inlet port
          111, inlet side 103, sump 105, outlet side 104, outlet port
          112, and finally back to compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          Air circulation through the closed loop conduit 102 is
          provided by air moving device 106. In the embodiment of FIG.
          1B, air moving device 106 is placed within the conduit inlet
          side 103, between inlet port 111 and normally cold heat
          exchanger 162. Alternatively, air moving device 106 could be
          placed within the conduit outlet side 104. <br>
          <br>
          In the embodiment of FIG. 1B, airflow baffle 101 performs two
          functions. As previously noted, the portion of baffle 101
          extending into compartment 172 causes air exiting conduit 102
          through outlet port 112, to circulate through compartment 172
          prior to reentering conduit 102 through inlet port 111. In
          addition, the portion of baffle 101 extending inside the
          conduit (i.e. between heat pump 161 and ports 111 and 112)
          extends from the front to the rear wall of the conduit 102 of
          FIG. 1B, as shown in FIG. 2C. Baffle 101 may be sealed or
          bonded to the front and rear walls of conduit 102, or may
          merely be in contact with the front and rear walls of conduit
          102, thus preventing airflow communication between the inlet
          side 103 and outlet side 104, in the space above heat pump
          161. Baffle 101 therefore prevents an airflow short-circuit,
          insuring that air entering the inlet port flows through the
          length of inlet side 103, through sump 105, through the length
          of outlet side 104, prior to exiting the conduit through
          outlet port 112. <br>
          <br>
          Two additional features are shown near each port 111 and 112.
          Inlet door 109 and ambient inlet vent 107 are disposed near
          inlet port 111 and inlet side 103. Outlet door 110 and ambient
          outlet vent 108 are disposed near outlet port 112 and outlet
          side 104. The purpose of these features will be fully
          described in the discussion of defrost mode. During normal
          operation, inlet door 109 is in the position shown in FIG. 1B,
          sealing off ambient inlet vent 107. In analogous fashion,
          outlet door 110 is in the position shown in FIG. 1B during
          normal operation, sealing off ambient outlet vent 108. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments, heat pump 161 is a thermoelectric
          device. Thermoelectric heat pump 161 is placed within conduit
          102, as shown in FIG. 1B. In the alternative, the heat pump is
          a vapor compression cycle heat pump, as discussed below and
          illustrated in FIGS. 8A through 8D. Power is supplied to the
          heat pump through any convenient means, such as the
          electronics complex within enclosure 171, or any convenient
          external source. During normal operation, the heat pump 161
          causes heat to flow from the normally cold element 162 to the
          normally hot element 163. The normally cold element 162 is in
          thermal contact with the normally cold heat exchanger 164, and
          the normally hot element 163 is in thermal contact with the
          normally hot heat exchanger 165. FIGS. 2A through 2C provide
          additional details of the thermoelectric heat pump 161. As
          shown in FIG. 2A, heat pump 161, elements 162 and 163, and
          heat exchangers 164 and 165 extend substantially but not
          completely from the front to the back wall of conduit 102. In
          addition, the normally cold heat exchanger 164 extends
          substantially but not completely to the wall of conduit inlet
          side 103. In analogous fashion, the normally hot heat
          exchanger 165 extends substantially but not completely to the
          wall of conduit outlet side 104. As a result, there is limited
          thermal contact between any portion of conduit 102 and heat
          pump 161, elements 162 or 163, or heat sinks 164 or 165. <br>
          <br>
          Mechanical support for heat pump 161 may be provided by a seal
          or other mechanism connecting heat pump 161 and/or elements
          162 and 163 to the wall of conduit 102. In preferred
          embodiments, the mechanical support limits thermal conduction
          between conduit 102 and the heat pump 161 and its elements 162
          and 163. Also, in preferred embodiments, a mechanical support
          such as a seal provides additional airflow isolation of the
          conduit inlet side from the conduit outlet side, along the
          length of heat pump 161. One possible embodiment is
          illustrated in FIGS. 2A through 2C, showing rail 115
          connecting to the front and back walls of conduit 102. As
          shown, rail 115 provides mechanical support for the sides and
          some portion of the bottom of heat pump 161. In preferred
          embodiments, rail 115 simplifies field servicing by allowing
          easy insertion and removal of heat pump 161. <br>
          <br>
          As shown in <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIGS. 2A and 2B</span>,
          the normally cold heat exchanger 164 is in thermal contact
          with the air within conduit inlet side 103, however heat
          exchanger 164 is not in direct thermal contact with the walls
          of conduit inlet side 103. Similarly, the normally hot heat
          exchanger 165 is in thermal contact with the air within
          conduit outlet side 104, however heat exchanger 165 is not in
          direct thermal contact with the walls of conduit outlet side
          104. During normal operation, therefore, heat pump 161 causes
          heat to flow from the air within conduit inlet side 103 to
          normally cold heat exchanger 164, to normally cold element
          162, through heat pump 161, to normally hot element 163, to
          normally hot heat exchanger 165, and finally to the air within
          conduit outlet side 104. Through this process, the air
          entering conduit 102 is cooled as it passes through inlet side
          103, and is heated as it passes through outlet side 104. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments, the normally hot heat exchanger 165
          is designed such that it provides greater heat transfer than
          the normally cold heat exchanger 164. As a byproduct of
          pumping heat from the normally cold element 162 to the
          normally hot element 163, heat pump 161 creates some quantity
          of waste heat (i.e. joule heating). As a result, heat
          exchanger 165 should be designed such that it provides heat
          transfer capabilities sufficient to transfer to the air within
          the outlet side a quantity of heat equal to the heat which is
          removed from the air within the inlet side plus the waste heat
          which is generated by the heat pump 161. While optional, this
          design consideration becomes increasingly important as the
          duty cycle of RECU 100 increases, such as when enclosure 171
          is poorly sealed against entry of ambient air. The embodiment
          illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B displays this feature: normally
          hot heat exchanger 165 is designed for greater thermal
          transfer than normally cold heat exchanger 164. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG. 1B</span> illustrates
          several control features, to be discussed in detail below.
          These control features include sensing devices (dew point
          sensor 121, liquid level sensor 122, pressure sensor 123), a
          controller 130, and solenoid valve 153. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECU Normal Operation </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Normal operation of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1A will
          now be described, with reference to FIG. 1B. <br>
          <br>
          During normal operation, RECU 100 removes humidity from
          compartment 172. While manual operation of RECU 100 is
          possible, preferred embodiments employ control mechanisms to
          monitor the dew point within the compartment 172, causing RECU
          100 to operate when the dew point exceeds a predetermined
          setpoint. RECU 100 should operate intermittently, i.e. at a
          duty cycle less than 1. To lower the RECU operational duty
          cycle, enclosure 171 should be substantially sealed against
          ingress of ambient air. A better seal results in a lower RECU
          duty cycle. A hermetically sealed enclosure is not required. <br>
          <br>
          When RECU 100 is in normal operation, power is supplied to
          heat pump 161 and air moving device 106. Heat pump 161 causes
          heat to flow from normally cold element 162 to normally hot
          element 163, in turn causing heat to flow from normally cold
          heat exchanger 164 to normally cold element 162, and from
          normally hot element 163 to normally hot heat exchanger 165.
          In this manner, the temperature of normally cold heat
          exchanger 164 is lowered, and the temperature of normally hot
          heat exchanger 165 is raised. Air moving device 106 causes air
          to flow from electronics compartment 172, through inlet port
          111, through inlet side 103 and over normally cold heat
          exchanger 164. As air passes over normally cold heat exchanger
          164, water vapor condenses on the cold surfaces of heat
          exchanger 164. Condensate accumulates on heat exchanger 164,
          and eventually falls into a collection area, conduit sump 105.
          Condensate accumulates in sump 105 until it is removed. A
          mechanism to remove condensate is disposed near the lowest
          point of sump 105. This mechanism may be a device such as a
          valve or a wick. If a valve is used to remove condensate, the
          valve may be operated manually, or in preferred embodiments a
          solenoid valve 153 is used to enable automatic control. In
          either case, the valve allows condensate to flow from sump 105
          to condensate drain 152, for subsequent disposal. If a wick is
          used, condensate drain 152 and additional control mechanisms
          are not required. FIG. 7 illustrates one such embodiment,
          showing wick 754 disposed substantially at the lowest point of
          sump 305. As shown, wick 754 provides continuous removal of
          condensate without the need for manual or automated control. <br>
          <br>
          As air passes through normally cold heat exchanger 164 during
          normal operation, the air temperature and humidity are both
          reduced. Upon exiting the conduit inlet side 103, air flows
          through sump 105 and then enters conduit outlet side 104.
          While flowing through outlet side 104, air flows through
          normally hot heat exchanger 165. Heat exchanger 165 transfers
          heat to the air, raising its temperature. As noted previously,
          the normally hot heat exchanger 165 transfers to the air the
          waste heat which is generated by the heat pump, in addition to
          the heat which is removed from the air by the normally cold
          heat exchanger 164. This results in a net increase in the
          temperature of air exiting outlet port 112, compared to air
          entering inlet port 111. <br>
          <br>
          Under normal operation as illustrated in FIG. 1B, therefore,
          RECU 100 removes moisture from compartment 172, without
          lowering the temperature of the air within compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECU Defrost Mode </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Defrost mode operation of the embodiment illustrated in FIG.
          1A will now be described, with reference to FIG. 1C. <br>
          <br>
          In some applications, condensate may freeze on the surface of
          the normally cold heat exchanger 164. Continued accumulation
          of such frost on the normally cold heat exchanger 164
          eventually impedes airflow through the normally cold heat
          exchanger, thus degrading the performance of the RECU. Two
          factors that may increase the likelihood of frost are the
          temperature of the normally cold heat exchanger 164 (low
          temperature increases the likelihood of frost), and RECU duty
          cycle (high duty cycle increases the likelihood of frost). For
          applications prone to frost accumulation, preferred
          embodiments of the present invention provide a defrost mode.
          During the defrost mode, the polarity of the heat pump 161 is
          reversed, causing the normally cold element 162 to become hot,
          and the normally hot element 163 to become cold. In addition,
          inlet and outlet doors provide airflow to and from the conduit
          102 and the ambient environment, while eliminating airflow to
          and from the conduit 102 and the compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1C depicts the operation of the RECU 100 during defrost
          mode. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, heat
          pump 161 is a thermoelectric device. Reversing the direction
          of heat flow is easily accomplished by reversing the polarity
          of the voltage supply providing power to the thermoelectric
          heat pump 161. Once the supply voltage polarity is reversed,
          providing power to heat pump 161 causes heat to flow from the
          normally hot element 163 to the normally cold element 162.
          Heat then flows from normally cold element 162 to normally
          cold heat exchanger 164. The normally cold element 162 and
          normally cold heat exchanger 164 become hot, and the normally
          hot element 163 and normally hot heat exchanger 165 become
          cold. The heat which is provided to the normally cold heat
          exchanger 164 melts the frost on normally cold heat exchanger
          164. <br>
          <br>
          A second change occurs during defrost mode, to insure that the
          moisture from the melting frost is vented to the ambient
          environment. FIG. 1C illustrates inlet door 109 and outlet
          door 110 in their defrost mode positions. In defrost mode,
          inlet door 109 swings toward inlet port 111, eliminating
          airflow communication between inlet port 111 and inlet side
          103. With inlet door 109 in the defrost position, ambient
          inlet vent 107 is now in airflow communication with inlet side
          103. Air moving device 106 now causes air to flow from the
          ambient environment, through ambient inlet vent 107, then into
          inlet side 103. In similar fashion, outlet door 110 swings
          toward outlet port 112, eliminating airflow communication
          between outlet side 104 and outlet port 112. With outlet door
          110 in the defrost position, ambient outlet vent 108 is now in
          airflow communication with outlet side 104. Air flowing
          through the inlet side 103, therefore, flows through sump 105,
          through outlet side 104, through ambient outlet vent 108 and
          finally back into the ambient environment surrounding the
          enclosure 171. In this manner, water vapor which is created by
          heating the frost on normally cold heat exchanger 164 is
          vented into the ambient environment, rather than into
          electronics compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          As illustrated in FIGS. 1B and 1C, inlet door 109 comprises a
          single door on a hinge-like pivot mount. Inlet door 109 swings
          or pivots into one position during normal operation and a
          second position during defrost operation. Alternative
          embodiments are also envisioned, wherein inlet door 109 may be
          replaced by two doors: one to seal or open inlet port 111 and
          a second to seal or open ambient inlet vent 107. These inlet
          doors may also be replaced by louvers or other such devices.
          Further, embodiments are envisioned in which the inlet door or
          doors are mounted other than with a hinge or pivot, such as by
          using a sliding mount. Similar embodiments for outlet door 110
          are envisioned, in keeping with the spirit and scope of the
          present invention. <br>
          <br>
          Upon removal of the frost accumulation from normally cold heat
          exchanger 164, the defrost cycle is terminated. Air moving
          device 106 and heat pump 161 are turned off. The heat pump
          polarity is again reversed, by reversing the polarity of the
          thermoelectric heat pump 161 supply voltage. Finally, inlet
          door 109 and outlet door 110 are returned to their normal
          operating position, as shown in FIG. 1B. Inlet door 109 now
          seals inlet side 103 from ambient inlet vent 107, and restores
          airflow communication between inlet side 103 and electronics
          compartment 172. In similar fashion, outlet door 110 swings
          into normal position sealing outlet side 104 from ambient
          outlet vent 108, and restoring airflow communication between
          outlet side 104 and outlet port 112. These changes return the
          RECU to normal operating condition, ready to remove moisture
          from the environment within compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECU Control </span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments of the present invention, control
          mechanisms are provided to manage many of the RECU operations.
          FIG. 1B depicts the devices which are involved in controlling
          the RECU: dew point sensor 121, liquid level sensor 122,
          pressure sensor 123, controller 130, and solenoid valve 153.
          FIG. 1B illustrates placement of controller 130 within
          enclosure 171, an alternative placement of controller 130 is
          possible, such as within a separate unit near or attached to
          RECU 100. In similar fashion, power may be supplied to
          controller 130 from the electronics complex within enclosure
          171, or from any convenient source. FIG. 5 depicts a schematic
          representation of the control device connections, and
          introduces the thermoelectric (TE) power switch 531. Switch
          531 performs two functions in embodiments employing a
          thermoelectric heat pump: polarity control and on/off
          switching. FIG. 6 illustrates the main control logic which
          manages a preferred embodiment of the present invention. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the control
          devices and logic manage three RECU operations: starting and
          stopping normal operation (dehumidification), starting and
          stopping defrost mode, and purging accumulated condensate from
          sump 105. In embodiments employing a wick rather than a valve
          to remove condensate from sump 105, condensate is purged
          continuously, thereby eliminating the need to provide control
          for this operation. <br>
          <br>
          In preferred embodiments, RECU 100 is activated in normal
          dehumidification mode when the dew point within enclosure 171
          exceeds a predetermined setpoint. Dew point sensor 121
          monitors the dew point of the air within enclosure 171, and
          provides a signal indicative of the dew point to controller
          130 (input 541, see FIG. 5). Controller 130 periodically
          monitors the dew point input (FIG. 6, step 639), comparing the
          dew point input to a predetermined setpoint (FIG. 6, step
          640). If controller 130 determines that the dew point is below
          the setpoint, controller 130 then determines whether the RECU
          is currently in dehumidification mode (FIG. 6, step 650).
          Controller 130 makes this determination by monitoring the
          state of three of its outputs: air moving device on/off (545),
          heat pump on/off (546), heat pump polarity (547) (see FIG. 5
          and Table 1). If the RECU is currently in dehumidification
          mode, the controller terminates dehumidification mode by
          turning off heat pump 161 and air moving device 106 (FIG. 6,
          steps 651 and 652). If the RECU is not in dehumidification
          mode, no further action is taken during this control cycle. <br>

          <br>
          Also in preferred embodiments, the RECU defrost cycle is
          activated when normally cold heat exchanger 164 becomes
          frosted. As previously noted, frost accumulation on the
          surfaces of normally cold heat exchanger 164 impedes or
          restricts airflow through the heat exchanger. This restricted
          airflow condition causes an increase in air pressure in the
          portion of conduit inlet side 103 between the air moving
          device 106 and the leading edge of normally cold heat
          exchanger 164. A pressure sensor 123 is placed at this
          position, as shown in FIGS. 1B and 1C. Thus placed, pressure
          sensor 123 is properly located to detect an increase in air
          pressure indicative of frost accumulation on normally cold
          heat exchanger 164. As shown in FIG. 5, pressure sensor 123 is
          electrically connected to controller 130 (input 541),
          providing to controller 130 an electrical signal indicative of
          the air pressure within conduit inlet side 103 between air
          moving device 106 and normally cold heat exchanger 164. <br>
          <br>
          Controller 130 periodically monitors the input from pressure
          sensor 123 (FIG. 6, step 603), comparing the value to a
          predetermined setpoint (FIG. 6, step 605). If the pressure
          exceeds the setpoint, controller 130 insures that the RECU
          enters or remains in defrost mode (FIG. 6, steps 610 through
          624, explained in detail below). If the pressure is at or
          below the setpoint, controller 130 insures that the RECU
          enters or remains in normal (dehumidification) mode (FIG. 6,
          steps 630 through 634, explained in detail below). <br>
          <br>
          If controller 130 determines that the pressure exceeds the
          setpoint, indicating frost accumulation on the normally cold
          heat exchanger 164, controller 130 initiates a sequence of
          steps placing the RECU in defrost mode, or causes the RECU to
          remain in defrost mode as appropriate. As shown in FIG. 6,
          controller 130 compares the input from pressure sensor 123 to
          a setpoint, at step 605. If the pressure exceeds the setpoint,
          controller 130 next determines whether the RECU is actively
          operating in normal (dehumidification) mode, at step 610.
          Controller 130 makes this determination by monitoring the
          state of three of its outputs: air moving device on/off (545),
          heat pump on/off (546), heat pump polarity (547) (see FIG. 5
          and Table 1). If the RECU is actively operating in
          dehumidification mode, controller 130 turns off heat pump 161
          and air moving device 106, at steps 611 and 612 respectively.
          If the RECU is not actively in dehumidification mode (i.e.
          RECU is inactive, or in defrost mode), steps 611 and 612 are
          unnecessary. Controller 130 next determines whether the RECU
          is already in defrost mode, at step 620, by monitoring the
          state of outputs 545, 546, and 547, as previously noted. If
          the RECU is already in defrost mode, controller 130 takes no
          further action during this control cycle, causing the RECU to
          remain in defrost mode. If the RECU is not yet in defrost
          mode, controller 130 initiates a sequence of operations
          placing the RECU in defrost mode. First, controller 130 causes
          inlet door 109 and outlet door 110 to move into defrost
          position, step 621, and as illustrated in FIG. 1C. One method
          of accomplishing this result is shown in the schematic of FIG.
          5, where controller 130 provides output 548 to a device such
          as a servo motor 532. Two such servo motors may be used, one
          for inlet door 109 and a second for outlet door 110.
          Controller 130 next reverses the direction of heat flow
          through heat pump 161, step 622. In preferred embodiments,
          heat pump 161 is a thermoelectric device. As previously noted,
          controller 130 reverses the heat flow direction through the
          thermoelectric heat pump by reversing the polarity of the heat
          pump voltage supply. FIG. 5 illustrates one possible apparatus
          to control the polarity reversal, TE power switch 531. As
          defined here, heat pump 161 operates in normal mode (heat flow
          from normally cold element to normally hot element) when
          voltage supply V1 exceeds voltage supply V2. Switch 531 has
          two sets of inputs: two control inputs (heat pump on/off 546,
          heat pump polarity 547), and two voltage supply inputs
          (V+,V-). Switch 531 applies the appropriate supply voltages to
          the heat pump, V1 and V2, based on the control inputs 546 and
          547. Table 2 describes the function of switch 531 by
          illustrating the relationship between control inputs 546 and
          547, and heat pump supply voltages V1 and V2. Switch 531 may
          be implemented using a number of relays, for example, or any
          switching devices providing the characteristics illustrated in
          Table 2. At the completion of step 622, the state of switch
          531 is described in column 3 of Table 2, corresponding to
          controller output 546=OFF, controller output 547=REVERSE. <br>
          <br>
          TABLE 2 Output 546 = OFF Output 546 = ON (Heat Pump OFF) (Heat
          Pump ON) 547 = 547 = 547 = 547 = NORMAL REVERSE NORMAL REVERSE
          V1 NC V- V+ V- V2 V- NC V- V+ <br>
          <br>
          Controller 130 next activates heat pump 161 in the reverse
          heat flow direction, at step 623. At the completion of step
          623, the state of switch 531 is described in column 5 of Table
          2, corresponding to controller output 546=ON, controller
          output 547=REVERSE. In the final step in activating defrost
          mode, controller 130 turns ON air moving device 106, at step
          624. At this point, defrost mode is active: inlet and outlet
          doors 109 and 110 are in defrost mode position, heat flow
          direction through heat pump 161 is reversed, heat pump 161 is
          ON, air moving device 106 is ON. <br>
          <br>
          If, at step 605, controller 130 determines that the pressure
          (as indicated by pressure sensor 123) is at or below the
          setpoint, indicating the absence of frost accumulation on the
          normally cold heat exchanger 164, controller 130 initiates a
          sequence of steps terminating the RECU defrost mode, or causes
          the RECU to remain in normal mode as appropriate. As shown in
          FIG. 6, controller 130 compares the input from pressure sensor
          123 to a setpoint, at step 605. If the pressure is at or below
          the setpoint, controller 130 next determines whether the RECU
          is actively operating in defrost mode, at step 630. Controller
          130 makes this determination by monitoring the state of three
          of its outputs: air moving device on/off (545), heat pump
          on/off (546), heat pump polarity (547) (see FIG. 5 and Table
          1). If controller 130 determines that the RECU is not actively
          operating in defrost mode, no further action is taken with
          respect to the operational mode of the RECU, and controller
          130 continues with normal operation by reading dew point
          sensor 121, at step 639. <br>
          <br>
          If, after determining that the pressure is at or below
          setpoint (step 605), controller 130 determines that the RECU
          is actively in defrost mode (step 630), controller 130
          initiates a series of steps to terminate defrost mode and
          return the RECU to dehumidification mode. Controller 130 first
          turns air moving device 106 OFF, step 631. Controller 130 then
          turns heat pump 161 OFF, step 632, and reverses the polarity
          of heat pump supply voltages thereby reversing the direction
          of heat flow to the normal mode, step 633. As noted
          previously, under normal operation heat flows from the
          normally cold element 162 to normally hot element 163.
          Finally, at step 634, controller 130 returns inlet and outlet
          doors 109 and 110, respectively, to their normal operating
          positions. With inlet door 109 in normal operating position,
          conduit inlet side 103 is in airflow communication with inlet
          port 111 and therefore with compartment 172. Ambient inlet
          vent 107 is sealed off from conduit inlet side 103. In similar
          fashion, with outlet door 110 in normal operating position,
          conduit outlet side 104 is in airflow communication with
          outlet port 112 and therefore with compartment 172. Ambient
          outlet vent 108 is sealed off from conduit outlet side 104. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 6 illustrates three additional aspects of RECU control.
          Controller 130 performs an initialization step at startup,
          step 601. This step insures that all control variables are in
          a known state: heat pump 161 OFF, air moving device 106 OFF,
          inlet and outlet door position NORMAL, heat pump 161 heat flow
          direction NORMAL. <br>
          <br>
          The next aspect illustrated in FIG. 6 involves the control
          flow for embodiments utilizing automated dehumidification and
          defrost cycles. In such an embodiment, it is possible for the
          dew point and pressure inputs to controller 130 to
          simultaneously exceed their respective setpoints. Since the
          two operating modes described herein are mutually exclusive,
          one operating mode should take priority over the other mode.
          While alternative solutions may be possible, the embodiments
          described herein prioritize the defrost mode over the
          dehumidification mode. FIG. 6 illustrates this in the
          following way: steps 639 and 640 (read and compare dew point
          sensor) are located in a branch of the control flow that
          controller 130 reaches only after determining that the
          pressure is at or below setpoint (step 605). As long as
          controller 130 determines that pressure exceeds the setpoint,
          step 605, the RECU remains in defrost mode, and controller 130
          does not compare the dew point input to the setpoint (step
          640). Further, if the RECU is operating in dehumidification
          mode when controller 130 determines at step 605 that pressure
          exceeds the setpoint, controller 130 determines the state of
          RECU and terminates the active dehumidification mode prior to
          activating defrost mode (steps 610, 611, and 612). <br>
          <br>
          The remaining aspect illustrated in FIG. 6 involves the use of
          a delay step 602. Step 602 helps to eliminate oscillations
          which may be caused by pressure or dew point values
          fluctuating at or near their respective set points. <br>
          <br>
          Preferred embodiments of the present invention employ control
          mechanisms for a third operation: purging accumulated
          condensate from sump 105. As previously noted, in embodiments
          employing a wick rather than a valve to remove condensate from
          sump 105, condensate is purged continuously, thereby
          eliminating the need to provide control for this operation. In
          embodiments employing a valve to purge condensate, a device
          such as a solenoid valve (FIG. 1B, 153) is preferably used. As
          shown in FIG. 5, a liquid level sensor 122 is used to monitor
          the level of condensate present in sump 105. In the embodiment
          of FIG. 5, liquid level sensor is in electrical communication
          with controller 130, providing to controller 130 a signal
          indicative of the liquid level within sump 105. When the level
          exceeds a setpoint, controller 130 opens solenoid valve 153,
          causing condensate to exit sump 105 through condensate drain
          152 (see FIG. 1B). Controller 130 determines when to terminate
          the purge cycle by either monitoring the signal from liquid
          level sensor 122, or by waiting some period of time after
          opening solenoid valve 153. Controller 130 then terminates the
          purge cycle by closing solenoid valve 153. Other arrangements
          to control purging condensate from sump 105 are, of course,
          possible. For example, since condensate purge control is
          independent of the operational state of the RECU (i.e.
          dehumidification mode, defrost mode, or OFF), it may be
          desirable to cause liquid level sensor 122 to directly control
          solenoid valve 153, without involving controller 130. Also for
          example, mechanical devices could be used to control the
          purging of condensate. <br>
          <br>
          As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, other
          embodiments of the present invention are possible, in keeping
          with the spirit and scope of the present invention. By way of
          example, a few of the possible alternative embodiments will
          now be described. These embodiments are intended as examples,
          and do not constitute a comprehensive list of embodiments

          <br>
          In the embodiment of FIGS. 1A through 1C, inlet port 111
          constitutes a single plane, which is defined by the upper
          surface of inlet door 109 while in its defrost position (see
          FIGS. 1B and 1C). Outlet port 112 constitutes a single plane,
          which is similarly defined by the upper surface of outlet door
          110 while in its defrost position. In this embodiment, the
          primary purpose of inlet and outlet ports 111 and 112 is to
          define the airflow communication aperture between compartment
          172 and conduit inlet and outlet sides 103 and 104, such that
          inlet and outlet doors 109 and 110 create effective seals when
          they close against their respective ports. <br>
          <br>
          It is possible to modify the inlet and outlet ports, as shown
          in the embodiment of FIGS. 3A through 3C. FIG. 3A shows an
          alternative embodiment, RECU 300, employing a conduit 302 with
          modified inlet and outlet ports. As will be described, this
          embodiment eliminates the need to extend an airflow baffle
          into compartment 172, as in the embodiment of FIG. 1A. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3B illustrates additional details of the modified conduit
          302. In particular, inlet port 311 now comprises some length
          of the airflow path through conduit 302. In the embodiment of
          FIG. 3B, inlet port 311 now performs two functions. First,
          inlet port 311 defines the aperture against which inlet door
          309 closes when in defrost position (see FIG. 3C), as did
          inlet port 111 of FIGS. 1B and 1C. In addition, inlet port 311
          now comprises some length of conduit, causing air from
          compartment 172 to be transported some distance after entering
          conduit 302, before reaching the conduit inlet side 303. In
          similar fashion, outlet port 312 as shown in FIG. 3B also
          performs two functions, defining the aperture against which
          outlet door 312 closes when in defrost position (again, see
          FIG. 3C), and transporting air exiting conduit outlet side 304
          some distance prior to returning the air to compartment 172.
          Extending inlet and outlet ports 311 and 312 thus causes air
          to exit conduit 302 some distance from the location where air
          enters conduit 20302. In this way, conduit 302 removes air
          from compartment 172 some distance from the location where
          conduit 302 returns air to compartment 172, causing the
          returning air to circulate through compartment 172 prior to
          reentering conduit 302. This arrangement of inlet and outlet
          ports 311 and 312 eliminates the need to extend an airflow
          baffle (such as baffle 101 of FIG. 1A) into compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          The dehumidification mode operation of the embodiment
          illustrated in FIG. 3B is much the same as the
          dehumidification mode operation of the embodiment illustrated
          in FIG. 1B. The function and operation of heat pump 161 and
          associated elements (162 and 163), heat exchangers (164 and
          165), sensors (121, 122, 123), air moving device 106, valve
          153 and drain 152, and controller 130 are unchanged from the
          embodiment of FIGS. 1A through 1C. Air moving device 106
          creates the airflow through conduit 302, from inlet side 303
          to outlet side 304. Air enters inlet port 311 of conduit 302
          from compartment 172. Inlet port 311 then directs the flow of
          air some distance to the aperture connecting inlet port 311 to
          conduit inlet side 303. As in the embodiment of FIGS. 1A
          through 1C, air next flows through conduit inlet side 303
          where it is cooled and dehumidified by normally cold heat
          exchanger 164, through sump 305, then through conduit outlet
          side 304 where the air is heated by normally hot heat
          exchanger 165. Air exits conduit outlet side 304 through the
          aperture connecting outlet side 304 to outlet port 312, outlet
          port 312 then directs the flow of air some distance prior to
          allowing the air to return to compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          Inlet and outlet doors 309 and 310, respectively, perform the
          same functions as the inlet and outlet doors 109 and 110 of
          the embodiment of FIG. 1B, although doors 309 and 310 are
          positioned differently than doors 109 and 110. In the normal
          (i.e. dehumidification) mode shown in FIG. 3B, inlet door 309
          is shown in normal operating position. In this position, the
          aperture connecting inlet port 311 and conduit inlet side 303
          remains unobstructed, thereby allowing airflow communication
          between inlet port 311 and conduit inlet side 303. Inlet door
          309 also seals ambient inlet port 307 from conduit inlet side
          303. Similarly, FIG. 3B also shows outlet door 310 in normal
          operating position. In this position, the aperture connecting
          outlet port 312 to conduit outlet side 304 remains
          unobstructed, thereby allowing airflow communication between
          conduit outlet side 304 and outlet port 312. Outlet door 310
          also seals ambient outlet vent 308 from conduit outlet side
          304. <br>
          <br>
          The defrost mode operation of the embodiment illustrated in
          FIG. 3C is similar to the defrost mode operation of the
          embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1C. The function and operation
          of heat pump 161 and associated elements (162 and 163),
          heatsinks (164 and 165), sensors (121, 122, 123), air moving
          device 106, valve 153 and drain 152, and controller 130 are
          unchanged from the embodiment of FIGS. 1A through 1C. During
          defrost mode operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3C,
          inlet door 309 moves into defrost position. In this position,
          inlet door 309 seals the aperture connecting inlet port 311 to
          conduit inlet side 303, thereby eliminating airflow
          communication between inlet port 311 and conduit inlet side
          303. Ambient inlet vent 307 is now unobstructed, allowing the
          ambient air surrounding enclosure 171 to enter conduit inlet
          side 303. Similarly, during defrost mode operation outlet door
          310 moves into defrost position. In this position, outlet door
          310 seals the aperture connecting outlet port 312 to conduit
          outlet side 304, thereby eliminating airflow communication
          between outlet port 312 and conduit outlet side 304. Ambient
          outlet vent 308 is now unobstructed, venting the air from
          conduit outlet side 304 into the ambient environment
          surrounding enclosure 171. <br>
          <br>
          The inlet and outlet ports 311 and 312, respectively, may each
          extend further, increasing the distance between the point at
          which air enters conduit 302 and the point at which air exits
          conduit 302. Increasing this distance improves the flow of air
          within compartment 372. FIG. 3D illustrates one such
          embodiment, where outlet port 312 extends the length of the
          bottom wall of enclosure 171, then up the height of one wall
          of enclosure 171. <br>

          <br>
          In some applications, it may be desirable or necessary to
          contain the entire conduit within the electronics closure,
          requiring only the condensate drain (or some portion thereof)
          to extend outside the enclosure. FIG. 4A illustrates such an
          embodiment, where RECU 400 comprises a conduit 402 disposed
          completely within enclosure 171. As shown here and in FIGS. 4B
          and 4C, sensors 121, 122, and 123 are shown extending outside
          of enclosure 171, however this configuration is not a
          requirement. An alternative embodiment may be envisioned where
          all sensors are disposed within enclosure 171. Likewise,
          solenoid valve 153 is shown disposed outside of enclosure 171,
          however this configuration is also not a requirement. An
          alternative embodiment may be envisioned where solenoid valve
          153 is disposed within enclosure 171, with condensate drain
          152 being disposed partially inside enclosure 171, extending
          through enclosure 171 into the ambient environment, in order
          to allow removal of condensate from within the enclosure. <br>
          <br>
          The basic structure of the embodiment of FIGS. 4A through 4C
          is similar to that of the embodiments previously described. As
          illustrated in FIG. 4B, conduit 402 comprises an inlet port
          411, conduit inlet side 403, sump 405, conduit outlet side
          404, and outlet port 412. Inlet door 409 is disposed such that
          during normal operation door 409 is capable of sealing off
          ambient inlet vent 407 while inlet port 411 remains in airflow
          communication with conduit inlet side 403, and such that
          during defrost mode door 409 is capable of sealing off inlet
          port 411 while ambient inlet vent 407 is in airflow
          communication with conduit inlet side 403. Outlet door 410 is
          analogously disposed to seal ambient outlet vent 408 during
          normal operation, and to seal outlet port 412 during defrost
          mode. Conduit inlet side 403, as shown, is similar to conduit
          inlet side 103 of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1A
          through 1C. Conduit outlet side 404, however, is extended and
          doubled back in order to direct airflow toward the bottom wall
          of enclosure 171 (and ambient outlet vent 408), for easy
          access to the external ambient during defrost mode. Inlet port
          411, as shown in FIG. 4B, is similar in design to inlet port
          111 of FIG. 1B. Inlet port 411 provides an aperture connecting
          compartment 172 to conduit inlet side 403, where the aperture
          is capable of being sealed off by inlet door 409 during
          defrost mode. Outlet port 412, as shown in FIG. 4B, is similar
          in design to outlet port 312 of FIG. 3B, since outlet port 312
          also directs the air exiting conduit outlet side 404 some
          distance after the sealable aperture before allowing the air
          to reenter compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          As is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art,
          the features of the conduit inlet and outlet sides 403 and
          404, and the inlet and outlet ports 411 and 412 illustrated in
          FIG. 4B may be interchanged or modified, in keeping with the
          spirit and scope of the present invention. For example,
          conduit inlet side 403 could be extended and doubled back
          instead of conduit outlet side 404, or both sides 403 and 404
          could be extended and doubled back to allow freestanding
          placement of conduit 402 away from enclosure walls. Also for
          example, inlet port 411 could be extended as in the embodiment
          of FIG. 3B. <br>
          <br>
          The dehumidification mode operation of the embodiment
          illustrated in FIG. 4B is much the same as the
          dehumidification mode operation of the embodiment illustrated
          in FIG. 1B. The function and operation of heat pump 161 and
          associated elements (162 and 163), heatsinks (164 and 165),
          sensors (121, 122, 123), air moving device 106, valve 153 and
          drain 152, and controller 130 are unchanged from the
          embodiment of FIGS. 1A through 1C. Air moving device 106
          creates the airflow through conduit 402. Air enters inlet port
          411 of conduit 402 from compartment 172, then flows into
          conduit inlet side 403. As in the embodiment of FIGS. 1A
          through 1C, air next flows through conduit inlet side 403
          where it is cooled and dehumidified by normally cold heat
          exchanger 164, through sump 405, then through conduit outlet
          side 404 where the air is heated by normally hot heat
          exchanger 165. Conduit outlet side 404 redirects the air
          toward the bottom wall of enclosure 171, where the air exits
          conduit outlet side 404 through the aperture connecting outlet
          side 404 to outlet port 412, outlet port 412 then directs the
          flow of air some distance prior to allowing the air to return
          to compartment 172. <br>
          <br>
          The defrost mode operation of the embodiment illustrated in
          FIG. 4C is similar to the defrost mode operation of the
          embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1C. The function and operation
          of heat pump 161 and associated elements (162 and 163),
          heatsinks (164 and 165), sensors (121, 122, 123), air moving
          device 106, valve 153 and drain 152, and controller 130 are
          unchanged from the embodiment of FIGS. 1A through 1C. During
          defrost mode operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 4C,
          inlet door 409 moves into defrost position. In this position,
          inlet door 409 seals the aperture connecting inlet port 411 to
          conduit inlet side 403, thereby eliminating airflow
          communication between inlet port 411 and conduit inlet side
          403. Ambient inlet vent 407 is now unobstructed, allowing the
          ambient air surrounding enclosure 171 to enter conduit inlet
          side 403. Similarly, during defrost mode operation outlet door
          410 moves into defrost position. In this position, outlet door
          410 seals the aperture connecting outlet port 412 to conduit
          outlet side 404, thereby eliminating airflow communication
          between outlet port 412 and conduit outlet side 404. Ambient
          outlet vent 408 is now unobstructed, venting the air from
          conduit outlet side 404 into the ambient environment
          surrounding enclosure 171. <br>
          <br>
          Embodiment Using Vapor Compression Cycle Heat Pump <br>
          <br>
          As previously noted, in preferred embodiments heat pump 161 is
          a thermoelectric device. Embodiments of the present invention
          are envisioned, however where the heat pump is a vapor
          compression cycle heat pump. <br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 8A through 8D illustrate an embodiment of the present
          invention utilizing an air-to-air reversing vapor-compression
          heat pump configuration in place of a thermoelectric heat
          pump. As shown in FIG. 8A, within conduit 302 the
          thermoelectric module and heat exchanger assembly is replaced
          by two finned-tube heat exchangers which are separated by
          baffle 801. Normally cold element 862 is comprised of a
          serpentine tube disposed within conduit inlet side 303.
          Normally cold heat exchanger 864 is comprised of a series of
          fins in thermal contact with normally cold element 862 and
          also in thermal contact with the air within conduit inlet side
          303. In similar fashion, normally hot element 863 is comprised
          of a serpentine tube disposed within conduit outlet side 304.
          Normally hot heat exchanger 865 is comprised of a series of
          fins in thermal contact with normally hot element 863 and also
          in thermal contact with the air within conduit outlet side
          304. As shown in FIG. 8A, the fins of both heat exchangers 864
          and 865 are oriented in the direction of airflow through
          conduit inlet and outlet sides, 303 and 304, respectively.
          Baffle 801 extends from the front wall of conduit 302 to the
          rear wall of conduit 302,in the same fashion as baffle 101 of
          FIG. 2C. Baffle 801 extends the length of conduit inlet and
          outlet sides 303 and 304, as shown, thereby insuring airflow
          through both heat exchangers 864 and 865. An additional
          element, an expansion valve 869, is placed in the tubing
          connecting the two heat pump elements 862 and 863. A
          compressor 866, which is disposed outside of conduit 302,
          receives low pressure refrigerant at low pressure inlet 867,
          compresses the refrigerant, and delivers high pressure
          refrigerant to high pressure outlet 868. Each heat pump
          element 862 and 863 is connected to both compressor ports
          through a series of four tubing lines as shown in FIG. 8A.
          Four electrically operated solenoid valves are provided, 855
          through 858, to control the flow of refrigerant from
          compressor 866 to elements 862 and 863, and back to compressor
          866. The remaining features of this embodiment are unchanged
          from the embodiment of FIGS. 3A through 3D. <br>
          <br>
          FIG. 8B illustrates the operation of this embodiment of the
          RECU during normal (dehumidification) mode, focusing primarily
          on the operation of heat pump 861. Table 3 shows the state of
          solenoid valves 855 through 858 as a function of controller
          130 output 547 (heat pump polarity). In particular, Table 3
          column 2 shows the state of solenoid valves 855 through 858
          during normal operation: valves 855 and 856 are OPEN, and
          valves 857 and 858 are CLOSED. Compressed refrigerant gas
          exits the high pressure outlet 868 of compressor 866. Solenoid
          valve 856 directs the high pressure refrigerant to normally
          hot element 863. Normally hot element 863 acts as a condenser,
          transferring heat from the condensing refrigerant to normally
          hot heat exchanger 865, which then transfers heat to the air
          within conduit exit side 304. Liquid refrigerant exits
          normally hot element 863 and flows through expansion valve
          869, thereby substantially reducing the temperature of the
          liquid refrigerant. The low temperature liquid refrigerant
          then enters normally cold element 862, which functions as an
          evaporator during normal operation. Within normally cold
          element 862 (now an evaporator), low temperature liquid
          refrigerant absorbs heat from normally cold heat exchanger
          864, which in turn absorbs heat from the air within conduit
          inlet side 303. As a result of absorbing heat, the refrigerant
          exits normally cold element 862 as a higher temperature gas.
          Solenoid valve 855, OPEN during normal operation, directs the
          gaseous refrigerant back to compressor 866, through low
          pressure inlet 867. <br>

          FIG. 8C illustrates the operation of this embodiment of the
          RECU during defrost mode, again focusing primarily on the
          operation of heat pump 861. As previously noted, during normal
          operation frost may accumulate on normally cold heat exchanger
          864, thus impeding airflow through the RECU. The defrost mode
          removes accumulated frost, as previously described. In order
          to remove frost, the polarity of heat pump 861 is reversed,
          causing the normally hot element to become cold and the
          normally cold element to become hot. In the embodiment of FIG.
          8C, this polarity reversal is accomplished by changing the
          state of solenoid valves 855 through 858, as shown in Table 3.
          In particular, Table 3 column 3 shows the state of solenoid
          valves 855 through 858 during defrost mode: valves 855 and 856
          are CLOSED, and valves 857 and 858 are OPEN. Changing the
          state of solenoid valves 855 through 858 reverses the flow of
          refrigerant through elements 862 and 863, thereby reversing
          the elements' roles. Compressed, high pressure refrigerant gas
          exits the high pressure outlet 868 of compressor 866. Solenoid
          valve 858 now directs the high pressure refrigerant to
          normally cold element 862. During defrost mode, therefore,
          normally cold element 862 acts as a condenser (rather than an
          evaporator), and therefore absorbs heat from the high pressure
          refrigerant gas. The heat thus absorbed is transferred to
          normally cold (now hot) heat exchanger 864, thereby causing
          the accumulated frost to melt. Liquid refrigerant exits the
          condenser (normally cold element 862) and flows through
          expansion valve 869, substantially reducing the temperature of
          the liquid refrigerant. The low temperature liquid refrigerant
          then enters normally hot element 863, which acts as an
          evaporator (rather than a condenser) during defrost mode. As
          previously described, refrigerant exits the evaporator (now
          normally hot element 863) as a higher temperature gas.
          Solenoid valve 857, OPEN during defrost mode, directs the
          gaseous refrigerant back to compressor 866, through low
          pressure inlet 867. <br>

          The embodiment of FIGS. 8A through 8C may be controlled in
          much the same manner as previously described. FIG. 8D
          illustrates a schematic diagram of the control devices of the
          present embodiment. The function of sensors 121 through 123,
          controller 130, solenoid valve 143, air moving device 106, and
          servo motor(s) 532 is unchanged from the embodiment of FIG.
          5A. TE switch 531 is replaced by switch 831, which controls
          solenoid valves 855 through 858 based on the state of
          controller 130 output 547 (heat pump polarity), as described
          in Table 3. Switch 831 may be comprised of a series of relays,
          for example. Controller output 546, heat pump ON/OFF, now
          controls compressor 866. <br>

          Abstract -- A local humidity control system and method are
          provided for a low temperature electronic device assembly
          wherein a surface of the low temperature electronic device
          assembly is maintained above an ambient dew point. The local
          humidity control system includes a first layer of thermal
          insulation at least partially surrounding and contacting the
          cooled electronic device, and a second layer of thermal
          insulation surrounding the first layer of thermal insulation
          and the cooled electronic device in which a volume is defined
          between the first and second layers of insulation. A heater
          assembly interfaces with the volume to heat the volume to a
          temperature sufficient to maintain the surface of the cooled
          electronic device above the ambient dew point. The heater
          assembly includes a thin film heater attached to the first
          layer of thermal insulation to maintain temperature of the
          surface above the ambient dew point, and a wire mesh heater
          suspended within the volume to lower relative humidity in the
          volume and inhibit the ingress of water vapor.<br>
