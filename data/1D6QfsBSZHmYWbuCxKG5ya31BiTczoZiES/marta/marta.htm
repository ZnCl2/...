        <div align="left"><b>The invention </b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          At the beginning of the 1980s a young Hungarian physicist,
          Márta Fenyo and her research team discovered the stimulative
          effect of polarized light on all living biological systems,
          including the significant invigoration of the self-healing
          abilities of the human body, when used in human therapy. This
          is mainly explained by the effect of polarized light on the
          regeneration, revitalization and harmonization of cell
          function.<br>
          <br>
          Jointly with her team the inventor developed and created the
          lamp emitting polarized light designed for the treatment of
          human body. After all, the first therapeutic apparatus based
          on the Hungarian invention started its worldwide career in
          Switzerland. Since then this healing apparatus has become
          indispensable for doctors, hospitals, clinics, private
          practitioners and private persons. Millions of people use this
          healing lamp the world over, with excellent results.<br>
          <br>
          The sources of polarized light manufactured earlier were
          designed to conduct successful treatment of only restricted
          surfaces at a time. Even this design of the apparatus was
          highly successful in the treatment of various skin problems,
          wounds, arthritis, sports injuries, and head skin and hair
          problems.<br>
          <br>
          <b>THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The research conducted so far and the results achieved have
          decidedly proven that, along with the local treatments,
          polarized light therapy has new and amazing opportunities. In
          the background of all spectacular cases of local healing is
          invariably the stimulating effect of polarized light on the
          immune system, blood circulation and oxygen supply of the
          cells. Based on the findings of recent years this effect can
          now be amplified to cover, in a single treatment of relatively
          short duration, the entire surface of the human body whereby
          the effect of biological stimulation is rapidly transmitted to
          all cells of the body, positively influencing their function.<br>
          <br>
          When treating the entire surface of the body the polarized
          light immediately gets through to the blood stream via the
          capillary veins thanks to the roughly 1 cm penetration depth,
          thus rapidly transmitting through the blood circulation the
          biological stimulation effect to all cells and vital organs of
          the human organism such as the heart, the liver, the stomach,
          the spleen, the kidneys and the endocrine glands, etc.,
          thereby exerting a systemic effect on their function.<br>
          <br>
          <b>WHAT ARE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THE SURROUND
            BODY-SURFACE LIGHT TREATMENT?</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Polarized light significantly enhances the activity of the
          immune-competent cells, stabilises the cell membrane of red
          blood cells and enhances their ability to bind and retain
          oxygen.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment using polarized light significantly stimulates
          the activity of T-lymphocytes responsible for recognising and
          defeating millions of faulty cells produced minute by minute
          in the human body that subsequently become responsible for
          serious illnesses and malignant deformations, thereby
          preventing more or less serious illnesses as well as
          facilitating and accelerating the recovery from protracted
          illnesses.<br>
          <br>
          Through the enhanced ability of the red blood cells to bind
          and retain oxygen more vital oxygen becomes available for each
          cell, organ and system thereby enhancing the efficiency of
          musculature and vital organs in growth and function. To sum
          up, body surface surround treatment using polarized light may
          significantly strengthen the immunization of the entire system<br>

          Inventor:<br>
          FENYO MARTA<br>
          <br>
          Lighting unit for producing linearly polarized light directed
          onto a target surface comprising a source unit producing light
          in the visible spectral range, and an optically translucent
          polarizing front unit ( 4 ) providing protection against
          external effects. The source unit and the polarizing front
          unit ( 4 ) are placed in a housing ( 8 ) in which an electric
          cable passes through. The source unit ( 1 ) contains at least
          one panel ( 2 ) having a number of high intensity LED devices
          ( 3 ) arranged in a predetermined pattern on one of its sides.
          The polarizing front unit ( 4 ) contains at least one
          optically transparent rigid carrier and a polarizing filter
          foil applied onto the carrier. The housing ( 8 ) keeps the
          polarizing front unit ( 4 ) in a fixed position so that they
          confine a hermetically closed inner space.; The panel ( 2 ) is
          positioned parallel with the polarizing unit ( 4 ) within the
          inner space so that the LED devices ( 3 ) face towards the
          polarizing front unit ( 4 ).<br>
          <br>
          [0001] The invention relates to a lighting unit for producing
          linearly polarized light directed onto a target surface, the
          lighting unit comprises at least a source unit producing light
          in the visible spectral range and an optically translucent
          polarizing front unit providing protection against external
          effects, the source unit and the polarizing front unit are
          placed in a housing in which an electric cable passes through.<br>
          <br>
          [0002] It is known that polarized, especially linearly
          polarized light is beneficial to vital functions and is
          capable for strengthening the organism to combat disorders. In
          case of humans it can be used for general conditioning. In
          case of animal husbandry it can be used in order to increase
          yield and to treat certain inflammatory diseases.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Consequently, a compact lighting unit is needed which
          can be installed easily and is able to emit light with
          required intensity in the proper direction. Advantageously the
          units are extendable by simple multiplication of them
          depending on the purpose and the circumstances.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] EP 0,279,002 described an arrangement for producing
          polarized light where the spectral range of the emitted light
          is basically found in the UV range. There is no proposal for
          special use of the polarized light in the visible range.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] At the same time U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,604 described a
          polarizer of the Brewster kind to create biostimulation. The
          light emission efficiency is, however, not properly handled.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The document WO 9309847 disclosed a device for
          photometric stimulation of living cells, where diodes produce
          light in three separate wavelengths. The solution lacks
          continual emitted light wavelength in a given range, therefore
          no sufficient effects on the living cells were experienced.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] It has been realized that the recently available
          relatively cheap so called high intensity LED devices with
          growing light output and improved efficiency are suitable for
          embodiments of divided units or panels substantially emitting
          light from a plane in a continuous wavelength range, and may
          be used for forming a lighting unit according to the object of
          the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Accordingly, the source unit of the lighting equipment
          described in the preamble contains at least one panel which
          has a number of high intensity LED devices arranged in a
          predetermined pattern on one of its sides. The polarizing
          front unit contains at least one optically transparent rigid
          carrier, and a polarizing filter foil applied onto the
          carrier. At least a portion of the housing is made from heat
          conductive material, and it keeps the polarizing front unit in
          a fixed position so that they confine a hermetically closed
          inner space. The panel is positioned in a fixed way parallel
          with the polarizing unit within the inner space so that the
          high intensity LED devices face towards the polarizing front
          unit.<br>
          <br>

          <b> </b><b>[0024] FIG. 15 is a schematic view of an extended
            lighting unit comprising several units connected to each
            other.</b><br>
          <br>
          [0025] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a fragment of an
          exemplary lighting unit according to the invention, in which a
          source unit 1 producing light in the <br>
          visible and near infrared spectral range and an optically
          translucent polarizing front unit 4 providing protection
          against external effects can be seen. Source unit 1 and
          polarizing unit 4 are placed in a housing 8. Source unit 1
          contains at least one panel 2 which has a number of high
          intensity LED devices 3 arranged in a predetermined pattern on
          one of its sides. In FIG. 1 this pattern is a matrix. An
          electric cabel (not shown) passing somewhere through housing 8
          supplies energy for LED devices 3. The same source unit 1 may
          contain a number of separate panels 2 or these panels may be
          attached to each other in a releasable manner.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] According to FIG. 2 the polarizing front unit 4
          contains at least one optically transparent rigid carrier 5
          and a polarizing filter foil 7 applied onto the carrier 5. At
          least a portion of housing 8 is made from heat conductive
          material, for example metal in order to reduce the heat
          developing during operation. To reduce the heat of the inner
          space 11 also any other known means, for example
          heat-insulating paint layer might be proper. Polarizing front
          unit 4 is fixed to housing 8 by means of a frame 9 so that
          they confine a hermetically closed inner space 11. Panel 2 is
          positioned in a fixed way parallel with the polarizing front
          unit 4 within inner space 11 so that the high intensity LED
          devices 3 face towards the polarizing front unit 4.
          Optionally, cooling flange 16 may also be applied at the
          bottom part of housing 8 in order to reduce heat developing in
          the inner space 11.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] In respect of this invention the term LED devices is
          used for all high-efficiency light emitting semiconductor
          devices and structures currently manufactured in
          mass-production and available in trade. These devices and
          structures are continuously developed in order to reach higher
          and higher luminous efficiency. Such devices emit light within
          the visible and near infrared spectral range in the form of
          white light which may have different colour temperatures. In
          the present invention the term LED devices 3 is used in a
          comprehensive meaning, especially for known high-intensity,
          high-power LED (Light Emitting Diode) or OLED (Organic Light
          Emitting Diode) devices. The latter renders possible to use a
          plane luminous foil which-theoretically-may be cut to an
          optional size. Also LEP (Light Emitting Polymer) devices may
          be used. To sum it up, according to the present invention all
          those devices may be regarded as LED devices 3 which are known
          as SSL (Solid State Lighting) electronic devices in the state
          of the art. Current possibilities in trade make dominantly the
          use of discrete LED devices feasible.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] FIG. 3 shows the cross-section of a possible structure
          of the polarizing front unit 4. The optically transparent
          rigid carrier 5 together with a similar carrier 6 form a
          sandwich structure surrounding the polarizing filter foil 7.
          This polarizing filter foil may be applied onto either carrier
          5 or carrier 6. Application may be performed by sticking,
          heat-treatment, etc. It is also possible that polarizing
          filter foil 7 is simply kept in its place by exertion of a
          mechanical force. Polarizing filter foils are known and
          commercially available. Advantageously, the polarizing filter
          foil 7 is highly transparent, preferably it has a
          light-transmitting capacity of more than 40%. Advantageously,
          the carriers 5 and 6 are made of plexi-glass, transparent
          polycarbonate or similar plastic material, however glass or
          hardened glass may also be appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] According to FIG. 4 only a single carrier 5 is used. In
          this case polarizing front unit 4 contains a polarizing filter
          foil 7 applied onto carrier 5 by using one of the applying
          methods previously described.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] As it was mentioned LED devices 3 are arranged on one
          of the sides of panel 2 in a predetermined pattern. This
          pattern may be a matrix containing a number of rows m and
          columns n as it is shown in FIG. 5 or the LED devices 3 may be
          arranged concentrically as it can be seen in FIG. 6. Further,
          the LED devices 3 may be arranged in an undulating line as it
          is shown in FIG. 9 or they may be distributed along a straight
          line according to FIG. 10. As it is shown in FIG. 7 the light
          source may be different in the same pattern. In this case in
          addition to LED devices 3 compound LED devices 13 containing
          several LED components 3' arranged in a starlike pattern as
          shown in FIG. 8 may be used. These LED devices 13 are
          available in trade. The LED devices 3 and compound LED devices
          13 may be arranged in like manner as it is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Preferably, in certain applications most of the LED
          devices 3 placed in the lighting unit emit warm white light.
          However, it is possible that a small number of LED devices 3
          emitting coloured light are also applied.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] It is an object of the lighting unit according to the
          invention to produce relatively directed linearly polarized
          light instead of diffused light with divergent beams. For this
          purpose an additional optical element 15 decreasing the light
          emitting space angle [alpha] of the LED devices 3 may be
          positioned before the LED devices 3 or at least before some of
          them. This can be a lens as it is shown in FIG. 11. The
          original space angle [alpha] of the light emitted from LED
          device 3 is cut down to space angle [beta] by means of the
          optical element (lens) 15. Space angle 1 is smaller than space
          angle [alpha]. It proves to be good if the resultant space
          angle 1 before the polarizing front unit 4 has an aperture
          angle of 10-50[deg.]. For practical purposes in case of large
          surfaces the optically transparent rigid carriers 5 or 6 of
          polarizing front unit 4 may contain a Fresnel lens.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The lighting unit according to the invention can be
          used for certain therapeutic purposes-not detailed in the
          present description-if the intensity of the resultant light
          measured at a distance of 0.5 m from the polarizing front unit
          4 is between 5-60 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; . Advantageously this value
          is between 30-40 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; .<br>
          <br>
          [0034] An alternative embodiment of the lighting unit
          described with reference to FIG. 1 can be seen in FIG. 12.
          Panel 12 of the source unit is bent so that it has a convex
          surface with respect to polarizing front unit 14. Polarizing
          front unit 14 is bent similarly. In this manner the distance
          between panel 12 and polarizing front unit 14 is constant.
          These bendings must be performed in one dimension (in order to
          guarantee linear polarization) and they result in a
          cylindrical surface, as it is shown in FIG. 12. The direction
          of polarization of the polarizing filter foil 7 is parallel
          with the axis of the cylinder. The shape of the housing 18 is
          optional, it may be different from the one shown in the
          Figure. Advantageously, its inner surface is coated with
          light-reflecting material.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] In another alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 13 the
          filter and the light source are interchanged, and panel 12'
          containing LED devices 3 is bent so that it has a concave
          surface with respect to polarizing front unit 14'. Again, the
          shape of the housing 18' is optional, it may be different from
          the one shown in the Figure.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] An extended version of the embodiments shown in FIGS.
          12 and 13 can bee seen in FIG. 14 in which the bendings result
          in a complete cylinder. Cylinder surfaces 20 and 21 are not
          designated as panels 12, 12' or polarizing front units 14, 14'
          indicating by this that they are interchangeable.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] The lighting unit according to the invention in its
          entirety may be disc-shaped or parallelepiped. Especially the
          latter has an advantage that the shape of the individual
          lighting units makes possible to extend it by further units,
          i.e. several lighting units can be connected (both
          mechanically and electrically) to each other easily. In FIG.
          15 the side of housing 8 is provided with a mechanical
          connecting element 10 by means of which a plurality of
          rectangular lighting units 22 can be connected to each other
          so that their polarizing front units are in the same plane.
          Connecting elements 10 may be provided on all four sides of
          the housing 8 while counterparts are formed on the opposite
          sides. In this manner extension according to FIG. 15 can be
          performed easily. Connecting element 10 is also shown
          symbolically in FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] The lighting unit according to the present invention
          has several advantages, for example in the specific
          utilization of the enhancement of the productivity of dairy
          farms. Any other kind of breeding animals can also be a scope
          of utilisation of the present invention. It can be implemented
          simply, it is mobile and can be extended easily without the
          need for changing the already installed units. Further, it
          does not get overheated in spite of the dust- and
          vapour-resistant closed housing.<br>

          A procedure for relaxing the human organism, improving its
          general condition, increasing the capability of its natural
          protective mechanism, alleviating the state of stress,
          improving the frame of mind and balancing the blood- and
          lymph-circulation. During the procedure the patient is made
          comfortable in a sitting and/or reclining position and is
          exposed to polarised light of at least 100 but at most 400 Lux
          intensity, and the light treatment has a duration of at least
          20 minutes, and during the whole light treatment at least 4 J
          but preferably 10 J per cm&lt;2&gt; energy is transmitted to
          the patient, and simultaneously with the light treatment also
          sound therapy is applied with an intensity of at least 30dB,
          but at most 80 dB. Additionally appropriate aroma- and oxygen-
          therapy is applied.<br>
          <br>
          The invention relates to an arrangement for relaxing the human
          organism, improving its general condition and for increasing
          the capability of its natu<br>
          ral protective mechanism, alleviating the state of stress,
          improving the frame of mind and the capacity to perform,
          balancing the blood-and lymph-circulation, comprising a source
          of light arranged in an enclosed place and a sitting or

          HU 186 081 describes an equipment aimed at stimulating the
          biologic processes connected with the cellular activity,
          especially at aiding the healing of<br>
          the pathologic formations located on the surface of the body
          e. g. wounds, sores and other lesions, containing a light
          source producing light of a wavelength in excess of 300
          nanometers. There are a polariser and a light deflector system
          integrated to the light source producing incoherent light ;
          the light deflector system aligns the light beam into the
          required direction. The polariser is either attached to the
          light source or separated from it.<br>
          <br>
          It is a generally accepted concept that both the negative
          environmental effects and the stress or other negative psychic
          effects weaken the human immune system.<br>
          <br>
          There is very limited opportunity and time to counterbalance
          these negative effects under the present conditions and
          conduct of life. It would be highly desirable to compensate
          all these negative effects. (See 0. Carl Simonton, Stephanie
          Matthews-Simonton, James L. Creighton : Getting Well Again

          <br>
          It is a known and experimentally proved fact that the
          treatment with polarised light has a stimulating effect on the
          immune system, it improves the peripheral circulation of blood
          and stimulates the metabolism of the tissues on the body
          surface and below. (See : Fenyo, M. : Theoretical and
          Experimental Basis of Biostimulation (Optics and
          Laser-Technology, 1984 ; 16 : 209-215 ; Kubasova T., Fenyo, M.

          Light (Photochemistry and Photobiology, Vol. 48, No. 4. Pp.
          505-509, 1988, and Kubasova T., Fenyo, M. : Effect of Visible
          Light on Some Cellular and Immune Parameters (Immunology and
          Cell Biology, Vol. 73, pp. 239-244, 1995).<br>
          <br>
          Physiotherapeutic treatments are generally applied in a
          successive manner, successively (and independently from one
          another) while the skilled persons responsible for the
          treatment monitor the effect achieved during the treatment. In
          order to avoid the unfavourable co-effect of the treatments
          and also for the better monitoring of them, it is not
          customary to apply simultaneously the different treatments.<br>
          <br>
          In this context our experience shows that the treatment with
          polarised light can be applied simultaneously with other
          treatments without significant<br>
          danger of unfavourable co-effect.<br>
          <br>
          We have recognised that the negative effects can be
          counterbalanced far more effectively if the light treatment
          using polarised light to stimulate the immune system is
          combined with other treatments and/or the stimulation of the
          sensory organs.<br>
          <br>
          Not only the intensity and the quantity of transmitted energy
          are important in the treatment with polarised light, but also
          the colour of the light and even the sight registered with the
          sensory organ. From a mentalistic aspect the use of suitable
          sound effect and/or aroma therapy during the light treatment
          are especially important. Suitable physical stimulations, too
          have a favourable effect on the results of the treatment with
          polarised light.<br>
          <br>
          The increase of the oxygen contents and especially of the
          negative oxygen ion contents of the inhaled air shows
          favourable physiological effects in the case of all healthy
          cells of the organism.<br>
          <br>
          When applying stimulus to the sensory organs we have noted
          that the treatment of a significant part of the body surface
          with polarised light (for instance one whole side of the body)
          besides stimulating the immune system WO 01/457803 showed
          favourable effects both on the metabolism and on the
          performance capacity and mood of the person treated.<br>
          <br>
          The deficiency of the known equipment is that it is suitable
          only to stimulate locally the biologic processes connected
          with the cellular activity.<br>
          <br>
          We have recognised that by applying polarised light of a
          suitable colour and intensity to the treatment of the entire
          body and complementing it with<br>
          suitably selected sound effects, it is possible to relax the
          human organism and to improve its general condition.
          Simultaneously the capability of the natural protective
          mechanism of the organism increases, the state of stress is
          alleviated, the blood-and lymph-circulation becomes more
          balanced and the performance capacity and mood of the treated
          person improves.<br>
          <br>
          Based on this recognition, a process was developed to relax
          the human organism, improve its general condition, reduce the
          state of stress, improve its<br>
          performance capability and mood, and to balance the blood-and
          lymph circulation. In this process a person or patient to be
          treated is placed in a com<br>
          fortable sitting and/or reclining position and is illuminated
          with a light of suitable intensity. Light treatment is applied
          for at least 20 but at most 60 minutes. During the full time
          of this light treatment the patient receives at least 4 J,
          preferably 10 J but at most 40 J energy per cm2. For values
          below 4 J either the positive effect becomes negligible or the
          time of treatment must be continued for unacceptably long
          periods ; for values over 40 J undesired skin reaction could
          occur and the too intensive light prevents relaxing. In
          parallel to the light treatment also sound therapy is applied,
          having a volume of at least 30 dB, but at most 80 dB. Volumes
          below 30 dB in a city environment are commensurable with the
          background noise and therefore lower values, for instance 20
          dB can only be used in a very quiet environment. Volumes over
          80 dB in most cases do not help relaxation.<br>
          <br>
          Well-known physiotherapeutic treatments like for instance
          massaging and different electric treatments are applied in
          conjunction with the light treat<br>
          ment and sound therapy if required.<br>
          <br>
          Optionally aroma therapy treatments are applied with the use
          of suitable aromas in parallel with the light treatment. The
          harmonisation of the appropriate colour and aroma is of
          particular importance.<br>
          <br>
          Optionally also visual treatment can be applied in conjunction
          with the light treatment and sound therapy wherein suitable
          equipment is used to stimulate the patient with visual
          effects. Clearly, the colour of the light treatment, the sound
          effects and the visual effects must harmonise.<br>
          <br>
          It is also possible to monitor the physical condition of the
          patient during the treatment, for instance the frequency of
          respiration or heart-beat, blood<br>
          pressure, skin resistance, frequency of motions, etc. On the
          basis of these data the effect achieved by the treatment can
          be observed and monitored during the treatment, the intensity
          and duration of the treatment can be adjusted, e. g. weakened,
          shortened or can be strengthened, intensified and lengthened,
          respectively, as necessary.<br>
          <br>
          Before starting the light treatment it is necessary to
          determine the colour and intensity of the light treatment and
          the character and volume of the sound therapy to be applied in
          parallel. It can be determined also how the intensity and the
          colour of the light treatment should change during the light
          treatment and how should the different sound effects and their
          volume change.<br>
          <br>
          If necessary, the above prescription has to be complemented by
          prescribing the duration of the applied physiotherapy and if
          different types of physiotherapeutical treatments are applied,
          their sequence and intensity.<br>
          <br>
          Light treatment can be complemented by oxygen treatment where
          the concentration of ionised oxygen of the air inhaled by the
          patient is increased.<br>
          <br>
          All these different treatments have therapeutic effect both in
          conjunction and separately, too. Their joint application
          however is more far-reaching. For instance, with the use of
          adequate sound-and image-effects the process of relaxation and
          learning can be deepened and accelerated. In general it is
          possible to influence the state of consciousness while instead
          of becoming tired the patient becomes more lively and his
          capacity to perform increases significantly.<br>
          <br>
          Our experiences prove that this is enhanced by the polarised
          character of the light.<br>
          <br>
          In the sense of the invention we have developed an arrangement
          for relaxing the human organism, improving the general
          well-being and mood of the<br>
          patient, for increasing his capacity to perform and the
          capability of his natural protective mechanism, for
          alleviating the state of stress and for balancing the
          blood-and lymph-circulation, with the arrangement comprising a
          light source arranged in an enclosed place and a contrivance
          for sitting and/or reclining. In accordance with the invention
          there is a polarised filter placed at a distance of at least
          one of the walls of the room, covering 50% but at least 4 m2
          of the wall in question. The light sources are located between
          the polarising filter and the said wall of the room. The size
          of the surface illuminated by the light source must be enough
          to cover in full the reclining and/or sitting contrivance. The
          light sources emit different light spectrums and each spectrum
          has a characteristic colour. A colour adjustment device is
          connected to the light sources which switches on the different
          colour light sources as prescribed. Furthermore there is at
          least one loudspeaker in the room, connected to an
          audio-amplifying equipment In accordance with the invention a
          physiotherapeutic device, for instance a massaging device can
          be advantageously connected to the reclining and/or sitting
          contrivance. Furthermore there is a displaying device, for
          instance a projection screen is arranged advantageously in the
          room to which a projecting device, for instance a projector or
          a video-player is connected.<br>
          <br>
          The room can be equipped also with an oxygen source, with the
          aid of which for instance, through a mask, the patient can
          inhale air with high ionised oxygen concentration, and can
          inhale in this same manner also the appropriate aromatic
          material. Both the light sources, the physiotherapeutic
          equipment, the sound sources (acoustical generator) and the
          aroma source can be connected to a central controller unit
          through the controllers attached to the different devices.<br>
          <br>
          Sensors connected to the data collector can be arranged near
          to or attached to the reclining and/or sitting contrivance.
          The data collector, too, is connected to the central
          controlling unit. The room can further be equipped with
          decorations, for instance with a background picture. If
          necessary, the back WO 01/457806 ground picture can be set up
          in a manner to allow variability.<br>
          <br>
          The invention will be described on the basis of the attached
          drawing. In the drawing Figure 1. is the schematic design of
          the arrangement of the subject matter of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          The implementation shown in Figure 1 is arranged in an
          enclosed place (room) 1, where a polarising filter 2 is placed
          below the ceiling 7 at a distance<br>
          from it. The polarising filter 2 covers the largest part of
          the ceiling 7 of the room 1, in the present arrangement part
          of the room 1 is sectioned out with the partitioning wall 21
          and the polarising filter 2 is set up to this partitioning
          wall 21.<br>
          <br>
          There are light sources 3 arranged between the polarising
          filter 2 and the ceiling 7, made in the form of fluorescent
          lamps of different colours and radiating in different spectral
          ranges. Near to one of the walls of the room 1 there is a
          reclining and/or sitting contrivance 4 arranged in a position,
          that allows the person in it to see the furthest wall of the
          room 1. There is an opening 22 made on the partitioning wall
          21 through which the displaying device, for instance
          projection screen 15 mounted or placed on the wall of the room
          1 behind the partitioning wall 21 can be seen. There are
          loudspeakers 5 in the room 1, which in this case are placed at
          the two opposite sides of the partitioning wall 21.
          Furthermore, decoration 6 can be installed in the room 1.
          There are furthermore an ionizator 18 and an aroma source 14
          installed in the room 1. The colour adjustment unit 8
          controlling the light sources 3 and the audio-amplifying
          equipment 9 are connected to the central control unit 12. A
          physiotherapeutic equipment 10, for in<br>
          stance a massaging device, electro-therapeutic device, etc can
          be attached to the reclining and/or sitting contrivance.
          Different sensors connected to a data collector 13 can also be
          attached to the reclining and/or sitting contrivance 4.<br>
          <br>
          With the aid of these sensors it is possible to collect data
          about the frequency of heart beat or breathing, blood
          pressure, motions and the different parameters indicating the
          physical state of the patient being in the reclining and/or
          sitting contrivance 4.<br>
          <br>
          It is very important, especially if the environment is
          polluted, to have an WO 01/457807 aerator 20 installed in the
          room 1 which-equipped with a suitable air filter-will blow
          clean air into the room 1. An oxygen source 19 can also be
          connected to the aerator 20 to increase the oxygen
          concentration in the room 1. An aroma source controller 11 can
          be connected to the aroma source 14 which can be set up in a
          form suitable to emit in a controlled manner one or more
          aromas, equipped for instance with a controllable heating
          device-which, if adjusted as prescribed can emit different
          fragrances into the room 1 for the prescribed length of time
          and in the prescribed order. The aroma source 14 can be
          combined also with the aerator 20, in which case the air blown
          in contains the desired aroma. These devices can be combined
          and then it will be possible to use a device which contains an
          air filter, a source of oxygen (discharger), an ionizator and
          also an aroma source. The outlet of the device is-through a
          flexible tube-connected to a mask which can be put on the face
          of the patient. Different appliances can be installed in the
          part of the room 1 separated by the partitioning wall 21,
          preferably outside the field of vision of the person in the
          reclining and/or sitting contrivance 4. Such appliance could
          be for instance the projector 16 associated with the
          displaying device 15, which projects motion pictures onto the
          displaying device 15 with the aid of suitable optical
          accessories, for instance mirrors. The projector 16 could for
          instance be a video player, while the displaying device 15
          could be a large size screen connected to it. One or more
          different background pictures 17 can also be set up in this
          separate part of the room 1, which can be mounted on the
          displaying device 15 or the displaying device 15 can be
          covered by those.<br>
          <br>
          There should preferably be among the light sources 3 types
          that emit rays in the ultra violet range (UV-A and UV-B), this
          should only be done how<br>
          ever if the polarising filter 2 is permeable for the radiation
          in that range. If the polarising filter 2 is not permeable for
          these ultra violet rays, a separate source of light emitting
          ultra violet rays could be installed in the room 1, which
          polarises the ultra violet rays with the aid of suitable
          optical accessories, for instance with mirrors or filters.
          This is important because the ultra violet radiation, in spite
          of all its useful characteristics, can also have harmful
          effects in certain cases (for WO 01/457808 instance it is
          known to have carcinogen effect), and these harmful effects
          can be counterbalanced with polarisation. Polarised light has
          a stimulating effect on the immune system and it has been
          proved experimentally that it is useful in arresting and
          inhibiting the generation or propagation of malign skin
          deformations.<br>
          <br>
          Thus physiologically polarised ultra violet light is far more
          favourable than the not polarised one.<br>
          <br>
          There is an adequate number of light tubes mounted on the
          ceiling 7 of the room 1 in such a manner that there are 6-10
          light tubes of different colours<br>
          for each 50 cm area evenly distributed by colour.<br>
          <br>
          It is evident that by turning on light tubes in the
          appropriate number and colour, both the intensity and the
          colour of the light can be varied within broad<br>
          limits. The physiologic effect of light is known and in
          certain cases is used to influence the state of mind and mood
          of people. All these effects are enhanced if the immune system
          of the patient is stimulated with the help of polarised light
          in parallel with influencing his state of mind. A very
          positive effect can be achieved by simultaneously improving
          the state of mind and the performance capacity as well as
          stimulating the immune system, and stress alleviation effect
          can be achieved with light treatment of appropriate intensity,
          colour and duration.<br>
          <br>
          The stress alleviation and relaxing effect of the treatment
          with polarised light can be enhanced with a sound (audio)
          treatment applied simultaneously.<br>
          <br>
          With the aid of the audio-amplifying equipment 9 used in the
          arrangement of the subject matter of the invention the sound,
          music, noise or background noise corresponding to the desired
          effect can be produced. Audio tapes, records, synthetisers
          equipped with suitable programming device, computer, etc. can
          be used for this purpose, but also other sound generating
          devices can be utilised, for instance gongs, bells, whistles
          or other musical instruments.<br>
          <br>
          Certain people feel isolated if they are alone in an enclosed
          place, room 1. This unpleasant feeling can be significantly
          reduced with the use of decora<br>
          tion 6 which effectively enhances the visual effect exercised
          through the displaying device 15.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally, it is possible to set up more than one reclining
          and/or sitting contrivances 4 in the room 1 and thus the
          different services and treatments can<br>
          be offered to several people simultaneously. Naturally, in the
          treatment of more than one person the provision of the
          individual programs cannot clash, and therefore the
          arrangement of the subject matter of the invention on
          occasions will provide treatment to one person only.<br>
          <br>
          Before starting the procedure which is made possible by the
          arrangement of the subject matter of the invention, it is
          necessary to prescribe the steps to be taken, their intensity,
          duration and sequence. The spectrum to be used (dominant
          colour, UV-A and UV-B components), the intensity and the
          fragrances to be used in parallel to them must be determined
          taking into account the desired effect and the condition of
          the patient to be treated. The most important aim when
          determining the sound effect to be used is for it to produce
          the effect that suits the wishes and health condition of the
          patient (stress alleviation, relaxation, increase of
          performance, deepening of knowledge, etc.).<br>

        </div>
        <div align="left"> It can be seen that by the arrangement of the
          subject matter of the invention, a procedure based on the use
          of polarised light is suitable for a large variety of uses. It
          is however important to note that the treatment is ineffective
          if the energy of the light treatment remains below the value
          of 4 J per cm2 for one treatment. There is practically no
          upper limit, but in the case of too intensive illumination
          (with an intensity of over 500 Lux) the light can be
          disturbing and thus the beneficial effect can be diminished.
          For this reason, the use of illumination has to happen with an
          intensity between 100-400 Lux but preferably with 200 Lux.<br>
          <br>
          It is important principally from the aspect of relaxation and
          stress allevia- tion that the duration of the treatment be at
          least 20 minutes, but preferably 30 minutes. In the case of
          treatments of more than 60 minutes the beneficial effect will
          not increase noticeably. The treatment is more effective if it
          is periodically repeated for instance every day or at least
          every week. It is beneficial to apply the treatment in the
          form of a cure, and a cure should preferably comprise 6-12
          sessions. The cure could be advantageously complemented by a
          diet or nutrition complements ; food additives, teas,
          medicinal herbs can be used in parallel.<br>

          <b>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          A method and apparatus for the stimulation of biological
          processes related to cellular activity, particularly for
          promoting the healing of lesions on the body surface i.e.
          wounds, ulcers and various epithelial injuries.<br>
          <br>
          The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the
          stimulation of biological processes related to cellular
          activity, particularly for promoting the healing of lesions on
          the body-surface i.e. wounds, ulcers and various epithelial
          injuries, which is based upon the use of the biostimulating
          effect of light.<br>
          <br>
          The irradiation of a living surface with laser light has, as
          it is widely known, a biostimulating effect. The experiments
          in this field have been conducted since 1967 under the
          guidance of professor Endre Mester and the initially modest
          presumptions have been broadly proven since that time. The
          healing effect of the treatment with laser light has already a
          very broad literature. The summary of experiences is included
          among other publications e.g. in the work of professor Endre
          Mester: "Laser Application in Promoting of Wound-Healing",
          published in the 1980 issue of the "Laser in Medicine" (edited
          by H. K. Koebner, Wiley-Interscience Publ. 1980.). Another
          work by professor Endre Mester: "Der Laser" can also be
          regarded as a summary of his experiences (edited by K. Dinstl
          and P. L. Fischer, Springer-Verlag, 1981.). It should be noted
          that in contrast to the laser light, no other treatments
          carried out by natural or artificial light have manifested any
          biostimulating effect thus far.<br>
          <br>
          The healing effect of the laser light becomes apparent mainly
          in the healing of refractory wounds and ulcers. It is well
          known that such lingering ulcers develop fairly frequently on
          aged people suffering from cardiovascular troubles. Refractory
          bed-sores also tend to develop as a consequence of prolonged
          decubitus.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of treatment with laser light, the laser light
          is directed onto the wound by means of a prism, a mirror or a
          fibre-optic and the entire surface of the wound is scanned by
          the correspondingly deflected beam. The specific intensity of
          the beam is between 20-150 mW/cm@2, and the maximum energy
          density is set to be about 4 J/cm@2. The treatment is usually
          recurrent, performed generally twice a week and the average
          time of healing is estimated to be about 10-12 weeks.<br>
          <br>
          There are a great number of mutually contradictory theories,
          attempting to explain the biostimulating effect of the laser
          light, however, none of these could provide a scientifically
          acceptable explanation.<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of the published results laser light would have a
          wide field of application, however, practical experiences show
          that it did not come into general use to an extent which it
          would deserve by its efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          There are several reasons that slow down the wide scale
          acceptance of this treatment, one of which might be that the
          design of continuously operating lasers providing the required
          output and beam diameter is rather complicated and besides the
          sophisticated technical environment they also require special
          skills during manufacture.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The object of the invention is to provide a method and an
          apparatus that can establish a biostimulating effect, at least
          equivalent to that of the laser light, without the technical
          difficulties connected with the generation of laser light.<br>
          <br>
          For solving this task it has been considered as a starting
          point that in its physiological state, the lipid bilayer of
          the cell membrane is in a phase similar to that of liquid
          crystals. It is known from the interaction between polarized
          light and liquid crystals, that over a certain intensity
          threshold polarized light can induce a change of state in
          liquid crystals. It has been assumed that polarized light of
          certain properties can reorder the polar heads of the lipid
          bilayer of the cell membrane or it can induce such a
          reordering process. It has also been expected that such an
          internal re-arrangement would bring about a noticable change
          in the cellular processes related to and taking place through
          the cell membrane.<br>
          <br>
          The essence of the invention is the recognition of the fact,
          that the biostimulating effect is attributable in the first
          place to the application of polarized light rather than to
          that of laser light, and the laser light has such an effect
          only because it represents a form of polarized light, too.
          Consequently, the normal, incoherent light can also trigger a
          biostimulating effect, provided it is linearly polarized.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention a method has been provided for the
          stimulation of biological processes related to cellular
          activity, particularly for promoting the healing of lesions on
          the body-surface, i.e. wounds, ulcers and various epithelial
          injuries, during which the pathological area is irradiated
          with a light of given intensity in which the improvement lies
          in that the irradiation is carried out by a linearly polarized
          light containing non-coherent components of wavelength
          exceeding 300 nm.<br>
          <br>
          According to a preferable embodiment the intensity of the
          irradiating light is adjusted between 20 and 150 mW/cm@2.<br>
          <br>
          It is advantageous for the healing process if the irradiation
          is carried out in intermittent periods and the energy density
          of the light during the treatment does not exceed 5 J/cm@2.
          With such an energy the re-arrangement process in the membrane
          can reach a saturation and the application of higher energies
          might not provide further benefits.<br>
          <br>
          The light beam used for the treatment should comprise
          substantially parallel rays of continuous or quasi-continuous
          spectral distribution at least in the 400-700 nm wave-length
          range and the beam should fall substantially normal to the
          surface to be treated.<br>
          <br>
          If the sectional area of the light bundle is less than the
          area of the pathological body-surface to be treated, it is
          expedient to perform irradiation by displacing the beam of
          light and the area under treatment in relation to each other
          in such a way, that the circumferential region of the area
          under treatment is irradiated first, then approach is made
          towards the centre region in a circular path. It is preferable
          if the beam has at least a 3 cm@2 sectional area and the
          treatment is performed at normal room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention an apparatus has also been provided
          for the stimulation of biological processes related to
          cellular activity, particularly for promoting the healing of
          lesions on the body surface i.e. wounds, ulcers and various
          epithelial injuries, comprising a light source in which the
          improvement lies in that the light source comprises a lamp
          emitting non-coherent light with spectral components exceeding
          300 nm, a light deflecting system placed in the path of the
          light beams to project the light into a given direction of
          treatment, and a polarizer inserted in said path to produce
          polarized light beams approaching the surface to be treated.
          In the preferable embodiment an ultraviolet filter and in
          given cases an infrared filter is inserted into the path of
          the beams.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferable embodiment a reflector surface is arranged
          behind the lampto reflect forward the backwardly projected
          light beams. The reflector surface can be made of a cold
          mirror having preferably a spherical shape or the shape of a
          paraboloid of rotation. The light source can be a normal
          incandescent bulb or preferably a metal-halogen bulb.<br>
          <br>
          The polarizer may comprise a sheet polarizer, a specular
          polarizer, a Nicol's prism or any other means capable of
          producing polarized light beams.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus according to the invention is preferably mounted
          in a tubular housing, the length of which is sufficient for
          the suppression of diverging direct light beams with
          divergence angles exceeding 15 DEG.<br>
          <br>
          A fan is mounted behind the reflector surface to provide
          sufficient cooling.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferable embodiment the light deflecting system
          comprises lenses. The lens, when mounted in front of the
          reflector surface and provided with different coating
          materials on each side for filtering out the ultraviolet and
          infrared wave-length components can offer preferable features
          from the point of view of directing the light. In an other
          embodiment the reflector surface is of the shape of a
          paraboloid of rotation and the lamp is arranged in the focus
          thereof, and a pressed glass plate is arranged in front of the
          lamp fixed to the reflector surface and it comprises an
          annular spherical specular surface.<br>
          <br>
          In a further embodiment the lamp and the reflector surface are
          arranged in an end portion of a tubular enclosure and a
          specular polarizer is placed in the opposite end region
          thereof. The plane of the specular polarizer is inclined in
          relation to the optical axis of the directed light beam
          propagating in the enclosure, wherein the angle of incidence
          of the beams on this plane is equal to Brewster's angle. There
          is arranged preferably another enclosure beside the first one,
          with holes defined in the adjacent side walls thereof to
          enable the passage of light beams reflected from the specular
          polarizer and there is another mirror in the second enclosure,
          placed in the path of the reflected light beams to direct
          these beams in parallel with the optical axis. It is
          preferable if the second enclosure of this embodiment is
          mounted closely beside and in parallel with the first one and
          the angle defined between the reflecting mirror and the
          specular polarizer is double the complementary of Brewster's
          angle.<br>
          <br>
          In order to increase the efficiency of polarization it is
          preferable if the specular polarizer comprises a plurality of
          plano-parallel plates, made preferably of transparent glass.<br>
          <br>
          The stimulating effect of the treatment with polarized light
          on the healing of wounds, as suggested by the present
          invention can be demonstrated effectively by describing the
          experiences obtained during such a treatment applied to
          chronic wounds which had been lingering for years.<br>
          <br>
          In response to the treatment the chronic wounds started to
          heal, first they got purged, then secretion reduced and later
          completely ceased. Blood-vessel endings appeared on the bases
          of the wounds, then epithelization started on the edges. The
          process of healing was continuous. The bases of the wounds got
          filled up, then they healed in some cases after crustation.<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of cytological examinations of smears taken from
          the wound secretion before and after each treatment, the
          effects of irradiation with polarized light can be summarized
          as follows.<br>
          <br>
          The irradiation increased the proportion of healthy leukocytes
          which are ready for phagocytosis, to the necrotic ones.<br>
          <br>
          Not only the number of phagocytic leukocytes but also the
          intensity of phagocytosis increased significantly. This
          increase in intensity manifested itself both in the highly
          increased number of bacteria phagolysed by the respective
          leukocytes and in the higher percentage of healthy and
          phagocytic leukocytes among all leukocytes.<br>
          <br>
          After a few number of treatments the cells taking part in the
          immunological protection, namely the eosinophile cells,
          lymphocytes and monocytes appeared in the smears.<br>
          <br>
          Both the quantity and quality of granuli in the cytoplasm of
          the cells changed considerably under the effect of the
          treatment which was demonstrated by the appearance of clearly
          visible large granuli.<br>
          <br>
          The quantity of fibrin fibers originally not or hardly
          observable in the smear, multiplied under the effect of the
          treatment, and the initially thin fibrins with a tendency
          toward disintegration, increased both in length and thickness
          and they were often arranged in bundles.<br>
          <br>
          In response to the treatment the composition of immunoproteins
          in the secretion has changed which could also prove the
          starting and activation of humoral protection. Irradiation
          with polarized light facilitated the quantitative growth of
          immunoproteins, of course to different degrees in case of
          different fractions. The highest average growth was observed
          in the immunoglobulin M, being about +85% compared to the
          pre-treatment average value, whereas the lowest increase of
          about +21% appeared in the immunoglobulin A fraction.<br>
          <br>
          The biological effects described hereinabove are closely
          related to the phase transition associated with the change of
          conformation of the polar heads in the cell membrane's lipid
          bilayer, i.e. to the effect of polarized light exerted on the
          lipid bilayer. This can be explained by the supposition that
          the antigen structures being present in the vicinity of immune
          cells can provide an immune response under the effect of
          polarized light by triggering a non-specific response in or
          increasing the sensitivity of the immune cells which, inter
          alia, can contribute to the healing of wounds.<br>
          <br>
          If polarized light changes the membrane structure of the
          lymphocytes, then this intensifies the activity of the
          receptors of the lymphocytes on one hand, and on the other
          hand the change in the membrane structure can directly
          activate the cyclic adenosin monophosphate, which can trigger
          the energy-generating process of the cell. These two effects
          can generate a local immunological response.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of the triggered immune response lymphokins are
          released that are capable of starting an immunological chain
          reaction. This chain reaction involves the triggering of the
          factor MIF (Migration Inhibiting Factor) inhibiting the
          migration of makrophags, the factor MCF (Monocyte Chemotactic
          Factor), the factor NCF (Neutrophile Chemotactic Factor) and
          the factor ECF (Eosinophile Chemotactic Factor) and these
          factors together attract the monocytes, neuotrophile
          granulocytes and eosinophile cells to the affected area.<br>
          <br>
          Consequently, the aforementioned cells will migrate to that
          particular area.<br>
          <br>
          On account of the changes in the membrane structure, the
          quantity of factor SRF (Skin Reaction Factor) that increases
          the permeability of blood-vessels will increase, thus it
          facilitates the circulation and in this way the transportation
          of the protective cells in the blood stream to the wounded
          area.<br>
          <br>
          The above described events facilitate the cellular immune
          response (with T lymphocytes, killer cells) and the humoral
          immune response by means of T-helper cells.<br>
          <br>
          The transport through the cell membrane will also be
          facilitated by the fact, that the initially irregular
          configuration of particles in the interstitium take a regular
          formation under the effect of electric field induced by
          polarized light. The process of re-arrangement in response to
          an electrical field is described e.g. in the paper of H. P.
          Schwan and L. D. Sher "Alternating Current Field-Induced
          Forces and Their Biological Implications" (J. Electrochem.
          Society, January 1969, pp 22c-25c).<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of the above described effects it can be stated
          that the application of polarized light in accordance with the
          present invention exerts a stimulating effect in general on
          biological processes related to cellular activity by
          controlling the behaviour of the cell membrane.<br>
          <br>
          The invention will now be described through exemplary
          embodiments thereof, in which reference will be made to the
          accompanying drawings.<br>

            EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
          <br>
          According to the present invention it has been discovered that
          the application of polarized light of sufficient intensity
          that falls in a predetermined wavelength range can produce a
          biostimulating effect. Though there are numerous known ways
          for the generation of polarized light, in the following
          description the specific conditions will be summarized and
          demonstrated by exemplary embodiments which should be taken
          into account when polarized light sources are being used to
          stimulate the healing of wounds.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 shows the schematic arrangement of a first embodiment
          of an apparatus for generating polarized light which can well
          be used for the healing treatment of wounds. The light source
          produced by lamp 10 is built integrally with reflecting
          surface 11 adapted to direct the backward light in an axially
          forward direction. If lamp 10 is a point source or nearly a
          point source and the reflector surface 11 has a rotational
          paraboloid shape, the majority of the light beams will be
          passed in parallel with the optical axis. In that case the
          lamp 10 should be placed in the focus of the reflector surface
          11.<br>
          <br>
          The next element in an axial direction after lamp 10 is
          infrared filter 12 for the suppression of infrared components
          emitted by lamp 10. The filtering or suppressing of the
          forwardly reflected infrared components will be more effective
          if the reflector surface 11 is designed as a cold mirror that
          fully reflects the visible components, whereas having a
          reflection factor in the infrared range being as small as
          about 20%, whereby about 80% of the backward infrared beams
          can pass therethrough. The infrared filter 12 can be of known
          type which is used commonly in photography such as the
          infrared filter type KG-4 of the Spezial-Glas GmbH (West
          Germany).<br>
          <br>
          The transmission characteristics versus wavelength of a filter
          of this type is shown in FIG. 6 (curve IRF). The application
          of the infrared filter 12 is considered essential, because the
          heat load on the treated surface might cause undesirable
          effects (without the suppression of the infrared components).
          The density of the luminous flux of the predominantly visible
          light incident on the body-surface under treatment should be
          in the range of about 20-150 mW/cm.<br>
          <br>
          In FIG. 1 a light deflecting system 13 is illustrated
          schematically. The task of the light deflecting system 13 is
          to project the light of the lamp 10 in parallel with the
          optical axis, by providing the most uniform spatial
          distribution possible. The deflecting system 13 can be built
          of traditional optical lenses, but the lamp 10 with the
          reflector surface 11 can also be regarded as an embodiment of
          the deflecting system 13, if they can produce together, the
          required axial light beams. The apparatus has a tubular
          enclosure 14 and by increasing its length the beams
          propagating non-parallel to the optical axis can be
          suppressed. Consequently it is not essential that the light
          deflecting system 13 be built of lenses. Indeed, the low value
          of the light intensity and the relatively significant light
          reflection is a disadvantage of the embodiments using lenses
          and due to the higher absorption more powerful bulbs should be
          chosen to provide a predetermined luminous output. On the
          other hand, however, the power of the lamp should be chosen as
          low as possible in order to minimize the problems of cooling.<br>
          <br>
          It is well known in the art that the human body is sensitive
          to ultraviolet light. This sensitivity is even more intensive
          in case of ill tissues and wound surfaces, therefore the
          emitted light should not include ultraviolet components. The
          ultraviolet beams are effectively eliminated by filter 15.
          Though the ultraviolet range of the spectrum is filtered by
          the glass lenses, the application of a separate ultraviolet
          filter 15 is also advisable in combination with glass lenses.
          Thorough absorption of the ultraviolet range of the spectrum
          becomes particularly significant in embodiments operating
          without lenses.<br>
          <br>
          In FIG. 6 curve UVF illustrates the transmission
          characteristic of an ultraviolet filter commonly used in
          photography. The absorption of the ultraviolet light will be
          more effective if the ultraviolet filter 15 is a yellow
          filter, also commonly used in photography. This results in a
          decrease in the visible light output mainly in the range of
          shorter wavelengths. Diagram YF in FIG. 6 shows the
          transmission characteristic of a typical yellow filter.<br>
          <br>
          Linearly polarized light is produced by means of a sheet
          polarizer 16 placed in the path of the light beam. The sheet
          polarizer 16 can be made of a polarizing plate-filter commonly
          used in photography. Such a filter is e.g. the polarizing
          filter type 4K of the Spindler-Hoyer GmbH (W. Germany).
          Diagram PF in FIG. 7 demonstrates the transmission
          characteristic of such a filter. The dependence of polar
          absorption from the wave-length can be determined on the basis
          of the cross-over characteristics. To obtain such a
          characteristics a pair of polarizing filters of opposite
          polarization directions are placed behind each other and as a
          consequence of this arrangement the opposingly polarised light
          beams will mutually extinguish each other. Such a cross-over
          characteristic is shown in diagram CR of FIG. 7. It can be
          observed that in the infrared range, over the wavelength of
          about 800 nm, the phenomenon of extinction ceases, which
          indicates that such filters do not polarize the infrared part
          of the spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 2 shows a further embodiment according to the invention.
          In this embodiment the lamp 10, the reflector surface 11 and
          lens 17 produce light beams parallel to the optical axis.<br>
          <br>
          The lens 17 consists of two parts, namely of lens body 20 and
          of coating 21. The lens body 20 can be made by a glass
          material providing infrared absorption, in which case the
          coating 21 should be an ultraviolet filter. The function of
          the lens body 20 and the coating 21 can also be interchanged,
          in which case the former provides a UV-absorption and the
          coating is made of an infrared-absorbing material.<br>
          <br>
          The light beams propagating in an axial direction in tubular
          enclosure 14 are transformed into polarized light by means of
          mirrors, as shown in FIG. 2. Specular polarizer 22 is mounted
          in the enclosure 14 in a remote position from the lamp 10 and
          in an inclined plane, in which the angle of incidence of the
          axial beams on this plane is 55 DEG. Light is reflected from
          the specular polarizer 22 obliquely, in the direction shown
          with dashed-dotted line in the figure, and it strikes another
          mirror 23 arranged in parallel with the specular polarizer 22.
          The mirror 23 is mounted in housing 24, fixed to the enclosure
          14. The reflected light beams pass through respective holes 25
          and 26 made in the adjacent side walls of the enclosure 14 and
          of the housing 24. The mirror 23 reflects the light beams back
          into the axial direction. The housing 24 is closed by glass
          plate 27, which provides protection for the internal parts
          against dust and provides ultraviolet filtering. It is known
          from physics that mirrors arranged under a suitable angle
          relative to incident light can produce polarized light not
          only in the visible but also in the infrared ranges.<br>
          <br>
          Reference is made now to FIG. 3, in which an embodiment
          similar to the one shown in FIG. 2 can be seen. The lamp 10 is
          built together with a spherical reflector surface 11 and in
          front of which a condensor 28 is placed. The reflector surface
          11 is formed by a cold mirror, therefore a portion of the
          infrared beams are projected backwardly in a direction
          opposite to that of the visible beams, into a rear space
          behind the lamp 10. In this space fan 29 is arranged providing
          cooling both for the lamp 10 and the tubular enclosure 14. The
          cooling air streams out through vent holes 30.<br>
          <br>
          The embodiment of FIG. 3 differs from that shown in FIG. 2
          also in the arrangement of the light source in the right side
          of the enclosure 14 and in the opposing directions of the
          emitted and the outgoing light beams leaving the equipment. In
          this embodiment the polarizer is made by a plurality of
          plano-parallel plates of common transparent glass 31, being
          parallel to each other and being inclined relative to the
          direction of the incident light. The angle of incidence of the
          light is equal to the known Brewster's angle, which is 57 DEG,
          and the light reflected from the layers consists of components
          which are polarized in one plane. The number of the reflecting
          surfaces of the plano-parallel layers 31 is double the number
          of the plates. About 35% of the incident light is reflected if
          the plate structure consists of four plates. Immediately under
          the enclosure 14 there is provided a second housing 32 of
          smaller dimensions built integrally therewith. The common wall
          of the enclosure 14 and the housing 32 defines a hole 33
          having a size enabling the passage of all light beams
          reflected from each polarizer plate.<br>
          <br>
          An inclined mirror 34 is placed in the path of the reflected
          light beams passed through hole 33 in such a way that the
          angle of incidence of the reflected light beams is also 57
          DEG. The mirror 34 reflects the incident light beams into a
          path which is parallel to the path of light emitted by the
          lamp 10 but having the opposite direction.<br>
          <br>
          In this way reflected light beams 35 pass through the housing
          32 and leave it at the right-hand end thereof. This end of the
          housing is closed by plate 36, made of an ultraviolet filter.
          The transmission characteristic of a polarizer of this type is
          shown in FIG. 7 (diagram PR). It can be seen that such
          polarizers provide polarized light also in the infrared region
          which eliminates the need of using an infrared filter. Owing
          to the wider polarized spectral range the required polarized
          light intensity can be reached with much less lamp-power
          relative to the designs with an infrared filter. The reduced
          power generates smaller amounts of heat, which renders the use
          of forced cooling unnecessary.<br>
          <br>
          In the arrangement shown in FIG. 3 the path of the light is
          nearly twice as long as the total constructional length of the
          equipment, due to the reversing of the light beams. This
          increased length reduces the divergence of the outgoing light
          beams 35, because the divergent beams will be withheld by the
          tubular enclosure. It is advisable to provide the internal
          surface of the enclosure with a light-absorbing black coating.
          Another advantage lies in the fact that the sectional area of
          the enclosure 14 comprising the lamp 10 is larger than that of
          the housing 32, therefore a larger lamp can be used for a
          given outgoing beam cross-section which is preferable in view
          of heat engineering. Fan 29 is not essential, but it is
          recommended, particularly in the case of higher outputs.<br>
          <br>
          During treatment it is often necessary to change the direction
          of the light beams. This function is performed by support 37
          fixed to the enclosure 14 or 32, to be clamped to a console,
          not shown in the drawing. The console comprises known fixing
          and control mechanisms providing the required setting and
          position-adjustment of the light beams.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 is
          operative without the use of the second mirror 34 and the
          housing 32. In such an arrangement polarized beams are emitted
          in a downwardly inclined direction through the hole 33. The
          position of the enclosure 14 can be adjusted to provide
          polarized beams in any direction including both the horizontal
          and vertical ones.<br>
          <br>
          A further embodiment of the apparatus according to the
          invention is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
          <br>
          The light source used in this embodiment is of a special
          design capable of generating light beams substantially
          parallel to the axis. The lamp 10 is placed in the focus of
          the reflector surface 11 having now a shape of a rotational
          paraboloid. There is provided a pressed glass plate 38 fixed
          to the reflector surface 11 in front of the lamp 10. The
          pressed glass plate 38 has a spherical annular outer portion
          which is provided internally with a mirror surface 39
          reflecting the incident light beams towards the centre of the
          lamp 10 which should now be regarded as a point light source.
          Within the internal annular edge of the mirror surface 39 the
          pressed glass plate 38 has a slightly convex form and this
          internal portion is made of transparent glass. The pressed
          glass plate 38 can be designed to form an infrared and/or
          ultraviolet filter.<br>
          <br>
          Owing to this arrangement only light beams extending
          substantially parallel to the axis can pass through the
          transparent central portion 40 of the pressed glass plate 38.
          A ring 41 is provided to attach the pressed glass plate 38 to
          the reflector surface 11.<br>
          <br>
          Whilst the mirror 39 is designed as a normal reflecting
          surface, it is recommended that the reflector surface 11 be
          made of a cold mirror.<br>
          <br>
          It is believed that the compact lamp shown in FIG. 4 is the
          most appropriate for polarized light treatments which
          eliminates the need for using a separate light-deflecting
          optical system.<br>
          <br>
          The polarizer shown in FIG. 4 is a per se known Nicol's prism
          consisting of a pair of calcite prisms tooled by grinding and
          glued together with Canadian balsam. Angle 43 shown in FIG. 4
          is equal to 66 DEG.<br>
          <br>
          The Nicol's prism 42 is fixed in enclosure 14 by means of
          retaining washers 44 and 45. The retaining washer 45 has a
          frontal opening closed by glass plate 46, which can be
          designed as an infrared filter.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 shows a more detailed assembly drawing of a polarized
          light source corresponding to the principal arrangement shown
          in FIG. 1. In this embodiment the lamp 10 and the reflector
          surface 11 are realized by the commercially available cold
          mirror-type lamp designated Tungsram 52210 or 52220 which is
          surrounded by a tube 50 provided with cooling ribs. The lamp
          10 is fixed in a ceramic lamp socket 51, clamped onto a
          fixture 52 which together with a mounting base 37 is fixed to
          the lower part of the tube 50 by means of a screw joint. Disc
          53 with vent-holes provides a rear closure for the tube 50. A
          hollow screw-mount is arranged in the centre of the disc 53
          for supporting the electric cable connections and a bracket 54
          adapted to fix the fan 29.<br>
          <br>
          An adapter sleeve 55 with vent-holes is coupled to the frontal
          end of thetube 50 with cooling ribs and its frontal end is
          coupled to a sleeve 56 through a threaded joint. The sleeve 56
          supports internally a lens holder 57 in which a lens 58 is
          mounted. The sleeve 56 is extended by a hollow filter support
          59 designed to have an open top portion covered by a cover
          plate 60 attached thereto by a releasable fastening. There are
          several filter-holding slots (in the exemplary embodiment four
          slots) in the filter support 59. When the covering plate 60 is
          removed, suitable filters can be inserted into the respective
          slots of the filter support 59, or the filter can be changed
          according to actual requirements. In FIG. 5 infrared filter 61
          and polarizing filter 62 have been shown in the slots of the
          tubular holder for filters. A tubular lens holder 63 is
          coupled to the filter support 59 in such a manner that an
          ultraviolet filter 64 can be inserted in the joint. The
          tubular lens holder 63 is used for holding second and third
          lenses, 65 and 66.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus shown in FIG. 5 produces polarized light beams
          of about 35-40 mm diameter, directed substantially in parallel
          to the optical axis. The emitted light falls within the
          visible range of wavelengths, and both its ultraviolet and
          infrared components are effectively suppressed.<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 to 5 it can
          be stated that for the purpose of stimulating the healing of
          wounds a special light source is required that generates
          visible light, from which the ultraviolet (and as and if
          necessary the infrared) components are removed, the emitted
          light should propagate essentially in a parallel beam of
          uniform distribution. The light intensity of the beam should
          not exceed about 150 mW/cm@2. The emitted light should be
          linearly polarized.<br>
          <br>
          The individual constructional details of the embodiments
          discussed hereinabove, can naturally be used in any other
          rational combination. For example, the light source
          demonstrated in FIG. 4 can be employed in the arrangement
          according to FIG. 1, however, that would render the use of
          deflecting system 13 unnecessary. Thus, the polarized light
          source according to the invention should not be limited to any
          one of the exemplary embodiments.<br>
          <br>
          Now the application of the method according to the invention
          and the experiences obtained during such applications will be
          described through the following examples.<br>
          <br>
          In order to demonstrate the effect of polarized light,
          patients were treated with anamnesis in which all types of
          traditional therapy for healing their wounds had been applied,
          without even a temporary success. Altogether 23 patients were
          treated and the aetiological distribution of their illness was
          the following: ulcus cruris developed as a consequence of
          diabetic angiopathy in the case of 7 patients; ulcus cruris
          was caused by arteriosclerosis obliterans in 6 cases, and in 6
          cases by varicositas or postthrombotic syndrom. Three patients
          were treated for decubitus and one of the patients had a
          chronic osteomyelitis in the background of his pathography.<br>
          <br>
          Prior to the treatment with polarized light, during the
          traditional therapy, dressings with Mikulitz's ointment and
          Peruvian balm, Oxycort, Panthenol spray, Solcoseryl jelly,
          Debrisan and various local antibiotic and drying bandages were
          employed. As a general therapy, the patients took Glyvenol,
          Padutin, Venoruton, vitamins and other corroborants, and they
          also received corroborant treatment. The treatment with
          polarized light was started after the failure of the above
          mentioned types of conventional therapy. Mentioning only the
          extreme cases, one of the patients had a non-healing wound for
          more than 35 years, and in several cases the wounds developed
          5-20 years before the treatment was started.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment with polarized light was performed once a day.
          The area of the spot of the light projected onto the wounds
          was about 4 cm@2 and the average flux-density of the beams was
          about 80 mW/cm@2. The spectrum of the light ranged between 300
          nm and 700 nm, the spectral distribution did not comprise
          discrete components with high intensities.<br>
          <br>
          The duration of the treatment was chosen so that the average
          energy falling on the wound surface under treatment be 4
          J/cm@2. When the area to be treated was larger than the
          cross-section of the beams, this latter was scanned by the
          intermittent displacement of the light source in such a way
          that the wound edges were irradiated first circumferentially
          and the inner region was reached by a circular inwardly
          directed movement. The typical duration of the treatment in
          each position of the light source was between one and two
          minutes.<br>
          <br>
          Before and after each treatment respective samples were taken
          from the wound secretion and smears were prepared for
          microscopic evaluation using fixation technique and the
          May-Grunwald-Giemsa method. With the progress of the treatment
          as the secretion was gradually reduced and ceased, smears
          could not be prepared any more.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the samples for smears larger samples were also
          taken from the wound secretion--when it was possible--to
          determine the composition of proteins, particularly
          immunoproteins, in the serum.<br>
          <br>
          For the duration of the treatment with polarized light the
          patients did not get any kind of antibiotics and only dry
          bandages were applied.<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of the cytological examination of smears, taken
          from the wounds before and after every treatment, the
          following general results have been obtained:<br>
          (a) The ratio of healthy leukocytes ready for
          bacteriophagocytosis to the necrotic ones increased to a
          substantial degree as a consequence of irradiation with
          polarized light. The increase of this ratio showed a fairly
          varied picture in the examined cases. It occured in several
          cases that, whilst there were no healthy leukocytes at all in
          the smear before treatment, the ratio of healthy leukocytes to
          the necrotic ones increased to 50%:50% in the smear prepared
          immediately after treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Irradiation with polarized light facilitated the emergence of
          healthy leukocytes on the wound's surface. The extent of
          increase of this ratio in favour of the healthy leukocytes
          could be observed nearly in each sample, however, it was
          particularly high after the first few treatments of a series.<br>
          <br>
          Most of the leukocytes in the smear were neutrophil
          granulocytes forming the basis of the cellular defense
          mechanism of the organism, which is the most elementary form
          of protection. Sacrificing themselves, the neutrophile
          granulocytes swallow bacteria in order to protect the
          organism. The measure of the intensity of
          bacterio-phagocytosis is the number of bacteria swallowed by a
          single neutrophile granulocyte.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b demonstrate these phenomena.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 8a shows a smear taken before treatment in which a great
          number of extracellular bacteria can be observed and the
          overwhelming majority of the leukocytes is formed by necrotic
          ones. The situation after treatment is illustrated in FIG. 8b,
          extracellular bacteria have substantially vanished and mainly
          healthy leukocytes can be seen.<br>
          <br>
          Another typical smear is shown in FIG. 9a, in which the number
          of necrotic cells was high before treatment, and after
          treatment as shown in FIG. 9b, a substantial increase occured
          in the number of healthy cells.<br>
          <br>
          (b) The intensity of phagocytosis has also increased. In
          addition to the increase in the ratio of healthy phagolytic
          leukocytes, the intensity of phagocytosis has also increased
          as a consequence of irradiation with polarized light. The
          rather sluggish bacteriophagocytosis before treatment, which
          meant the swallowing of about 8-10 bacteria by a single cell,
          was becoming more and more intensive, and the leukocytes
          phagolysed up to 80-100 bacteria under the effect of
          treatment.<br>
          <br>
          The intensity of phagocytosis is also characterized by the
          percentual ratio of the actually phagolysing leukocytes within
          total number of healthy ones. Whilst only 5-10% of the healthy
          leukocytes were phagocytic before treatment, after treatment
          this ratio increased to 50-60%.<br>
          <br>
          These two phenomena are particularly significant in the
          initial phase of healing, because the healing of wounds is
          impeded mainly by the presence of extracellular bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          The appearance of sound healthy leukocytes in the secretion
          and both types of the intensification of bacterio-phagocytosis
          promote the annihilation of extracellular bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 10a shows a situation before treatment, where only few
          cells phagolyse and each of them swallows only few bacteria.
          FIG. 10b shows the situation after treatment and it
          demonstrates that the number of phagocytic cells and the
          number of bacteria swallowed by one cell has increased
          noticably. A similarly considerable intensification can be
          seen in FIGS. 11a and 11b, illustrating also respective
          situations before and after irradiation. The smears taken
          after irradiation also demonstrate the disappearance of
          extracellular bacteria.<br>
          (c) Under the effect of the treatment with polarized light the
          immunological (humoral) defense of the organism is also
          triggered or intensified.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that this type of protection against bacteria is
          provided by plasma cells, lymphocytes and monocytes. These
          types of leukocytes produce immunoproteins, killing the
          bacteria. The appearance of these cells means that the
          organism mobilizes deeper immunological mechanisms to heal the
          wound and kill the bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          While the smear taken before irradiation contained generally
          neutrophile granulocytes only, after irradiation other types
          of leukocytes have also appeared that can provide higher,
          humoral form of protection. Such cells are e.g. the
          eosinophile cells, lymphocytes and monocytes.<br>
          <br>
          In several cases these cells appeared already after a few
          treatments. The ratio of appearance of these cells relative to
          other cells varied from one case to the other. It happened
          that no lymphocytes were found among the leukocytes before
          treatment, whereas the ratio of lymphocytes increased to 4-10%
          by the end of the treatment. With increasing number of
          treatments lymphocytes could be seen in the secretion already
          before the next day's treatment, but their ratio before
          treatment was, for example, 2%, which increased to 20%
          following the treatment.<br>
          <br>
          A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of eosinophile
          granulocytes, the ratio of which increased from the initial 0%
          to 1-5%, then in a later phase of the therapy from the initial
          1% to 20%. Similar increase of the percentual ratio of
          monocytes was detected from the initial 0% to the post
          treatment 5% and in a later phase from 3% to 5%.<br>
          <br>
          The cells that provide the immunological defense of the
          organism, appeared generally after the second or third
          treatment, but a significant quantitative growth could be
          observed generally during and after the seventh-ninth
          treatment. However, the presence of these cells stabilized
          only after the 15th-20th treatment, up to which their quantity
          decreased between subsequent treatments.<br>
          <br>
          By that time there were already visible signs of the ongoing
          healing process. This is a rather significant demonstration,
          since before the first treatment there were no traces of the
          presence of leukocytes in the secretion of any of the patients
          that would provide immunological defense.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 12a shows a condition before treatment with visibly high
          number of extracellular bacteria and sluggish
          bacteriophagocytosis. Apart from the neutrophile granulocytes
          no other types of leukocytes can be seen. FIG. 12b shows the
          situation after treatment and it can be seen that some
          lymphocytes have appeared, and the extracellular bacteria have
          disappeared. After a later treatment monocytes can be detected
          (see FIG. 12c). In FIG. 12c it can also be observed that
          fibrin-fibers are already present. Similarly, FIG. 13a
          illustrates a pretreatment condition with low granularity.
          Only neutrophile granulocytes can be seen. After treatment the
          eosinophile cell has also appeared (see FIG. 13b). After
          successive treatments a great number of eosinophile cells
          appear in the smear as shown in FIG. 13c. In FIG. 14a
          lymphocytes can be detected even before the treatment and the
          quantity of which has considerably increased after the
          treatment (FIG. 14b).<br>
          <br>
          When the process of healing is examined, it will be discovered
          that at first the quantity and activity of the neutrophile
          granulocytes increases in a chronic, refractory wound and
          after that, or partly at the same time cells offering the
          higher forms of protection appear, and when these mechanisms
          of protection become relatively stabilized, the spectacular
          process of healing of the wound starts.<br>
          (d) The evolution of immunological protection is verified by
          the change in the quality and quantity of granuli in the
          cytoplasm of the cells, taking place under the effect of the
          treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Granulation comprises the lysosomatic enzymes (that can
          dissolve all types of organic matter required for protection
          against bacterii) and the presence of a definite, large-size
          granulation is the proof of the quantitative growth and
          appearance of such enzymes.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 15a and 15b demonstrate the changes in extent and
          quality of granulation that occured in response to the
          treatment with polarized light. Before the treatment the
          granulation in the neutrophile granulocyte cells was weak,
          hardly detectable. In the post-treatment state as shown in
          FIG. 15b a definite, large-grained and well detectable
          granulation can be seen in the cytoplasm of the cells.<br>
          (e) The few fibrins when being present in the pre-treatment
          smear are thin with a tendency toward disintegration.<br>
          <br>
          The presence of fibrins in the course of the first few
          treatments was hardly experienced. In response to the
          treatment with polarized light the quantity of fibrins
          multiplied in relation to the pre-treatment condition. These
          fibrins are formed to long, thick, parallel straight fibres
          arranged often in bundles. This is illustrated in FIGS. 16a
          and 16b showing smears taken before and after irradiation,
          respectively. The effect of treatment with polarized light on
          the composition of immunoproteins in the secretion has also
          been investigated. The composition measurements were carried
          out by the immunoelectrophoretic technique. 0.4 .mu.l volume
          of the secretion was required for each analysis to prepare the
          samples on a specially prepared plate for immunological tests.
          Eight different proteins can be measured usually on a single
          plate. There is a standard sample on each plate, in which the
          respective areas pertaining to each fraction are known,
          therefore the measurement can be performed to supply not only
          relative, but also absolute values.<br>
          <br>
          During immunoelectrophoresis the individual protein fractions
          separate, and the quantitative ratios of fractions are
          represented by the ratios of the corresponding areas. By
          placing the test plate onto an overhead projector and
          outlining the contours of each fraction projected with the
          same magnification, the size of the obtained areas can be
          determined by means of a planimeter. Then the quantities of
          the fractions are calculated in relation to the standard
          areas. Such outlined contours are shown in FIGS. 17a and 17b
          (before and after treatment, respectively). The figures
          associated with the respective components indicate the
          relative indices of the related areas.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of the measurements the composition of
          immunoproteins in the secretion of three patients was analysed
          and the samples were taken before and after each treatment of
          a series. The effect of the treatment is reflected in the
          extent of change of the composition. Table 1. shows the
          percentual changes of immunoprotein fractions of three
          patients A, B and C, in response to respective treatments. The
          missing entries indicate that the low quantity of the
          secretion that was available during the particular treatment,
          was not sufficient to perform the measurement of that
          particular component. In case of patient C, due to the rapid
          healing of the wound, sufficient amount of secretion was
          available during a few treatments only.<br>
          <br>
          <b>TABLE 1</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>Percentual changes of the respective components
            after treatment relative to pre-treatment values</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          On the basis of Table 1, in which the respective pre-treatment
          values have been considered as 100%, it can be seen that
          irradiation with polarized light intensifies proteinogenesis
          in the secretion, obviously to different degrees in different
          fractions. The considerable fluctuations in the entries of the
          table resulted by the individual differences and by the fact
          that the samples were taken in different phases of healing.
          There was no sense of calculating averages due to the high
          variance of the values, however, the data of table 1 clearly
          demonstrate the tendency of quantitative growth of the
          components in response to the treatment. These figures show
          that the highest increase took place in fraction
          immunoglobulin-M, then the succession was: Albumin, .alpha.1
          -lipoprotein, Immunoglobulin-G, .alpha.1 -antitrypsin,
          Transferin, .alpha.2 -Macroglobulin and Immunoglobulin-A.<br>
          <br>
          It has also been noticed that the inclination to healing of
          different patients is proportional to the quantitative growth
          of immunoproteins that take place in response to respective
          treatments. The more is the increment of immunoproteins, that
          is, the more intensive is the response to the treatment with
          polarized light, the higher is the rate of healing. Taking
          this relationship into account, the inclination of the wound
          to healing and the expected total duration of the cure can be
          estimated already on the basis of a few treatments.<br>
          <br>
          The results of the immunological tests are in accordance with
          the experiences obtained by the cytological examinations, i.e.
          in response to the treatment with polarized light:<br>
          (i.) protein types providing humoral protection appear,<br>
          (ii.) definite granulation, indicating the presence of
          lysosomatic enzymes,appears in the cytoplasm of the cells;<br>
          (iii.) effective protection starts against the bacilliform
          bacteria, destroyable mainly in the immunological way. Besides
          cytological and immunological tests, great importance was
          attached to the general process of healing as well.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of the examinations the macroscopic parameters
          of the wounds were measured and the obtained results were
          evaluated. The changes observed in the base of the wounds were
          measured and recorded including the vertical and horizontal
          dimensions of the edges of the wounds, as well as their depths
          and the width of the newly grown epithelial edges were also
          measured. In the course of treatments the wounds began first
          to purge, secretion reduced and became clearer even after a
          few treatments only. At the same time the patients reported on
          the substantial reduction of their pains. The wounds started
          to heal visibly after a certain period of latency, which
          lasted generally one week. After this time the wounds started
          to heal gradually, even those which showed no tendency of
          healing before the treatment with polarized light.<br>
          <br>
          After another week of treatment the process of healing usually
          became more rapid.<br>
          <br>
          Blood vessel endings appeared on the bases of the wounds later
          with white pearly growths around them, and epithelisation also
          started on the edges. The new epidermis appeared first as a
          red area that usually turned white and became a rim-like
          elevation to the next day.<br>
          <br>
          The beginning and rate of healing largely depends on the age,
          general condition, medical and haemodynamic state of the
          patient.<br>
          <br>
          This process is illustrated by FIGS. 18, 19 and 20. The full
          lines show the horizontal size of the wounds and the dash
          lines the vertical one.<br>
          <br>
          In the anamnesis of a 54 years old male patient the only
          disease he suffered from was hepatitis. He has had distinct
          varicosity for 20 years, but he hasn't had thrombosis. His
          shin split a first time 15 years ago, then the wound healed
          spontaneously. This process was repeated since then several
          times. The ulcer developed on his right shin four years
          before; the current wounds have not healed since 10 months. He
          was treated with Venoruton and Padutin, the local medical
          attendance involved Oxycort, antibiotics, Neogranorman and
          Panthenol.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment with polarized light was started after such
          antecedents. At that time he had a 2 mm deep ulcer of
          20.times.24 mm size on the border of the middle and lower
          third of his shank, and a 4 mm deep one of 24.times.18 mm size
          in the distal third. Approximately after the 5th or 7th
          treatment the wounds started to heal rapidly, they became
          shallower and nervate. The distal wound healed with crustation
          to the 40th treatment (FIG. 18), then the much deeper proximal
          ulcer also pullulated to the 57th treatment (FIG. 19), and the
          cure was finished.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 20 demonstrates the healing of the wounds of a 66 years
          old male patient. His anamnesis included permanent coxalgia
          for 21 years, therefore he was provided with an artificial hip
          (prothesis) 17 years ago and in order to relieve him of
          lingering pain, cordothomy was performed on him. Due to his
          mental derangement, which evolved six months before, he was
          transferred to the psychiatric department. On the body of this
          patient, who became confined to bed in the meantime, decubiti
          evolved gradually, on both sides, on the hip and sacralis too.
          Then the treatment with polarized light was started. At the
          beginning of the therapy he had two 3 mm-deep wounds on the
          rightside of the hip, one of 21.times.30 mm and the other of
          16.times.25 mm size. On the left side he had a 38 mm deep
          wound of 66.times.45 mm size. The sacral decubitus was
          30.times.13 mm large. The effect of the polarized light began
          to purge the wounds gradually and after the 7th treatment
          their size started to recede slowly. Then the rate of healing
          decelerated temporarily and after the 40th treatment the
          pouches on the edges subsided and the depth of the hollow also
          decreased considerably. The patient left the ward upon his
          request, due to some family affair, after the 50th treatment.
          At this time the sacral ulcer and the smaller wound on his
          right side were entirely epithelised, the other one receded to
          8.times.17 mm, and the wound on his left side--to 26.times.20
          mm.<br>
          <br>
          The experiences obtained by polarized light treatment show
          that lesions due to diabethes react to the treatment after the
          longest time and with the slowest rate. The inclination to
          healing of wounds, developed as a consequence of
          arteriosclerosis obliterans is somewhat better, but the most
          striking and rapid are the results obtained in the curing of
          ulcus cruris developed due to postthrombotic syndrom.<br>
          <br>
          In the foregoing description the stimulating effects of the
          treatment with polarized light have been demonstrated on the
          healing of chronic, otherwise non-healing wounds. It became
          clear that the treatment exerted a significant stimulating
          effect on the healing process even in case of the most
          unfavourable pathography. It must be obvious therefore that
          the stimulating effect of the treatment with polarized light
          also asserts itself in the healing of acute injuries, cut and
          contured wounds, where the conditions hindering the healing
          process are less manifested.<br>
          <br>
          According to the experiments, treatment with polarized light
          also facilitates the healing of burning lesions. On the leg of
          a 40 years old male patient autograft was performed for the
          treatment of a third-degree burn. The skin-graft separated on
          an area of 1.times.5 cm size, and two additional areas of 1
          cm@2 each. The physicians performing traditional treatment
          suggested a new transplantation, because by their opinion the
          process of pullulation from the edges of the wound would take
          several months.<br>
          <br>
          After these antecedents started the treatment of the wound
          surface with polarized light, once a day, at 4 J/cm@2 density
          of energy. Following the third treatment pullulation started
          from the edges of the wound. Then the process of healing sped
          up, in two weeks full crustation took place, then, having
          finished the treatment, the whole surface healed. The
          treatment with polarized light was applied in those places
          only, where the skin-graft separated.<br>
          <br>
          Whilst the transplanted skin surface, not treated with
          polarized light was of reddish hue with secondary pouches, the
          colour of the recovered skin irradiated with polarized light
          was natural, its surface was smooth, and this was the
          strongest, soundest portion of the healed area of the
          third-degree burn.<br>
          <br>
          Considering that the treatment with laser light has been
          applied in numerous fields of clinical practice during the
          long years elapsed since its introduction, and the
          biostimulating effect has been proven, it may be supposed that
          the biostimulating effect can also be triggered in similar
          fields of application through treatment with polarized light.<br>
          <br>
          This may apply to various treatments of cosmetic nature, to
          the liquidation of cicatrices, to the stimulation of
          miscellaneous lesions on the body-surface on the analogy of
          laser stimulation, or, in general, to stimulate biological
          processes, related basically to cellular activity.<br>

          <b>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The present invention relates to a method for in vivo
          treatment of tumorous tissues on body surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          The medical literature dealing with various treatments of
          cancer is very extensive and the citation of only a small
          portion thereof would certainly make the present specification
          prolix. In spite of worldwide research and numerous
          significant achievements there have remained much to be solved
          and any small pace of improvement is significant.<br>
          <br>
          It has been long known in the art that the irradiation of
          tumorous tissues by specific rays such as X-rays or isotopes
          have a growth inhibiting effect. Such treatments were based on
          the selective destructive effects of these rays for tumorous
          and healthy cells. A different branch of cancer research deals
          with chemotherapy.<br>
          <br>
          Recently much effort is concentrated on the investigation of
          the immunotherapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Of the
          pertinent literature a few number of papers will be cited. The
          first one is the work of Steven A. Rosenberg, Paul Spiess and
          Rene Lafreniere: `A New Approach to the Adoptive Immunotherapy
          of Cancer with Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes` (Science, Vol.
          233, 19 Sept. 1986, pp. 1318-1321). The second reference is
          Richard L. Kradin and James T. Kurnick: Adoptive Immunotherapy
          of Cancer with Activated Lymphocytes and Interleukin-2
          published in "The Year in Immunopathology, Pathol.
          Immunpathol. Res. pp. 193-202 (1986)". Rosenberg et. al have
          reported that the adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating
          lymphocytes (TIL) expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) has proved
          to be substantially more effective to mice bearing
          micrometastases from various types of tumors than
          lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells are. The combination
          of TIL and cyclophosphamide was further potentiated by the
          simultaneous administration of IL-2. Kradin et. al have
          disclosed that a measure of therapeutic success has been
          achieved by the administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
          IL-2 activated lymphocytes in mice with metastatic
          malignancies. The Apr. 9, 1987 issue of the New England
          Journal of Medicine includes reports by two different groups
          of investigators concerning their experience with adoptive
          immunotherapy for cancer.<br>

          Our purpose of our citing these references was to demonstrate
          that there exists a certain degree of correlation between the
          responses of tumor cell on various treatments in mice and in
          humans.<br>
          <br>
          In a quite different field of art a method has been suggested
          for the stimulation of biological processes relating to
          cellular activity, particularly for promoting the healing of
          wounds, ulcers and epithelial injuries which was based on the
          recognition that polarization property of laser light was
          responsible for the well-demonstrated wound-healing effect of
          laser light, thus the expensive and bulky laser could be
          replaced by a light source emitting incoherent polarized
          light. This invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,986
          issued to Fenyo et. al, Mrs. Fenyo being one of the inventors
          of the present invention as well.<br>

          The polarized lamp has gotten a fairly moderate acceptance and
          its medical use has been rather limited. A few number of
          patent applications were directed to particular designs of
          polarized lights sources for biostimulation. Of these PCT
          publication WO-A-8 403 049 and published European patent
          application 84850395.9 can be mentioned as relevant.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The object of the invention is to provide a new method for in
          vivo treatment of tumorous tissues on body surfaces which can
          enhance the available arsenal of means and methods of
          overcoming or moderating this disease.<br>
          <br>
          The essence of the invention is the recognition of the fact
          that polarized light (be it incoherent or laser light) can
          positively influence the tumor-host relationship leading to
          suppression or rejection of tumors. The exact mechanism of
          this effect remains to be elucidated.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention a method has been provided for in
          vivo treatment of tumorous tissues on body surfaces that
          comprises the step of irradiating said tissues by polarized
          light of predetermined intensity, this polarized light
          predominantly includes wavelength components exceeding 300 nm
          and substantially excludes ultraviolet components.<br>
          <br>
          It is preferable if the intensity of irradiation is between 20
          and 150 mW/cm@2, however, the highest intensity of the
          irradiation is limited only by the sensitivity of tissues
          against heat load concomittant with the irradiation.<br>
          <br>
          It has been found that the effects of an irradiation with
          polarized light last about for 24 hours. This finding can be
          largely inaccurate, nevertheless it is preferable if the
          treatment is carried out at least once a day for at least one
          period of at least 2 minutes duration. It is preferable, if
          the time of the daily treatment is between 5 and 30 minutes.
          These time data are, however largely dependent on the
          individual, on the intensity and spectral distribution of the
          light, on the depth of the tissues to be treated and on
          several other factors.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferable embodiment the polarized light includes
          polarized infrared components. With such components the depth
          of penetration will be higher than in case of using visible
          components only. A further advantage of using infrared
          components lies in the increased efficiency of utilizing the
          available light output of generally available light sources.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferable embodiment the cross-section of the
          irradiating light is at least as large as the surface area of
          the tissues to be treated. By using a sufficiently large
          cross-section the need for mosaic-like irradiation is
          eliminated, and the time of treatment is reduced. If
          substantially larger areas are irradiated than the overall
          surface of the tumor tissues, the results can even be better,
          since due to limited penetration of the light into
          under-surface tissues (including arteries and veins) the
          stimulation can be more effective.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferable embodiment the irradiating light can have a
          spectral distribution that corresponds substantially to that
          of a metal halogen bulb from which components under about 400
          nm have been substantially filtered out.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention a surprisingly new use of a light
          source emitting polarized light with wavelength components
          exceeding 300 nm has been suggested, in which said light is
          used for irradiating tumorous tissues on body surfaces. The
          term `body surface` covers areas in body cavities to which
          light can be administered as well as under-surface tissues
          within the range of penetration of polarized rays.<br>
          <br>
          This new use covers light sources disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
          4,686,986 as well as other conventional light sources like
          laser sources used up to now for wound healing or general
          biostimulation.<br>

          <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          All experiments were performed with inbred BALB/c mice of our
          own breeding colony originally derived from the
          Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute (New York, USA). The used
          tumor was the methyl-cholanthren induced fibrosarcoma (BALB/c
          Meth A) originally derived from Dr. Old's Laboratory
          (Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute).<br>
          <br>
          The tumor was maintained in its ascites form through serial
          passage in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice. The cells
          were harvested, washed three times in Hank's solution,
          examined for vitality and inoculated subcoutaneously (s.c.)
          into the abdomen of syngenetic mice. From previous experiments
          it is well known that the injection of 3.times.10@6 vital
          cells represent 100% take of the tumor. Therefore always this
          amount of cells was administered. For the experiments only
          male mice were used of more than 25 g body weight and of equal
          age and breed.<br>
          <br>
          In the experiments 7 groups were formed, each included four or
          five mice. These groups were treated first after 48, 72 and 96
          hours, respectively after transplantation and subsequently
          each day until their death by linearly polarized light. A
          group of four mice served as tumor bearing untreated control.
          The treatment consisted of irradiation by polarized light of
          about 50 mW/cm@2 power density using the lamp sold under the
          trade name EVOLITE by Bildsystem AB, of Malmo, Sweden,
          designed according to the published European patent
          application 84850395.9. FIG. 1 shows the general view of the
          irradiation arrangement. Mouse 1 under treatment was kept on
          its back and was temporarily fixed on a board 2. Light source
          3 emitted parallel rays of polarized light having a
          rectangular cross-section of 200.times.300 mm indicated by
          reference numeral 4. The spectral distribution of the
          irradiating light was in correspondence with that of a usual
          metal halogen bulb, however, components under the wave length
          of about 400 nm were effectively suppressed. The distance of
          the treated surface of the mouse 1 from the exit opening of
          the light source 3 was about 18-20 cm. The cross-section of
          the irradiating light was larger than the whole surface of the
          mouse 1 therefore the irradiation was not limited to the
          tumorous area.<br>
          <br>
          Each irradiation was performed under neurolept anaesthesia
          (Vetranquil 0.01% 0.1 ml intramuscular inj.). The duration of
          the daily irradiation was 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes in the
          respective groups. Each day the mice were irradiated about the
          same time. Table 1 summarizes the data of irradiation for
          groups 1 to 6<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The growth of the tumor grafts was monitored twice every week
          by measuring the size thereof by means of calipers. The tumor
          size is expressed in mm@2 units obtained by the product of the
          largest two diameters of the tumor. FIGS. 3 to 8 illustrate
          the tumor growth as a function of time for the six groups. A
          similar diagram for the untreated control group is shown in
          FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          On the basis of the measured data statistical work was
          performed by using Mann-Whitney test on the 23rd day and
          Wilcoxon test on the 29th day. The average of the tumor growth
          curves for the treated and for the control groups is shown in
          FIG. 9, while FIG. 10 illustrates the average tumor surface on
          the 29th day for the respective groups including the control
          group.<br>
          <br>
          The tumor growth curves demonstrate without exception that the
          treatment with polarized light effectively inhibited tumor
          growth in each group. On the 23rd day the average surface area
          of the treated groups was only 31% of the average of the
          control group, while a similar ratio at the end of the 29th
          day was only 28%. FIG. 9 shows that the growth rate of the
          treated animals is practically constant from the 6th day to
          the end of the 29th day, while this rate in the control group
          was uneven, the steepness has increased with time.<br>
          <br>
          This fact is reflected also from FIG. 10, in which the group
          averages can be seen separately. This figure shows that there
          is no direct relationship between the irradiation time and the
          extent of response. The timing of the first treatment has
          probably more influence at least on the initial tumor growth.
          The survival of the animals was not investigated in this sort
          of experiments.<br>
          <br>
          To exclude the possibility that a non-specific toxic effect of
          the polarized light can be responsible for the differences in
          the tumor growth, a separate toxicity test was carried out. In
          this test series 10 female mice were irradiated after weaning
          for twelve hours per day by polarized light. Another group of
          10 similar mice was irradiated with non-polarized (normal)
          light with identical intensity, also for twelve hours a day.
          The increase of weight was measured for a longer period of
          time. The results of this test i.e. average weight of the
          respective groups versus time are illustrated in FIG. 11. This
          figure shows that apart from a slower weight increase in the
          first two weeks, the weight after the first month became very
          close to each other and by the end of the sixth week the
          average weight of both groups became equal. This demonstrates
          that the treatment with polarized light does not have a toxic
          effect on the experimentary mice, and the tumor growth
          inhibiting effects demonstrated by our tests are due to
          specific effects of polarized light on the tumor-host system.<br>
          <br>
          Our experience with polarized light treatment on mice obtained
          during other series of tests than demonstrated here suggest
          that the effects of polarized light do not last longer than
          about 24 hours, and this explains why we have chosen the daily
          irradiation rate.<br>
          <br>
          The essence of the test-series described hereinabove is the
          fact that polarized light with specific intensity can
          positively influence the tumor-host relationship leading to
          suppression or rejection of otherwise untreatable tumors. The
          exact mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated.<br>
          <br>
          There are, however, certain facts and phenomena which can
          assist in understanding the way how polarized light can
          accomplish its beneficial effects. It is known that the
          literature (Dvorak, H F; Senger, D R; Dvorak, A M: Fibrin as a
          component of the tumor stroma; origins and biologic
          significance, published in Cancer Metastasis Review 1983, 1
          pp. 41-73) that the tumor structure is composed of malignant
          cells surrounded by stroma. The latter regulates the access of
          inflammatory cells to tumors. In many transplantable tumors
          lymphocytes are confined largely to the tumor-host interface
          and do not penetrate into mature tumor stroma or provisional
          matrix to any important extent (see also Dvorak, H F; Dvorak,
          A M: Immunhystochemical characterisation of inflammatory cells
          that infiltrate tumors; In: Haskil S. ed: Tumor immunity in
          prognosis: The role of mononuclear cell infiltration, Vol. 3
          New York, Marcel Dekker 1982, pp. 297-307). According to
          recent investigations a well-defined permeability factor is
          produced by the tumor cells which renders local blood vessels
          permeable for protracted periods (See Senger, D R; Galli, S J;
          Dvorak, A M; Peruzzi, C A; Harvey, V S; Dvorak, H F: Tumor
          cells secrete a vascular permeability factor that promotes
          accumulation of ascites fluid, Science, 1983; 219: 983-5). The
          discrepancy between rapidly growing tumor cells and imperfect
          metabolic supply leads to necrosis which phenomenon is often
          referred to as spontaneous disappearing tumors (See Folkman J:
          Tumor angiogenesis, Adv. Cancer Res.: 1985; 43 pp. 175-203).<br>
          <br>
          One of our interesting observations during the experiments was
          that central necrosis occurred earlier and to a greater extent
          than on the animals without polarized light therapy. Although
          such observations require more investigations, this can mature
          to a further verification that polarized light stimulates the
          immunological defense system.<br>
          <br>
          The tumor used for the experiments belonged to a chemically
          induced type. It is known from our previous experiments (See
          Borberg, H; Abdallah, A; Schwulera, U; Sonneborn, H;
          Inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse fibrosarcoma after
          interleukin 2 application, Immunbiol. 172. 1986, pp. 383-390
          and the references included therein) that the growth of
          chemically induced tumors can be inhibited by means of
          non-specific immunostimulants, by lymphocytes from immunised
          donors and soluble products of activated lymphocytes. The
          fact, that polarized light proved to be beneficious for
          decreasing the growth rate of a chemically induced tumor, can
          also be regarded as a further support for the hypothesis that
          the mechanism by means of which polarized light can be
          effective is the general stimulation of the immune system.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the present invention and of the above outlined
          hypothesis the experiments obtained with wound healing obtain
          a new interpretation. In such tests the compositions of the
          wound secretions before and after treatment with polarized
          light were examined and compared to each other. The treatment
          resulted in a significant increase in immunoglobulins and
          other proteins. Also the cellular composition showed a marked
          difference: among neutrophil granulocytes lymphocytes and
          monocytes appeared and demonstrated activity within the wound
          secretion. These had to be caused by changes of the vascular
          permeability and/or subsequent chemotactic efforts which were
          otherwise lacking. The second reason why the particular
          references dealing with the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer
          were cited in the description of the prior art portion of the
          present specification will now be understood. In broad sense
          these papers have pointed out that an increase in activity of
          lymphocytes at the close proximity of tumor cells had
          beneficious effects. The above demonstrated increase in
          activity of the immune system in response to irradiation with
          polarized light can cause similar effects, thus it can be
          expected that the irradiation with polarized light can be an
          alternative (or complementary) to the administration of IL-2
          and/or IL-2 activated lymphocytes.<br>
          <br>
          It might be significant that during the experiments not only
          the tumor area, but the whole body of the mice was irradiated.
          Since polarized light with infrared components has certain
          depth of penetration in tissues, it can be expected that a
          treatment with polarized light on human applications can be
          more effective if irradiation is not limited physically to the
          tumor areas.<br>
          <br>
          A major advantage of the method according to the invention
          lies in the harmless applicability thereof. Further to the
          above described toxity tests it can be added that polarized
          light treatment has been in use for more than six years for
          wound healing, cosmetical and other related applications in
          several countries and thousands of patients were treated
          therewith. Not a single case was reported with any side
          effect.<br>
