        CHICKEN FEET REGENERATE NEURONS?<br>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">by<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Because chicken feet have the potential to regenerate, including
      nerves, bone, and muscle, ground-up preparations of this poultry
      waste product (in the past, called Revital) can be used to promote
      regeneration and healing in spinal cord injury (SCI). Given its
      potential, it was unfortunate that the FDA stopped these efforts,
      spearheaded by veterinarian Dr. Harry Robertson several decades
      ago.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Obtaining the source material is easy because chicken feet are
      discarded as waste products. The key to preparing this
      regenerative material is removing all water at low temperature.
      Most dehydration methods will work because the proteins are
      stable,<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Process:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Basically, the dehydration process causes the water from the wound
      when the powdered chicken’s feet preparation is applied to join
      chemically and ionically with the amino acids. This creates an
      electrical change by which a brief period of nerve bridging takes
      place. When the preparation is repeatedly applied, this bridging
      allows the formation of new nerves according to the already
      present DNA. Due to the breakdown of the preparation in the
      binding process, there is no immunological rejection.<br>
      <br>
      Nerves are the most difficult of the various tissue components to
      re-grow. For example, it is much easier to re-grow bone than
      nerve, not so much because of speed but rather direction. Although
      it is possible to re-grow nerves without sufficient genetic
      encoding by using overriding electrical fields, such an
      alternative will not provide full function and is less desirable.
      Through electrical interconnectively, the natural means are
      preferable.<br>
      <br>
      The uncomplicated application procedure was simply to pack the
      preparation into an open wound, which would then heal from the
      inside out. There was no infection, and there was full restoration
      in animals.<br>
      <br>
      Ideally, the preparation should be packed into the open wound as
      soon as possible after the injury. If this is not possible, an
      intervention is an option, even to cut open and apply this
      preparation with the deliberate intent of increasing the body’s
      ability to repair from the inside.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential Role of Folic Acid:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In addition, however, the chicken feet preparation can be eaten as
      capsules or as mixed with other foods, an area that Robertson did
      not explore. Although many people would consider eating the feet
      themselves repugnant, some cultures do this and find this
      consumption regenerative and helpful.<br>
      <br>
      This beneficial aspect relates to folic acid, an important
      nutrient involved in DNA synthesis and a many other physiological
      roles. For example, scientists have shown it to be important in
      preventing neural tube defects. It is one of the most important
      and flexible components of humic acids, key substances of soils
      and compost that have the ability to absorb and work with minerals
      and other substances. Overall, folic acid plays a critical role in
      regulation of healing in the body. Because there are small amounts
      of the nutrient in chicken feet due to soil contact, folic acid
      was consumed when native tribes ate chicken feet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is time for us to open-mindedly revisit this simple,
      nerve-regenerating therapy. Clearly, it would be relatively easy
      for scientists to checkout the its potential using existing animal
      models and assessments for SCI. There is nothing to lose except
      our belief that solutions for complicated problems must also be
      complicated. <br>

      Remeber when you were little and you got sick and your mother made
      a big steaming pot of hot chicken soup for you? Somehow, you
      always seemed to feel better after you ate it. It was silly, of
      course, and you chuckled over it years later. "Jewish penicillin",
      you called it. "Another of Mom's miraculous home remedies", you
      said. Now comes Dr Harry Robertson to tell us that maybe Mom was
      right after all. Maybe there is something to chicken soup's
      mysterious curative powers.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Harry Robertso is the inventor of Revital, a product he
      unhesitatingly calls "one of the great breakthroughs in medical
      science in the last century". He claims Revital has the pwoer to
      heal the worst third degree burns imaginable without scarring and
      without skin grafting. Furthermore, he says, it will regenerate
      both muscle and nerve tissue.<br>
      <br>
      "What I have done", Dr Robertson boasts, "is something that has
      never been done before. No one to my knowledge has ever proved
      that you could completely regenerate both muscle and nerve tissue
      quickly, cleanly, and painlessly. But I did it and I have the
      documentation to prove it and if I live long enough it's going to
      make me a Nobel laureate. In my opinion, this is a greater
      discovery than penicillin."<br>
      <br>
      Nobody has ever accused Harry Robertson of false modesty when it
      comes to his achievements. But as James Joyce once observed,&nbsp;
      "A man of genius makes no mistakes". People are inclined to suffer
      his occasional boorishness because they recognize that behind the
      bluster and hype and the self-promotion beats the heart of a
      brilliant innovator. "Harry's problem", says his friend Jack
      Ridgway, "is that he's a jump ahead of most folks -- and doesn't
      know it".<br>
      <br>
      Dr Harry Robertson is an energetic 69-year old Salisbury
      veterinarian who accidentally discovered Revital while he was
      looking for an inexpensive source of protein for 3rd world
      countries. As he tells it, he was working late in his lab one
      night when he spilled caustic acid on his hand. Since he didn't
      have a conventional burn remedy handy, he says he grabbed the
      first thing he could find -- a jar of his "liquid protein" -- and
      applied it.<br>
      <br>
      To his utter amazement, the pain and the redness went away in
      about 10 minutes and there was no blistering the next day. From
      that point on, he began using the "protein" whenever he burned
      himself. He gave it to his wife, Thelma, and he handed it out to
      his friends and neighbors, all of whom, he says, achieved the same
      results -- a few minutes after they applied Revital, the pain went
      away. There was no blistering, no infection, and no scarring.<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, Dr Robertson had to abandon his quest for a cheap
      source of protein after an even cheaper source -- soybeans -- was
      discovered. He had been using chicken byproducts -- specifically
      ground-up chicken feet -- but he says he couldn't compete with soy
      products. He turned, instead, to the manufacture of canned dog
      food.<br>
      <br>
      He arrived in Salisbury, a major chicken processing area on the
      Eastern shore, in 1962, looking for a cheap, plentiful source of
      discarded poultry products to use in dog food. A retired army
      officer with 20 years of service in the Veterinary Corps, he was
      custom-packing canned dog food for a number of nationally known
      dog food companies, using a patented process he had invented a few
      years before.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;After he got out of the business in the late 60s (he claims
      he "was squeezed out by a bunch of investment bankers carrying
      briefcases instead of guns"), he turned his attention to running a
      small animal hospital in Salisbury and perfecting Revital, so
      named, he says, because of its "revitalizing effect on human
      tissue". Whatever its effect, there's no denying that people are
      taken aback when they learn that the main ingredient in Revital is
      chicken feet. They find it slightly repugnant.<br>
      <br>
      "I don't know why", Robertson says. "There's nothing wrong with
      it. It's a perfectly logical source. Chicken feet are nothing but
      amino acids and amino acids are the building blocks of the body.
      Hedck, I take a couple of tablespoons of powder every day and it's
      put about 8 pounds of muscle on my body. It's pure and clean and
      perfectly safe. There's nothing in Revital that can harm you".<br>
      <br>
      The US Food and Drug Administration agrees. It approved Revital in
      1978 -- not as a drug, strangely enough, but as a device, a "Class
      I device", the same lassification as that of ordinary baby powder.
      The FDA says Revital (like baby powder) can be sold over the
      counter without a prescription because it contains nothing harmful
      to a person's health.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Robertson says Revital has "basically the same nutrients that
      cells need to rejuvenate themselves". He confesses he doesn't know
      exactly how or why it works, but the amino acids in it (there are
      19, according to the label) probably "stimulate both the DNA and
      the RNA of cells", causing them to multiply and grow. It is not a
      protein, however, although he frequently refers to it that way.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Robertson first became aware of the reparative effects of
      Revital while taking a course in burn therapy in Chicago. He
      became acquainted with a doctor who specialized in burn research.
      "He seemed upset one day and, when I asked him what was wrong, he
      said he was having problems healing 3rd degree burns on some of
      his experimental rabbits. He said the skin grafts dried out too
      quickly and wouldn't take".<br>
      <br>
      Dr Robertson suggested Revital. The doctor agreed to try it, but
      midway through the procedure he ran out of grafts so he treated
      several of the rabbits with Revital alone. When he checked the
      rabbits a few days later he found that not only had the
      "Revital-ized" grafts held, but when he re-dressed the wounds of
      the rabbits that had been treated with Revital alone, he noticed
      also that healthy tissue was growing inside the burn area,
      something that is not supposed to happen in 3rd degree burns
      "because reparative cells normally don't migrate towards the
      center of the burn, they stop right at the edge"...<br>
      <br>
      Later, the Chicago doctor used Revital to treat a young boy with
      severely burned legs. The youth "recovered completely", according
      to Dr Robertson, and in the process he discovered something else
      amazing about Revital. It stopped infections.<br>
      <br>
      "In a majority of burn cases", Dr Robertson says, "victims die
      from infections, not the burns themselves, and infections are
      caused by decaying tissue. The greatest danger is that the dead
      tissue will get into the bloodstream and cause death so it is
      imperative to remove it before that happens. The process is called
      debridement and it can be excruciatingly painful because the skin
      is literally scrubbed away. In this case, however, there was
      absolutely no need to clean the wound. Revital did the job
      beautifully. It completely sterilized it within a day or two and
      the boy recovered nicely with a minimum of scarring".<br>
      <br>
      A few years later, Dr Robertson treated a dog that had been hit by
      a car and was near death. The dog had been dragged under the car
      for several feet. Most of the thigh muscles had been ripped away,
      and a large part of the femur and hip joint were exposed. Dr
      Robertson says he told the owner it was "hopeless". He recommended
      putting the dog to sleep, but the owner pleaded with him to save
      it.<br>
      <br>
      He says he told her the only thing he could possibly recommend was
      Revital, but he had never before used it on such massive injuries
      and could not guarantee it would work. She told him to do anything
      he could. As soon as he got the dog out of shock he saturated the
      wounds with the powder and bandaged the dog. Within an hour, he
      says, the dog "appeared to be experiencing little or no pain".
      When he redressed the wound a few days later, he says it was
      "perfectly clean" and seemed to be "healing nicely although it
      smelled terrible" (something which is not uncommon when using
      Revital on wounds).<br>
      <br>
      Today, the dog is alive and well and "running faster than ever",
      according to her owners, Mr and Mrs Brewington. Mrs Brewington
      says the hair has grown over most of the wounds...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"I don;t know how it worked", Dr Robertson says, "but it
      did. The dog is vcertainly normal in every respect today, which
      flies in the face of everything I learned in veterinary school.
      Once nerves and muscles are destroyed, they're supposed to stay
      destroyed. They're not supposed to regenerate. But they do. When
      Revital is used, they grow right back good as new. That's what's
      so crazy about it. The dog's leg should have atrophied".<br>
      <br>
      Allan Williams, who manages the bookstore at Salisbury State
      University, had an experience similar to the Brewingtons'. His
      dog, a shepherd named Lady, was accidnetally burned by boiling
      water. Mr Williams, who was one of Dr Robertson's assistants in
      the animal hospital at the time, says the dog had&nbsp; 3rd degree
      burns over almost a third of the lower part of her body and hind
      legs.<br>
      <br>
      "The hair was gone and she was burned right down to bare tissue",
      he says. "Harry treated her with the powder every three days and
      after the first week you could see a noticeable difference. The
      skin was pink and healthy-looking. Her hair started growing back
      in 5 or 6 weeks. She didn't seem to be in any pain the day after
      the accident and she started eating right away".<br>
      <br>
      Mr Williams says Lady, who is now 12 (she was about 3 when the
      accident occurred), completely recovered in about 9 weeks. He says
      her skin is in "perfect shape", although he can see a "slight
      difference in coloration where she was burned. "It's a bit
      lighter, but the skin is very soft and pliable, not at all like
      scar tissue". There's only a small patch where the hair isn't
      growing, which in itself is remarkable because hair normally does
      not grow on scar tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Williams remembers a couple of other "basket cases" Dr
      Robertson treated; in particular a poodle that was brought in with
      a cut pad. "Harry stitched it and bandaged it, but somehow the dog
      got the bandage off and chewed the foot off. All that was left was
      the bony structure of the foot. Harry packed it with Revital and
      made a cast for it and the dog grew a whole new foot".<br>
      <br>
      Dr Robertson says he saved a cat's leg in a similar manner. The
      cat was brought to him with a gangrenous leg. It had been
      declawed, but the veterinarian who had declawed it apparently put
      the bandage on too tight, cutting the circulation. Dr Robertson
      says he packed the leg with powder and redressed it every few days
      and eventually the leg and foot grew back completely.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Williams can recall only two of Dr Robertson's experiments with
      Revital that failed: "One time Harry&nbsp;took a section of bone
      out of an old cat to see it it would grow a new one, but it didn't
      work". Another time, "he tried to use the protein to grow hair.
      He's bald and he had me smear the stuff on his head every day for
      6 weeks... [ missing page in photocopy ]<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, much of the Salisbury medical establishment either
      disparages Harry Robertson or adopts a wait-and-see attitude.
      Ronald Davis, a dentist who started treating his patients with
      Revital about 6 years ago, says he thinks Dr Robertson may be onto
      something. He started using Revital primarily on diabetic
      patients, who are prone to develop dry sockets after extractions
      (their blood doesn't really clot), and he says he hasn't had a dry
      socket in 6 years.<br>
      <br>
      Patients "healed faster, with a minimum of pain and virtually no
      inflammation" -- and he has had essentially the same results
      treating patients with periodontal disease. In most cases "the
      pain is gone and the tissue is pink and healthy" within 24 hours.
      Furthermore, Revital has "virtually eliminated the need for
      antibiotics" in periodontal cases.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Richard Snyder, an associate of Dr Davis, says Revital "is
      effective in shrinking the size of periodontal pockets". He's also
      used it to treat abscesses and herpetic lesions and in every case,
      he says, the pain disappears almost instantly. "While I can't
      really say it heals faster", he adds, "it does seem to have a
      positive impact on pain".<br>
      <br>
      Impressed as they are with Revital, Dr Davis and Dr Snyder are
      still not ready to mortgage the farm for it. They both believe it
      has to be studied further. "Based on what I've seen so far, it
      works, but I'ld like to see the mechanism involved", Dr Davis
      says. Adds Dr Snyder, "My guess is it works because we're putting
      the building blocks of the body right at the site of the problem.
      But I think that [hypothesis] should be tested".<br>
      <br>
      At least 3 pharmaceutical firms are doing just that, although
      officially they deny it. A spokeman for one of the firms
      identified by Dr Robertson (and confirmed by Jack Ridgway) said
      that not only did the company not send a representative to
      Salisbury to study Revital, "We've never even heard of it".
      Another firm, which reportedly was preparing to have several
      pounds of the powder shipped to its labs for testing, said it had
      not yet decided to investigate it.<br>
      <br>
      Why all the pussy-footing around? "Competition", confides a member
      of a natiowide drug chain's research and development team, who
      admits off-record that his company is interested in Revital. "If
      what this guy says is true, if this powder of his does half the
      things he says it does, he's sitting on a 7-figure deal -- and no
      company in its right mind is going to run around blabbing about
      it".<br>
      <br>
      That may explain why commercial interests tread cautiously, but
      what about non-profit organization? Dr Robertson says hardly any
      of them have shown any interest and he wishes he knew why.
      Certainly it hasn't been for a lack of trying. He has lugged a
      suitcase full of video tapes and time-lapse pictures all over the
      country trying to drum up interest in Revital. "Most people", he
      says, "couldn't wait to get rid of me."<br>
      <br>
      He says he went to the Army's Brooke Burn Center in San Antonio TX
      three times at his own expense and "barely got the time of day".
      On the last trip, he says, the colonel in charge "sloughed me offf
      to a major who said, I don;t know why they sent you to me, I'm
      getting out in two days". When he tried to show the director of
      the burn unit at the Crozer-Chester Medical Cneter in Chester PA,
      photographs of his work, he says, "The guy told me 'I'm not
      interested;', and he walked away".<br>
      <br>
      He says he's contacted the University of California, U. of
      Maryland, and the U. of Nebraska, and tried to convince them to
      test Revital, but they turned him down cold. "I don't know why",
      he adds, "but I do know that if it hadn't been for Bill Crosby and
      Tony Silvetti and a few others, I'd be dead".<br>
      <br>
      Bill Crosby is Col. William H Crosby, a renowned hematologist and
      senior investigator at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
      in Washington. Tony Silvetti is Dr Anthony N Silvetti, a Chicago
      physician and former US Navy doctor. Col Crosby says he used the
      powder for about 6 years while running a clinic in El Centro CA.<br>
      <br>
      "I used it mainly in the treatment of indolent and infected
      wounds, primarily bedsores, that are slow to heal", he says. "It
      was astonishing. It cleaned them up and healed them in rapid
      fashion. I don't know why, but my hunch is it shortcuts the
      problem of nutrition. One problem in indolent wounds is the blood
      supply is inadequate so the wound is not getting the necessary
      nutrients to heal itself. Revital seems to put the nutrients
      'where the action is'.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Crosby is "sure Revital works", although he concedes he's seen
      Dr Robertson's photos of paw regeneration and is "not particularly
      convinced by them". Still, he says, while regeneration of muscles
      and nerves may be contrary to everything he was taught in medical
      school, "Every year I'm seeing things contrary to what I learned.
      So I've learned to keep my mind open. It may turn out that Harry's
      observations are reproducible and accurate. Certainly, from my
      experience, the powder does clean up infected wounds and it does
      seem to speed up the healing process".<br>
      <br>
      Dr Silvetti is considerably less enthusiastic, although he
      believes Revital "should be given a fair trial". he says he's used
      it in a "limited number of cases and my experience has not been
      like I would have liked it to have been". He says he used it with
      "severely ill patients, who are not good patients to begin with,
      and the results were not that impressive. It didn't harm anyone,
      but there was not complete healing of lesions in some cases". He
      would like to see somebody study it further.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Gary Gibbons, a surgeon at New England's Deaconess Hospital in
      Boston, says he 's been applying Revital in the treatment of foot
      ulcers (both diabetic and non-diabetic) for "about 3 months, but
      it's too early to make any report on it. We don't have enough
      experience with it yet".<br>
      <br>
      Dr Andrew Munster, director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center
      at Baltimore City hospitals, feels the same way. He says he's
      tried Revital, but is not yet prepared to say it works.<br>
      <br>
      "I've used it on two patients with small leg ulcers, and it worked
      on one, but the other guy committed suicide before I could tell
      whether it had any effect. That's not enough experience to
      evaluate it". However, Dr Munster says he's impressed enough by
      the literature he's seen "to give it a chance", and he expects to
      begin using it shortly in large burn cases. "I don't expect
      miracles", he adds. "I'm looking for it to facilitate healing. If
      it does that I'll be satisfied".<br>
      <br>
      Harry Robertson says not to worry, it will do that and more.
      Forget scars. Forget skin grafts. Forget infection, loss of fluids
      and amputation. Revital will take care of all those things -- plus
      it will regenerate nerves and muscles. And that's only the things
      Harry Roberton knows Revital will do. If someone wants to take the
      time and trouble to run some tests on it, he says, there's no
      telling what they might find. Maybe even a cure for... But that's
      another story.<br>

      <br>
      Revital, a product containing 19 amino acids, was applied to
      experimental deep second degree bums in guinea-pigs for 24 days,
      in order to assess the effect of this form of hyperalimentation on
      the healing process. Silver sulphadiazine cream served as the
      contralateral control standard. Epithelialization was faster in
      the silver sulphadiazine treated burn wounds, while contraction of
      both tested wounds proceeded at a similar rate. Revital
      significantly enhanced the formation of granulation and scar
      tissue in this burn wound model. These observations indicate that
      topical wound hyperalimentation promotes granulation tissue
      formation of experimental deep second degree burns in guinea-pigs.<br>

      Medical Protein Hydrolysate is produced from the feet of young
      freshly killed poultry or other young freshly killed animal
      sources of protein which are sufficiently immature that the
      resulting protein lacks antigenic properties. The protein, thus
      produced, is an extract of polypeptides and amino acids having as
      little biological disruption as possible. It is in the form of a
      powder or a gel, each of which is suitable for topical application
      to living cells of animals and humans for aiding in healing. The
      process of production of the Protein Hydrolysate includes treating
      the washed and comminuted poultry feet or other source of protein
      with a dilute acid, preferably acetic acid, and drying under low
      heat conditions the resulting solution to a powder or to a gel.
      The process of using the Protein Hydrolysate including periodic
      topical application to a traumatized (wound) area. In the event
      that treatment is to be below the surface, an aqueous solution of
      the protein can be injected into the area to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I have believed that there had to be a product that would create,
      within a traumatized (wound) area, conditions as close to fetal
      surroundings, as possible, so that the individual cells within
      this area would have the optimum chance for regeneration. Since
      rapidly dividing cells, in the embryo fetal complex, originate
      from a single fertilized cell, and then divide into specialized
      tissues, whether they be muscle, nerve, skin, etc. I have sought a
      protein source material which is readily available and
      inexpensive, being from an immature animal in which the antibodies
      were not well developed. I have found that any freshly killed,
      immature animal or poultry would give me an adequate product.
      Since poultry by-products were readily available, I felt this to
      be an ideal source.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest hindrance to the regenerative healing of woulds
      appears to have been that of antigenicity. Thus, immaturity in the
      protein source is the most important factor in producing a product
      capable of simulating an embryonic condition adjacent to the wound
      and thereby inducing the cells to perhaps retrogress to an earlier
      state or stimulate the memory of the cells to produce other cells,
      capable of more regenerative repair or, at least, repair at a more
      rapid healing rate due to the fact that body defenses in such
      immature cells do not have the ability to reject foreign protein.
      For example, in dogs the body's ability to develop antibodies does
      not develop until 8-9 weeks after birth. In cats, 12-13 weeks and
      in humans, much later.<br>
      <br>
      My Protein Hydrolysate, described hereinafter, is believed to
      possess the properties which I have described above.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Briefly described, my medical Protein Hydrolysate comprises the
      soluble polypeptides and soluble amino acid constituents of
      immature animal protein such as chicken feet and its mineral
      content, resulting from the hydrolyzing of the animal protein with
      a dilute acid, preferably a weak organic acid such as acetic acid,
      and the subsequent drying, or concentrating, of the resulting
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      The process comprises first cleansing the raw material, such as
      the feet of eight or nine week old broilers, then comminuting this
      raw material and subjecting it to a dilute acid, under controlled
      pH and temperature conditions. The resulting solution is decanted,
      strained or filtered and then spray dried or otherwise dewatered
      or concentrated to a dry powder or dried gel.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the powder is topically applied to a moist open wound, or
      is reconstituted with water and injected, with a syringe, into the
      area to be treated. The gel is used for the treatment of
      relatively dry areas and can be reconstituted from the dry powder
      or from partially dried gel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I preferably used the feet of freshly killed immature broilers, or
      other sources of protein from immature freshly killed animals, as
      my raw material and extract therefrom, polypeptides and amino
      acids that are lacking in antigenic properties.<br>
      <br>
      In so doing, I wash and comminute the raw material, then
      selectively dissolve the proteins therefrom, with as little
      biological disruption as possible, using a dilute weak organic
      acid, such as acetic acid or lactic acid, as my hydrolyzing agent,
      supplemented by controlled extraction temperatures. Hydrochloric
      and phosphoric acid have also been tried with less success. By far
      the best acid to employ is acetic acid. The solution thus formed
      is a liquid product which is then dried, either by spray drying or
      dewatering into a dried product, which can be reconstituted into a
      gel.<br>
      <br>
      In more detail, I use young "broiler" chicken feet as they have
      sufficient immature protein and are cheap and abundant. After
      thoroughly washing the feet in water to rid them of dirt, debris
      and blood, I grind the feet through a 1/4 inch plate of a Hobart
      grinder. From 1/8 to 1/2 inch plates can be used; however, a 1/4
      inch plate appears to provide the most efficient size grind for
      rapid and uniform extraction of the soluble proteins.<br>
      <br>
      In a separate container, I make up a water solution of glacial
      acetic acid by adding the glacial acetic acid to the water to
      produce a first dilute acetic acid solution containing from about
      1% to about 11/2% by weight, glacial acetic acid. Into this dilute
      acetic acid solution, on a one to one weight basis, I dump the
      ground feet so that the acid can break down or hydrolize the blood
      and other extraneous matter, this at room temperature, i.e., from
      about 70 DEG F. to about 90 DEG F. I allow the comminuted feet and
      dilute acetic acid solution to work overnight, i.e., eight to
      twelve hours, stirring it periodically so that it is well mixed. I
      then wash or flush the mixture with fresh water until the
      comminuted feet mix is clear of debris. This initial treatment or
      pretreatment with acetic acid solution is to remove blood, free
      fats and serum.<br>
      <br>
      I then make up another mixture of glacial acetic acid and water so
      as to provide a second solution having a pH 4.6. The pH may run
      from pH 6.5 to pH 3.6 if desired. However, I have found that,
      where I have used these extreme ranges, resulting protein material
      is not as effective. The washed comminuted feet mix is then added
      to this second solution in a one to one ratio by weight and the
      resulting mix is heated to a temperature of between 130 DEG F. and
      140 DEG F. and constantly stirred for about 30-40 minutes, but it
      can be comingled and heated for a shorter period of time, with a
      decrease in yield.<br>
      <br>
      This solubilized mixture is then decanted or drawn off and sent
      through a centrifuge to remove most of the fat and particulate
      matter. The defatted centrifuged solution is then passed through a
      filter. So far, I have found that the best filter bed to use is
      "Speed Flow" diatomaceous earth, though I am sure there are other
      filters that would be equally effective.<br>
      <br>
      I next allow the dissolved protein solution to solidify. I then
      skim off the remaining fats. To again solubilize this gelled
      protein, I once again heat it to 100 DEG F.-120 DEG F. so that it
      can be pumped. This mixture (solution) of amino acids and
      polypeptides generally runs from 4%-9% solids. If I want to make a
      gel of it, I dry the solidified (gelled solution) by low
      temperature air drying and reconstitute it when I need it by again
      bringing the solubilizing water up to 100 DEG F.-130 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, another or second extraction, using the second acetic
      acid solution (pH 4.6) on a pound for pound basis of the
      previously extracted ground feet and acetic acid solution. I
      extract for 30 minutes at 140 DEG F.-155 DEG F. and blend this
      mixture in with the other filtered and clarified protein solution,
      after first going through the same defatting and clarifying steps
      as on the first extraction. I have not found that this second
      product is as good as the first extraction as I think there is too
      much denaturation of the proteins, therein.<br>
      <br>
      To produce the dry powder, the resulting solution is spray dried.
      The powder has an average particle size of from about 1 micron to
      about 20 microns.<br>
      <br>
      The same procedure was followed with a solution of lactic acid,
      alsodiluted until the pH was about 4.6. The resultant powder was
      effective, but to a lesser extent than that produced with acetic
      acid. As is conventional, other weak organic acids could be used
      with similar results. The same occurred when hydrochloric and
      phosphoric acid were used.<br>
      <br>
      A better understanding of the present invention will be had by
      reference to the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE I</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      100 pounds of frozen poultry feet, obtained from freshly killed
      commercial broilers, eight to nine weeks old, grown and processed
      in Maryland, U.S.A., were washed with water to remove coarse
      debris, dirt and blood. They were then ground using a Hobart
      Grinder with a 1/4" plate and this comminuted material was
      immersed in 100 pounds of a 1% solution of aqueous glacial acetic
      acid for a period of ten hours at room temperature. The mixture
      was stirred at least once per hour to maximize the area exposed to
      the dilute acetic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Next the solution was drained from the comminuted feet by being
      poured onto a 1/32" mesch screen. The material on the screen was
      then washed with water until the wash water was clear. This
      resulted in 87 pounds of cleansed comminuted or ground broiler or
      poultry feet.<br>
      <br>
      A first extraction was made up by mixing glacial acetic acid and
      water to produce a resulting solution having about 1% by weight,
      glacial acetic acid.<br>
      <br>
      To 87 pounds of the first extraction solution was added the 87
      pounds of cleansed comminuted poultry feet. The pH of the mix was
      then adjusted to a pH of 4.6 by the addition of glacial acetic
      acid. This mixture was then constantly stirred and brought to a
      temperature of about 130 DEG F. and maintained within the range of
      about 130 DEG F. to about 140 DEG F. for about 1/2 hour so as to
      dissolve the soluble protein from the ground material.<br>
      <br>
      This hot solubilized mixture was then passed through a milk
      centrifuge so that the fat was discharged from the solution and
      the solids or non-solubilized material removed therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      Thence, the centrifuged solution was filtered by being passed
      through diatomaceous earth (Speed Flow--a Dow Chemical[Grefco]
      product). At this stage the solution was a clear solution
      containing approximately 5.7 pounds of the polypeptides and amino
      acids mix.<br>
      <br>
      While still in its liquid state, the clear solution at a
      temperature of from about 100 DEG F. to about 120 DEG F. was
      passed through a spray dryer. The inlet temperature of the air was
      about 250 DEG F. and the outlet temperature was about 120 DEG F.
      The resulting non-antigenic Protein Hydrolysate powder, being
      hydroscopic, was then immediately placed in an air tight, moisture
      impervious container so that it would not cake.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE II</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The procedure of Example I was repeated but instead of spray
      drying, the filtered solution was dried in dry air at a
      temperature of from 65 DEG to 75 DEG F., until it contained about
      5%, by weight, moisture.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting Protein Hydrolysate material weighed 6.1 pounds and
      was placed in an airtight, moisture impervious container.<br>
      <br>
      The material was later mixed with water to produce various samples
      of gels containing from about 15% to about 30%, by weight, of the
      material. The water was preheated to from about 120 DEG F. to
      about 130 DEG F. and the material added to the warm water. The
      gels were kept under refrigeration.<br>
      <br>
      In Examples I and II a Sharpless centrifuge or cream separator
      with fixed parts was used. A Bowen spray dryer was used in Example
      I.<br>
      <br>
      In the procedure of the Protein Hydrolysate described above, i.e.,
      by extracting the polypeptides and amino acids through the use of
      acetic acid as a solvent for the extracted proteins, the proteins
      are broken down from their complex protein structures to the
      simpler structures. It is important, for best results, that the
      solids, i.e. minerals, which precipitate out as the filtered
      hydrolyzed protein is dewatered and cooled be retained in the
      resulting product. Protein Hydrolysate, without such minerals,
      while causing excellent repair of a wound, may result in
      concomitant hyperplasia which should be debrided to bring it in
      line with adjacent tissue. Thereafter, the wound will slowly
      continue to repair.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, I have found that it is not desirable to remove
      the precipitated minerals which precipitated out as the extracted
      (solubilized) proteins lose moisture and that it is not desirable
      to filter the product after it is in concentrated form. When the
      non-precipitated mixtures of Examples I and II were used, the
      hyperplasia of regenerating tissue disappeared and remarkable
      regrowth of not only muscle tissue, but skin and nerve tissue,
      also, regenerated and returned to its normal position and contour
      and function, indicating that it restored memory to the tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TREATMENT USING MY MEDICAL
        PROTEIN HYDROLYSATE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      My Protein Hydrolysate is particularly useful for the treatment of
      burns, particularly third degree burns. The dry powder is
      sprinkled over the effected area and combines with the moisture in
      the tissue to provide a protective cell stimulating coating. The
      gel is preferably used for first and second degree burns, where a
      relatively dry area is involved. Pain is usually stopped in three
      to five minutes after application to the effected area. I have
      found it preferable to apply a sprinkled layer of dry powder or
      gel to the burned area about every third day.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of third degree burns, the powder allows for the
      fiberblasts or regenerative cells to continue to grow out from the
      center and edges of the wound so that skin grafting is materially
      reduced or entirely eliminated. Furthermore, the new skin even
      appears to be formed from normal cells and hair actually grows
      from the new skin in a normal way.<br>
      <br>
      In most cases of wounds in animals treated with my material,
      either spray dried or in gel form, bacterial infections have
      generally been eliminated after the first three days, and in all
      cases, infection appeared to be eliminated at the end of the
      seventh day (end of second application). This has been
      demonstrated with gas gangrene (clinically), massive disruptive
      wounds resulting from auto and other traumatic disruptions of the
      skin and underlying muscle, nerve and vascular tissues.<br>
      <br>
      When using my material topically applied, either in spray dried
      powder or gel form, the hyperplasia of regenerating tissue
      disappeared and remarkable regrowth of not only muscle tissue, but
      skin and nerve tissue, also, regenerated and returned to its
      normal position and contour and function, indicating that it
      restored memory to the tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Bed sores which have existed for some time have healed quite well
      after treatment with my material. Indeed, even cells which
      appeared to have died around a wound were restored to normal.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPARATIVE TEST</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      To demonstrate the importance of using immature animal tissue and
      particularly immature poultry feet, the following test was run.
      Four cats of like weight, maturity and state of health were
      operated on and three muscles of the upper right thigh were
      severed: the Bicepts femoris, the Vastus lateralis and the
      Semitendinosus. Each cat was treated with an agent topically
      applied to cover the wound twice a week until all wounds healed.<br>
      <br>
      The first cat was treated with protein hydrolysate prepared
      according to Example II above. Its wounds healed in 21 days
      without complications. It walked without a limp in 7 days.<br>
      <br>
      A second cat, treated with a protein hydrolysate prepared in an
      identical manner from the feet of chicken about one year old.
      Healing took 33 days and hyperplasia developed on the 8th day.
      Normal walking occurred only on the 15th day.<br>
      <br>
      A third cat was treated with a prior art protein hydrolysate,
      hydrolysed casein, a Borden product. It developed hyperplasia on
      the 7th day and a secondary infection, both of which persisted
      until final healing at 33 days. This cat limped until final
      healing.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth cat, treated with the broad spectrum antibiotic
      5-Nitro-2-fureldehyde semi-carbazone ("FURACIN", a product of
      Eaton Laboratories). Healing took 33 days. A lesser amount of
      hyperplasia was noted and the cat walked with a limp for the
      entire period.<br>
      <br>
      The third and fourth cats also exhibited progressive atrophy of
      the muscles posterior to the incision continuing until the femur
      could be palpitated.<br>
      <br>
      This test demonstrates the effectiveness and advantage of protein
      hydrolysate prepared according to the present invention and
      particularly speed of recovery, lack of infection absence of
      hyperplasia and full return of muscle function.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus seen that the therapeutic agent of the present
      invention, i.e. my medical Protein Hydrolysate, is a hydroscopic
      mixture of polypeptides and amino acids. It appears to have the
      fantastic ability to create, around a wound area, conditions that
      allow true tissue regeneration, this is the total absence of
      antibodies, even in the most critically infected wounds.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the wound is heavily covered with my powder or gel.
      When powder is used, the area must be moist so that the powder can
      stick. No adverse tissue reaction has been observed in any
      treatment using my Protein Hydrolysate.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to cover the wound with a non-adhering dressing
      (Telfa) to keep the powder/gel in contact with the wound. The
      treatment of the wound with my material should be repeated every
      three or four days.<br>
