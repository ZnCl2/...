          THE NEGLECTED ELEMENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE HEALTHY

        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Rex Newnham</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Author of "Beating Arthritis
          and Beating Osteoporosis”</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      I spent most of the period of the 1980s doing epidemiological work
      and researching the areas of the world where there is more or less
      than the normal prevalence of arthritis of about 20%, and areas
      where there is more or less than the norm of boron in the soil or
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The motivation for this work originated 35 years ago when I was
      living in Perth, Western Australia. Most of the soils around Perth
      are white sands which are very low in all essential minerals, but
      there are a few isolated areas with clay soils. At first I lived
      on one of these and all was well and we grew most of our own
      vegetables. Then we moved to an area where there was sandy soil.
      This had grown Banksia scrub and the sand was dark on the top and
      the first vegetable crop was fair, but the next year there was a
      terrible crop and every trace mineral was seen to be deficient in
      some plant or other. I had been trained in botany and had been
      teaching botany and soil science, so I could pick these
      deficiencies readily. At this time I developed arthritis and found
      walking difficult. The local GP gave me something which did not
      help, so I started to try to discover the cause of my own
      arthritis. With my training I naturally thought of soil minerals
      when these were all deficient in my diet. I looked at what the
      literature had to say about all of them - boron, calcium, copper,
      iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, potassium and zinc. None
      were relevant to arthritis, but boron was written off as not
      needed by man or animal, yet I knew that it was essential to the
      green plant and that it helped in calcium metabolism in the plant.<br>
      <br>
      I found out all that I could about boron and most of the
      literature dealt with its toxicity. 40-60 grams was a dangerous
      dose and children had been killed with much smaller doses, but
      there was nothing helpful. So I took 30 mg of borax twice daily,
      this was 6 mg of elemental boron a day and in a week the pain was
      less, in ten days the pain was less. In three weeks the pain,
      swelling and stiffness had all gone, so I stopped taking the
      borax. A year later the pain and swelling returned so I took more
      borax and in two weeks all was right again.<br>
      <br>
      I then told the medical people at the university and the public
      health officials, but none of them were interested. Then I told a
      few people who had arthritis and they were thrilled as they were
      getting better. But it meant buying a packet of chemical that was
      labelled poison - for killing cockroaches and ants. Some were put
      off this recommendation and they persuaded me to have tablets made
      with a safe amount of boron.<br>
      <br>
      I did this in 1976 and the first 1000 bottles took 2 years to
      sell. Then I got 2000 bottles and they went in 6 months, then 7000
      went in six months, then 20,000 went in 8 months and another
      20,000 went in six months, and another 20,000 went in 4 months and
      finally in 1981 the last 20,000 went in 2 months. That is 10,000
      bottles in a month and all without advertising.<br>
      <br>
      By this time I had retired from teaching and qualified as a
      naturopath, homeopath and nutritionist. I did attempt to do a
      normal medical degree but was too old to start at 55. I was
      employing people to handle the boron tablets and then I did a
      foolish thing and went to a drug company for help in marketing,
      thinking they would be interested in overcoming arthritis. But
      they were not interested; they were concerned at an opposition
      product. That company had men on at least two government
      committees and they had the law changed so that boron became an S4
      poison and I was fined for selling a poison. They successfully
      destroyed my business in Australia, but by that time I had started
      exporting the same tablets and went to New Zealand, South Africa,
      America and Britain where they sold well. From half to 3/4 of a
      million people have benefitted from these boron tablets.<br>
      <br>
      From 1983 to 87 a double blind controlled pilot study was
      conducted in Melbourne. It only involved 20 people but of those
      who finished 70% gained much benefit. The trial only lasted for 2
      months and later knowledge has shown that older people need 3 or
      even 4 months in order to get quite free of arthritic symptoms.
      Those in the trial were aged 50-75 and should have used the
      tablets for 3 or 4 months. There were no side effects and the 22
      ancillary clinical, haematological and biochemical tests all
      proved that boron in these doses was not harmful or abnormal. (1)
      Then in the 1980s I carried out my epidemiological work and this
      meant nine trips around the world; I consulted Lawrence's book to
      try to ascertain where there was more or less arthritis in a
      population (2). This made me look towards Jamaica and Mauritius
      for a start. <br>
      <br>
      In Jamaica I hired a car and somebody who could act as interpreter
      as not everybody spoke English. I visited many farms and markets
      and saw all the essential mineral deficiency symptoms in all fruit
      and vegetable crops. Even the pine trees showed boron deficiency
      symptoms. Boron deficiency was very common. I visited the
      university departments of botany and medicine and the agriculture
      and forestry departments. All these people were helpful and showed
      concern. Even Mr. Jones, the Minister for Forests told me that
      some forests were owned by private companies and these had added
      boron to their fertilizer. Soil tests and analysis had been done
      by Dr. Weir and these showed a severe boron deficiency. Of the 34
      soil types 29 of these had less then 0.5 parts per million (ppm)
      of available boron. l .5 ppm boron in the soil is considered
      normal. This had never been published in journals but the files
      were in departmental records. The reason for the severe boron
      deficiency was that NPK fertilizer had been used every year since
      l 872 and in the: 70's and 80's l5 hundred weight of fertilizer
      was used on every acre of sugar producing land every year,
      according to the Sugar Industry Research Institute. The University
      Medical Department said that there was 12% with erosion arthritis
      and they estimated that 70% of the population had some form of
      arthritis. It was even obvious that the dogs in Kingston were
      limping. Compared with other country shows that these people
      consumed less than 0.5 mg boron per day. When the land would not
      grow sugar farmers were allowed to try to grow food crops on that
      soil and they had little success. <br>
      <br>
      Mauritius is another sugar producing island where similar
      fertilizer programmed were in use. Some prominent medical men from
      the Queen Victoria Hospital estimated that 50% of all people had
      some arthritic symptoms, and they were alarmed at the rise in
      juvenile arthritis; the Health Department would not give an
      estimate and would only say how many had entered hospital. Yet the
      Pampelmoussis botanic Gardens had wonderful plants that showed no
      mineral deficiency symptoms. This shows how continued application
      of NPK fertilizer without giving the soil a rest has a devastating
      effect on the health of soil, crops and people. In 1987 Dr. Woodun
      said that the soils of Mauritius were exhausted and nobody heeded
      him. Then in 1984 with my work a similar warning was given and was
      not heeded. Analyzes had shown that since 1962 the boron level in
      sugar cane leaf was steadily decreasing. The optimum level is 40
      ppm and it was to decrease to 5-12 ppm by 1968. The critical level
      is 1 ppm when hardly anything will grow. The soil was worn out and
      so were the people.<br>
      <br>
      Fiji is another sugar producing island in the Pacific where the
      sugar is produced by Indians who eat rice they grow themselves. At
      the other end of the island are the Native Fijians who eat starchy
      fruits and vegetables but little rice. The Indians had 40% with
      arthritis while the native Fijians only had 10%. <br>
      <br>
      Visits were also made to Carnarvon in NW Australia where the water
      used for crop irrigation has 2 ppm boron. I met people who told me
      that they had gone there for a few months to enjoy the good
      climate so as to get rid of their arthritis. A survey was
      conducted in which school leavers took questionnaires to every
      fourth house, showed that 1% of the people had arthritis or joint
      problems. It was the good water and not the good climate. Some of
      the stations inland from Carnarvon had up to 7 ppm boron in the
      bore water and there was no arthritis in man or animal. Food crops
      often had over 100 ppm boron when analysed.<br>
      <br>
      Ngawha in the far north of New Zealand has spa water with 300 ppm
      boron and they advertise that this spa is good for arthritis. In
      fact it is the main industry in Ngawha. Dr. Herbert in 1921 was
      the government balneologist and he wrote a book about the New
      Zealand spas in which he showed how some of these were very
      beneficial for arthritics. (2). He did not know why, but those
      that he mentioned as good for arthritics were all rich in boron.<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting place was Israel where the water beneath the
      coastal plain contains 2-3 ppm boron, and this is used for
      irrigation. Even the Dead Sea is rich in boron and many have made
      claims that bathing in this water will heal many diseases
      including arthritis. Dr. Zve Bentwich has written a paper that
      shows there is 0.35% of the population with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) and he estimated that a similar number had osteo arthritis
      (OA), (3).<br>
      <br>
      In South Africa Prof. Meyers showed that the Xhosa tribal people
      had 2.2% with RA and this is consistent with other tribal peoples.
      When these same people go to live in the big cities such as Durban
      they soon develop the same prevalence for all arthritis as the
      rest of the population. <br>
      <br>
      So it was decided to analyse some of their food which is mainly
      corn or mealies. That grown in the native areas is a poor looking
      corn with black, blue, red and yellow grains but it had 5 ppm
      boron, while the commercial ground maize sold in the supermarkets
      had only from 0.4 to 0.75 ppm boron. Even the commercially grown
      maize had only about l ppm or less of boron because it was grown
      with fertilizer. The University of Natal did many analyses for me
      to show this point. <br>
      <br>
      In America and Finland there were many analyses of foods which
      showed the boron content, also estimates of actual boron
      consumption. The normal consumption of boron is between l and 2 mg
      per person per day, yet some consume 41 mg/day.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that this average of 1-2 mg per day boron intake is
      not sustainable as regards good health. We need in the region of 6
      to 8 mg per day and that will sustain good health as regards
      arthritic diseases. When we talk about sustainable medicine we
      should really be talking about sustainable health, and when this
      is applied to arthritic diseases and osteoporosis we need a good
      supply of boron and 6-8 mg a day is sufficient. Those with active
      disease are helped with 9-10 mg a day. I have been taking a boron
      supplement for 30 years and my wife also takes it every day and we
      have no joint problems.<br>
      <br>
      The Human Nutrition Research Center in North Dakota has furthered
      some of my work and they have shown how 3 mg a day of boron will
      reduce the average loss of calcium in post menopausal women from
      117 to 64 mg per day. The same boron will also raise the level of
      17 beta estradiol to normal in these women. Dr. Forrest Nielsen
      shows that boron and calcium work together at the cell membrane
      and this affects the modification of hormone action. (5) Now there
      are many others who have shown how the arthritic diseases are
      associated with allergies. Allergies can also be caused by
      problems at the cell membrane level where the allergen or
      histamine or similar do not move freely across cell membranes. It
      looks as if boron may be very relevant here. In order to sustain
      good health we need 6 mg a day or more of boron which is now a
      food supplement or a medicine in some places. This is sustainable
      and is even essential for health. <br>

      Rex E. Newnham PhD, DO, ND, was born and raised in Christchurch,
      New Zealand, and received his initial medical and science training
      there and in Australia. A teacher of Chemistry, soil science,
      agricultural botany, biology and geology for over thirty years Dr.
      Newnham’s investigations into nutrition began with a search for
      relief from his own arthritis, an affliction that became his
      primary field of inquiry. From this beginning, he went on to study
      homeopathy, naturopathy and osteopathy and earned a PhD in
      nutrition. He operated clinics in New Zealand, Australia and
      Britain and undertook nine trips around the world researching the
      epidemiology of arthritis and the general effects of nutrition on
      human health. He lived in Cracoe, near Skipton in the Yorkshire
      Dales, England, until his death in April 2008.<br>

      <br>
      Since 1963, evidence has accumulated that suggests boron is a safe
      and effective treatment for some forms of arthritis. The initial
      evidence was that boron supplementation alleviated arthritic pain
      and discomfort of the author. This was followed by findings from
      numerous other observations epidemiologic and controlled animal
      and human experiments. These findings included a) analytical
      evidence of lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and
      synovial fluid from people with arthritis than from those without
      this disorder; b) observation evidence that bones of patients
      using boron supplements are much harder to cut than those of
      patients not using supplements; c) epidemiologic evidence that in
      areas of the world where boron intakes usually are 1.0 mg or
      less/day the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 20 to
      70%, whereas in areas of the world where boron intakes are usually
      3 to 10 mg, the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 0 to
      10%; d) experimental evidence that rats with induced arthritis
      benefit from orally or intraperitoneally administered boron; e)
      experimental evidence from a double-blind placebo-boron
      supplementation trial with 20 subjects with osteoarthritis. A
      significant favorable response to a 6 mg boron/day supplement was
      obtained; 50% of subjects receiving the supplement improved
      compared to only 10% receiving the placebo. The preceding data
      indicate that boron is an essential nutrient for healthy bones and
      joints, and that further research into the use of boron for the
      treatment or prevention of arthritis is warranted.<br>

      You may not be able to imagine that borax, this humble insecticide
      and laundry detergent, has the potential of singlehandedly
      bringing down our entire economic system. But you do not need to
      worry, the danger has been recognised and the necessary steps are
      already being taken to defuse the situation. I will start with the
      basics and you will understand what I mean as the story unfolds.<br>
      <br>
      Borax is a naturally occurring and mined mineral salt and the
      source of other manufactured boron compounds. The main deposits
      are in Turkey and California. Chemical names are sodium
      tetraborate decahydrate, disodium tetraborate decahydrate, or
      simply sodium borate. This means it contains four atoms of boron
      as its central feature combined with two sodium atoms and ten
      molecules (or sometimes less) of crystallisation water. Therefore,
      borax is the sodium salt of the weak boric acid. Because sodium is
      more strongly alkaline, this makes a solution of borax strongly
      alkaline with a pH between 9 and 10 (pH 7 is neutral). When
      ingested, it reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form
      boric acid and sodium chloride. The boron content of Borax is
      11.3% while for boric acid it is 17.5% or about 50% higher.
      Ingested boron compounds are rapidly and nearly completely
      excreted with the urine. Formerly boric acid was widely used as a
      preservative in foods but is now banned for this purpose in most
      countries, and is also banned from public sale in Australia.<br>
      <br>
      According to conventional medicine it is not known if boron is
      essential for humans but research shows that we do need it. The
      reason why it was difficult to answer this question is the
      presence of boron in all plants and unprocessed foods. Diets with
      a fair amount of fruit and vegetables provide about 2 to 5 mg of
      boron per day, but this also depends on the region where the food
      was grown and how it was grown.<br>
      <br>
      In reality the average intake in developed countries is 1-2 mg of
      boron per day. Institutionalized patients may receive only 0.25 mg
      of daily boron. Chemical fertilizers inhibit the uptake of boron
      from the soil:&nbsp; an organic apple grown in good soil may have
      20 mg boron, but if grown with fertilizer it may have only 1 mg of
      boron. Fertilizers combined with poor food choices have greatly
      reduced our boron intake compared to 50 or 100 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      Further, unhealthy cooking methods greatly reduce the availability
      of boron from food. The cooking water of vegetables containing
      most of the minerals may be discarded during home cooking or
      commercial processing; phytic acid in baked goods, cereals and
      cooked legumes may greatly reduce availability, while gluten
      sensitivity and Candida overgrowth inhibit the absorption of
      minerals. All this makes health problems due to boron deficiency
      now very common.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Health Effects of Boron</span><br>
      <br>
      Due to their content of boron, borax and boric acid have basically
      the same health effects, with good antiseptic, antifungal, and
      antiviral properties but only mild antibacterial action. In plants
      as well as animals boron is essential for the integrity and
      function of cell walls, and the way signals are transmitted across
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      Boron is distributed throughout the body with the highest
      concentration in the parathyroid glands, followed by bones and
      dental enamel. It is essential for healthy bone and joint
      function, regulating the absorption and metabolism of calcium,
      magnesium and phosphorus through its influence on the parathyroid
      glands. With this boron is for the parathyroids what iodine is for
      the thyroid.<br>
      <br>
      Boron deficiency causes the parathyroids to become overactive,
      releasing too much parathyroid hormone which raises the blood
      level of calcium by releasing calcium from bones and teeth. This
      then leads to osteoarthritis and other forms of arthritis,
      osteoporosis and tooth decay. With advancing age high blood levels
      of calcium lead to calcification of soft tissues causing muscle
      contractions and stiffness; calcification of endocrine glands,
      especially the pineal gland and the ovaries; arteriosclerosis,
      kidney stones, and calcification of the kidneys ultimately leading
      to kidney failure. Boron deficiency combined with magnesium
      deficiency is especially damaging to the bones and teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Boron affects the metabolism of steroid hormones, and especially
      of sex hormones. It increases low testosterone levels in men and
      oestrogen levels in menopausal women. It also has a role in
      converting vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing calcium
      uptake and deposition into bone and teeth rather than causing soft
      tissue to calcify. Also other beneficial effects have been
      reported such as improvement of heart problems, vision, psoriasis,
      balance, memory and cognition.<br>
      <br>
      The German cancer researcher Dr Paul-Gerhard Seeger has shown that
      cancer commonly starts with the deterioration of cell membranes.
      As boron is essential for cell membranes and boron deficiency
      widespread, this may be an important cause for the initiation of
      tumour growth. Boron compounds have anti-tumour properties and are
      "potent anti-osteoporotic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipemic,
      anti-coagulant and anti-neoplastic agents" (1).<br>
      <br>
      This overview shows the wide-ranging influence of boron on our
      health. In the following I want to describe some of these health
      effects in greater detail.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Arthritis Cure of Rex Newnham</span><br>
      <br>
      In the 1960's Rex Newnham, Ph.D., D.O., N.D, developed arthritis.
      At that time he was a soil and plant scientist in Perth, Western
      Australia. Conventional drugs did not help, so he looked for the
      cause into the chemistry of plants. He realized that plants in
      that area were rather mineral deficient. Knowing that boron aids
      calcium metabolism in plants he decided to try it. He started
      taking 30 mg of borax a day, and in three weeks all pain, swelling
      and stiffness had disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      He told public health and medical school authorities about his
      discovery but they were not interested. However, some people with
      arthritis were delighted as they improved. Others were scared to
      take something with a poison label on the container and meant to
      kill cockroaches and ants. Eventually he had tablets made with a
      safe and effective quantity of borax.<br>
      <br>
      Within five years and only by word of mouth he sold 10,000 bottles
      a month. He could no longer cope and asked a drug company to
      market it. That was a major mistake. They indicated that this
      would replace more expensive drugs and reduce their profits. It so
      happened that they had representatives on government health
      committees and arranged that in 1981 Australia instituted a
      regulation that declared boron and its compounds to be poisons in
      any concentration. He was fined $1000 for selling a poison, and
      this successfully stopped his arthritis cure from spreading in
      Australia. (2)<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently he published several scientific papers on borax and
      arthritis. One was a double-blind trial in the mid 1980's at the
      Royal Melbourne Hospital which showed that 70% of those who
      completed the trial were greatly improved. Only 12% improved when
      on placebo. There were no negative side-effects, but some reported
      that their heart ailment had also improved, and there was better
      general health and less tiredness. (3)<br>
      <br>
      Most of his later research was devoted to the relationship between
      soil boron levels and arthritis. He found, for instance that the
      traditional sugarcane islands, due to long-term heavy use of
      fertilizers, have very low soil-boron levels. Jamaica has the
      lowest level and arthritis rates are about 70%. He noted that even
      most dogs were limping. Next comes Mauritius with very low boron
      levels and 50% arthritis. The daily boron intake in these
      countries is less than 1 mg/day. An interesting comparison is
      between Indian and native Fijians. The Indians are estimated to
      have an arthritis rate of about 40% and eat much rice grown with
      fertilizer while the native Fijians with an estimated arthritis
      rate of 10% eat mainly starchy root vegetables grown privately
      without fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      The US, England, Australia and New Zealand generally have average
      soil-boron levels with an estimated intake of 1 to 2 mg of boron
      and arthritis rates of about 20%. But Carnarvon in Western
      Australia has high boron levels in soil and water, and the
      arthritis rate is only 1%. It is similar in a place called Ngawha
      Springs in New Zealand with very high boron levels in the spa
      water which is curative for arthritis. Actually all spas reputedly
      curing arthritis have very high boron levels. These are also high
      in Israel with an estimated daily boron intake of 5 to 8 mg and
      only 0.5 - 1% arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      Bone analysis showed that arthritic joints and nearby bones had
      only half the boron content of healthy joints. Equally, synovial
      fluid that lubricates joints and provides nutrients to the
      cartilage is boron deficient in arthritic joints. After boron
      supplementation bones were much harder than normal and surgeons
      found them more difficult to saw through. With additional boron
      bone fractures heal in about half the normal time in both man and
      animal. Horses and dogs with broken legs, or even a broken pelvis,
      have fully recovered.<br>
      <br>
      Borax is also effective with other forms of arthritis, such as
      Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Arthritis, and Lupus (Systemic
      Lupus Erythematosus). For instance Dr Newnham saw a young girl
      aged 9 months with juvenile arthritis. He was able to cure her in
      2 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      He wrote that commonly people can get rid of their pain, swelling
      and stiffness in about 1 to 3 months. Then they can reduce
      treatment from 3 to 1 boron tablet (each 3 mg) per day as a
      maintenance dose so that they can avoid any future arthritis. He
      also stated that patients with rheumatoid arthritis commonly
      experienced a Herxheimer reaction and that this is always a good
      prognostic sign. They must persevere and in another 2 or 3 weeks
      the pain, swelling and stiffness will be gone. (4,5)<br>
      <br>
      I found this statement not only interesting but also surprising.
      The Herxheimer reaction is an early aggravation of symptoms with
      increased pain. It is commonly due to toxins released by killed
      Candida and mycoplasma. This is very common with antimicrobial
      therapy, and borax definitely is an exceptionally good and strong
      fungicide. What surprises me, however, is that this fungicidal
      effect is already present at this rather low dose of 75 to 90 mg
      of borax. Equally surprising is the finding that also up to 30% of
      those with osteoarthritis experienced a Herxheimer reaction,
      suggesting that the border between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
      arthritis is rather fluid. I believe that in long-standing and
      especially resistant cases it will be advisable to use other
      antimicrobials in addition. For co-factors in arthritis
      treatment&nbsp; also see my article Arthritis and Rheumatism or
      the booklet OVERCOMING ARTHRITIS.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Osteoporosis and Sex Hormones</span><br>
      <br>
      Boron deficiency causes greatly increased amounts of&nbsp; calcium
      and magnesium to be lost with the urine. A borax supplement will
      reduce the daily loss of calcium by nearly 50%. As this calcium
      comes mainly from resorbed bone and teeth, boron deficiency may be
      the most important factor in causing osteoporosis and tooth decay.<br>
      <br>
      It has been estimated that 55% of Americans over 50 have
      osteoporosis and of these about 80% are women. Worldwide 1 in 3
      women and 1 in 12 men over the age of 50 may have osteoporosis,
      and this is responsible for millions of fractures each year. Rats
      with osteoporosis were given a boron supplement for 30 days with
      the result that their bone quality was now comparable with that of
      the healthy control group and of a group supplemented with
      oestradiol (6).<br>
      <br>
      The beneficial effect of borax on bones seems to be due to two
      interrelated effects: a higher boron content of the bones which
      makes them harder, and a normalisation of sex hormones which
      stimulates the growth of new bone. Low oestrogen levels after
      menopause are thought to be the main reason why so many older
      women develop osteoporosis. In men testosterone levels decline
      more gradually which seems to be reflected in their later onset of
      osteoporosis as a group.<br>
      <br>
      Research has now shown that boron supplementation in
      postmenopausal women doubles the blood level of the most active
      form of oestrogen, 17-beta oestradiol, to the level found in women
      on oestrogen replacement therapy. Equally, the blood levels of
      testosterone more than doubled (7). With HRT there is a higher
      risk of breast or endometrial cancer which is not known to happen
      with hormones produced by the body as with borax supplementation.<br>
      <br>
      Some women get premenstrual problems because oestrogen levels are
      too high and progesterone too low, and therefore may be afraid of
      using boron. However, I found no evidence that boron raises
      oestrogen above normal healthy levels. Boron may balance levels of
      sex hormones similar to the action of maca root powder. Maca acts
      on the pituitary gland not only to increase but also to balance
      our sex hormones and seems to stimulate our own progesterone
      production as needed.<br>
      <br>
      A recent study in younger men (29 - 50) showed that the level of
      free testosterone (the form that matters most) had risen by one
      third after a daily supplementation of about 100 mg of borax for
      one week (8). This is of special interest for bodybuilders.<br>
      <br>
      Contrary to the medical preference of chemically castrating men
      with prostate cancer, research with boron has shown that elevated
      testosterone levels are beneficial by shrinking prostate tumours
      and PSA levels, PSA being a marker for tumours and inflammation in
      the prostate. Also significantly improved memory and cognition in
      elderly individuals may be partly due to increased levels of sex
      hormones and partly to improved membrane functions of brain cells
      (9).<br>
      <br>
      I have been asked about boron supplementation for women with
      oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer. Breast cancer is related to
      calcifications in the breast. In my opinion it is more important
      to normalize the calcium-magnesium metabolism and cellular
      membrane functions rather than feel restricted by a possibly
      faulty medical concept, especially as I believe that cancer can
      usually be controlled with long-term antimicrobial therapy.
      Therefore I would use boron as well as maca in this case.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fungi and Fluoride</span><br>
      <br>
      Being such an excellent fungicide it is not surprising that borax
      is being successfully used to treat Candida. There is much
      interesting information on an Earth Clinic forum called Borax
      Cures (10). With low to medium-weight people use 1/8 teaspoon of
      borax powder and with heavier weight 1/4 teaspoon per litre of
      water. One drinks the water spaced out during the day, and does
      this for 4 or 5 days a week as long as required. <br>
      <br>
      Many contributors wrote that it cured or greatly helped them. So
      for instance this post: "I also have psoriasis, so maybe the
      soreness in my joints is the psoriatic arthritis creeping in. I
      thought, after reading about borax here on this forum, I would
      give it a try. OMG! In one day, the soreness in my knees has
      vanished! .... Also, my psoriasis seems a lot better after 2 days
      drinking 1/4 tsp borax in 1 litre of water per day."<br>
      <br>
      Another one about toe fungus: "He wet his feet and then took a
      handful (of borax) and rubbed it all over his feet. He said it
      stopped itching immediately! He was stunned. A few weeks later I
      asked him how his athletes foot was and he said: oh wow! it hasn't
      come back! that stuff totally cured it !!!"<br>
      <br>
      Other enthusiastic posts were about vaginal thrush. Borax appeared
      to be more effective than other remedies. Commonly one large
      gelatine capsule filled with borax or boric acid was inserted at
      bedtime for several nights or up to 2 weeks. Alternatively the
      powder can be mixed with cool solidified coconut oil as a bolus or
      suppository.<br>
      <br>
      A recent scientific study (11) confirms these positive
      observations with vaginal thrush. Boric acid at the dose of a
      filled capsule worked even in cases of drug-resistant Candida and
      against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. Because of the greater
      dilution, a douche may not be strong enough for bacteria and
      drug-resistant Candida but it should work for normal Candida.
      Borax, due to its alkalinity, was more effective than boric acid.<br>
      <br>
      In normal healthy conditions Candida exists as harmless oval yeast
      cells. When challenged, chains of elongated cells called
      pseudohyphae develop, and finally strongly invasive long, narrow
      and tube-like filaments called hyphae. These damage the intestinal
      wall, and cause inflammation and Leaky Gut Syndrome. Pseudohyphae
      and hyphae can be seen in the blood of individuals with cancer and
      autoimmune diseases. Candida can also form tough layers of
      biofilm. This same study shows that boric acid/borax inhibits the
      formation of biofilms and also the transformation of harmless
      yeast cells into invasive hyphal form. In other articles I have
      shown that this process, commonly initiated by antibiotics, is a
      basic cause of most of our modern diseases, and this makes borax
      and boric acid primary health remedies. But this article shows
      that there are many more reasons to give them a top rating.<br>
      <br>
      A scientific review in 2011 concluded: "... boric acid is a safe,
      alternative, economic option for women with recurrent and chronic
      symptoms of vaginitis when conventional treatment fails..." (12).
      But as it is so much better than drugs why not use it as a first
      option, or use the even more effective borax?<br>
      <br>
      Another study from Turkey (13) shows the protective effect of
      boric acid on food contaminated with mycotoxins, especially fungal
      aflatoxins. Among these, Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) causes extensive DNA
      damage and is the most potent carcinogen ever tested, especially
      affecting liver and lungs, also causing birth defects,
      immunotoxicity and even death in farm animals and humans. Boric
      acid treatment was protective and led to increased resistance of
      DNA to oxidative damage induced by AFB1. The strong antifungal
      action of boric acid is, of course, the reason why it has
      traditionally been used as a food preservative.<br>
      <br>
      Borax, similar to the equally endangered Lugol's iodine solution,
      can also be used to remove accumulated fluoride and heavy metals
      from the body (14). Fluoride not only causes bones to deteriorate,
      but also the pineal gland to calcify and the thyroid to become
      underactive. Borax reacts with fluoride ions to form boron
      fluorides which are then excreted in the urine.<br>
      <br>
      In a Chinese study borax was used to treat 31 patients with
      skeletal fluorosis. The amount was gradually increased from 300 to
      1100 mg/day during a three month period, with one week off each
      month. The treatment was effective with 50 to 80% improvement.<br>
      <br>
      One forum contributor suffered with Fibromyalgia/Rosacea, chronic
      fatigue and TMJ for over 10 years which she believed were caused
      by fluoride. She used 1/8 tsp of borax and 1/8 tsp of sea salt in
      a litre of de-chlorinated water, and drank this for 5 days each
      week. Within two weeks her face cleared, the redness faded, body
      temperature normalized, energy level increased, and she steadily
      lost excess weight. The only side-effect was an initial
      aggravation of her Rosacea symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Another post: "7 years ago thyroid cancer, the next year adrenal
      fatigue, then early menopause, the following year uterine prolapse
      followed by hysterectomy - the following year fibromyalgia and
      neuropathy. Early Childhood was fluorinated water along with
      fluoride tablets. Fall of 2008 I was looking at total disability.
      I could barely walk and couldn't sleep because of the pain and was
      throwing up daily from the pain in my back. ... After reading
      about fluoride I came to understand where all of my problems
      originated. ... I began the borax detox of 1/8 tsp in a litre of
      water and within 3 days my symptoms were almost gone." &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calcium-Magnesium Metabolism</span><br>
      <br>
      There is antagonism as well as cooperation between calcium and
      magnesium. About half of the total body magnesium is found in
      bones and the other half inside the cells of tissues and organs.
      Only 1% is in the blood, and the kidneys try to keep this levels
      constant by excreting more or less with the urine.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, 99% of calcium is in bones, and the rest in the fluid
      outside of cells. Muscles contract when calcium moves into the
      cells, and they relax when calcium is again pumped out and
      magnesium moves in. This cellular pump requires much energy to
      pump calcium out, and if cells are low in energy, then calcium may
      accumulate inside cells. Low cellular energy may be due to
      Candida, faulty sugar or fat metabolism, deficiencies, or
      accumulating metabolic wastes and toxins.<br>
      <br>
      This then leads to only partial relaxation of the muscles with
      stiffness, a tendency to cramps, and poor blood and lymph
      circulation. The problem gets worse the more calcium moves from
      bones into soft tissue. Nerve cells can also accumulate calcium,
      leading to faulty nerve transmission, in the lens it causes
      cataracts, hormonal output keeps reducing as endocrine glands
      increasingly calcify, and all other cells become handicapped in
      their normal functions. In addition it causes intracellular
      magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is needed to activate countless
      enzymes, and a deficiency leads to inefficient and blocked energy
      production.<br>
      <br>
      A further problem is that excess calcium damages the cell membrane
      and makes it difficult for nutrients to move in and wastes to move
      out. When the intracellular calcium level gets too high the cell
      will die.<br>
      <br>
      Here we can see the importance of boron as a regulator of cell
      membrane functions, especially in regard to movements of calcium
      and magnesium. With boron deficiency too much calcium moves into
      the cell while magnesium cannot move inside to displace it. This
      is the condition of old age and of the boron-deficiency diseases
      leading up to it.<br>
      <br>
      While in good health and especially in younger years a calcium -
      magnesium ratio of 2 : 1 is normal and beneficial and supplied
      with a good diet. But with increasing age, boron deficiency and
      resulting disease conditions we need progressively less calcium
      and more magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      For boron to be fully effective in reversing tissue calcification
      ample magnesium is required. For elderly individuals I recommend
      400 to 600 mg of magnesium together with the daily borax
      supplementation spaced out during the day, and with protracted
      joint problems additional trans-dermal magnesium. However, oral
      magnesium may need to be adjusted according to its laxative
      effect. I am doubtful whether calcium supplements are needed and
      beneficial, even in case of osteoporosis. In my view these
      individuals have plenty of calcium stored in soft tissues where it
      does not belong, and supplementing boron and magnesium is expected
      to redeposit this misplaced calcium into bones. I regard the
      medical focus on a high calcium intake as a prescription for
      accelerated aging.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What and How Much to Use</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In some countries (e.g. Australia, NZ, USA) borax can still be
      found in the laundry and cleaning sections of supermarkets. There
      is no "food-grade" borax available or necessary. The label usually
      states that it is 99% pure which is safe to use, and is the legal
      standard for agricultural grade borax. Up to 1% mining and
      refining residues are permitted. Boric acid, if available, may be
      used at about ? the dose of borax.<br>
      <br>
      Firstly dissolve a lightly rounded teaspoonful (5-6 grams) of
      borax in 1 litre of good quality water free of chlorine and
      fluoride.&nbsp; This is your concentrated solution.&nbsp; Keep the
      bottle out of reach of small children.<br>
      <br>
      Standard dose = 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of concentrate. This has 25 to
      30 mg of borax and provides about 3 mg of boron.&nbsp; Take 1 dose
      per day mixed with drink or food.&nbsp; If that feels right then
      take a second dose with another meal.&nbsp; If there is no
      specific health problem or as a maintenance dose you may continue
      indefinitely with 1 or 2 doses daily.<br>
      <br>
      If you do have a problem, such as arthritis, osteoporosis and
      related conditions, menopause, stiffness due to advancing years,
      and also to improve low sex hormone production, increase intake to
      3 or more spaced-out standard doses for several months or longer
      until you feel that your problem has sufficiently improved. Then
      drop back to 1 or 2 doses per day.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to try the higher doses recommended by Earth Clinic
      for treating Candida and removing fluoride from the body -&nbsp;
      using your bottle of concentrated solution:<br>
      <br>
      Lower dose&nbsp; for low to normal weight - 100 ml (= 1/8 teaspoon
      of borax powder); drink spaced out during the day.<br>
      <br>
      Higher dose for heavier individuals - 200 ml (= 1/4 teaspoon of
      borax powder); drink spaced out during the day.<br>
      <br>
      Always start with a standard dose and increase gradually to the
      intended maximum. Take the maximum amounts for 4 or 5 days a week
      as long as required.<br>
      <br>
      Borax is rather alkaline and in higher concentrations has a soapy
      taste. You may disguise this with lemon juice, vinegar or ascorbic
      acid. Keep the bottle with the concentrated solution out of reach
      of small children.<br>
      <br>
      Borax and boric acid have been classified as reproductive poisons
      in Europe, and since December 2010 are no longer available to the
      public within the EU. Presently borax is still available in
      Switzerland (15), but shipment to Germany is not permitted. In
      Germany a small amount (20 - 50 grams) may be ordered through a
      pharmacy as ant poison, it will be registered.<br>
      <br>
      Boron tablets can be bought from health shops or the Internet,
      commonly with 3 mg of boron. These contain tightly bound boron not
      present in ionic form as with borax or boric acid. While suitable
      as a general boron supplement, I do not expect them to work
      against Candida and mycoplasmas, or as a quick arthritis,
      osteoporosis or menopause cure. Most scientific studies and
      individual experiences were with borax or boric acid. To improve
      effectiveness I recommend 3 or more spaced-out boron tablets daily
      for an extended period combined with sufficient magnesium and a
      suitable antimicrobial program (16).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Side-Effects</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      While side-effects from pharmaceutical drugs tend to be negative
      and often dangerous, with natural medicine such as borax therapy
      these are usually healing reactions with beneficial long-term
      effects. Most common is the Herxheimer reaction from eliminating
      Candida.<br>
      <br>
      In some of the above forum posts rapid improvement was experienced
      within days. This is always a functional response. High cellular
      calcium levels cause muscle contraction with cramps or spasms as a
      common cause of pain. Boron, especially together with magnesium,
      can rapidly relax these muscles and take away the pain.<br>
      <br>
      However, with long-standing severe calcifications a large amount
      of calcium cannot be redistributed in a short time. This leads to
      increased calcium levels in the affected area, especially the hips
      and shoulders, and can cause problems for a considerable time,
      such as a tendency to severe cramping and pain, or problems with
      the blood circulation, or nerve transmission. Nerve-related
      effects in hands and feet may be numbness, or reduced sensitivity
      or feeling in the skin. Higher amounts of calcium and fluoride
      passing through the kidneys may cause temporary kidney pain. Such
      healing reactions cannot be avoided when aiming for a higher level
      of health.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever you experience an unpleasant effect reduce or temporarily
      stop borax intake until the problem subsides. Then gradually start
      increasing again. Helpful additional measures are a greatly
      increased fluid intake, using more organic acids such as lemon
      juice, ascorbic acid or vinegar, and improving lymph flow as with
      rebounding, walking or inverted positions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Toxicity Issues</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Government health agencies are concerned about boron toxicity. You
      might be concerned as well if you read the following, pertaining
      to sodium chloride or table salt (17): 'Acute oral toxicity (LD50
      - the dose at which half of the tested animals die): 3,000 mg/kg
      [Rat]. Chronic Effects on Humans: Mutagenic for mammalian somatic
      cells. Slightly hazardous in case of skin contact, ingestion or
      inhalation. Lowest Published Lethal Oral Dose in Man: 1000 mg/kg.
      Causes adverse reproductive effects in humans (fetotoxicity,
      abortion) by intraplacental route, may increase risk of Toxemia of
      Pregnancy in susceptible women. May cause adverse reproductive
      effects and birth defects in animals, particularly rats and mice -
      fetotoxicity, abortion, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and
      maternal effects (on ovaries, fallopian tubes). May affect genetic
      material (mutagenic). Ingestion of large quantities can irritate
      the stomach with nausea and vomiting. May affect behavior (muscle
      spasicity/contraction, somnolence), sense organs, metabolism, and
      cardiovascular system. Continued exposure may produce dehydration,
      internal organ congestion, and coma.'<br>
      <br>
      Now compare the sodium chloride toxicity with the Material Safety
      Data Sheet or MSDS for borax (18): 'Low acute oral toxicity; LD50
      in rats 4,500 to 6,000 mg/kg of body weight.
      Reproductive/developmental toxicity: Animal feeding studies in
      rat, mouse and dog, at high doses, have demonstrated effects on
      fertility and testes. Studies with boric acid in the rat, mouse
      and rabbit, at high doses, demonstrate developmental effects on
      the fetus, including fetal weight loss and minor skeletal
      variations. The doses administered were many times in excess of
      those to which humans would normally be exposed. No evidence of
      carcinogenicity in mice. No mutagenic activity was observed in a
      battery of short-term mutagenicity assays. Human epidemiological
      studies show no increase in pulmonary disease in occupational
      populations with chronic exposures to borate dust and no effect on
      fertility.'<br>
      <br>
      Here you see that table salt is 50 to 100% more toxic than borax,
      it changes the genetic material and is mutagenic, while borax is
      harmless in this regard. Infants are most at risk from high borax
      ingestion. It has been estimated that 5 to 10 grams can cause
      severe vomiting, diarrhoea, shock and even death, but it also says
      that lethal doses are not well documented in the literature.<br>
      <br>
      The following toxicity data are from documents of the US
      Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease
      Control(19, 20).<br>
      <br>
      A review of 784 accidental human poisonings from 10 - 88 grams of
      boric acid reported no fatalities, with 88% of cases being
      asymptomatic, meaning they did not notice anything. However,
      gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and central
      nervous system effects, dermatitis, erythema, and death have been
      observed in some children and adults exposed to more than 84 mg
      boron/kg, corresponding to more than 40 grams of borax for 60 kg
      of body weight.<br>
      <br>
      Animal studies have identified reproductive toxicity as the most
      sensitive effects of boron ingestion. Exposure of rats, mice, and
      dogs for several weeks showed some damage to the testes and sperm
      at doses of more than 26 mg boron/kg which corresponds to 15 grams
      of borax/day for 60 kg body weight.<br>
      <br>
      Most at risk is the developing foetus, and in the studied animals
      rats were most affected. In one study slight reductions in the
      foetal body weight were already found at 13.7 mg boron/kg/day used
      during pregnancy. The no effect dose was set at less than 13.7
      mg/kg/day corresponding to about 7 grams of borax per day for 60
      kg body weight. With an added safety factor a no effect value of
      9.6 mg boron/kg/day was calculated corresponding to 5 grams of
      borax for 60 kg.<br>
      <br>
      However, a rat study lasting for 3 generations found no
      reproductive toxicity or effect on the parents or offspring at 30
      mg boron/kg/day. This dose corresponds to 17 grams of borax for 60
      kg ingested for 3 generations! In another 3-generation study no
      problem was found at 17.5 mg boron/kg/day, corresponding to 9
      grams of borax/60 kg, while the next higher tested dose of 58.5
      mg/kg/day, corresponding to 30 grams of borax/60 kg, resulted in
      infertility. Therefore we can assume that the safe reproductive
      dose is up to about 20 grams/60 kg/day.<br>
      <br>
      Human studies of the possible association between impaired
      fertility and high boron levels in water, soil and dust in a
      Turkish populations, and boron mining and processing workers,
      found no effect. One study even reported elevated fertility rates
      in borax production workers as compared to the U.S. national
      average.<br>
      <br>
      All this is important because possible reproductive toxicity is
      the official reason for the present assault on borax. The sodium
      chloride MSDS mentioned above also states: "While sodium chloride
      has been used as a negative control in some reproductive studies,
      it has also been used as an example that almost any chemical can
      cause birth defects in experimental animals if studied under the
      right conditions." Keep this in mind when you read the following.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Assault on Borax</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Arthritis in its various forms and its close relative osteoporosis
      affect about 30% of the population in developed countries.
      Osteoporosis is responsible for more long term hospital care than
      any other individual disease. This is due to the very high
      incidence of fractures, and especially the protracted nature of
      hip fractures. This is a main source of income for the
      medical-pharmaceutical system. If the boron-magnesium cure for
      these diseases should become widely known, this vital income
      stream would dry up and the system collapse. As this is the
      biggest and most profitable industry in the world, this&nbsp;
      cannot be allowed to happen.<br>
      <br>
      When Dr Newnham discovered the boron-arthritis cure it was not a
      big problem for the pharmaceuticals because news travelled slowly
      and was easily suppressed. This is very different now with
      Internet communication. Most research funding comes from the
      pharmaceutical industry, and nothing has come forward to duplicate
      Dr Newnham's findings and other positive osteoporosis studies.
      Instead, funding goes into the development of patentable boron
      drugs for limited application as in chemotherapy, or even to
      discredit boron. A test-tube experiment found that a relatively
      low dose of about 4 grams of borax can damage lymphocytes, just
      like an earlier test-tube study showed that vitamin C supplements
      are toxic. Most positive borax studies now come from China, Japan
      and Turkey.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, PubMed is a publicly funded search facility for
      bio-medical research publications. While other articles for
      Newnham R.E. and Zhou L.Y. are still listed, the two important
      borax publications mentioned earlier - about the arthritis trial
      at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the treatment of skeletal
      fluorosis in China - are no longer listed, but they belong there
      and obviously had been there originally. I suspect that they have
      been deliberately removed to prevent them from being quoted in
      other research.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, increasing effort goes into publicly demonizing borax
      for its alleged reproductive and infant toxicity. As an example I
      recently read an article by a 'senior scientist' of the supposedly
      'green' Environmental Working Group. In it the perceived dangers
      of borax were so exaggerated that most comments in effect said:
      "Thank you for opening my eyes. I did not know how poisonous and
      dangerous borax is, I certainly will not use it anymore in my
      laundry, or for cleaning my toilet and kitchen" .<br>
      <br>
      This is obviously a deliberate campaign to make people grateful
      for banning borax from public sale. For laundry and cleaning
      purposes Borax Substitute now replaces the product previously sold
      as Borax. The EU has spearheaded this campaign. In June 2010 borax
      and boric acid were reclassified as “Reprotoxic Category 2“,
      suggesting that they may be harmful to the reproductive functions
      of humans in high doses, and the product package must display the
      skull and crossbones symbol. From December 2010 these products
      were no longer available for public sale within the EU. While this
      classification now applies for all of Europe, non-EU countries
      still have some leeway in regard to public sales. This initiative
      is part of a Globally Harmonized System of Classification and
      Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) which is to be implemented as soon as
      possible. Australia is well-advanced on preparing regulations to
      implement the GHS for industrial chemicals, with new regulations
      expected in 2012 (21).<br>
      <br>
      The European Chemicals Agency gave as reason for their
      reclassification of boron products (paraphrased):<br>
      <br>
      'The available data do not indicate major differences between
      laboratory animals and humans, therefore it must be assumed that
      the effects seen in animals could occur in humans as
      epidemiological studies in humans are insufficient to demonstrate
      the absence of an adverse effect of inorganic borates on
      fertility. 17.5 mg boron/kg/day was derived as a NOAEL (no event
      level) for male and female fertility. For the rat decreased foetal
      weight occurred at 13.7 mg boron/kg/day, and a safe limit of 9.6
      mg/kg/day has been derived.' (22)<br>
      <br>
      What they are really saying is this: 'While we have no human data,
      animal studies suggest that for adult reproductive functions a
      daily ingestion of about 2 teaspoons of borax is safe. But to be
      absolutely sure that no-one is harmed, we will ban it totally.'
      Importantly, this ruling is not related to borax in foods or
      supplements where it is already banned, but only for general use
      as in laundry or cleaning products or as insecticides. Because
      borax is not readily inhaled or absorbed through intact skin, it
      is difficult to see how even a few milligrams daily could get into
      the body with the conventional use. If the same standard would
      apply to other chemicals there would be none left.<br>
      <br>
      The key study in this assessment was published in 1972. Why is
      this being dug up now to justify banning borax when it was of no
      concern for the past 40 years? It does not make any scientific
      sense, especially if you consider that the main chemical in the
      new borax substitute, sodium percarbonate, is about three times
      more toxic than borax. Acute oral LD50 values for animals are from
      1034 to 2200 mg/kg/day (23). Even the commonly used sodium
      bicarbonate, with an animal LD50 of 3360 mg/kg, is nearly twice as
      toxic as borax (24). Both of these chemicals have not been tested
      for long-term reproductive toxicity at the high doses that caused
      fertility problems in rats and mice.<br>
      <br>
      The same applies to washing powders, it has been stated that no
      toxicity is expected if used in the approved way, or that
      reproductive tests have not been done. Ingredients in these
      products are more toxic than borax, why can they be used in the
      approved way but not borax? And how about really toxic items such
      as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid? Why do they remain
      available to the public when one of the safest household chemicals
      is banned despite the fact that it is absolutely impossible to
      cause any reproductive harm with the approved use?<br>
      Regardless of the lack of any scientific credibility, the stage
      has been set for borax and boric acid to be globally removed from
      public sale at short or no notice. Even low-level and less
      effective boron tablets are now tightly controlled by the
      pharmaceutical industry, and may be restricted at any time through
      Codex Alimentarius regulations. With this the
      medical-pharmaceutical system has safely defused any potential
      danger that borax may have posed to its profitability and
      survival.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A composition for the treatment of arthritis The present invention
      relates to compositions for alleviating the discomforts of
      arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the onset of arthritis is, at least in part,
      due to a mineral difficiency in boron and, to a lesser extent, in
      magnesium. Close analysis of the food intake of
      arthritis-sufferers suggests this to be the case, and treatment
      with a mixture of boron- and magnesium-containing compounds
      supports this finding. Such findings are described in my
      Australian Patent Specification No. 514,16 1.<br>
      <br>
      This patent specification describes a composition comprising an
      inorganic boroncontaining compound in combination with an
      inorganic magnesium-containing compound, useful for treating
      arthritic conditions when orally administered.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention seeks to provide an improved composition.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, there is provided a
      composition for the treatment of arthritis comprising: from 2 to
      500 parts by weight of at least one boron- containing compound;
      Guaiacum in an amount up to an equivalent of 150 parts by weight
      of the dried herb; Berberis in an amount up to an equivalent of
      150 parts by weight of the dried herb; Harpagophytum recumbens in
      an amount up to an 90 equivalent of 150 parts by weight of the
      dried herb; and an effective amount of Rhustox or Bryonia, or
      mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the balance of the composition consists of excipients
      and/or fillers.<br>
      <br>
      Excipients are a combination of one or more ingredients used to
      bind the composition together, to enable rapid dissolution of the
      ingredients when 95 ingested, and to lubricate the composition
      during the step of moulding the composition into a tablet or the
      like. The preferred ingredients are gum arabic (acting as a
      binder), starch (to enable rapid disintegration of the tablet
      after ingestion), and 100 45 magnesium stearate (acting as a mould
      lubricant). The fillers which may be present may be functional,
      such as a magnesium compound, for example megnesium phosphate,
      magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate and the like or inert, 105
      such as lactose, calcium carbonate or the like.<br>
      <br>
      Mixtures of Rhustox and Bryonia are preferred, instead of only one
      of these substances, and they are present in small but effective
      amounts, preferably less than about 1 ppm each, based on the total
      weight of the composition as measured 110 in milligram quantities.<br>
      <br>
      Conveniently, the amount of excipient present ranges from 40 to
      100 parts by weight, most preferably 55 to 65 parts by weight, and
      the amount of filler employed is an amount sufficient 115 to
      provide a tablet of desired weight.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical composition is normally provided in a dry form.
      The Guaiacum, Berberis and Harpagophytum recumbens may each be GB
      2 103 088 A1 provided as a fluid extract, the fluid carrier for
      the extract being evaporated from the solids to leave an
      equivalent amount of functional ingredient of the dried hert).
      Moist herbs may also be used but this adds to the cost of
      providing a dry composition.<br>
      <br>
      Rhustox is a homeopathic substance which has been found to be
      effective for the relief of those arthritic attacks which occur
      after periods of rest. Bryonia is a homeopathic substance which
      has been found to be effective in relief of those arthritic
      attacks which occur after periods of activity. Both are added to
      the dry ingredients of the composition as a 6x solution and the
      solvent is evaporated, leaving the effective ingredients in a
      concentration up to about 1 ppm based on the total weight of the
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      The following is an example of a presently preferred composition
      for tablets weighing about 500 mg:<br>
      <br>
      Sodium tetraborate Guaiacum Berberis Harpagophytum recumbens
      Excipient Filler Rhustox Bryonia 24 mg mg mg mg mg Balance to make
      500 mg &lt;1 ppm &lt;'I ppm The solids are impregnated with a 6X
      solution of Rhustox and a 6X solution of Bryonia, evaporated and
      dried. The composition, normally in tablet form, is administered
      orally, typically to provide a dosage of from 50 to 100 mg of the
      boron-containing compound. Daily dosages may range from as little
      as 25 mg to 3,000 mg of the boron-containing compound, preferably
      in the range of from 50 to 100 mg.<br>
      <br>
      When administered to animals, sheep and goats would normally
      receive the same dosage as humans. Cattle, on the other hand,
      would receive dosages of 25 mg of the boron-containing compound
      per 60 kg of body weight. With cattle, the solids are nornally
      mixed with a chaff or other feed.<br>
