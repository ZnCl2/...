              Into Fire</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla.</i><b> -- </b>A Florida man may have
        accidentally invented a machine that could solve the gasoline
        and energy crisis plaguing the U.S., WPBF News 25 reported. </p>
      <p>Sanibel Island resident John Kanzius is a former broadcast
        executive from Pennsylvania who wondered if his background in
        physics and radio could come in handy in treating the disease
        from which he suffers: cancer. </p>
      <p>Kanzius, 63, invented a machine that emits radio waves in an
        attempt to kill cancerous cells while leaving normal cells
        intact. While testing his machine, he noticed that his invention
        had other unexpected abilities. </p>
      <p>Filling a test tube with salt water from a canal in his back
        yard, Kanzius placed the tube and a paper towel in the machine
        and turned it on. Suddenly, the paper towel ignited, lighting up
        the tube like it was a wax candle. </p>
      <p>"Pretty neat, huh?" Kanzius asked WPBF's Jon Shainman. </p>
      <p>Kanzius performed the experiment without the paper towel and
        got the same result -- the saltwater was actually burning. </p>
      <p>The former broadcasting executive said he showed the experiment
        to a handful of scientists across the country who claim they are
        baffled at watching salt water ignite. </p>
      <p>Kanzius said the flame created from his machine reaches a
        temperature of around 3,000 degrees Farenheit. He said a chemist
        told him that the immense heat created from the machine breaks
        down the hydrogen-oxygen bond in the water, igniting the
        hydrogen. </p>
      <p>"You could take plain salt water out of the sea, put it in
        containers and produce a violent flame that could heat
        generators that make electricity, or provide other forms of
        energy," Kanzius said. <br>
        He said engineers are currently experimenting with him in Erie,
        Pa. in an attempt to harness the energy. They've built an engine
        that, when placed on top of the flame, chugged along for two
        minutes, Kanzius told WPBF. </p>
      <p>Kanzius admits all the excitement surrounding a new possible
        energy source was a stroke of luck. Someone who witnessed his
        work on the cancer front asked him if perhaps the machine could
        be used for desalinization. </p>
      <p>"This was an experiment to see if I could heat salt water, and
        instead of heat, I got fire," Kanzius said. </p>
      <p>Kanzius said he hoped that his invention could one day solve a
        lot of the world's energy problems. </p>
      <p>"If I were to be bold enough, I think one day you could power
        an automobile with this, eventually," Kanzius told WPBF. </p>

      </center>
      <div class="posted">&nbsp; <br>
        <i>SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. --</i><b> </b>A Florida man with no
        medical training has invented a machine that he believes may
        lead to a cure for cancer. <br>
        John Kanzius, who turns 63 on March 1, is a former broadcast
        executive from Pennsylvania who wondered if his background in
        physics and radio could come in handy in treating the disease
        from which he suffers himself.
        <p>Inside his Sanibel Island garage, Kanzius invented a machine
          he believes sits on the brink of a major medical breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>The machine began to take shape four years ago, when his
          dreams of retirement were put on hold after he was diagnosed
          with a rare form of leukemia. </p>
        <p>Kanzius' invention is not flashy, and it looks like a piece
          of 20th-century hardware. It doesn't even have a name. </p>
        <p>"It's a kick-ass cancer cell generator," Kanzius called it. </p>
        <p>After 24 rounds of chemotherapy, the former broadcaster
          decided that he did not want to see others suffer trying to
          cure the disease. </p>
        <p>Kanzius said it was watching kids being treated that affected
          him the most. </p>
        <p>"Particularly, young children walk in with smiles, and then
          you'd see them three weeks later and their smiles had
          disappeared. I said to myself, 'We're in a barbaric type of
          medicine,'" Kanzius told WPBF. </p>
        <p>He began tinkering with pie plates and hot dogs, trying to
          use his broadcasting background to kill the cancerous cells. </p>
        <p>Kanzius said his machine basically makes cells act like
          antennae to pick up a signal and self-destruct. </p>
        <p>Unlike current cancer treatment, Kanzius' machine does not
          use radiation, and unlike today's radio-frequency treatments,
          it's noninvasive. </p>
        <p>Now, some of the nation's most prominent doctors and
          scientists are using Kanzius' machines in their research. In
          January, researchers said they performed a breakthrough at the
          M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. </p>
        <p>"The complete killing of pancreatic cells in laboratory
          conditions is encouraging," Dr. Steve Curley said. </p>
        <p>Curley is currently testing whether cancerous tumors can be
          wiped out in animals. </p>
        <p>"We've got a lot more work to do, but this is very
          interesting preliminary work," Curley told WPBF. </p>
        <p>Kanzius explained that his machine uses a solution filled
          with nanoparticles, which measure no more than one-billionth
          of a meter. A test subject would be injected with either gold
          or carbon nanoparticles, which would make their way through
          the body and attach to the cancerous cells. The test subject
          would then enter the machine and receive a dose of radio
          frequency waves, theoretically heating and killing the
          cancerous cells in moments and leaving nearby cells untouched.
        </p>
        <p>"That is the holy grail -- when they attach, and research has
          shown that they're able to kill them once they attach to the
          cancer cells," Kanzius said. </p>
        <p>Kanzius said he hopes to begin human testing with his machine
          within the next two years. </p>
        <p>"The results look too phenomenal for anyone to stop at this
          point in time. I don't think the largest research center in
          the world would put time and effort and their name on a
          project if they did not think it would work," Kanzius told
          WPBF. </p>
        <p>Kanzius told WPBF he does not want to try and build up false
          hope, but he mentioned that there could be some major
          announcements coming from researchers in the next coming
          months.</p>

        <p><b>John Kanzius may have found a cure for cancer and a
            renewable energy source too.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As if finding a potential cure for cancer isn't enough... John
        Kanzius and his associate Charlie Rutkowski have found a way to
        create energy by burning salt water with the same radio wave
        machine they are using to kill cancer cells. </p>
      <p>Kanzius and Rutkowski were testing their external radio-wave
        generator to see if it could desalinate salt water... and they
        ended up being able to burn it. </p>
      <p>"On our way to try to do desalinization we came up with
        something that burns and it looks like salt water could be used
        as a fuel to replace the carbon footsteps that we've been using
        all these years i.e. fossil fuels." said Kanzius </p>
      <p>The radio waves excite the salt water causing it to burn and
        creating the perfect energy source. </p>
      <p>"Using salt water or as you saw we used man made salt water
        just took tap water and added salt water to it and got it to
        burn so if you have water and salt two of the biggest resources
        on this whole planet i mean unbelievable." said Rutkowski. </p>
      <p>The potential uses are limitless... fuel for cars, creating
        electricity, heating homes... and all with a resource that is
        unlimited and renewable. </p>
      <p>Kanzius plans to continue his research and hopes that one day
        his invention will cure cancer and create energy from salt water
        efficiently. </p>
      <p>"If it helps humanity and it helps people out and it helps the
        city and the county out and more jobs for this city then I feel
        like done part." said Kanzius. </p>
      <p>Now the question is... what will Kanzius do next? </p>

      </center>
      <p>He's already on the path to finding a treatment for cancer, now
        Erie inventor John Kanzius may have discovered a way to produce
        alternative fuels. Thursday afternoon, Kanzius showed how he was
        able to convert salt water into fuel. </p>
      <p>The External RF Generator was invented to find a treatment for
        cancer.&nbsp; Now, after experimenting with the
        desalinization&nbsp; process, John Kanzius has potentially found
        an alternative fuel... salt water. You may have to see it, to
        believe it. </p>
      <p>First, Kanzius showed how plain tap water wouldn't create a
        flame. Then, Morton salt was added... heated up... and ignition.
        Kanzius can add salt to tap water or use salt water from the
        Gulf of Mexico or any other body of water. They've proved it can
        even work like a spark plug creating heat in a chamber by using
        a paper towel as a wick. </p>
      <p>If this is as successful as Kanzius is predicting, salt water
        could someday be used as a low-cost alternative fuel. </p>
      <p>Kanzius says he feels the same way about this latest discovery
        as he does about his theory for curing cancer.&nbsp; As long as
        he's helping the Erie community and humanity, then he's doing
        his part. </p>

      <p>Retired TV station owner and broadcast engineer, John Kanzius,
        wasn't looking for an answer to the energy crisis. </p>
      <p>He was looking for a cure for cancer. </p>
      <p>Four years ago, inspiration struck in the middle of the night.
        Kanzius decided to try using radio waves to kill the cancer
        cells. </p>
      <p>His wife Marianne heard the noise and found her husband
        inventing a radio frequency generator with her pie pans. </p>
      <p>"I got up immediately, and thought he had lost it." </p>
      <p>Here are the basics of John's idea: </p>
      <p>Radio-waves will heat certain metals. Tiny bits of certain
        metal are injected into a cancer patient. </p>
      <p>Those nano-particals are attracted to the abnormalities of the
        cancer cells and ignore the healthy cells. </p>
      <p>The patient is then exposed to radio waves and only the bad
        cells heat up and die. </p>
      <p>But John also came across yet another extrordinary
        breakthrough. </p>
      <p>His machine could actually make saltwater burn. </p>
      <p>John Kanzius discovered that his radio frequency generator
        could release the oxygen and hydrogen from saltwater and create
        an incredibly intense flame. </p>
      <p>"Just like that. If that was in a car cylinder you could see
        the amount of fire that would be in the cylinder." </p>
      <p>The APV Company Laboratory in Akron has checked out John's
        amazing invention. They were amazed. </p>
      <p>"That could be a steam engine, a steam turbine. That could be a
        car engine if you wanted it to be." </p>
      <p>Imagine the possibilities. Saltwater as the ultimate clean
        fuel. </p>
      <p>A happy byproduct of one man searching for the cure for cancer.

        <p>By GEORGE MILLER <br>

      </center>
      <p>A materials scientist is heated up over the effect of John
        Kanzius' external radio-wave generator on salt water. </p>
      <p>"It is scientifically a staggeringly important discovery", said
        Rustum Roy, a leading authority on microwave applications on
        materials technology. </p>
      <p>Roy was in Erie on Thursday to view experiments with the
        radio-wave generator at Industrial Sales and Manufacturing Inc.,
        the Millcreek company that builds Kanzius' generator. In the
        experiments, a test tube of salt water creates a flame when
        bombarded by the generator. </p>
      <p>"It will certainly shape a lot of science", said Roy, who
        founded the Materials Science Laboratory at Pennsylvania State
        University. "It will tell us a lot more about the structure of
        water than anything in 100 years. It's a big, big contribution
        to the science of water". </p>
      <p>Roy, a Penn State professor emeritus, still teaches some
        classes there and oversees research. He has done studies on the
        structure of water. He is also a visiting professor of medicine
        at the University of Arizona and distinguished professor of
        materials at Arizona State University. He spends his winters in
        Arizona. Kanzius said Roy was the first outside expert in water
        to view the demonstration. "It was sink-or-swim time for the
        project," Kanzius said. Kanzius said he is pleased with the
        assessment, especially because there have been skeptics. "To
        hear a world authority give such a rave review is phenomenal",
        he said. "It's more than we ever expected to hear from him
        today. I expected him to hit me on the head with a sledgehammer
        and say, "Wake up". </p>
      <p>Kanzius, a Millcreek inventor and a former television and radio
        broadcaster and engineer, built the radio-wave generator in 2003
        as a way of treating cancer. The cancer research, he said, is
        going fullspeed ahead." </p>
      <p>He found the generator's effect on salt water by a fluke during
        a demonstration in the fall of 2006 and has been exploring its
        use as an alternative energy source since then. </p>
      <p>Roy said the Kanzius' discovery has scientific value in itself
        and also has the potential to create an alternative energy
        source and perhaps even to benefit medicine beyond cancer. </p>
      <p>"Where its applications lead is hard to tell", said Roy.
        "Science is not hard to tell. It's going to be a whole new

      <p>Roy said he isn't sure whether the generator's use would result
        in a net gain in energy since the generator itself is powered by
        energy. </p>
      <p>"It is certainly a new route for active research", he said. </p>

      <p><i>"I want to see the treatment work," says John Kanzius, whose
          cancer has recurred. He knows the process he developed may not
          be ready in time to save his life, but the project was never
          about him. John Kanzius, sorely weakened by leukemia
          treatments, drew on his lifetime of working with radio waves
          to devise a machine that targets cancer cells. The miracle: It
          works.</i> </p>
      <p>ERIE, PA. -- When doctors told John Kanzius he had nine months
        to live, he quietly thanked God for his blessings and prepared
        to die. </p>
      <p>Then 58, he had lived a good life, with a loving wife, two
        successful adult daughters and a gratifying career. </p>
      <p>Now he had leukemia and was ready to accept his fate, but the
        visits to the cancer ward shook him. Faces haunted him, the bald
        and bandaged heads, bodies slumped in wheelchairs, and children
        who could not play. </p>
      <p>Like him, they had endured chemotherapy treatments that caused
        their weight to plummet, hands to shake, bodies to weaken, and
        immune systems to break down to the point that the slightest
        germ could be deadly. Kanzius knew their agony. He believed if
        cancer didn't kill him first, the treatments surely would. </p>
      <p>He thought there had to be a more humane way to treat cancer. </p>
      <p>Kanzius did not have a medical background, not even a
        bachelor's degree, but he knew radios. He had built and fixed
        them since he was a child, collecting transmitters,
        transceivers, antennas and amplifiers, earning an amateur radio
        operator license. Kanzius knew how to send radio wave signals
        around the world. If he could transmit them into cancer cells,
        he wondered, could he then direct the radio waves to destroy
        tumors, while leaving healthy cells intact? </p>
      <p>Awake in bed one night in 2003, as the clock ticked past 2,
        Kanzius pulled himself from beneath the covers, leaving his
        sleeping wife, Marianne. He staggered down a flight of stairs,
        grabbed some copper wires, boxes, antennas and Marianne's pie
        pans, and began building a machine. </p>
      <p>For months, Kanzius tinkered, using the pie pans to create an
        electronic circuit, often waking Marianne with his clanging. By
        day, he sent her out with supply lists: mineral mixtures,
        metals, wires. </p>
      <p>His early-morning experiments would lead him to one of the
        nation's top cancer researcher centers, and earn the support of
        a Nobel Prize winner. </p>
      <p>When it came to electronics, Marianne had always known her
        husband was gifted. But still she worried: Was he going mad? "My
        God, honey," she thought, "none of the doctors can fix this. How
        can you?" </p>
      <p>Kanzius' mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor, but he
        followed his father, a technician and ham radio operator who
        taught his son to love electronics and told him they would soon
        take over the world. </p>
      <p>When Kanzius was 22, after two years of trade school, he got a
        job at RCA as a technical assistant. On his first day, he fixed
        the company's color television transmitters, which had been the
        subject of lawsuits because they did not comply with Federal
        Communications Commission guidelines. He was promoted to the
        engineering department. </p>
      <p>He worked at RCA for two years. In 1966, he took a job at a
        television station as director of engineering. Kanzius became
        president and co-owner of a television and radio station company
        in 1984. He retired in 2001. </p>
      <p>In the winter of 2002 Kanzius felt soreness in his abdomen. On
        Good Friday, he went in for a CT scan. Doctors told him he had
        five to seven years to live. </p>
      <p>The drive home felt like the longest of his life. On the way,
        he called Marianne. She noted that moment in her journal: </p>
      <p>"I hadn't heard from him. Then the phone rang. 'Honey, it's
        bad. I have a tumor in my stomach. They're not certain, but they
        think it's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.' The phone went silent." </p>
      <p>He underwent chemotherapy, a few times a week for six months --
        but he stayed upbeat, and doctors told him the cancer had gone
        into remission. </p>
      <p>A year after his diagnosis, on Good Friday again, doctors gave
        him bad news: He had an aggressive type of cancer that had not
        actually gone into remission. They gave him nine months. Doctors
        said he needed a bone marrow transplant, and Kanzius traveled to
        M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a second opinion.
        During his visit, he noticed the children in the cancer ward.
        Kanzius went home thinking about them, and soon mapped out his
        idea. </p>
      <p>He knew that metal would heat when exposed to radio waves. He
        wanted to focus the waves by inserting metal particles into
        tumors. The infused cells would be placed in a radiofrequency
        field. The waves would pass through the human body, and the
        particles injected into the cancer would heat and kill the cells
        without harming anything else. </p>
      <p>He built a machine to send the waves, while undergoing his
        second round of chemotherapy. This time the treatments nearly
        killed him. He spent three or four days a week at the hospital,
        sometimes for as long as eight hours. He came home to rest, only
        to toil over his project. </p>
      <p>By Christmas 2003, Kanzius could barely walk. Around that time,
        his 83-year-old mother died from lung cancer. Kanzius was too
        weak to board a plane for her funeral. </p>
      <p>He drew pictures for Marianne, leaving them around the house.
        One showed him as a stick figure curled over a toilet as she
        took care of him. "A sign of real love," he wrote. "You are my
        reason for living." </p>
      <p>Weary and weak, he tested his machine with hot dogs, then
        liver, then steak. He injected minerals into the meat and placed
        the slabs into his machine. To his delight, the injected
        portions of meat burned. But would it work on people? </p>
      <p>Marianne marveled at his ingenuity and determination. She took
        a walk one night and noticed the brilliant colors of leaves soon
        to fall from trees. </p>
      <p>"Is it a lesson in life?" she wrote in her journal. "Do we see
        how wonderful, how beautiful, how magnificent someone is, just
        as we're about to lose them?" </p>
      <p>The worst of Kanzius' treatment was over by spring 2005, and
        the cancer this time was in remission. </p>
      <p>Reinvigorated, Kanzius knew he needed to get the word out about
        his discovery. He had lunch with a competitor from his days in
        the news industry, the managing editor of a local newspaper. He
        told him about his project, and the editor assigned a reporter
        to find out more. By summer, articles began to appear, and the
        community grew interested. </p>
      <p>Dr. David A. Geller, co-director of the University of
        Pittsburgh Medical Center's liver cancer program, read about
        Kanzius' machine and called him. </p>
      <p>Kanzius had secured a patent for his machine, and asked a
        company that made transmitters to build a model. He sent it to
        the medical center so Geller could perform tests. </p>
      <p>Kanzius shared his theory with his leukemia doctor at M.D.
        Anderson. Kanzius said he wanted to show his machine to Dr.
        Steven A. Curley, an oncologist on staff who specialized in
        radiofrequency cancer treatment. </p>
      <p>Doctors already use a treatment called radiofrequency ablation
        to kill cancer. The method involves inserting needles into
        tumors and killing them with electrodes. The invasive procedure
        is limited because it can only reach certain sites, mostly small
        tumors, and it can damage healthy cells in the surrounding area.
      </p>
      <p>Kanzius' doctor contacted Curley and told him he did not know
        whether his patient was mad, but his idea had attracted a lot of
        attention. Curley called Kanzius and asked whether he could find
        a substance that could attach to cancer cells and burn when hit
        with radio waves, sparing healthy cells. </p>
      <p>Kanzius said he might be able to use nanoparticles, which are
        so small that 75,000 to 100,000 lined up side by side equal the
        width of a strand of human hair. He thought nanoparticles could
        potentially be directed to travel through the bloodstream and
        stick only to cancer cells -- a patient would swallow a pill or
        take a shot containing them. But would they burn? </p>
      <p>Kanzius needed to get his hands on some nanoparticles. </p>
      <p>Curley knew that Nobel Prize-winning chemist Richard Smalley,
        who specialized in nanoscience, was also being treated for
        cancer at M.D. Anderson. Curley got in touch with Smalley and
        explained Kanzius' theory. </p>
      <p>Smalley did not think the nanoparticles would burn but agreed
        to give Curley two vials. </p>
      <p>In June 2005, Curley met with Kanzius and Marianne. He pulled
        the vials of nanoparticles out of his suit jacket pocket, and
        Kanzius placed them in the radio field of his machine and turned
        it on. </p>
      <p>They burned. </p>
      <p>Marianne captured that day in her journal: </p>
      <p>"John asked, 'Is this what you expected?' For the first time in
        my life, I realized that a smile starts behind the eyes before
        it starts at the mouth, for Steve responded, 'This is much more
        than I expected.' I watched his smile engulf his entire face." </p>
      <p>Marianne finally realized: "Could what John's working on be
        real?" Curley phoned Smalley to tell him the news. </p>
      <p>He remembered Smalley's response: "Holy God." </p>
      <p>Smalley asked his colleagues at Rice University to work with
        Curley's team at M.D. Anderson on the project. </p>
      <p>Shortly before he died in October 2005, Smalley made a final
        request to Curley, who would not forget his words: "Nothing has
        the potential to help people, to help patients, more than this.
        You have to promise me to keep doing this work." </p>
      <p>With the project moving along, Kanzius invited scholars,
        politicians and scientists to Erie for demonstrations. This
        spring, a Canadian health minister had a random thought, after
        noticing how quickly condensation formed on the test tube walls
        during the process: With the world's need for fresh water, he
        asked Kanzius, could his machine be used to desalinate water? </p>
      <p>A few weeks later, Kanzius tried to heat and distill water
        mixed with Morton's salt in a test tube, which he placed into
        his generator. He turned on the radio frequencies and held a
        match to the salt water. </p>
      <p>Flames erupted. </p>
      <p>The radio waves had weakened the bonds that held together the
        elements that made up the water, and ignited the hydrogen. The
        results left scientists excited by the possibility of separating
        hydrogen -- the most abundant element in the universe -- from
        salt water to use as a fuel. </p>
      <p>Rustum Roy, a Penn State University chemist and water science
        expert, called it the most remarkable discovery in water science
        in the last century. His team is working on the saltwater
        project at Penn State, using Kanzius' machine. </p>
      <p>The saltwater discovery pleased Kanzius, but the cancer project
        took precedence. </p>
      <p>Four years after he came up with his idea, researchers
        continued experiments and killed human cancer cells in petri
        dishes using nanoparticles and his machine. They recently killed
        100% of cancer cells grown in the livers of rabbits, using
        Kanzius' method. </p>
      <p>Curley said the treatment is the most promising he has ever
        seen because it has the potential to kill cancer -- without
        invasive treatment or surgery -- that doctors currently have no
        way of detecting. The next step for scientists is to perfect a
        method of binding nanoparticles with antibodies that, when
        introduced into the bloodstream, will attach only to cancer
        cells while avoiding normal cells. He said the treatment could
        work on any kind of cancer, and he estimates clinical trials are
        three to four years away. </p>
      <p>"Possible?" Curley said. "Yes. Not simple." </p>
      <p>Last year, Kanzius began raising money for his research with
        the help of his neighbors. High school students held
        fundraisers, foundations offered grants, and children sold
        lemonade. Donations soon reached more than $1 million. This May,
        Erie officials gave Kanzius a key to the city and declared an
        official John Kanzius Day. A former Erie mayor announced a goal
        of raising $3 million to fund research. </p>
      <p>But the accolades meant little if the wider medical community
        did not recognize the research. It had to be reviewed by a panel
        of medical experts and published in a scientific journal. </p>
      <p>In June, scientists submitted manuscripts based on the findings
        to journals. Three months later, Curley called Kanzius with
        news: The manuscripts, with Kanzius listed as a co-author, would
        be published in December in Cancer, an oncology medical journal.
        The results appeared online last week. </p>
      <p>Kanzius hung up and yelled the news to Marianne, who was
        watching television downstairs. She screamed. </p>
      <p>At 63, Kanzius is still receiving treatment for his cancer,
        which has recurred. He knows the process he developed may not be
        ready in time to save his life, but the project was never about
        him. "I want to see the treatment work," he said. "That would be
        my thanks." </p>
      <p>For Marianne, the journey led her to question her faith in God,
        only to have it reaffirmed. </p>
      <p>She is hopeful the invention will help future generations, but
        she lives in terror, staying up at night to make sure Kanzius is
        still breathing. She cannot imagine waking up without her
        husband beside her. </p>
      <p>"I'm selfish," she said. "If something can help him, I would
        like this to help him. </p>
      <p>"Yes, I hope." </p>

              leukemia cells</font></b> </p>

      <p><b>What It Means</b> </p>
      <p>The research showed that John Kanzius' radio-frequency device
        can kill leukemia cells in blood without damaging a high
        percentage of healthy cells. Such data was needed to determine
        if the device could possibly be used one day to treat leukemia
        patients. </p>
      <p>Hamot Medical Center is presenting 33 research projects
        Thursday and today at the hospital's Research Exposition 2009. </p>
      <p>But only one of those projects involves a device that has been
        profiled on "60 Minutes" and in major newspapers around the
        world. </p>
      <p>A group of researchers, including the late Millcreek Township
        inventor John Kanzius, showed that Kanzius' external
        radio-frequency generator can kill leukemia cells in blood while
        damaging few other, healthy cells. </p>
      <p>"This is information we needed to find," said Peter Depowski,
        M.D., Hamot's chief of pathology and one of the project's
        researchers. "It doesn't matter how well the device kills cancer
        cells if you kill all the healthy cells as well." </p>
      <p>Kanzius, who died in February after a long battle with chronic
        lymphocytic leukemia, helped put together the research project
        in 2008. It was completed in December. </p>
      <p>Blood samples were taken from 19 CLL patients at the Regional
        Cancer Center. </p>
      <p>Researchers had wanted samples from 20 patients, and dozens
        from all over the world volunteered for the project. But
        researchers had time to work with only 19 patients before
        Kanzius had to move his RF device to his winter home in Sanibel,
        Fla. </p>
      <p>All but one blood sample were treated with Kanzius' device,
        which emits radio waves. The samples were then sent for testing
        to see what cells survived. </p>
      <p>The remaining sample served as the project's control. </p>
      <p>"We learned that the radio waves damage the (cancer) cells more
        than the healthy ones," said Justine Schober, M.D., one of the
        project's researchers and Hamot's director of academic research.
        "What we don't know is the significance. Whether the damage is
        due to heating or something else." </p>
      <p>Schober; Kanzius; Depowski; and Lazarus Mayoglou, a Lake Erie
        College of Osteopathic Medicine student, sent the data to Steve
        Curley, M.D., principal investigator for the Kanzius Project at
        M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. </p>
      <p>Curley said the data gave him background on how well Kanzius'
        device would work on this particular type of cancer cell. </p>
      <p>"(It) raised the blood temperature enough to kill low
        percentages of the leukemic cells," Curley said in an e-mail.
        "We killed the same percentage of cells with a hot water bath
        treatment. So it was not the RF field but nonspecific low level
        heating." </p>
      <p>Curley and his research team at M.D. Anderson continue to test
        Kanzius' device on many different types of cancer, including
        leukemia. He said they are using gold nanoparticles -- tiny
        pieces of metal -- to target the leukemia cells, just as he does
        with liver and pancreatic cancer cells. </p>
      <p>Kanzius' device heats the nanoparticles until they destroy the
        targeted cancer cells. Nearby healthy cells, which aren't
        targeted, are not damaged. </p>
      <p>"It only works well with the nanoparticles," Curley said. </p>
      <p>Playing even a small role in the search for a cancer cure is
        rewarding, Depowski said. </p>
      <p>"Dr. Curley is leading the charge, and we're following his
        lead," Depowski said. </p>
      <p>Hamot's Research Exposition continues today at the hospital,
        201 State St. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A method of inducing hyperthermia in at
        least a portion of a target area--e.g., a tumor or a portion of
        a tumor or targeted cancerous cells--is provided. Targeted RF
        absorption enhancers, e.g., antibodies bound to RF absorbing
        particles, are introduced into a patient. These targeted RF
        absorption enhancers will target certain cells in the target
        areas and enhance the effect of a hyperthermia generating RF
        signal directed toward the target area. The targeted RF
        absorption enhancers may, in a manner of speaking, add one or
        more RF absorption frequencies to cells in the target area,
        which will permit a hyperthermia generating RF signal at that
        frequency or frequencies to heat the targeted cells. </p>

        and Methods for RF-Induced Hyperthermia Using Biological Cells
        and Nanoparticles as RF Enhancer Carriers, both of which are
        incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention relates generally to the field of
        radio frequency (RF) circuits, and more specifically to an RF
        transmitter and receiver system and method for inducing
        hyperthermia in a target area. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0003] Hyperthermia is characterized by a very high fever,
        especially when induced artificially for therapeutic purposes.
        RF electromagnetic energy is electromagnetic energy at any
        frequency in the radio spectrum from 9000 Hz to 3 THz (3000
        GHz). It is known in the art to use contact antennas to direct
        RF electromagnetic radiation to intentionally induce
        hyperthermia in human tissue for therapeutic purposes, e.g.,
        destroying diseased cells (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,899). There
        are also several other prior art RF heating devices described in
        various publications (e.g., the Thermotron RF-8 system, Yamamoto
        Viniter Co. of Osaka, Japan, and the KCTPATEPM system, Russia,
        and U.S. Pat. No. 5,099,756; Re. 32,066; and U.S. Pat. No.
        4,095,602 to LeVeen). </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0004] In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the
        present invention, a method of inducing hyperthermia in at least
        a portion of a target area--e.g., a tumor or a portion of a
        tumor or targeted cancerous cells--is provided. In this first
        exemplary method, targeted RF absorption enhancers, e.g.,
        antibodies bound to RF absorbing particles, are introduced into
        a patient. These targeted RF absorption enhancers will target
        certain cells in the target areas and enhance the effect of a
        hyperthermia generating RF signal directed toward the target
        area. The targeted RF absorption enhancers may, in a manner of
        speaking, add one or more artificial RF absorption frequencies
        to cells in the target area, which will permit a hyperthermia
        generating RF signal at that frequency or frequencies to heat
        the targeted cells. </p>
      <p>[0005] In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the
        present invention, another method of inducing hyperthermia in at
        least a portion of a target area is provided. In this second
        exemplary method RF absorption enhancers (targeted and/or
        non-targeted) are introduced into a patient and a multifrequency
        hyperthermia generating RF signal is directed toward the target
        area. The multifrequency hyperthermia generating RF signal may
        be a frequency modulated (FM) signal having parameters selected
        to correspond to a sample of particles being used as energy
        absorption enhancer particles in the RF absorption enhancers.
        For example, the center frequency of an FM hyperthermia
        generating signal may correspond to a resonant frequency of
        nominally sized particles used as energy absorption enhancer
        particles and the modulation of the FM hyperthermia generating
        signal may correspond to a size tolerance of the particles. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p>
      <p>[0024] In the accompanying drawings which are incorporated in
        and constitute a part of the specification, exemplary
        embodiments of the invention are illustrated, which, together
        with a general description of the invention given above, and the
        detailed description given below, serve to example principles of
        the invention. </p>
      <p>[0025] Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIG. 1,
        there is shown a first exemplary embodiment of a non-invasive RF
        system 100 for inducing hyperthermia in a target area 106.
        System 100 comprises an RF transmitter 102 in circuit
        communication with a transmission head 104 and an RF receiver
        110 in circuit communication with a reception head 108. "Circuit
        communication" as used herein is used to indicate a
        communicative relationship between devices. Direct electrical,
        optical, and electromagnetic connections and indirect
        electrical, optical, and electromagnetic connections are
        examples of circuit communication. Two devices are in circuit
        communication if a signal from one is received by the other,
        regardless of whether the signal is modified by some other
        device. For example, two devices separated by one or more of the
        following--transformers, optoisolators, digital or analog
        buffers, analog integrators, other electronic circuitry, fiber
        optic transceivers, or even satellites--are in circuit
        communication if a signal from one reaches the other, even
        though the signal is modified by the intermediate device(s). As
        a final example, two devices not directly connected to each
        other (e.g. keyboard and memory), but both capable of
        interfacing with a third device, (e.g., a CPU), are in circuit
        communication. </p>
      <p>[0026] In exemplary system 100, the RF transmitter 102
        generates an RF signal 120 at a frequency for transmission via
        the transmission head 104. Optionally, the RF transmitter 102
        has controls for adjusting the frequency and/or power of the
        generated RF signal and/or may have a mode in which an RF signal
        at a predetermined frequency and power are transmitted via
        transmission head 104. In addition, optionally, the RF
        transmitter 102 provides an RF signal with variable amplitudes,
        pulsed amplitudes, multiple frequencies, etc. </p>
      <p>[0027] The RF receiver 110 is in circuit communication with the
        reception head 108. The RF receiver 110 is tuned so that at
        least a portion of the reception head 108 is resonant at the
        frequency of the RF signal 120 transmitted via the transmission
        head 104. As a result, the reception head 108 receives the RF
        signal 120 that is transmitted via the transmission head 104. </p>
      <p>[0028] The transmission head 104 and reception head 108 are
        arranged proximate to and on either side of a general target
        area 106. General target 106 is general location of the area to
        be treated. The general target area 106 is any target area or
        type of cells or group of cells, such as for example, tissue,
        blood cells, bone marrow cells, etc. The transmission head 104
        and reception head 108 are preferably insulated from direct
        contact with the general target area 106. Preferably, the
        transmission head 104 and reception head 108 are insulated by
        means of an air gap 112. Optional means of insulating the
        transmission head 104 and reception head 108 from the general
        target area 106 include inserting an insulating layer or
        material 310 (FIG. 3), such as, for example, Teflon.RTM. between
        the heads 104, 108 and the general target area 106. Other
        optional means include providing an insulation area on the heads
        104, 108, allowing the heads to be put in direct contact with
        the general target area 106. The transmission head 104 and the
        reception head 108, described in more detail below, may include
        one or more plates of electrically conductive material. </p>
      <p>[0029] The general target area 106 absorbs energy and is warmed
        as the RF signal 120 travels through the general target area
        106. The more energy that is absorbed by an area, the higher the
        temperature increase in the area. Generally, the general target
        area 106 includes a specific target area 130. Specific target
        area 130 includes the tissue or higher concentration of cells,
        such as, for example, a tumor, that are desired to be treated by
        inducing hyperthermia. Preferably, the general target area is
        heated to for example, to between 106.degree. and 107.degree..
        Thus, preferably, the specific target area 130 receives higher
        concentrations of the RF signal 120 then the general target area
        106. As a result, the specific target area 130 absorbs more
        energy, resulting in a higher temperature in the specific target
        area 130 than in the surrounding general target area 106. </p>
      <p>[0030] Energy absorption in a target area can be increased by
        increasing the RF signal 120 strength, which increases the
        amount of energy traveling through the general target area 106.
        Other means of increasing the energy absorption include
        concentrating the signal on a localized area, or specific target
        area 130, and/or enhancing the energy absorption characteristics
        of the target area 130. </p>
      <p>[0031] One method of inducing a higher temperature in the
        specific target area 130 includes using a reception head that is
        smaller than the transmission head. The smaller reception head
        picks up more energy due to the use of a high-Q resonant circuit
        described in more detail below. Optionally, an RF absorption
        enhancer 132 is used. An RF absorption enhancer is any means or
        method of increasing the tendency of the specific target area
        130 to absorb more energy from the RF signal. Injecting an
        aqueous solution is a means for enhancing RF absorption. Aqueous
        solutions suitable for enhancing RF absorption include, for
        example, water, saline solution, aqueous solutions containing
        suspended particles of electrically conductive material, such as
        metals, e.g., iron, various combination of metals, e.g., iron
        and other metals, or magnetic particles. These types of RF
        enhancers (i.e., non-targeted "general RF enhancers") are
        generally directly introduced into the target area. Other
        exemplary general RF enhancers are discussed below, e.g.,
        aqueous solutions of virtually any metal sulfate (e.g., aqueous
        solutions of iron sulfate, copper sulfate, and/or magnesium
        sulfate, e.g., aqueous solutions (about 5 mg/kg of body mass),
        copper sulfate (about 2 mg/kg of body mass), and magnesium
        sulfate (about 20 mg/kg of body mass)), other solutions of
        virtually any metal sulfate, injectable metal salts (e.g., gold
        salts), and RF absorbing particles attached to other
        non-targeted carriers. Preferably, these types of RF enhancers
        may be directly injected into the target area by means of a
        needle and syringe, or otherwise introduced into the patient. </p>
      <p>[0032] Other means of enhancing RF absorption include providing
        targeted RF enhancers, such as antibodies with associated RF
        absorption enhancers, such as metal particles. The antibodies
        (and other targeting moieties, discussed below) target and bind
        to specific target cells in the target area 130. Generally,
        antibodies (and other targeting moieties) can be directed
        against any target, e.g., tumor, bacterial, fungal, viral,
        parasitic, mycoplasmal, histocompatibility, differentiation and
        other cell membrane antigens, pathogen surface antigens, toxins,
        enzymes, allergens, drugs and any biologically active molecules.
        Binding RF enhancing particles to the antibodies (and other
        carriers having at least one targeting moiety) permits the
        injection of the antibodies (and other carriers having at least
        one targeting moiety) into the patient and the targeting of
        specific cells and other specific targets. Once a high enough
        concentration of RF enhancers 132 are attached to the target
        cells, the RF signal 120 is passed through the specific target
        area 130. The RF enhancers induce the absorption of more energy,
        creating a localized temperature in the specific target area 130
        that is higher than the temperature created in the general
        target area 106. In addition, a combination of antibodies (and
        other carriers having at least one targeting moiety) bound to
        different metals (and other RF absorbing particles, discussed
        below) can be used allowing for variations in the RF absorption
        characteristics in localized areas of the target areas. These
        variations in RF absorption characteristics permit intentional
        uneven heating of the specific target area 130. </p>
      <p>[0033] Targeted RF enhancers and general RF enhancers can be
        used to improve current RF capacitive heating devices as well as
        current RF ablation devices. Antibodies bound to metals, which
        can act as RF absorption enhancers in accordance with the
        teachings of the present application, can be obtained through
        commercially available channels. </p>
      <p>[0034] Targeted RF enhancers and general RF enhancers are
        applicable for both in-vivo and in-vitro applications. In one
        in-vitro application the targeted RF enhancers and/or general RF
        enhancers are in introduced into the target area prior to the
        target area being removed from the patient. After the targeted
        RF enhancers and/or general RF enhancers bind to the target
        area, the target area is removed from the patient and treated
        with one or more RF signals. In another in-vitro application the
        target area is removed from the patient before the RF enhancers
        are introduced into the target area. Once the target area is in
        a suitable vessel, the targeted RF enhancers and/or general RF
        enhancers are introduced into the target area. The target area
        is then treated with one or more RF signals. </p>
      <p>[0035] Optionally, multiple frequency RF signals 120 are used.
        Multiple frequency RF signals can be used to treat target areas.
        Multiple frequency RF signals allow the energy absorption rate
        and absorption rate in different locations of the target area to
        be more closely controlled. The multiple frequency signals can
        be combined into one signal, or by use of a multi-plated
        transmission head, or multiple transmission heads, can be
        directed at one or more specific regions in the target area.
        This is useful for treating target areas that have specific
        regions of various shapes, thicknesses and/or depths. Similarly,
        pulsed RF signals, variable frequency RF signals and other
        combinations or variations of the RF signals can be used to more
        precisely control and target the heating of the specific target
        areas. These and other methods of increasing RF absorption can
        be used independently or in any number of combinations to
        increase the energy absorption rate of the specific target area
        130. </p>
      <p>[0036] In addition, antibodies (or other targeting moieties)
        bound with magnetic particles (i.e., magnetic targeted RF
        enhancers) can be steered to specific locations using magnets or
        magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) machines. Thus, the magnetic
        targeted RF enhancers can be directed toward specific target
        area or target cells. Furthermore, once the magnetic targeted RF
        enhancers bind to the specific target cells, the target cells
        can be separated from the other cells by use of a magnetic
        force. The magnetic force can be either an attracting force, or
        a repelling force. Magnets or MRI machines can also be used to
        steer injected (or otherwise introduced) magnetic particles to
        specific locations. The magnetic general RF enhancers discussed
        above may also be directed toward a specific target area or
        target cells using a magnetic force from, e.g., a magnet or MRI
        machine. </p>
      <p>[0037] Additionally, in accordance with the teachings above, a
        target of RF induced hyperthermia may be specific target cells
        and need not be limited to a specific region of a body. Certain
        cancers, e.g., blood cancers, do not necessarily manifest
        themselves in a localized region. As discussed above, targeted
        RF enhancers, will target specific cells and need not be
        localized. In the case of blood cancers, such as lymphoma,
        leukemia, and multiple myeloma, such targeted RF absorption
        enhancers (e.g., targeting moieties bound to RF absorbing
        particles) can be introduced into a patient and then a selected
        region of the body (or perhaps the entire body) can be
        irradiated with RF energy, with the RF absorption enhancers
        bound to the cells heating up and heating those cells more than
        cells without RF absorption enhancers bound to them. </p>
      <p>[0038] The above discussion recites several different types of
        exemplary RF absorption enhancers for enhancing the RF
        absorption of a target area (which may be a tumor or a portion
        of a tumor or target cells or some other target), such as (i)
        solutions and/or suspensions introduced into a target area to
        enhance RF heating of the target area (general RF absorption
        enhancers) and (ii) antibodies (or other targeting moieties)
        bound to RF absorbing particles that are introduced into a
        patient and that target specific target cells to enhance RF
        heating of the targeted cells (targeted RF absorption
        enhancers). As discussed above, these and other RF absorption
        enhancers may be used independently or in any number of
        combinations to increase RF absorption of a target area. The
        targeted RF absorption enhancers discussed herein can be thought
        of as effectively changing the resonant frequency of the target
        cells, i.e., adding another, artificial frequency to the target
        cells (which may be a resonant frequency of RF absorbing
        particles), because the RF absorbing particles, which are bound
        to target cells via the targeting moieties, will absorb more RF
        energy and heat more quickly than the target cells will at that
        frequency. Thus, instead of trying to determine one or more
        resonant frequencies of target cells, the targeted RF absorption
        enhancers used in accordance with the systems and methods of the
        present invention may be used to effectively add an artificial
        frequency or frequencies to the target cells at whatever
        artificial frequency or frequencies are desired to create
        hyperthermia. </p>
      <p>[0039] The targeted RF absorption enhancers discussed above
        have a portion that binds to one or more targets and an
        associated portion that absorbs RF energy relatively well, e.g.,
        a carrier having a targeting moiety and attached to an RF
        absorbing particle. The general RF absorption enhancers may also
        have an associated portion that absorbs RF energy relatively
        well e.g., a non-targeted carrier attached to an RF absorbing
        particle or RF absorbing particles in solution or suspension.
        Several examples given above of such RF absorbing particles
        listed above include particles of electrically conductive
        material, such as metals, iron, various combination of metals,
        irons and metals, or magnetic particles. Other examples are
        given below. Of course, these particles may be sized as
        so-called "nanoparticles" (microscopic particles whose size is
        measured in nanometers, e.g., 1-1000 nm) or sized as so-called
        "microparticles" (microscopic particles whose size is measured
        in micrometers, e.g., 1-1000 .mu.m). If these particles are to
        be injected (or otherwise introduced) intravenously, such
        particles are preferably small enough to be bound to and carried
        with the at least one carrier to a target cell (e.g., in the
        patient's body) or target area (e.g., in the patient's body) via
        the patient's vascular system. In accordance with other
        exemplary embodiments of the present invention, other RF
        absorption enhancers may be used, e.g., using other carriers
        other than antibodies and/or using other RF absorbing particles
        than those specifically identified above. </p>
      <p>[0040] Examples of such other carriers (both targeted and
        non-targeted) for RF absorption enhancers include any one or
        more of the following: biomolecules, biological cells,
        microparticle delivery systems, nanoparticle delivery systems,
        water-soluble polymers, other polymers, molecular or cellular
        proteomic or genomic structures, as well as other small particle
        constructs, including biological or robotic constructs, whether
        organic or from man-made materials, such as synthetic applied
        materials. Again, these carriers are attached to, or perhaps
        contain, RF absorbing particles to form RF absorption enhancers.
      </p>
      <p>[0041] Exemplary biomolecules that may be used as carriers
        (both targeted and non-targeted) for RF absorption enhancers
        include any one or more of the following: organic molecules,
        nucleotides, proteins, antibodies, other specialized proteins,
        ligands, oligonucleotides, genetic material, nucleotides, DNA,
        RNA, viruses, retroviruses, organometallic molecules, proteins
        that are rapidly taken up by fast growing cells and tumors,
        transferrin, RGD (arg-gly-asp tripeptide) peptides, and NGR
        (asn-gly-arg tripeptide) peptides, folate, trasferrin,
        galactosamine, and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony
        stimulating factor). Herein, the term "organometallic molecule"
        (or just organometallics) means a molecule in which there is at
        least one bonding interaction (ionic or covalent, localized or
        delocalized) between one or more carbon atoms of an organic
        group or molecule and a main group, transition, lanthanide, or
        actinide metal atom (or atoms), and shall include organic
        derivatives of the metalloids (boron, silicon, germanium,
        arsenic, and tellurium), organic derivatives of all other metals
        and alloys, molecular metal hydrides; metal alkoxides,
        thiolates, amides, and phosphides; metal complexes containing
        organo-group 15 and 16 ligands; metal nitrosyls and similar
        others. Thus, in addition to being bound to separate RF
        absorbing particles to form RF absorption enhancers, some
        organometallic molecules may function as RF absorption enhancers
        by themselves, having both a carrier portion and an RF absorbing
        metallic portion. These organometallic molecules may be directly
        injected (or otherwise introduced) or may be attached to
        organic, biomolecular, biopolymer, molecular or cellular
        proteomic or genomic structures, or may be placed in biologic,
        robotic, or man-made synthetic applied materials. The
        application of organometallics in nuclear medicine (i.e. for the
        labeling of receptor binding biomolecules like steroid hormones
        or brain tracers) has been proposed in the literature.
        Technetium and radiogallium, typically used for medical imaging,
        can be modified with an organometallic. These biomolecules,
        organometallic technetium and organometallic radiogallium, could
        serve the dual function of imaging a tumor and be a
        radiofrequency enhancer because of their specific heat
        properties and imaging properties. Additionally, organometallic
        technetium and/or organometallic radiogallium may be bound to
        one or more different RF absorbing particles, e.g., bound to any
        one or more of virtually any of the RF absorbing particles
        described herein, to form RF absorption enhancers. </p>
      <p>[0042] Exemplary biological cells (both targeted and
        non-targeted) that may be used as carriers for RF absorption
        enhancers include any one or more of the following: white blood
        cells, modified white cells, vaccine stimulated white cells,
        expanded white cells, T-cells, and tumor infiltrating
        lymphocytes (TILs). In general, these cells can be removed from
        a tumor or the circulating blood of a cancer patient and grown
        in tissue culture dishes or suspensions; thereafter, RF
        absorbing particles can be microinfused or absorbed into the
        cells to create RF absorption enhancers. </p>
      <p>[0043] Exemplary microparticle and nanoparticle delivery
        systems (both targeted and non-targeted) that may be used as
        carriers for RF absorption enhancers include any one or more of
        the following: liposomes, immunoliposomes (liposomes bound to
        antibodies or antibody fragments or non-antibody
        ligand-targeting moieties), magnetic liposomes, glass beads,
        latex beads, other vesicles made from applied materials,
        organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles, synthetic
        biomaterial like silica modified particles and nanoparticles,
        other nanoparticles with the ability to take up DNA (or other
        substances) for delivery to cells, other nanoparticles that can
        act as a vector to transfer genetic material to a cell. Many of
        these can be directly taken up or otherwise internalized in the
        targeted cells. Liposomes are artificial microscopic vesicles
        used to convey substances--e.g., nucleic acids, DNA, RNA,
        vaccines, drugs, and enzymes--to target cells or organs. In the
        context of this application, liposomes may contain and carry RF
        absorbing particles (such as metal particles, organometalics,
        nanoparticles, etc.) to target cells or organs. These and other
        microparticle and nanoparticle delivery systems (both targeted
        and non-targeted) may be used to carry any one or combination of
        two or more of virtually any of the RF absorbing particles
        described herein, to form RF absorption enhancers. Exemplary
        polymers that may be used as carriers for RF absorption
        enhancers include any one or more of the following: dextran,
        albumin, and biodegradable polymers such as PLA (polylactide),
        PLGA polymers (polylactide with glycolide or poly(lactic
        acid-glycolic acid)), and/or hydroxypropylmethacrylamine (HPMA).
      </p>
      <p>[0044] Other exemplary carriers for RF absorption enhancers
        include: molecular or cellular proteomic or genomic constructs,
        as well as other small particle constructs, including biological
        or robotic constructs, whether organic or from man-made
        materials, such as synthetic applied materials. </p>
      <p>[0045] Targeted RF absorption enhancers are characterized by
        targeting and binding to target cells to thereby increase
        heating of target cells responsive to the RF signal by
        interaction between the RF signal and the targeted RF absorption
        enhancer. The target cells may be in an organ or a tumor or a
        portion of a tumor, or may be circulating or isolated cells,
        such as blood cells. Some targeted RF absorption enhancers may
        bind to the cell membrane or intracellular contents of (e.g.,
        one or more biomolecules inside) the target cells. Some targeted
        RF absorption enhancers may bind to target cells by being taken
        up or otherwise internalized by the target cells. Some targeted
        RF absorption enhancers discussed herein can be thought of as
        effectively changing the resonant frequency of target cells,
        i.e., adding another, artificial frequency to the target cells
        (which may be a resonant frequency of RF absorbing particles),
        because the RF absorbing particles, which are bound to target
        cells via the targeting moieties, will absorb more RF energy and
        heat more quickly than the target cells will at that frequency.
        For targeted RF absorption enhancers, carriers with a targeting
        moiety for targeting and binding to a target cells ("targeted
        carriers") are attached (either directly or indirectly) to any
        of the RF absorbing particles described herein and introduced
        into the patient prior to transmitting the RF signal to create
        hyperthermia. Some targeted carriers for RF absorption enhancers
        (e.g., antibodies, ligands, and TILs) inherently have targeting
        moieties for targeting some part of target cells. Other RF
        absorption enhancer carriers (e.g., liposomes) may need to be
        modified to be targeting carriers by attaching one or more
        target moieties for targeting some part of target cells, e.g.,
        immunoliposomes, which are liposomes bound to antibodies or
        antibody fragments or non-antibody ligand-targeting moieties.
        Some targeted carriers (e.g., antibodies, ligands, and antibody
        fragments) target one or more "target biomolecules" of target
        cells and bind to the target cells. The term "target
        biomolecules" as used herein means a molecular structure within
        a target cell or on the surface of a target cell characterized
        by selective binding of one or more specific substances. The
        term "target biomolecules" includes, by way of example but not
        of limitation, cell surface receptors, tumor-specific markers,
        tumor-associated tissue markers, target cell markers, or target
        cell identifiers, such as CD markers, an interleukin receptor
        site of cancer cells, and other biomolecules to which another
        molecule, e.g. a ligand, antibody, antibody fragment, cell
        adhesion site, biopolymer, synthetic biomaterial, sugar, lipid,
        or other proteomic or genetic engineered constructs including
        recombinant technique, binds. Examples of targeted carriers and
        other targeting moieties that can be used to create targeted RF
        absorption enhancer carriers include: bivalent constructs,
        bispecific constructs, fusion proteins; antibodies; antibody
        fragments; non-antibody ligands; and non-antibody targeting
        moieties (e.g., GM-CSF which targets to GM-CSF receptor in
        leukemic blasts or Galactosamine which targets endothelial
        growth factor receptors in the vessels). </p>
      <p>[0046] Tumors may produce antigens recognized by antibodies.
        There are currently trials of antibodies and antibody fragments
        for virtually all cancers and others are being developed. Tumors
        often express high levels and/or abnormal forms of glycoproteins
        and glycolipids. Antibodies are known to target these (e.g.,
        Anti-MUC-1 for targeting breast or ovarian cancer). Oncofetal
        antigens are also produced by some tumors. Antibodies are known
        to target these (e.g., anti-TAG72 [anti-tumor-associated
        glycoprotein-72] for targeting colonrectal, ovarian and breast
        cancer or anti-CEA [anti-carcinoembryonic antigen] for targeting
        colon-rectal, small-cell lung and ovarian cancers). Tissue
        specific antigens have also been targeted. Antibodies are known
        to target these (e.g., anti-CD25 for targeting interleukin-2
        receptor in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). The rapid production of
        blood vessels in tumors presents another target. Antibodies are
        known to target these (anti-VEGR [anti-vascular endothelial
        growth-factor receptor] for targeting endothelial cells in solid
        tumors. These are but a few examples of the antibodies have
        already been used as ligands in targeted therapy to which the
        present RF enhancers could be attached. Any one or more of the
        RF absorbing particles disclosed herein can be attached
        (directly or indirectly) to any of these antibodies and antibody
        fragments (and any others) to form substances that may be used
        as targeted RF absorption enhancers in connection with
        hyperthermia generating RF signals in accordance with the
        teachings herein. </p>
      <p>[0047] Other examples of known ligand antibodies are the
        monoclonal antibodytrastuzumab (Herceptin) which targets to
        ERBB2 receptor in cells that over-express this receptor such as
        breast and ovarian cancers or rituximab an anti-CD 20 which
        targets cell surface antigen in non-hodgkin's lymphoma and other
        b-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. Any one or more of the RF
        absorbing particles can be attached (directly or indirectly) to
        any of these antibodies and antibody fragments (and any others)
        to form substances that may be used as targeted RF absorption
        enhancers in connection with hyperthermia generating RF signals
        in accordance with the teachings herein. </p>
      <p>[0048] For general RF absorption enhancers, non-targeted
        carriers, such as certain biomolecules, oligonucleotides,
        certain cells (such as cells having general adhesive molecules
        on their surfaces that are less specific than ligands and
        antibodies, which general adhesive molecules may attach to many
        different types of cells), etc. may be attached (either directly
        or indirectly) to any of the RF absorbing particles described
        herein and injected (or otherwise introduced) prior to
        transmitting the RF signal to create hyperthermia. Nanoparticles
        having oligonucleotides attached thereto, such as DNA sequences
        attached to gold nanoparticles, are available from various
        sources, e.g., Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, Ill. 60062, U.S.
        Pat. No. 6,777,186. </p>
      <p>[0049] RF absorbing particles are particles that absorb one or
        more frequencies of an RF electromagnetic signal substantially
        more than untreated cells in or proximate the target area. This
        permits the RF signal to heat the RF absorbing particle (or a
        region surrounding it or a cell near it) substantially more than
        untreated cells in or proximate the target area, e.g., heating
        the RF absorbing particles (or a region surrounding them or a
        cell near them) with the RF signal to a temperature high enough
        to kill target cells bound to them (or damage the membrane of
        target cells bound to them), while untreated cells in or
        proximate the target area are not heated with the RF signal to a
        temperature high enough to kill them. Exemplary target
        hyperthermia temperatures include values at about or at least
        about: 43.degree. C, 106.3.degree. F., 106.5.degree. F., and
        106.7.degree. F., and 107.degree. F. It may also be desirable to
        generate a lower hyperthermia temperature (e.g., any temperature
        above 103.degree., or above 104.degree., or above 105.degree.)
        which may not directly cause necrosis from hyperthermia within
        the target area, but may kill or damage cells in the target area
        in combination with another therapy, e.g., chemotherapy and/or
        radiotherapy and/or radioimmunotherapy. Pulsed RF signals may
        produce very localized temperatures that are higher. Exemplary
        RF absorbing particles mentioned above include particles of
        electrically conductive material, such as gold, copper,
        magnesium, iron, any of the other metals, and/or magnetic
        particles, or various combinations and permutations of gold,
        iron, any of the other metals, and/or magnetic particles.
        Examples of other RF absorbing particles for general RF
        absorption enhancers and/or targeted RF absorption enhancers
        include: metal tubules, particles made of piezoelectric crystal
        (natural or synthetic), very small LC circuits (e.g., parallel
        LC tank circuits, FIGS. 24 and 30), tuned radio frequency (TRF)
        type circuits (e.g., a parallel LC tank circuit having an
        additional inductor with a free end connected to one of the two
        nodes of the tank circuit, FIGS. 27 and 31), other very small
        tuned (oscillatory) circuits (e.g., FIGS. 25, 26, 28, 29, and
        32-33), hollow particles (e.g., liposomes, magnetic liposomes,
        glass beads, latex beads, other vesicles made from applied
        materials, microparticles, microspheres, etc.) containing other
        substances (e.g., small particles containing argon or some other
        inert gas or other substance that has a relatively high
        absorption of electromagnetic energy), particles of radioactive
        isotopes suitable for radiotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (e.g.,
        radiometals, .beta.-emitting lanthanides, radionuclides of
        copper, radionuclides of gold, copper-67, copper-64,
        lutetium-177, yttrium-90, bismuth-213, rhenium-186, rhenium-188,
        actinium-225, gold-127, gold-128, In-111, P-32, Pd-103, Sm-153,
        TC-99m, Rh-105, Astatine-211, Au-199, Pm-149, Ho-166, and
        Thallium-201 thallous chloride), organometallics (e.g., those
        containing Technetium 99m and radiogallium), particles made of
        synthetic materials, particles made of biologic materials,
        robotic particles, particles made of man made applied materials,
        like organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles. These
        particles may be sized as so-called "nanoparticles" (microscopic
        particles whose size is measured in nanometers, e.g., 1-1000 nm)
        or sized as so-called "microparticles" (microscopic particles
        whose size is measured in micrometers, e.g., 1-1000 .mu.m).
        These particles are preferably small enough to be bound to and
        carried with the at least one biomolecule to a target cell via
        the patient's vascular system. For example, gold nanospheres
        having a nominal diameter of 3-37 nm, plus or minus 5 nm may
        used as RF absorption enhancer particles. Some of the
        radioactive isotopes are inserted as "seeds" and may serve as RF
        absorption enhancers, e.g., palladium-103, to heat up a target
        area in the presence of an RF signal. </p>
      <p>[0050] In the case of the particles of radioactive isotopes
        used for various treatments, e.g., to treat cancer, a multi-step
        combination therapy can be used in accordance with the teachings
        hereof. In a first phase, targeted carriers (either carriers
        with an inherent targeting moiety or non-targeting carriers with
        a targeting moiety attached thereto) are attached to one or more
        RF absorbing radionuclides, such as any of the radiometals
        mentioned herein, are introduced into the patient, target
        specific cells, and emissions (e.g., alpha emissions and/or beta
        emissions and/or Auger electron emissions) therefrom damage or
        kill the targeted cells. This first phase may include the
        introduction of other radiometal-labeled antibodies that may act
        as RF absorption enhancers but that do not have cell damaging
        emissions, e.g., radiometals used primarily for imaging. This
        first phase, in the context of certain antibodies and certain
        radioisotopes, is known to those skilled in the art. Thereafter,
        in a second phase according to the present invention, an RF
        signal is transmitted in accordance with the teachings herein to
        generate a localized hyperthermia at the targeted cells by using
        the radioisotope particles (which may be partially depleted) as
        RF absorption enhancing particles. Such a two-phase therapy may
        result in enhanced treatment effectiveness vis-a-vis traditional
        radioimmunotherapy with the addition of the second RF-induced
        hyperthermia phase. In the alternative, such a two-phase therapy
        may result in about the same treatment effectiveness vis-a-vis
        traditional radioimmunotherapy by using a lower dose of
        radioisotope emissions in the first phase (some radioisotopes
        can cause severe damage to tissue, e.g., bone marrow, during
        radiotherapy) with the addition of the second RF-induced
        hyperthermia phase. Between the two phases, one may wait for a
        predetermined period of time, e.g., a period of time based on
        the half-life of emissions from a particular radiometal used, or
        a period of time based on a patient recovery time after the
        first phase, or a period of time based on the ability of one or
        more non-targeted organs (e.g., the liver or kidneys) to
        excrete, metabolize, or otherwise eliminate the
        radioimmunotherapy compound(s). In this regard, it may be
        beneficial for this multiphase therapy to use radiometals or
        other RF absorbing radionuclides with a relatively high
        residualization in target cells. This may help prevent damage to
        non-targeted organs and cells by permitting them to excrete,
        metabolize, or otherwise eliminate the radioimmunotherapy
        compound(s) prior to coupling a hyperthermia generating RF
        signal using the radioimmunotherapy compound as an RF enhancer.
        For example, a patient treated with Yttrium-90 (Y-90)
        ibritumomab tiuxetan (Y-90 ZEVALIN.RTM.) (which is used to treat
        b-cell lymphomas and leukemias) in accordance with known
        protocols, and also perhaps injected with Indium-111 (In-111)
        ibritumomab tiuxetan (In-111 ZEVALIN.RTM.) (which is used for
        imaging in connection with rituximab treatments), may also
        thereafter have a hyperthermia-generating RF signal coupled
        through a body part to heat the cells targeted by the Y-90
        ZEVALIN.RTM. and/or the (In-111 ZEVALIN.RTM.). Particles of
        radioactive isotopes used to treat cancer, either attached to
        biomolecules or not, can be obtained from various commercial
        sources. Radiometals can be attached to monoclonal antibodies,
        e.g., 90-Yttrium-ibritumomab tiuxetan [Zevalin] or
        131-iodine-tositumomab (Bexxar) target anti-CD 20 antigens and
        are used for lymphomas. Radiofrequency can produce an added
        effect with these metals. </p>
      <p>[0051] Very small LC circuits and other tuned (oscillatory)
        circuits were mentioned above as exemplary RF absorbing
        particles. The very small LC circuits and other tuned
        (oscillatory) circuits (FIGS. 24-29) may damage target cells
        with vibration (i.e., heating) when a signal at or near the
        resonant frequency of the tuned circuit is received.
        Additionally, or in the alternative, there may be direct radio
        frequency ablation to the cell from RF energy absorbed by tuned
        circuit RF absorbing particles, which current may be transferred
        to target cells via one or more metal connections of the tuned
        circuit particles to the cell membrane or cell itself (see the
        discussion below with respect to the at least one exposed
        electrical contact 2502 and the encapsulating electrically
        conducting material). </p>
      <p>[0052] For purposes of the present application, virtually any
        of the carriers (targeted or non-targeted) for RF absorption
        enhancers described herein may be attached (either directly or
        indirectly) to virtually any RF absorbing particle described
        herein and/or virtually any combination of and/or permutation of
        any RF absorbing particles described herein to form any one or
        more RF absorption enhancers. For example, antibody carriers may
        be bound to (or otherwise carry) one or more piezoelectric
        crystals, tuned electronic circuits, tuned RF (TRF) circuits,
        TRF circuits having a rectifier D (FIG. 29), LC tank circuits,
        LC tank circuits having a rectifier D (FIG. 26), metallic
        particles, and/or metallic nanoparticles. As other examples, TIL
        carriers may be attached to or contain an organometallic or TRF
        or any other of the microscopic electronic circuit particles,
        RNA or DNA carriers may be attached to organometallic molecules
        acting as RF absorbers, antibody carriers may be attached to
        organometallic molecules acting as RF absorbers, metals (e.g.,
        iron) may be attached to transferrin, liposomes may contain RF
        absorbing particles, immunoliposomes (liposomes bound to
        antibodies or antibody fragments or non-antibody
        ligand-targeting moieties) may contain RF absorbing particles,
        immunopolymers (microreservoirs) formed by linking therapeutic
        agents and targeting ligands to separate sites on water-soluble
        biodegradable polymers, such as HPMA, PLA, PLGA, albumin, and
        dextran, may be used to form RF absorption enhancers by
        attaching to an RF absorbing particle and a targeting moiety
        (antibody or non-antibody), those formed by the attachment of
        multivalent arrays of antibodies, antibody fragments, or other
        ligands to the liposome surface or to the terminus of hydropic
        polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which are grafted
        at the liposome surface) may contain RF absorbing particles,
        dextran may have metallic particles and targeting peptides
        attached to it, polymers of HPMA can have targeting peptides and
        metallic particles attached, liposomes may carry metallic or
        thermally conductive synthetic biomaterials inside,
        immunoliposomes may carry metallic or thermally conductive
        synthetic biomaterials inside, monoclonal antibodies and metals,
        monoclonal antibodies and radioisotopes like Zevalin, antibody
        fragments and organometallics, antibody fragments and
        radioisotopes, fusion proteins and organometallics, fusion
        proteins and radioisotopes, bispecifics and metals or
        organometallics, bispecifics and bivalents constructs and
        radioisotopes. Since tumor penetration is often hampered by
        particle size, reductionistic engineering techniques that create
        smaller proteomic and genomic constructs and recombinations
        which are more tumor-specific will be able to carry RF
        absorption enhancers. As other examples, microparticle and
        nanoparticle delivery systems (both targeted and non-targeted)
        and any of the other carriers herein may carry two or more
        different RF absorbing particles, e.g., metallic particles of
        two different sizes, metallic particles and electronic circuits,
        metallic particles and an RF absorbing gas, electronic circuits
        and an RF absorbing gas, etc. Such combinations of RF absorbing
        particles may provide enhanced absorption at two different
        frequencies, e.g., two different resonant frequencies, or a
        resonant frequency and a frequency range (as one might see with
        a tuned RF circuit absorbing particle combined with a general
        particle, such as a metal particle), which may facilitate
        multi-level treatments at multiple tissue depths. </p>
      <p>[0053] Additionally, virtually any of the foregoing RF
        absorbing particles may be partially encapsulated or fully
        encapsulated in a carrier or other encapsulating structure such
        as: glass beads, latex beads, liposomes, magnetic liposomes,
        other vesicles made from applied materials, etc. As exemplified
        by the tank circuit of FIG. 25 and the TRF circuit of FIG. 28,
        RF absorbing particles in the form of a tuned circuit may be
        partially encapsulated in an electrically insulating material
        2500 (e.g., a glass or latex bead) and have at least one exposed
        electrical contact 2502 in circuit communication with the
        rectifier D for contact with biological material in the target
        area. In the alternative, RF absorbing particles in the form of
        a tuned circuit may be encapsulated in an electrically
        conducting material in circuit communication with the rectifier
        for contact with biological material in the target area.
        Similarly, as exemplified by the rectifying tank circuit of FIG.
        26 and the rectifying TRF circuit of FIG. 29, RF absorbing
        particles having a rectifier D to rectify a received RF signal
        may be partially encapsulated in an electrically insulating
        material 2500 and have at least one exposed electrical contact
        2502 in circuit communication with the rectifier D for contact
        with biological material in the target area to provide a path
        for rectified current to flow and perhaps damage cells and/or
        heat cells in the target area. In the alternative, RF absorbing
        particles having a rectifier to rectify a received RF signal may
        be encapsulated in an electrically conducting material in
        circuit communication with the rectifier for contact with
        biological material in the target area to provide a path for
        rectified current to flow and perhaps damage cells and/or heat
        cells in the target area. These may be fabricated using standard
        monolithic circuit fabrication techniques and/or thin film
        fabrication techniques. Various techniques for fabricating
        microscopic spiral inductors of FIGS. 24-29 using monolithic
        circuit fabrication techniques and/or thin film fabrication
        techniques are known, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,297,647; 5,070,317;
        5,071,509; 5,370,766; 5,450,263; 6,008,713; and 6,242,791.
        Capacitors and rectifiers D may also be fabricated using
        monolithic circuit fabrication techniques and/or thin film
        fabrication techniques (e.g., with a pair of conductive layers
        with a dielectric therebetween and a P-N junction,
        respectively). Thus, it is believed that the microscopic
        (preferably microparticle or nanoparticle) circuits of FIGS.
        24-29 may be fabricated using known monolithic circuit
        fabrication techniques and/or thin film fabrication techniques.
        FIGS. 30-33 show exemplary embodiments of some exemplary tuned
        (oscillatory) circuit particles. FIG. 30 shows an exemplary
        embodiment 3000 of an LC particle of FIG. 25. The exemplary LC
        particle 3000 comprises a substrate 3002 carrying an inductor
        3004 in circuit communication with a capacitor 3006 via
        conductive traces 3008, 3010. The inductor 3004 may be a spiral
        3020 of electrically conductive material. The capacitor 3006 may
        be formed from two spaced plates 3022, 3024 of electrically
        conductive material with a dielectric (not shown) therebetween.
        Plate 3022 and conductive path 3008 are shown as at a lower
        level than plate 3024 and inductor 3020. Conductive path 3008 is
        connected to inductor 3020 with a via 3021. The encapsulating
        electrically insulating material 2500 in FIG. 20 may be
        implemented by a layer of electrically insulating material 3026
        covering at least the inductor 3004 and the capacitor 3006 above
        in cooperation with the substrate 3002 below. The exposed
        electrical contact 2502 in FIG. 25 may be implemented as an
        exposed pad 3030 of conductive material. FIG. 31 shows an
        exemplary embodiment 3100 of a TRF circuit of FIG. 28. Particle
        3100 may be the same as particle 3000, except particle 3100 has
        an additional inductor 3102. The inductor 3102 may be a spiral
        3104 of electrically conductive material, in circuit
        communication by a via 3106 with the node 3008 connecting
        inductor 3004 and capacitor 3006. FIG. 32 shows an exemplary
        embodiment 3200 of a rectifying tank circuit 3200 of FIG. 26.
        Particle 3200 may be the same as particle 3000, except particle
        3200 has a rectifier 3202. Rectifier 3202 may be implemented
        with a n-type semiconductor region (or a p-type region) 3204 in
        circuit communication with a p-type region (or an n-type region)
        3206 as known to those in the art. The node 3010 connecting
        inductor 3004 and capacitor 3006 may be connected to rectifier
        3202 at via 3208. Similarly, the exposed pad 3030 may be
        connected to rectifier 3202 at via 3210. FIG. 33 shows an
        exemplary embodiment 3300 of a rectifying TRF circuit of FIG.
        28. Particle 3300 may be the same as particle 3100, except
        particle 3300 has a rectifier 3202. As with the rectifier in
        FIG. 32, rectifier 3202 may be implemented with an n-type
        semiconductor region (or a p-type region) 3204 in circuit
        communication with a p-type region (or an n-type region) 3206 as
        known to those in the art. The node 3010 connecting inductor
        3004 and capacitor 3006 may be connected to rectifier 3202 at
        via 3208. Similarly, the exposed pad 3030 may be connected to
        rectifier 3202 at via 3210. The particles made of piezoelectric
        crystal can be obtained from various commercial sources, e.g.,
        Bliley Technologies, Inc., Erie, Pa. Gases in the noble gas
        family, e.g., neon, argon, etc., exhibit relatively large
        excitation at relatively low RF signal strengths. The small
        particles containing argon can be obtained from various
        commercial sources. </p>
      <p>[0054] Various means for getting the RF absorption enhancers of
        the present invention to the targeted cell site are
        contemplated. RF absorption enhancers may be introduced as part
        of a fluid directly into the tumor (e.g., by injection),
        introduced as part of such a fluid into the patient's
        circulation (e.g., by injection), mixed with the cells outside
        the body (ex-vivo), inserted into target cells with
        micropipettes. Nanoparticle RF absorption enhancers may be
        introduced by aerosol inhalers, sublinqual and mucosal
        absorption, lotions and creams, and skin patches. RF absorption
        enhancers may be directly injected into a patient by means of a
        needle and syringe. In the alternative, they may be injected
        into a patient via a catheter or a port. They may be injected
        directly into a target area, e.g., a tumor or a portion of a
        tumor. In the alternative, they may be injected via an
        intravenous (IV) system to be carried to a target cell via the
        patient's vascular system. RF absorption enhancers of the
        present invention may bind with the cell surface, bind to a
        target cell wall (e.g., those using monoclonal antibodies as a
        carrier) or be internalized by the cells (e.g., those using
        liposomes and nanoparticles as a carrier). Certain RF absorption
        enhancers of the present invention (e.g., those using TILs as a
        carrier) may be internalized by target cells. Additionally, it
        may be desirable to surgically-place certain RF absorption
        enhancers in a patient, e.g., metallic radioactive "seeds." </p>
      <p>[0055] RF hyperthermia generating signal may have a frequency
        corresponding to a selected parameter of an RF enhancer, e.g.,
        13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz, 915 MHz, 1.2 GHz. Several RF frequencies
        have been allocated for industrial, scientific, and medical
        (ISM) equipment, e.g.: 6.78 MHz.+-.15.0 kHz; 13.56 MHz.+-.7.0
        kHz; 27.12 MHz.+-.163.0 kHz; 40.68 MHz.+-.20.0 kHz; 915
        MHz.+-.13.0 MHz; 2450 MHz.+-.50.0 MHz. See Part 18 of Title 47
        of the Code of Federal Regulations. It is believed that
        hyperthermia generating RF signals at sequentially higher
        frequency harmonics of 13.56 MHz will penetrate into
        respectively deeper tissue, e.g., a hyperthermia generating RF
        signal at 27.12 MHz will penetrate deeper than at 13.56 MHz, a
        hyperthermia generating RF signal at 40.68 MHz will penetrate
        deeper than at 27.12 MHz, a hyperthermia generating RF signal at
        54.24 MHz will penetrate deeper than at 40.68 MHz, a
        hyperthermia generating RF signal at 67.80 MHz will penetrate
        deeper than at 54.24 MHz, a hyperthermia generating RF signal at
        81.36 MHz will penetrate deeper than at 67.80 MHz, and so on (up
        to higher RF frequencies that may heat the skin uncomfortably or
        burn the skin). The optimum depth level is selected based upon
        antibodies used, and the physical size of the patient, the
        location and depth of the target area, and the tumor involved.
        As discussed above, combinations of two or more different
        frequencies may be used, e.g., a lower frequency RF component
        (such as 13.56 MHz) and a higher frequency component (such as
        40.68 MHz) to target different tissue depths with the same
        hyperthermia generating RF signal. </p>
      <p>[0056] Some of the exemplary particles shown comprise a
        rectifier D, e.g., FIGS. 26, 29, 32 and 33. Any of the RF
        absorption enhancer particles disclosed herein may also comprise
        an associated rectifier or demodulator (e.g., a diode or crystal
        in circuit communication with an oscillatory circuit) on some or
        all of the particles to cause rectification of the RF signal and
        thereby generate a DC current to damage the target cell(s) (in
        the case of targeted RF absorption enhancers) and/or cells in
        the target area (in the case of general RF absorption
        enhancers). Thus, for example, the particles may have an LC tank
        circuit with a diode (FIG. 26), a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
        type circuit implemented thereon with a diode (FIG. 29) or a
        piezoelectric crystal with a diode. Such RF absorption enhancer
        particles may require the patient to be grounded, e.g., with a
        grounded lead pad, to provide a current path for the rectified
        RF current. These examples immediately above may be thought of
        as being similar to a simple TRF crystal set, which was powered
        only by a received RF signal and could demodulate the received
        signal and generate enough energy to power a high-impedance
        earphone with no outside power source other than the signal from
        the radio station. With the particles of the present
        application, the addition of a diode to these circuits may cause
        DC currents to flow within the target area and/or within and/or
        between the target cells responsive to the RF signal causing
        additional heating effect to generate the desired hyperthermia
        temperature, e.g., 43.degree. C. The rectifier in any of these
        particles may be a single diode in either polarity (for
        half-wave rectification of the received RF signal) or a pair of
        diodes with opposite polarity (for full wave rectification of
        the RF signal). </p>
      <p>[0057] Any of the RF absorbing particles described herein may
        be used alone or in virtually any combination of and/or
        permutation of any of the other particle or particles described
        herein. For example, it may be beneficial to use the same
        targeted carrier or targeting moiety with a plurality of
        different RF absorbing particles described herein for treatment
        of a target area. Similarly, any of the RF absorbing particles
        described herein may be used alone or in virtually any
        combination of and/or permutation of any of the targeting
        moieties or targeted carriers described herein. Similarly, it
        may be best for some target areas (e.g., some tumors) to use
        multiple different targeting moieties or targeted carriers in RF
        absorption enhancers, e.g., for a malignancy that may have
        different mutations within itself. Accordingly, virtually any
        combination or permutation of RF absorption enhancer targeting
        moieties or RF absorption enhancer targeted carriers may be
        attached to virtually any combination of and/or permutation of
        any RF absorbing particle or particles described herein to
        create RF absorption enhancers for use in accordance with the
        teachings herein. </p>
      <p>[0058] Of the RF absorbing particles mentioned herein, some may
        be suitable for a 13.56 MHz hyperthermia-generating RF signal,
        e.g., gold nanoparticles, copper nanoparticles, magnesium
        nanoparticles, argon-filled beads, aqueous solutions of any of
        the metal sulfates mentioned herein, other hollow nanoparticles
        filled with argon, and any of the organometallics. RF absorption
        enhancers using these RF absorbing particles are also expected
        to be effective at slightly higher frequencies, such as those
        having a frequency on the order of the second or third harmonics
        of 13.56 MHz. </p>
      <p>[0059] Some of the particles used in general RF absorption
        enhancers and/or targeted RF absorption enhancers may have one
        or more resonant frequencies associated therewith such that RF
        energy or other electromagnetic energy at that resonant
        frequency causes much greater heating of the particle than other
        frequencies. Thus, in accordance with the systems and methods of
        the present invention, it may be beneficial to match one or more
        resonant frequencies of RF absorption enhancer particles
        (general and/or targeted) with one or more of the
        electromagnetic frequencies being used to create hyperthermia.
        Additionally, the size of nanoparticles can vary to within
        certain manufacturing tolerances, with generally increased cost
        for a significantly smaller manufacturing tolerance. Thus, for a
        single frequency being used to create hyperthermia, there may be
        a nominal size of nanoparticles associated with that one
        frequency (e.g., a nominal size of nanoparticles having a
        resonant frequency at that frequency); however, the cost of
        manufacturing nanoparticles only at that one size might be
        prohibitively high. Consequently, from a cost standpoint, it
        might be beneficial (i.e., lower cost) to use nanoparticles with
        a larger size tolerance as RF absorption enhancer particles;
        however, the particles within a sample of nanoparticles with a
        larger size tolerance may have widely different resonant
        frequencies. Accordingly, it may be beneficial to use a
        frequency modulated (FM) signal to create hyperthermia with
        certain energy absorption enhancer particles. The parameters of
        the FM signal used to generate hyperthermia may be selected to
        correspond to the specific sample of particles being used as
        energy absorption enhancer particles. The center frequency of an
        FM hyperthermia generating signal may correspond to a resonant
        frequency of nominally sized particles used as energy absorption
        enhancer particles and the modulation of the FM hyperthermia
        generating signal may correspond to the size tolerance of the
        particles used as energy absorption enhancer particles. For
        example, a hyperthermia generating RF signal may be modulated
        with an FM signal having a frequency deviation of 300-500 KHz or
        more, and any particles having a resonant frequency within the
        FM deviation would vibrate and cause heating. Targeted RF
        absorption enhancer particles used in accordance with an FM
        signal used to generate hyperthermia can be thought of as
        effectively changing the resonant frequency range of the target
        cells, i.e., adding a resonant frequency range to the target
        cells. Thus, instead of trying to determine one or more resonant
        frequency ranges of target cells, in accordance with the systems
        and methods of the present invention the resonant frequency
        range of target cells may be effectively changed to whatever
        frequency range is desired to create hyperthermia. With all the
        embodiments described herein, one may select a frequency or
        frequency range for a signal used to generate hyperthermia that
        corresponds to a parameter of energy enhancing particles, or one
        may select energy enhancing particles corresponding to a
        frequency or frequency range for a signal used to generate
        hyperthermia. It may be beneficial to modify other existing
        thermotherapy devices to use the FM hyperthermia generating RF
        signal discussed herein. Similarly, it may be beneficial to
        modify other existing thermotherapy therapies to use the FM
        hyperthermia generating RF signal discussed herein. </p>
      <p>[0060] Additionally, in any of the embodiments discussed
        herein, the RF signal used to generate hyperthermia may be a
        pulsed, modulated FM RF signal, or a pulse fixed frequency
        signal. A pulsed signal may permit a relatively higher
        peak-power level (e.g., a single "burst" pulse at 1000 Watts or
        more, or a 1000 Watt signal having a duty cycle of about 10% to
        about 25%) and may create higher local temperatures at RF
        absorption enhancer particles (i.e., higher than about
        43.degree. C.) without also raising the temperature that high
        and causing detrimental effects to surrounding cells (for
        targeted enhancers) or surrounding areas (for general
        enhancers). </p>
      <p>[0061] Several systems can be used to remotely determine
        temperature within a body using sensors or using radiographic
        means with infrared thermography and thermal MRI. Such remotely
        determined temperature may be used as feedback to control the
        power of the signal being delivered to generate hyperthermia.
        For example, a temperature remotely measured can be used as an
        input signal for a controller (e.g., a PID controller or a
        proportional controller or a proportional-integral controller)
        to control the power of the hyperthermia-generating signal to
        maintain the generated temperature at a specific temperature
        setpoint, e.g., 43.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0062] Similarly, the location of certain radioisotopes can be
        remotely determined using radiographic means for imaging of
        radioimmunotherapy. Accordingly, in any of the embodiments
        discussed herein, RF absorption enhancers may have substances
        (such as certain radioisotopes, quantum dots, colored dyes,
        fluorescent dyes, etc.) added or attached thereto that, when
        introduced with the RF absorption enhancers, can be used to
        remotely determine the location of RF absorption enhancers,
        i.e., the location of the substances can be determined and the
        location of RF absorption enhancers can be inferred therefrom.
        In the alternative, these substances can be introduced before or
        after RF absorption enhancers are introduced and used to
        remotely determine the location of the RF absorption enhancers.
        Examples of radioisotopes the location of which can be monitored
        in a body (e.g., with CT scanners, PET scanners, and other
        systems capable of detecting particles emitted by such
        substances) include: technetium 99m, radiogallium, 2FDG
        (18-F-2-deoxyglucose or 18-F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose) (for PET
        scans), iodine-131, positron-emitting Iodine 124, copper-67,
        copper-64, lutetium-177, bismuth-213, rhenium-186, actinium-225,
        In-111, iodine-123, iodine-131, any one or more of which may be
        added to RF absorption enhancers. Some of these, e.g.,
        technetium 99m, radiogallium, 2FDG, iodine-131, copper-67,
        copper-64, lutetium-177, bismuth-213, rhenium-186, actinium-225,
        and In-111 may also absorb a significant amount of RF energy and
        therefore function as RF absorption enhancing particles,
        absorbing RF energy sufficient to raise the temperature of
        target cells or a target area to a desired temperature level and
        permitting remote location determination. Such determined
        location can be used to provide feedback of the location of
        general or targeted RF absorption enhancers to know which
        regions of an area or body will be heated by a hyperthermia
        generating RF signal. For example, the location of these
        particles (and by inference the location of targeted RF
        absorption enhancers) can be periodically determined, i.e.,
        monitored, and the hyperthermia generating RF signal applied
        when enough of the targeted RF absorption enhancers are in a
        desired location. As another example, the location of these
        particles (and by inference the location of general or targeted
        RF absorption enhancers) can be periodically determined, i.e.,
        monitored, and the hyperthermia generating RF signal ceased when
        the RF absorption enhancers have diffused too much or have moved
        from a predetermined location. Thus, the location of RF
        absorption enhancers may be determined via PET scanners, CT
        scanners, X-ray devices, mass spectroscopy or specialized CT
        scanners (e.g., Phillips Brilliance CT), and/or infrared, near
        infrared, thermal MRIs and other optical and/or thermal
        scanners. For PET scans, exemplary known imaging/treatment
        substances include: (a) antibodies (or targeting peptides)
        linked to PET radiometals linked to a cytoxic agent and (b)
        antibodies (or targeting peptides) linked to PET radiometals
        linked to beta emitting radionucleotides. In accordance with the
        teachings herein, one or more RF absorbing particles may be
        added to these substances (or in the alternative one or more RF
        absorbing particles may replace either the cytoxic agent or the
        beta emitting radionucleotides) for combined PET imaging with RF
        generated hyperthermia. Thus, these phage display antibodies
        attached to PET radiometals may also be attached to any one or
        more of the RF absorbing particles discussed herein. This
        combination of imaging and RF hyperthermia therapy may be
        accomplished with PET, infrared, near infrared, and MRI. </p>
      <p>[0063] Imaging techniques can be used to guide the injection
        (or other introduction) of RF absorption enhancers into a tumor,
        e.g., a tumor or a portion of a tumor. After injection, a
        hyperthermia generating RF signal is applied to the target area
        and thermal imaging can be used to monitor the heat being
        generated by the RF signal and perhaps directly control the
        power of the RF signal. Thereafter, follow-up 3-D imaging using
        traditional methods can be used to determine the results of the
        hyperthermia. Additionally, imaging combinations are
        contemplated for imaging of RF absorption enhancers, e.g., using
        thermal imaging, colored dyes, quantum dots. </p>
      <p>[0064] Several substances have been described as being injected
        into a patient, e.g., general RF absorption enhancers, targeted
        RF absorption enhancers, radioisotopes for remotely determining
        temperature, radioisotopes capable of being remotely located,
        etc. It is expected that some or all of these will be injected
        using a syringe with a needle. The needle may be removed from
        the patient after injection and before the RF signal is applied
        to generate hyperthermia. In the alternative, a needle used to
        inject one or more of the foregoing may be left in place and
        used as an RF absorption enhancer, i.e., a needle can be made
        from any number of selected that will heat in the presence of an
        RF signal. Thus, an ordinary needle may be used as an RF
        absorption enhancer. Additionally, a needle can be altered to
        resonate at a selected frequency of an RF
        hyperthermia-generating signal, which will cause it to heat
        faster. For example, the tip of a needle can be modified to
        include a quarter-wave coil, e.g., at the tip of the needle. For
        example, at an RF frequency of about 13.56 MHz, about six (6)
        turns of 22 or 24 gauge wire wrapped around the tip of a needle
        (and perhaps covered with an electrical insulator, e.g., an
        enamel coating) may greatly enhance RF absorption at the needle
        tip, effectively creating a hot spot at the tip of the needle
        subjected to an RF signal. Additionally, or in the alternative,
        a needle used to inject one or more RF absorption enhancers may
        have a temperature sensor at its tip in circuit communication
        with external circuitry to determine a temperature of a target
        region. As discussed above, this determined temperature may be
        used to control the power of the RF signal to maintain a desired
        temperature of a target region. </p>
      <p>[0065] Viruses (and liposomes and perhaps other carriers) may
        also be used to improve receptivity of target cells and target
        areas to targeted RF absorption enhancers, e.g., by having a
        virus (and/or liposomes and/or another carrier) carry a gene (or
        other biomolecule) for production of a protein that would be
        incorporated on the surface of a target cell, making the target
        cell more identifiable and easily attached by a targeted RF
        enhancer. For example, a patient may be infected with a virus by
        removing the cells from the body, growing and increasing their
        number in a tissue culture, infecting the cells outside the body
        (ex-vivo), and then inserting them back into the patient. Or the
        virus may be introduced directly into the body (in-vivo) or into
        the tumor. Additionally, a virus with such a targeting gene may
        also be delivered to a target cell by other means, e.g.,
        liposomes or microinfusion. Once the target cell produces the
        protein that is incorporated to the surface membrane, a dose of
        a targeted RF absorption enhancer is introduced into the body
        and the targeted carrier thereof will target and attach to the
        new protein on the target cell membrane. After waiting for a
        significant number of the targeted RF absorption enhancers to
        attach to the new protein, a hyperthermia generating RF signal
        is transmitted into the target area and the target cells are
        given a lethal dose of heat or a dose of heat to augment other
        therapies. </p>
      <p>[0066] Referring once again to the figures, FIG. 2 illustrates
        an exemplary embodiment having an RF transmitter 200 in circuit
        communication with transmission head 218 that transmits an RF
        signal 270 through a target area 280 to a reception head 268 in
        circuit communication with an RF receiver 250. The RF
        transmitter 200 is a multi-frequency transmitter and includes a
        first RF signal generator 204. The first RF signal generator 204
        generates a first signal at a first frequency F1, such as a 16
        megahertz frequency. The first RF signal generator 204 is in
        circuit communications with band pass filter B.P. 1 206, which
        is in circuit communication with an RF combination circuit 212.
        Band pass filter B.P. 1 206 is a unidirectional band pass filter
        that prevents signals at other frequencies from reaching first
        RF signal generator 204. </p>
      <p>[0067] RF transmitter 200 includes a second RF signal generator
        208. Second RF signal generator 208 generates a second signal at
        a second frequency F2, such as, for example a 6 megahertz
        signal. Second signal generator 208 is in circuit communication
        with band pass filter B.P. 2 210, which is also in circuit
        communication with the RF combination circuit 212. Band pass
        filter B.P. 2 210 prevents signals at other frequencies from
        reaching second RF signal generator 208. Optionally, RF
        combination circuit 212 includes circuitry to prevent the first
        and second signals from flowing toward the other signal
        generators and thus eliminates the need for band pass filter
        B.P. 1 206 and band pass filter B.P. 2 210. </p>
      <p>[0068] RF combination circuit 212 combines the first and second
        signal at frequency F1 and frequency F2 and outputs RF signal
        270. Preferably, RF combination circuit 212 is in circuit
        communication with first meter 214. First meter 214 is used to
        detect the signal strength of RF signal 270. The RF signal 270
        is transmitted via transmission head 218 through the target 280
        to reception head 268. Optionally, plug type connectors 216, 266
        are provided allowing for easy connection/disconnection of
        transmission head 218, and reception head 268 respectfully.
        Reception head 268 is preferably in circuit communications with
        a second meter 264. Second meter 264 detects the RF signal
        strength received by the reception head 268. The difference in
        RF signal strength between first meter 214 and second meter 264
        can be used to calculate energy absorbed by the target area 280.
        Reception head 268 is also in circuit communication with an RF
        splitter 262. RF splitter 262 separates the RF signal 270 into
        back into its components, first signal at frequency F1 and
        second signal at frequency F2. RF splitter 262 is in circuit
        communication with band pass filter B.P. 1 256, which is in
        circuit communication with first tuned circuit 254. Similarly,
        RF splitter 262 is in circuit communication with band pass
        filter B.P. 2 260, which is in circuit communication with second
        tuned circuit 258. Optionally, band pass filter B.P. 1, 256 and
        band pass filter B.P. 2 260 can be replaced with a splitter or
        powered tee. </p>
      <p>[0069] First tuned circuit 254 is tuned so that at least a
        portion of reception head 268 is resonant at frequency F1.
        Similarly, second tuned circuit 258 is tuned to that at least a
        portion of reception head 268 is resonant at frequency F2. Since
        the reception head 268 is resonant at frequencies F1 and F2 the
        RF signal 270 is forced to pass through the target area 280. </p>
      <p>[0070] Optionally, an exemplary embodiment having an RF
        transmitter, similar to that illustrated above, that does not
        include an RF combination circuit is provided. Instead, the RF
        transmitter uses a multi-frequency transmission head. In this
        embodiment, one portion of the transmission head is used to
        transmit one frequency signal, and a second portion is used to
        transmit a second frequency signal. In addition, optionally, the
        reception head and resonant circuits are constructed without the
        need for a splitter, by providing a reception head having
        multiple portions wherein the specific portions are tuned to
        receive specific frequency signals. An example of such a
        transmission head in more detail illustrated below. </p>
      <p>[0071] FIG. 2 illustrates another means for concentrating the
        RF signal on specific target area by using a larger transmission
        head then reception head. The RF signal 270 transmitted by
        larger transmission head 218 is received by reception head 268
        in such a manner that the RF signal 270 is more concentrated
        near the reception head 268 than it is near the transmission
        head 218. The more concentrated the RF signal 270, the higher
        the amount of energy that can be absorbed by the specific area
        282. Thus, positioning the larger transmission head on one side
        of the target area 280 and positioning the smaller reception
        head 268 on the other side of and near the specific target area
        282 is a means for concentrating the RF signal 270 on the
        specific target area 282. Optionally, one or more of the tuned
        circuits 254, 258 in the RF receiver 250 are tuned to have a
        high quality factor or high "Q." Providing a resonant circuit
        with a high "Q" allows the tuned head to pick up larger amounts
        of energy. </p>
      <p>[0072] FIGS. 3-6 illustrate a number of exemplary transmitter
        head and reception head configurations. Additionally, the
        transmitter and receiver heads may be metallic plates. FIG. 3
        illustrates a transmitter head 302 having a non-uniform
        thickness 314. Transmission head 302 is electrically insulated
        from target area 306 by an insulation layer 308 in contact with
        the target area. Similarly, reception head 304 is electrically
        insulated by insulation layer 310. Insulation layer 310 can be
        in direct contact with target area 306. Insulation layer 308,
        310 provide additional means of electrically insulating the
        transmission head and reception heads from the target area.
        Reception head 304 also has non-uniform thicknesses 314 and 316.
        Receiver head 304 is smaller than transmission head 302 and has
        a smaller cross sectional area on its face. The smaller
        cross-sectional area of receiver head 304 facilitates in
        concentrating an RF signal in a specific target area. </p>
      <p>[0073] FIG. 3A illustrates a face view of the exemplary
        embodiment of the transmission head 302 of FIG. 3. The
        transmission head 302 includes a plurality of individual
        transmission heads 314, 316. Transmission heads 314 provide for
        transmission of a signal at a first frequency, such as 4
        megahertz. Transmission heads 316 provide for transmission of a
        signal at a second frequency, such as, for example 10 MHz, or
        13.56 MHz or any of the lower harmonics of 13.56 MHz mentioned
        above, e.g., 27.12 MHz. Preferably, the transmission heads 314
        and 316 are electrically insulated from one another. In
        addition, preferable the power output can be controlled to each
        transmission head, allowing for the power output to be increased
        or decreased in specific areas based upon the size, shape, or
        depth of the specific target area. Optionally, all of the
        transmission heads 314 provide the same power output, and
        transmission heads 316 provide the same power output. </p>
      <p>[0074] Obviously the transmission head can contain any number
        of individual transmission heads. Moreover, the transmission
        heads can transmit signals at a plurality of frequency, and
        include, but are not limited to transmission heads that transmit
        signals at one, two, three, etc. different frequencies. All of
        which have been contemplated and are within the spirit and scope
        of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0075] FIG. 4 illustrates yet an additional exemplary
        embodiment. FIG. 4 illustrates transmission head 402 with a wavy
        surface 412 and reception head 404 having a wavy surface 414.
        Other useful surface configurations include bumpy, planer,
        non-uniform, mounded, conical and dimpled surfaces. Varied
        surface shapes allow for variable depths of heating control. The
        shape of receiving head 414 is thinner, narrower (not shown) and
        is selected based upon the size and shape of the specific target
        area 410 located in the general target area 406. </p>
      <p>[0076] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary embodiment with a
        non-invasive transmission head 502 and an invasive needle 512.
        In this embodiment, end of needle 512 is located at least
        partially within general target area 506 and near specific
        target area 510. Needle 512 is preferably hollow and has
        extension members 514 within the needle 512. Once the end of
        needle 512 is located near the specific target area 510, the
        extension members 514 are extended and attach to the specific
        target area 510. Preferably, the specific target area 510 has
        been targeted with a large concentration of RF absorption
        enhancers 516. The target area 510, itself, becomes the
        reception head. The extension members 514 provide circuit
        communication with the resonant circuit and the target area 510
        is resonant at the desired frequency. Providing multiple
        extension members provides for a more even heating of the
        specific target area 510. This embodiment allows the RF signal
        to be concentrated on small areas. </p>
      <p>[0077] FIG. 6 illustrates yet another exemplary embodiment of
        transmission and reception heads. In this embodiment,
        transmission head 602 includes a first transmission head portion
        604 and a second transmission head portion 606. The first and
        second transmission heads 602, 604 are electrically isolated
        from one another by an insulating member 608. Similarly,
        reception head 612 includes a first reception portion 614 and a
        second reception portion 16 that are electrically isolated from
        one another by an insulation member 618. Providing multiple
        transmission head portions that are electrically isolated from
        one another allows the use of multiple frequencies which can be
        used to heat various shapes and sizes of target areas. Different
        frequencies can be used to heat thicker and thinner portions of
        the target area, or deeper target areas allowing for a more
        uniform heating, or maximum desired heating, of the entire
        target area. Another exemplary embodiment (not shown) includes a
        plurality of concentric circles forming transmission head
        portions and are electrically isolated or insulated from each
        other. </p>
      <p>[0078] FIG. 7 illustrates a high level exemplary methodology of
        for inducing hyperthermia in a target area 700. The methodology
        begins at block 702. At block 704 the transmission head is
        arranged. Arrangement of the transmission head is accomplished
        by, for example, placing the transmission head proximate to and
        on one side of the target area. At block 706 the reception head
        is arranged. Arrangement of the reception head is similarly
        accomplished by, for example, placing the reception head
        proximate to and on the other side of the target area so that an
        RF signal transmitted via the transmission head to the reception
        head will pass through the target area. At block 708 the RF
        signal is transmitted from the transmission head to the
        reception head. The RF signal passes through and warms cells in
        the target area. The methodology ends at block 710 and may be
        ended after a predetermined time interval and/in response to a
        determination that a desired heating has been achieved. </p>
      <p>[0079] FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary methodology for inducing
        hyperthermia in a target area 800. The methodology begins at
        block 802. At block 804 an RF transmitter is provided. The RF
        transmitter may be any type of RF transmitter allowing the RF
        frequency to be changed or selected. Preferably RF transmitter
        is a variable frequency RF transmitter. Optionally, the RF
        transmitter is also multi-frequency transmitter capable of
        providing multiple-frequency RF signals. Still yet, optionally
        the RF transmitter is capable of transmitting RF signals with
        variable amplitudes or pulsed amplitudes. </p>
      <p>[0080] Preferably, a variety of different shapes and sizes of
        transmission and reception heads are provided. The transmission
        head is selected at block 806. The selection of the transmission
        head may be based in part on the type of RF transmitter
        provided. Other factors, such as, for example, the depth, size
        and shape of the general target area, or specific target area to
        be treated, and the number of frequencies transmitted may also
        be used in determining the selection of the transmission head. </p>
      <p>[0081] The RF receiver is provided at block 808. The RF
        receiver may be tuned to the frequency(s) of the RF transmitter.
        At block 810, the desired reception head is selected. Similarly
        to the selection of the transmission head, the reception head is
        preferably selected to fit the desired characteristics of the
        particular application. For example, a reception head with a
        small cross section can be selected to concentrate the RF signal
        on a specific target area. Various sizes and shapes of the
        reception heads allow for optimal concentration of the RF signal
        in the desired target area. </p>
      <p>[0082] The RF absorption in the target area is enhanced at
        block 812. The RF absorption rate may be enhanced by, for
        example, injecting an aqueous solution, and preferably an
        aqueous solution containing suspended particles of an
        electrically conductive material. Optionally, the RF absorption
        in the target area is enhanced by exposing the target cells to
        one or more targeted RF absorption enhancers, as discussed
        above. </p>
      <p>[0083] Arrangement of the transmission head and reception head
        are performed at blocks 814 and 816 respectfully. The
        transmission head and reception heads are arranged proximate to
        and on either side of the target area. The transmission head and
        reception heads are insulated from the target area. Preferably
        the heads are insulated from the target area by means of an air
        gap. Optionally, the heads are insulated from the target area by
        means of an insulating material. The RF frequency(s) are
        selected at block 818 and the RF signal is transmitted at block
        820. In addition to selecting the desired RF frequency(s) at
        block 818, preferably, the transmission time or duration is also
        selected. The duration time is set to, for example, a specified
        length of time, or set to raise the temperature of at least a
        portion of the target area to a desired temperature/temperature
        range, such as, for example to between 106.degree. and
        107.degree., or set to a desired change in temperature. In
        addition, optionally, other modifications of the RF signal are
        selected at this time, such as, for example, amplitude, pulsed
        amplitude, an on/off pulse rate of the RF signal, a variable RF
        signal where the frequency of the RF signal varies over a set
        time period or in relation to set temperatures, ranges or
        changes in temperatures. The methodology ends at block 822 and
        may be ended after a predetermined time interval and/in response
        to a determination that a desired heating has been achieved. </p>
      <p>[0084] FIG. 9 illustrates an exemplary in-vitro methodology of
        inducing hyperthermia in target cells 900. The exemplary
        in-vitro methodology 900 begins at block 902. At block 904,
        cells to be treated are extracted from a patient and placed in a
        vessel. The removed cells include at least one or more target
        cells and are extracted by any method, such as for example, with
        a needle and syringe. At block 906 antibodies bound with RF
        enhancers are provided and exposed to the extracted cells. The
        antibodies bound with RF enhancers attach to one or more of the
        target cells that are contained within the larger set of
        extracted cells. </p>
      <p>[0085] An RF transmitter and RF receiver are provided at blocks
        910 and 912 respectively. The transmission head is arranged
        proximate to and on one side of the target cells in the vessel
        at block 916. At block 918 the reception head is arranged
        proximate to and on the other side of the target cells. An RF
        signal is transmitted at block 918 to increase the temperature
        of the target cells to, for example, to between 106.degree. and
        107.degree.. </p>
      <p>[0086] FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary in-vitro methodology of
        separating cells 1000. The exemplary in-vitro methodology begins
        at block 1002. At block 1004, cells to be treated are extracted
        from a patient and placed in a vessel. The extracted cells
        include at least one or more target cells and are extracted by
        any method, such as for example, with a needle and syringe. At
        block 1006 targeting carriers (with either inherent targeting
        moieties or targeting moieties attached thereto) bound to
        magnetic particles (magnetic targeted RF absorption enhancers)
        are provided and exposed to the extracted cells. The magnetic
        targeted RF absorption enhancers attach to one or more of the
        target cells that are contained within the larger set of
        extracted cells. A magnetic coil is provided at block 1010 and
        energized at block 1012. The target cells that are bound to the
        targeting moieties are attracted by the magnetic field. The
        target cells bound to the targeting moieties are then separated
        from the other cells. The target cells can be separated by
        skimming the one or more target cells from the remaining cells,
        or retaining the one or more target cells in one area of the
        vessel and removing the other cells. The methodology ends at
        block 1020 after one or more of the target cells are separated
        from the other cells. </p>
      <p>[0087] As shown in FIG. 11, an exemplary system 1100 according
        to the present invention may have an RF generator 1102
        transmitting RF energy via a transmission head 1104 toward a
        target area 1106. The transmission head 1104 may have a plate
        1108 operatively coupled to a coil or other inductor 1110. In
        such a configuration, the head 1104 may itself constitute or be
        components of a resonant circuit for transmission and/or
        reception of a hyperthermia-generating RF signal. The plate 1108
        may be in circuit communication with the coil or other inductor
        1110. The RF generator 1102 may be a commercial transmitter,
        e.g., the transmitter portion of a YAESU brand FT-1000MP Mark-V
        transceiver. A hyperthermia generating signal can be generated
        at about 13.56 MHz (one of the FCC-authorized frequencies for
        ISM equipment) by the transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
        FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver by clipping certain blocking
        components as known to those skilled in the art. The RF
        generator 1102 and transmission head 1104 may have associated
        antenna tuner circuitry (not shown) in circuit communication
        therewith or integral therewith, e.g., automatic or manual
        antenna tuner circuitry, to adjust to the impedance of
        transmission head 1104 and the target area 1106 (and a receiver,
        if any). The transmitter portion of a YAESU brand FT-1000MP
        Mark-V transceiver has such integral antenna tuner circuitry
        (pressing a "Tune" button causes the unit to automatically
        adjust to the load presented to the RF generator portion). The
        RF generator 1202 and transmission head may have associated
        antenna tuner circuitry (not shown) in circuit communication
        therewith or integral therewith, e.g., automatic or manual
        antenna tuner circuitry, to adjust to the combined impedance of
        the target area 1206 and the receiver 1212, 1214 and compensate
        for changes therein. The transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
        FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver has such integral antenna tuner
        circuitry. Various configurations for the plate 1108 and coil
        1110 are possible, as exemplified below. A central axis of the
        coil, e.g., the central axis of a cylindrical inductor core, may
        be directed toward the target area. </p>
      <p>[0088] As exemplified by FIG. 12A, an exemplary system 1200
        according to the present invention may have an RF generator 1202
        transmitting RF energy via a transmission head 1204 (which
        transmission head 1204 may have a plate 1208 operatively coupled
        to a coil or other inductor 1210) through a target area 1206 to
        a reception head 1212 coupled to a load 1214. The reception head
        1212 may have a plate 1216 operatively coupled to a coil or
        other inductor 1218. The RF generator 1202 may be a commercial
        transmitter, e.g., the transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
        FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver, which may be modified as discussed
        above to generate a 13.56 MHz signal. The RF generator 1202 and
        transmission head 1204 may have associated antenna tuner
        circuitry (not shown) in circuit communication therewith or
        integral therewith, e.g., automatic or manual antenna tuner
        circuitry, to adjust to the combined impedance of the
        transmission head 1204, the target area 1206, and the receiver
        1212, 1214 and compensate for changes therein. The transmitter
        portion of a YAESU brand FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver has such
        integral antenna tuner circuitry. The load 1214 may be as simple
        as a non-inductive resistive load (e.g., a grounded power
        resistor) providing a path for coupled RF energy to dissipate.
        Various configurations for the plates 1208, 1216 and coils 1210,
        1218 are possible, as exemplified below. </p>
      <p>[0089] As exemplified by FIG. 12B, an exemplary system 1220
        according to the present invention may have a combined RF
        generator/load 1222 transmitting RF energy via the transmission
        head 1204 through the target area 1206 to the reception head
        1212, which may also be coupled to the combined RF
        generator/load 1222. The combined RF generator/load 1222 may be
        a commercial transceiver, e.g., a YAESU brand FT-1000MP Mark-V
        transceiver, which has built-in automatic antenna tuner
        circuitry, which can automatically correct for the impedance of
        the transmission head 1204, the target area 1206, and the
        reception head 1212. For generating hyperthermia with an RF
        signal, the YAESU brand FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver may not
        generate enough heat, depending on whether RF enhancers are
        used. Accordingly, the output may need to be amplified with a
        power amplifier prior to coupling via the transmission head
        through the target region to the reception head. The
        configurations of FIGS. 12A and 12B, having a transmission head
        and a reception head defining a target region therebetween, are
        favored at the time of the filing of the present application
        with respect to generating hyperthermia with an RF signal in a
        target region, e.g., in a tumor or portion of a tumor treated
        with RF enhancers. </p>
      <p>[0090] As shown in FIGS. 13-14, an exemplary head 1300 (as a
        transmission head and/or as a reception head) may have a plate
        of conductive material 1302 operatively coupled to a coil or
        other inductor 1304, an axis of which inductor 1304 may extend
        generally perpendicular or substantially perpendicular with
        respect to a surface 1305 of the plate 1302. In such a
        configuration, the head 1300 may itself constitute or be
        components of a resonant circuit for transmission and/or
        reception of a hyperthermia-generating RF signal. The plate of
        conductive material 1302 may be a generally round plate made of
        flat, conductive material of substantially uniform thickness.
        The specific characteristics (surface area, thickness, material,
        etc.) of the plate 1302 may depend on the specific application
        and may depend greatly on the frequency or frequencies of
        electromagnetic radiation directed toward a target area. The
        plate 1302 may be made from, e.g., copper or silver-plated
        copper or bronze and should be thick enough to be
        self-supporting or supported by supporting structures (not
        shown). The surface area of the plate 1302 may depend on the
        size of the target area, with a larger plate being used for a
        larger target area. The surface area of the plate 1302 may
        depend on the frequency of hyperthermia generating RF signal
        being used, with lower frequencies, e.g., 13.56 MHz, using a
        larger plate than higher frequencies, e.g., 27.12 MHz or 40.68
        MHz, to help tune to the frequency of hyperthermia generating RF
        signal being used. </p>
      <p>[0091] Similarly, the specific characteristics (number of
        inductors, inductance of each inductor, overall length of each,
        material for each, material dimensions for each, number of
        windings for each, coil diameter for each, coil core material
        for each, etc.) of the inductor 1304 may depend on the specific
        application and may depend greatly on the frequency or
        frequencies of electromagnetic radiation directed toward a
        target area. At higher RF frequencies, (e.g., at about 100 MHz
        and higher) the inductor 1304 may be a simple straight length of
        electrical conductor. The inductor 1304 at lower RF frequencies
        (e.g., about 13.56 MHz) may be configured as a coil 1304 of
        electrically conductive material, as shown in the figures. If
        the inductor 1304 is a coil, the coil 1304 may be formed using a
        core 1306, which may have an axis, e.g., a central axis 1307,
        that is generally or substantially perpendicular to the surface
        1305 of plate 1302. If a plurality of frequencies of
        electromagnetic radiation are directed toward a target area, a
        corresponding plurality of electrically insulated inductors may
        extend generally or substantially perpendicular from the surface
        1305 toward the target area. Some or all of the plurality of
        electrically insulated inductors may be coils, some or all of
        which may be coaxial or even share a common core 1306. As shown
        in FIG. 13, the inductor 1304 may be spaced from a central point
        1308 (e.g., a center of area or center of mass or axial center)
        of the plate by a distance 1309. Similarly, the axis 1307 of
        inductor 1304 may be spaced from the central point 1308 of the
        plate by a distance (not shown). As shown in FIG. 14, the head
        1300 may have an associated electrical connector 1312 for being
        placed in circuit communication with either an RF generator (in
        the case of a transmission head) or a load (in the case of a
        reception head). As discussed below, the plate 1302 may be
        electrically connected to the inductor 1304 at a point 1310. In
        the alternative, the plate 1302 may be electrically insulated
        from the inductor 1304, which may permit the plate to be
        configured differently from the inductor 1304, e.g., permit the
        plate 1302 to be grounded or tuned independently of the inductor
        1304. Thus, the connector 1312 may be in circuit communication
        with the plate 1302 and/or the inductor 1304 and the plate 1302
        and the inductor 1304 may each have an associated connector. As
        discussed below, the other end 1314 of coil 1304 may be free or
        may be connected to a tuning circuit, e.g., a capacitor which
        may be a variable capacitor. </p>
      <p>[0092] An exemplary head for use at a frequency of about 13.56
        MHz may have a plate formed as an approximately circular shaped
        disk of flat copper that is about ten (10) inches thick
        electrically connected to an inductor that is a coil formed from
        about six (6) turns of 22 or 24 gauge wire would around a 1-inch
        hollow air core with the windings extending about three (3)
        inches from the surface of the plate. </p>
      <p>[0093] As shown in FIG. 15, two of the exemplary heads 1300 of
        FIGS. 13-14 may be used as a transmission head 1300a and
        reception head 1300b pair. In this configuration, the
        transmission head 1300a may be in circuit communication with an
        RF generator via connector 1312a and reception head 1300b may be
        in circuit communication with a load via connector 1312b with RF
        electromagnetic energy being coupled from transmission head
        1300a to reception head 1300b. As shown in FIG. 15, such a pair
        may be oriented to create an area 1500 bounded on different
        sides by the plates 1302a, 1302b and coils 1304a, 1304b. More
        specifically, the transmission head 1300a and reception head
        1300b may be oriented with their plates 1302a, 1302b generally
        facing each other and their inductors spaced from each other and
        with their axes extending generally parallel to each other to
        create area 1500. Area 1500 thus is bounded by a side 1502a
        proximate plate 1302a, a side 1502b proximate plate 1302b, a
        side 1504a proximate inductor 1304a, and a side 1504b proximate
        inductor 1304b. Notice that in this configuration, the distal
        ends 1502a, 1502b of the inductors 1304a, 1304b are proximate an
        opposite location 1508b, 1508a of the opposite plate 1302b,
        1302a, respectively, which creates an overlap of the inductors
        1304a, 1304b that helps form the area 1500. It is expected that
        RF electromagnetic energy will be coupled from inductor 1304a to
        inductor 1304b in this side to side configuration. Similarly, it
        is also believed that RF electromagnetic energy will be coupled
        from plate 1302a to plate 1302b. Surprisingly, a pair of heads
        1300a, 1300b tuned to substantially the same frequency (or
        harmonics thereof) can be arranged in a skewed configuration
        (with the plates not directly facing each other and the axes of
        the coils skewed) and separated by several feet of separation
        and still permit coupling of significant RF electromagnetic
        energy from head 1300a to head 1300b. </p>
      <p>[0094] Another exemplary head configuration is shown in FIGS.
        16-17, which shows exemplary head 1600 (as a transmission head
        and/or as a reception head). The head 1600 is similar in many
        ways to the head 1300 of FIGS. 13-14. Like head 1300, head 1600
        may have a plate of conductive material 1602 operatively coupled
        to a coil or other inductor 1604, an axis of which inductor 1604
        may extend generally perpendicular or substantially
        perpendicular with respect to a surface 1605 of the plate 1602.
        In such a configuration, the head 1300 may itself constitute or
        be components of a resonant circuit for transmission and/or
        reception of a hyperthermia-generating RF signal. Except as set
        forth below, all of the discussion above with respect to head
        1300 also applies to the head 1600. If the inductor 1604 is a
        coil, the coil 1604 may be formed using a core 1606, which may
        have an axis, e.g., a central axis 1607, that is generally or
        substantially perpendicular to surface 1605 of plate 1602.
        Unlike head 1300, in head 1600, the axis 1607 of inductor 1604
        is shown as being coaxial with a central point of the plate.
        Also note that the head 1600 has a coil 1604 that has more
        closely spaced coil windings than coil 1304 of head 1300, which
        permits coil 1604 to be shown as being shorter than coil 1304 in
        FIG. 13. As shown in FIG. 17, the head 1600 may have an
        associated electrical connector 1612 for being placed in circuit
        communication with either an RF generator (in the case of a
        transmission head) or a load (in the case of a reception head)
        with RF electromagnetic energy being coupled from transmission
        head 1300a to reception head 1300b. As discussed below, the
        plate 1602 may be electrically connected to the inductor 1604 at
        a point 1610. In the alternative, the plate 1602 may be
        electrically insulated from the inductor 1604, which may permit
        the plate to be configured differently from the inductor 1604,
        e.g., permit the plate 1602 to be grounded or tuned
        independently of the inductor 1604. Thus, the connector 1612 may
        be in circuit communication with the plate 1602 and/or the
        inductor 1604 and the plate 1602 and the inductor 1604 may each
        have an associated connector. As discussed below, the other end
        1614 of coil 1604 may be free or may be connected to a tuning
        circuit, e.g., a capacitor which may be a variable capacitor.
        Again, except as noted above, all of the discussion above with
        respect to head 1300 also applies to the head 1600. </p>
      <p>[0095] A pair of the exemplary heads 1600 of FIGS. 16-17 may be
        used as a transmission head 1600a and reception head 1300b pair,
        with the transmission head 1600a in circuit communication with
        an RF generator via connector 1612a and the reception head 1600b
        in circuit communication with a load via connector 1612b, with
        RF electromagnetic energy being coupled from transmission head
        1600a to reception head 1600b. In such a configuration, the head
        1600 may itself constitute or be components of a resonant
        circuit for transmission and/or reception of a
        hyperthermia-generating RF signal. Although a pair of heads 1600
        may be arranged similar to as shown in FIG. 15, with a pair of
        inductors side to side and plates facing each other, head 1600
        does not really lend itself to this configuration because
        inductor 1604 is significantly shorter than inductor 1304 and if
        put in this configuration, there would be a substantially
        smaller target area and significant portions of the opposite
        plates not directly facing each other. The head 1600 does lend
        itself to the configuration shown in FIG. 18 in which a pair of
        heads 1600a, 1600b are arranged in an "end-fired" configuration,
        i.e., the coils 1604a, 1604b are coaxial so that the ends of the
        coils are essentially aimed at each other. In the configuration
        of FIG. 18, the plates 1602a, 1602b face each other directly. RF
        electromagnetic energy is coupled from transmission head 1300a
        to reception head 1300b through an area 1800 between the heads
        1600a, 1600b as discussed in more detail below. The central axis
        of the coils 1604a, 1604b, e.g., the central axis of a
        cylindrical inductor core, may be directed toward the target
        area. </p>
      <p>[0096] FIG. 19 shows two heads 1600a, 1600b in the "end-fired"
        configuration of FIG. 18 with transmission head 1600a being in
        circuit communication with an RF generator via coaxial cable
        1900 connected to connector 1312a and the reception head 1300b
        being in circuit communication with a load via a coaxial cable
        1902 connected to connector 1312b, with RF electromagnetic
        energy being coupled from transmission head 1600a to reception
        head 1600b. A conductor 1904 within connector 1612a is in
        circuit communication with plate 1602a and coil 1604a.
        Similarly, a conductor 1906 within connector 1612b is in circuit
        communication with plate 1602b and coil 1604b. The shield layer
        of coaxial cables 1900, 1902 are grounded as shown schematically
        at 1910, 1912. It is believed that there is significant coupling
        of RF electromagnetic energy directly between the end-fired
        inductors 1604a, 1604b, as indicated schematically by the
        relatively closely spaced rays at 1920. It is also believed that
        there is additional coupling of RF electromagnetic energy
        between the plates 1602a, 1602b, although not at as significant
        a rate, as indicated schematically by the more widely spaced
        rays at 1930. Again, surprisingly, a pair of such heads 1600a,
        1600b tuned to substantially the same frequency (or harmonics
        thereof) can be arranged in a skewed configuration (with the
        plates not directly facing each other and the axes of the coils
        skewed) and separated by several feet of separation and still
        permit coupling of significant RF electromagnetic energy from
        head 1600a to head 1600b. </p>
      <p>[0097] FIG. 20 shows two heads 2000a, 2000b the same as the two
        heads 1600a, 1600b in the "end-fired" configuration of FIGS. 18
        and 19, except that the heads 2000a, 2000b have plates 2002a,
        2002b that are electrically insulated from inductors 2004a,
        2004b and are grounded. Thus, in the configuration of FIG. 20,
        the inductor 2004a is in circuit communication with an RF
        generator via coaxial cable 1900 connected to connector 2012a
        and inductor 2004b is in circuit communication with a load via a
        coaxial cable 1902 connected to connector 2012b, with RF
        electromagnetic energy being coupled from inductor 2004a to
        inductor 2004b. A conductor 2040 within connector 2012a is in
        circuit communication with 2004a. Similarly, a conductor 2042
        within connector 2012b is in circuit communication with coil
        2004b. The shield layer of coaxial cables 1900, 1902 are
        grounded as shown schematically at 1910, 1912. Additionally, in
        this configuration, the plates 2002a, 2002b are grounded as
        shown schematically at 2044, 2046. It is believed that there is
        significant coupling of RF electromagnetic energy directly
        between the end-fired inductors 2004a, 2004b, as indicated
        schematically by the relatively closely spaced rays at 2020. </p>
      <p>[0098] FIGS. 21A and 21B show schematically the end-fired coils
        1604a, 1604b, 2004a, 2004b shown in FIGS. 18-20 coupling
        electromagnetic radiation 1920, 2020 from coil 1604a, 2004a to
        coil 1604b, 2004b. In FIG. 21A, the distal ends 1614a, 1614b,
        2014a, 2014b of coils 1604a, 2004a, 1604b, 2004b are shown as
        being free. In the alternative, either or both of the distal
        ends 1614a, 2014a, 1614b, 2014b may be connected to active or
        passive circuitry to assist in coupling electromagnetic
        radiation 1920, 2020 from coil 1604a, 2004a to coil 1604b,
        2004b, whether there is an associated plate 1602, 2002 or not.
        For example, either or both of the distal ends 1614a, 2014a,
        1614b, 2014b of coils 1604a, 2004a, 1604b, 2004b may be in
        circuit communication with parallel capacitors C1, C2 as shown
        in FIG. 21B to assist in coupling electromagnetic radiation from
        coil to coil. Similarly, FIGS. 22A and 22B show schematically
        the side to side coils 1304a, 1304b shown in FIG. 15 coupling
        electromagnetic radiation 2200 from coil 1304a to coil 1304b. In
        FIG. 22A, the distal ends 1314a, 1314b of coils 1304a, 1304b are
        shown as being free. In the alternative, either or both of the
        distal ends 1614a, 1614b may be connected to active or passive
        circuitry to assist in coupling electromagnetic radiation 2200
        from coil 1304a to coil 1304b, whether there is an associated
        plate 1302 or not. For example, either or both of the distal
        ends 1314a, 1314b, of coils 1604a, 1604b may be in circuit
        communication with parallel capacitors C3, C4 as shown in FIG.
        22B to assist in coupling electromagnetic radiation from coil to
        coil. Side to side coils 1304a, 1304b without corresponding
        plates may be placed in a grounded cage, e.g., a Faraday cage
        such as a grounded bronze screen box, to prevent re-radiation
        away from each other, such as re-radiation along their central
        axes. The use of ungrounded plates in circuit communication with
        coils (e.g., FIGS. 13-19) tends to confine the RF energy between
        the plates, which might avoid the need for a Faraday shield. For
        example, for a pair of the exemplary heads described above
        (13.56 MHz; plates formed as an approximately circular shaped
        disk of flat copper that is about ten (10) inches thick
        electrically connected to a coil formed from about six (6) turns
        of 22 or 24 gauge wire would around a 1-inch hollow air core
        with the windings extending about three (3) inches from the
        surface of the plate) arranged in the configuration of FIG. 18
        and tuned to the frequency being transmitted, with the plates
        spaced about 6'' apart, transmitted RF seems to stay
        substantially within the confines of the plates using a neon
        bulb, as basic testing has indicated. </p>
      <p>[0099] Any of the foregoing heads may be used for transmission
        and/or reception of a hyperthermia-generating RF signal. </p>
      <p>[0100] FIG. 23 shows an exemplary RF generator 2300 in circuit
        communication with a transmission head 2302 coupling
        hyperthermia generating RF energy to a reception head 2304
        through a target area 2306. The spacing between the transmission
        head 2302 and the reception head 2304 preferably, but not
        necessarily, may be adjusted to accommodate targets of different
        sizes. The transmission head 2302 and/or the reception head 2304
        may have circuitry to accommodate differences in impedance
        between the transmission head 2302 and the reception head 2304
        caused, e.g., by differences in spacing between the heads 2302,
        2304 and/or different targets. Such circuitry may include
        automatic antenna matching circuitry and/or manually adjustable
        variable components for antenna matching, e.g., high-voltage,
        high-power RF variable capacitors. The reception head 2304 may
        be in circuit communication with a load 2308, which may be as
        simple as a non-inductive resistive load (e.g., a grounded power
        resistor) providing a path for coupled RF energy to dissipate.
        The transmission head 2302 and the reception head 2304 may each
        be in any of the various head configurations shown and/or
        described herein. The transmission head 2302 and/or the
        reception head 2304 may have an associated power meter, which
        may be used as feedback to adjust any manually adjustable
        variable components for antenna matching until a substantial
        amount of power being transmitted by transmission head 2302 is
        being received by the reception head 2304. In general, such
        power meters may be separate or integral with the RF generator,
        and/or the RF receiver, and/or the combined RF
        generator/receiver. If separate power meters are used, they may
        be located remotely with the transmission head 2302 and the
        reception head 2304 to facilitate contemporaneous adjustment and
        tuning of the transmission head 2302 and the reception head
        2304. </p>
      <p>[0101] The exemplary RF generator 2300 of FIG. 23 comprises a
        crystal oscillator 2320 that generates a signal 2322 at a power
        level of about 0.1 Watts at a selectable frequency to a
        preamplifier 2324. The signal 2322 may be modified before the
        preamplifier 2324 to have a variable duty cycle, e.g., to
        provide a pulsed RF signal at a variable duty cycle. As
        discussed above, it may be beneficial to use a frequency
        modulated (FM) RF signal to create hyperthermia with certain
        energy absorption enhancer particles. Accordingly, in addition,
        or in the alternative, signal 2322 may be modified before the
        preamplifier 2324 to be an FM signal. For example, pre-amp 2324
        may be replaced with an amplifying FM exciter to modulate the
        signal 2322 with a selected modulation frequency and amplify the
        signal as pre-amp 2324. The parameters of the FM RF signal used
        to generate hyperthermia may be selected to correspond to the
        specific sample of particles being used as energy absorption
        enhancer particles. The center frequency of an FM hyperthermia
        generating RF signal may correspond to a resonant frequency of
        nominally sized particles used as energy absorption enhancer
        particles and the modulation of the FM hyperthermia generating
        RF signal may correspond to the size tolerance of the particles
        used as energy absorption enhancer particles, as discussed
        above. </p>
      <p>[0102] The preamplifier 2324 amplifies the RF signal 2322 (or
        the modified signal 2322) and generates a signal 2326 at a power
        level of about 10 Watts to an intermediate power amplifier 2328.
        The intermediate power amplifier 2328 amplifies the RF signal
        2326 and generates an RF signal 2330 at a power level of about
        100 Watts to a power amplifier 2332. The power amplifier 2332
        amplifies the RF signal 2330 and generates a selectable power RF
        signal 2334 at a selectable power level of 0.00 Watts to about
        1000 Watts to the transmission head 2302. A power meter may be
        placed in circuit communication between the power amplifier 2332
        and the transmission head 2302 to measure the RF power to the
        transmission head 2302. Similarly, a power meter may be placed
        in circuit communication between the reception head 2304 and the
        load 2306 to measure the RF power from the reception head 2304.
        The preamplifier 2324 may be a hybrid preamplifier. The
        intermediate power amplifier 2328 may be a solid state Class C
        intermediate power amplifier. The power amplifier 2332 may be a
        zero-bias grounding grid triode power amplifier, which are
        relatively unaffected by changes in output impedance, e.g., a
        3CX15000A7 power amplifier. </p>
      <p>[0103] The exemplary RF generator 2300 shown generates a
        high-power fixed-frequency hyperthermia generating RF signal at
        an adjustable power range of 0.00 Watts to about 1000 Watts. The
        exemplary RF generator 2300 shown may be modified to generate
        high-power fixed-frequency hyperthermia generating RF signals at
        selected frequencies or at an adjustable frequency, any of which
        may be pulsed or FM modulated. For example, a plurality of
        separate crystals, preamplifiers, and IPAs, each at a different
        frequency, e.g., 13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz, 40.68 MHz, 54.24 MHz,
        67.80 MHz, and 81.36 MHz (not shown) may be switchably connected
        to the power amplifier 2332 for generation of a high-power
        hyperthermia generating signal at a frequency selected from a
        plurality of frequencies. </p>
      <p>[0104] While the present invention has been illustrated by the
        description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments
        have been described in some detail, it is not the intention of
        the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the
        appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and
        modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art.
        For example, any of the transmitter circuits and/or transceiver
        circuits described herein can be used with virtually any of the
        RF absorption enhancers (general and/or targeted), described
        herein, or with any combination or permutation thereof, or
        without any RF absorption enhancer. As another example, the RF
        signal (single frequency or FM modulated) may be modulated with
        another signal, such as, for example, a square wave (e.g. a
        300-400 Hz square wave). Modulating the RF signal with a square
        wave may stimulate the tissue and enhance heating; square waves
        introduce harmonics that may enhance modulation utilized; and
        square waves may also be used to pulse the transmitted signal to
        change the average duty cycle. Another example includes total
        body induced hyperthermia to treat the patient's entire body. In
        this example, the transmission and reception heads are as large
        as the patient and hyperthermia is induced in the entire body.
        Cooling the blood may be required to prevent overheating and can
        be accomplished in any manner. Additionally, the steps of
        methods herein may generally be performed in any order, unless
        the context dictates that specific steps be performed in a
        specific order. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects
        is not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus
        and methods, and illustrative examples shown and described.
        Accordingly, departures may be made from such details without
        departing from the spirit or scope of the applicant's general
        inventive concept. </p>

      <p>The Kanzius cancer-treating concept has taken a major stride,
        thanks to successful results from a significant test. </p>
      <p>Researchers found that an external radio-frequency device can
        destroy specific cancer cells that have been tagged with tiny
        pieces of gold, or nanoparticles. </p>
      <p>John Kanzius, a retired Erie radio engineer, invented the
        device, and Steven Curley, M.D., serves as principal
        investigator for the Kanzius Project at M.D. Anderson Cancer
        Center in Houston. </p>
      <p>Research demonstrating that specific cancer cells could be
        targeted with nanoparticles were published online in the Journal
        of Experimental Therapeutics on Friday. The research has
        generated new excitement about the Kanzius invention. </p>
      <p>"It proves that this has the potential to work, and it makes
        sense for us to continue pushing," Curley says. </p>
      <p>At this juncture in the research, we echo Curley. Keep pushing
        on the scientific and research fronts. </p>
      <p>Keep pushing for additional donations to the Kanzius Cancer
        Research Foundation. Research costs money, and the resources
        must be available to keep this project moving ahead through the
        government regulatory process. </p>
      <p>Keep pushing Gov. Ed Rendell, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, U.S. Sen.
        Arlen Specter and soon-to-be U.S. Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper to keep
        the lines of communication open with the Kanzius Foundation and
        the Kanzius Project to see how state and federal government can
        assist. </p>
      <p>Keep pushing to determine what role Erie companies can play in
        the manufacture of the Kanzius invention. </p>
      <p>With each new breakthrough on this project, we witness two
        reactions. There are the positive responses articulated by
        Curley, Kanzius and the many people touched by cancer, who are
        optimistic (yet realistic) that this project will be successful
        in human trials. </p>
      <p>Then there are the negative responses by some who suspect that
        competing interests will stomp out the gains of cancer
        researchers affiliated with Kanzius. </p>
      <p>One benefit from journal publication of the cancer-targeting
        tests is the new publicity about Kanzius, his invention and the
        high regard he has gained in the legitimate scientific
        community. Ordinary people -- those who have fought cancer and
        those who fear it -- can understand the basic concepts of the
        Kanzius treatment. They are unlikely to let a plausible cancer
        treatment slip from public sight. </p>
      <p>In the new scientific study, researchers attached specific
        antibodies, or proteins, to the nanoparticles, and placed the
        treated nanoparticles and live cancer cells in a specimen dish.
        Radio waves blasted the tagged cancer cells for two minutes.
        Nearly 100 percent of the pancreatic and colorectal cells were
        killed; hardly any of the control group's cells were destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>"It shows that we can target specific types of cancer. We're
        now working on other types of cancer cells, including breast,
        prostate, leukemia and ovarian," Curley said. </p>
      <p>Curley has much more work ahead, including writing six to eight
        additional scientific manuscripts in 2009. Approval from the
        Food and Drug Administration for human trials could follow in
        late 2010, with Erie eventually involved in Phase II trials at
        the Regional Cancer Center in Erie. <br>
        Would we like to see cancer cured today or tomorrow? Absolutely.
        Are we confident that the Kanzius Project is speeding in the
        right direction? No doubt.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Hydrogen gas is combustible and is therefore a potentially
      viable fuel source particularly for use in internal combustion
      engines. Water can be a source of hydrogen gas and unlike crude
      oil, which is used to produce gasoline, water and particularly
      seawater has an advantage over crude oil in that it is present on
      earth in great abundance. Furthermore, the burning of hydrogen
      produces water, an environmentally clean byproduct. Many other
      volatile organic compounds, such as ethanol for example, are also
      combustible and so they too are potentially viable fuel sources
      for use in internal combustion engines. Likewise, ethanol has an
      advantage over crude oil in that ethanol can be synthesized from
      fermentation of com, sugar cane or other agricultural products and
      it is therefore a renewable resource, while by contrast crude oil
      is not.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0017] Systems are presented for using RF energy to combust salt
      water and/or various solutions containing salt water, to produce
      hydrogen from salt water, to produce volatiles from solutions
      containing salt water, to desalinate seawater, and/or to carry out
      the electrolysis of water. An exemplary system may comprise a
      reservoir for containing salt water that is a mixture comprising
      water and salt, the salt water having an effective amount of salt
      dissolved in the water; a reaction chamber having an inlet and an
      outlet; a feed line operatively connecting the reservoir to the
      inlet of the reaction chamber; an RF transmitter having an RF
      generator in circuit communication with a transmission head, the
      RF generator capable of generating an RF signal at least partially
      absorbable by the salt water having at least one frequency for
      transmission via the transmission head; and an RF receiver;
      wherein the reaction chamber is positioned such that at least a
      portion of the reaction chamber is between the RF transmission
      head and the RF receiver. Other exemplary systems may comprise a
      reservoir for containing a solution that is a mixture of water and
      salt and optionally containing (i) at least one additive, or (ii)
      at least one secondary fuel, or (iii) mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Similarly, methods are presented for using RF energy to
      combust salt water and solutions containing salt water, to
      desalinate seawater, to produce hydrogen from salt water and
      solutions containing salt water, and/or to carry out the
      electrolysis of salt water. An exemplary method may comprise
      providing salt water comprising a mixture of water and at least
      one salt; or a salt water solution comprising a mixture of water
      and at least one salt and optionally containing (i) at least one
      additive, or (ii) at least one secondary fuel, or (iii) mixtures
      thereof; the salt water or salt water solution having an effective
      amount of the salt dissolved in the water; providing an RF
      transmitter having an RF generator in circuit communication with a
      transmission head, the RF generator capable of generating an RF
      signal at least partially absorbable by the salt water or salt
      water component of the solution containing salt water and having
      at least one frequency for transmission via the transmission head;
      arranging the transmission head near the salt water or solution
      containing salt water such that the RF signal transmitted via the
      transmission head interacts with at least some of the salt water;
      and transmitting the RF signal via the transmission head for a
      time sufficient to combust the salt water or to heat the solution
      containing salt water to volatilize and to combust a secondary
      fuel source that may be optionally present. If hydrogen gas is
      created from the salt water or the solution containing salt water
      by the RF signal, the RF signal may also be transmitted via the
      transmission head sufficient to combust the hydrogen gas so
      produced.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0019] In the accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and
      constitute a part of the specification, exemplary embodiments of
      the invention are illustrated, which, together with a general
      description of the invention given above, and the detailed
      description given below, serve to example principles of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">General Terms</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] "Additive" as used herein is a chemical compound having
      solubility, miscibility, or compatibility with various solutions
      of salt water (including sea water, salt water, or solutions
      containing salt water and optionally containing at least one
      secondary fuel) that furthermore is capable of altering the
      responsiveness of the various solutions of salt water to
      stimulation by RF energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] "Circuit communication" as used herein is used to indicate
      a communicative relationship between devices. Direct electrical,
      optical, and electromagnetic connections and indirect electrical,
      optical, and electromagnetic connections are examples of circuit
      communication. Two devices are in circuit communication if a
      signal from one is received by the other, regardless of whether
      the signal is modified by some other device. For example, two
      devices separated by one or more of the following - transformers,
      optoisolators, digital or analog buffers, analog integrators,
      other electronic circuitry, fiber optic transceivers, or even
      satellites - are in circuit communication if a signal from one
      reaches the other, even though the signal is modified by the
      intermediate device(s). As a final example, two devices not
      directly connected to each other (e.g. keyboard and memory), but
      both capable of interfacing with a third device, (e.g., a CPU),
      are in circuit communication.<br>
      <br>
      [0022 ] "Combustion" as used herein indicates a process that
      rapidly produces heat and light (perhaps caused by a rapid
      chemical change and with or without "burning" or "oxidation" in
      the classic sense). Salt water and solutions containing salt water
      respond to RF energy in many of the various systems and methods
      taught herein with rapid heating and rapid generation of light,
      which may be visible, UV, TR, etc. This is considered "combustion"
      herein, even though it may or may not be "burning" in the classic
      sense. "Combustion" herein also is used to indicate more typical
      incendiary "combustion," i.e., the process of burning in which a
      rapid chemical change occurs that produces heat and light, which
      includes burning in the classical sense of the products produced
      from salt water reacting with RF. For example, when hydrogen is
      combusted or burned in air the hydrogen is chemically oxidized
      into water and undergoes such a rapid reaction that a flame is
      produced and the water is discharged in the form of steam.<br>
      <br>
      [0023 ] "Desalinate" as used herein is used to indicate the
      process of removing salt and other chemicals from water. For
      example, when desalination of seawater is carried out through
      heating, e.g., boiling, steam is produced and collected. When the
      collected steam is subsequently condensed back into a liquid, pure
      water is obtained free of any salt or minerals. "Electrolysis" as
      used herein is used to indicate the process of applying energy to
      water in order to decompose the water into its constituent
      elements hydrogen and oxygen. Energy can be applied in the form of
      either electrical energy, as for example in the application of an
      electric current, or in the form of heat energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] "Operatively connected" or "operatively connecting" as used
      herein is used to indicate that a functional connection (e.g., a
      mechanical or physical connection or an electrical or optical or
      electromagnetic or magnetic connection) exists between the
      components of a system. [0025] "Salt water" as used herein is used
      to indicate a mixture comprising water and salt, the salt water
      having an effective amount of salt dissolved in the water.
      "Solution containing salt water" and "salt water solutions" are
      used interchangeably and as used herein indicate a mixture
      comprising salt water and optionally containing one or more of the
      following: (i) at least one additive, (ii) at least one secondary
      fuel, or (iii) mixtures of both. Hence, a solution containing salt
      water may comprise only salt water. "Salt water mixture" as used
      herein is used to indicate a mixture containing salt water that is
      used in conducting electrolysis with the various systems and
      methods taught herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] "Secondary fuel" as used herein is used to indicate
      combustible organic compounds that can be made volatile and that
      have solubility, miscibility, or compatibility with various salt
      water solutions (including salt water, sea water, or salt water
      solutions containing salt water and optionally containing at least
      one additive). As used herein, a secondary fuel may be the only
      substance that is combusting; thus, use of the term secondary fuel
      does not necessary require that there is a primary fuel also
      combusting. Salt and salt solutions may be used to increase the
      combustion of secondary fuels without the salt or salt solution
      also combusting.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Systems</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0027] Referring to the drawings and to Figures 1-16A, various
      different views of exemplary systems and system components are
      shown. It is believed that these systems and components may be
      used with virtually all the various RF absorption enhancers and
      virtually all the various methods discussed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The exemplary systems of Figures 1-4 include an RF
      generator 102 in circuit communication with a transmission head
      104 for transmitting through a reaction chamber 106 an RF signal
      108 generated by the RF generator 102 and transmitted by the
      transmitter head 104. The reaction chamber 106 may be open or
      closed, depending on the specific application. The reaction
      chamber may be, for example, a vessel or a cylinder with an
      associated piston.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 [0029] Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a first
      exemplary embodiment of an RF system 100 that uses an RF signal
      108 to process solutions containing salt water 110 in the reaction
      chamber 106. For example, the RF signal 108 may combust the
      solution containing salt water 110. As another example, the RF
      signal 108 may heat the solution containing salt water 110 for
      further processing, e.g., steam collection and condensing to
      desalinate a solution containing salt water 110. As yet another
      example, the RF signal 108 may produce hydrogen from the solution
      containing salt water 110 or the RF signal may heat the solution
      containing salt water and volatilize any secondary fuel that may
      be optionally contained in the solution. The hydrogen produced as
      well as any volatilized secondary fuel optionally present may be
      collected as a gas and stored for various uses, e.g., stored for
      use as a fuel. Alternative, the hydrogen or any volatilized
      secondary fuel or both may be combusted in the reaction chamber
      106. Exemplary system 100 comprises an RF generator 102 in circuit
      communication with a transmission head 104. A reaction chamber 106
      is positioned such that at least a portion of the reaction chamber
      106 is RF coupled to the transmission head 104. hi exemplary
      system 100, the RF generator 102 communicates an RF signal for
      transmission to the transmission head 104. The RF signal 108
      transmitted by the transmission head 104 passes through at least a
      portion of the reaction chamber 106. A solution containing salt
      water (and also a solution optionally containing (i) at least one
      additive, (ii) at least one secondary fuel, or (iii) mixtures
      thereof) 1 10 contained within the reaction chamber 106 is
      positioned such that the solution containing salt water 1 10 (and
      in particular the salt water component of the solution) absorbs at
      least some of the RF signal 108. Optionally, the RF generator 102
      may be controlled adjusting the frequency and/or power and/or
      envelope, etc. of the generated RF signal and/or may have a mode
      in which an RF signal at a predetermined frequency and power are
      transmitted via transmission head 104. In addition, optionally,
      the RF generator 102 provides an RF signal 108 with variable
      amplitudes, pulsed amplitudes, multiple frequencies, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The solution containing salt water 110 absorbs energy as
      the RF signal 108 travels through the reaction chamber 106. The
      more energy that is absorbed by the salt water component of the
      solution containing salt water 110 the higher the temperature
      increase in the area which leads to water decomposition and
      hydrogen production, and in instances where the solution
      containing salt water 1 10 also contains a secondary fuel, this
      may also lead to volatization and to combustion of the secondary
      fuel instead of or in addition to decomposition of the salt water
      and hydrogen production. As even more energy is absorbed by the
      salt water component of the solution containing salt water 110,
      combustion of the hydrogen that is being produced eventually
      occurs. The rate of energy absorption by the solution containing
      salt water 110 can be increased by increasing the RF signal 108
      strength, which increases the amount of energy traveling through
      the reaction chamber 106. Other means of increasing the rate of
      energy absorption may include but are not limited to concentrating
      the signal on a localized area of the solution containing salt
      water 110, or further mixing with the solution containing salt
      water at least one additive that is appropriately selected from
      various chemical species to be capable of altering the rate of
      energy absorption of the solution containing salt water 1 10 and
      as a result may be able to increase the rate of energy absorption
      by the solution containing salt water 1 10. Examples of additives
      that it is believed may be useful in this regard include
      surfactants, chemical species that form azeotropic mixtures with
      water, and chemical species that alter the freezing point of
      water.<br>

      [0031] As shown in Figures 2-4, exemplary systems may also include
      a receiver head 1 12 and an associated current path 1 14 to permit
      the RF signal 108 to be coupled through the reaction chamber 106.
      The systems 200, 300, 400 also use an RF signal 108 to process
      solutions 110 in the reaction chamber 106. For example, the RF
      signal 108 may combust the solution containing salt water 110. As
      another example, the RF signal 108 may heat the salt water
      component of the solution containing salt water 110 in preparation
      for further processing (e.g.: in instances where the solution
      containing salt water 110 is salt water alone, steam collection
      and condensing to desalinate the salt water; in instances where
      the solution containing salt water contains a secondary fuel, the
      volatization of the secondary fuel). As yet another example, the
      RF signal 108 may produce hydrogen from or may volatilize a
      secondary fuel contained within the solution containing salt water
      110 and the hydrogen or the volatilized secondary fuel or both may
      be collected as a gas and stored for various uses, e.g., stored
      for use as a fuel. In the alternative, the hydrogen produced or
      the volatilized secondary fuel or both may be combusted in the
      reaction chamber 106. [0032 ] Referring to Figure 2, the exemplary
      system 200 has a transmission head 104 and receiver head 112
      arranged proximate to and on either side at least a portion of the
      reaction chamber 106. This allows at least a portion of the
      solution containing salt water 110 in the reaction chamber 106 to
      be exposed to the RF signal 108 transmitted by the transmission
      head 104. Some portion of the RF system may be tuned so that the
      receiver head 1 12 receives at least a portion of the RF signal
      108 transmitted via the transmission head 104. As a result, the
      receiver head 112 receives the RF signal 108 that is transmitted
      via the transmission head 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0033 ] The heads 104, 112 may each or both have associated tuning
      circuitry such as pi- networks or tunable pi-networks, to increase
      throughput and generate a voltage in the area of the reaction
      chamber 106 and in the solution containing salt water salt 110
      contained within. Thus, as shown in Figure 3, the transmission
      head 104 may have an associated tuning circuit 1 16 in circuit
      communication between the RF generator 102 and the transmission
      head 104. Additionally, or in the alternative, as shown in Figure
      3, the current path 114 may comprise the receiver head 112 being
      grounded.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Referring to Figure 3, the transmission head 104 and
      receiver head 112 may be insulated from direct contact with the
      reaction chamber 106. The transmission head 104 and receiver head
      112 may be insulated by means of an air gap 118. An optional means
      of insulating the transmission head 104 and receiver head 1 12
      from the reaction chamber 106 is shown in Figure 4. The exemplary
      system 400 includes inserting an insulating layer or material 410
      such as, for example, Teflon&lt;(R)&gt; between the heads 104, 112
      and the reaction chamber 106. Other optional means include
      providing an insulation area on the heads 104, 1 12, and allowing
      the heads to be put in direct contact with the reaction chamber
      106. The transmission head 104 and the receiver head 1 12,
      described in more detail below, may include one or more plates of
      electrically conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] One optional method of inducing a higher temperature in the
      solution containing salt water 110 includes using a receiver head
      112 that is larger than the transmission head 104 (although it was
      earlier believed that a smaller head would concentrate the RF to
      enhance RF heating, a larger reception head was found to generate
      a higher temperature, perhaps because of the use of a high-Q
      resonant circuit described in more detail below). For example, a
      single 6" circular copper plate may be used on the Tx side and a
      single square 9.5" copper plate may be used on the Rx side.
      Optionally, an RP absorption enhancer may be added to the solution
      containing salt water 110. An RF absorption enhancer is any means
      or method of increasing the tendency of the solution containing
      salt water 110 to absorb more energy from the RF signal that the
      salt water component of the solution containing salt water would
      otherwise absorb. Suitable RF absorption enhancers include, for
      example, suspended particles of electrically conductive material,
      such as metals, e.g., iron, various combination of metals, e.g.,
      iron and other metals, or magnetic particles. The many types of RF
      absorption enhancers are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The RF generator 102 may be any suitable RF signal
      generator, generating an RF signal at any one or more of the RF
      frequencies or frequency ranges discussed herein. The RF signal
      108 generated by the RF generator 102 and transmitted by the
      transmission head 104 may have a fundamental frequency in the HF
      range or the VHF range or an RF signal at some other fundamental
      frequency. The RF signal 108 may be a signal having one or more
      fundamental frequencies in the range(s) of 1-2 MHz, and/or 2-3
      MHz, and/or 3-4 MHz, and/or 4-5 MHz, and/or 5-6 MHz, and/or 6-7
      MHz, and/or 7-8 MHz, and/or 8-9 MHz, and/or 9-10 MHz, and/or 10-1
      1 MHz, and/or 11-12 MHz, or 12-13 MHz, or 13-14 MHz, or 14-15 MHz.
      The RF signal 108 may have a fundamental frequency at 13.56 MHz.
      The RF generator 102 may be an ENI Model No. OEM-12B (Part No.
      OEM-12B-07) RF generator, which is marked with U.S. Pat. No.
      5,323,329 and is known to be used to generate a 13.56 MHz RF
      signal for etching systems. Among other things, the ENI OEM-12B RF
      generator has an RF power on/off switch to switch a high-power
      (0-1250 Watt) RF signal, has an RF power output adjust to adjust
      the power of the signal generated, and has an RF power meter to
      measure the power of the RF signal being generated that can be
      switched to select either forward or reverse power metering. The
      power meter in reverse mode can be used to calibrate a tuning
      circuit, as explained above, by adjusting any variable components
      of the tuning circuit until minimum power is reflected back to the
      power meter (minimum VSWR). The ENI OEM-12B RF generator may be
      cooled by a Thermo Neslab Merlin Series M33 recirculating process
      chiller. A at 13.56 MHz RF signal from the ENI OEM-12B RF
      generator having a power of about 800-1000 Watts will combust salt
      water. In the alternative, the RF generator may be a commercial
      transmitter, e.g., the transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
      FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver. An RF signal can be generated at
      about 13.56 MHz (one of the FCC-authorized frequencies for ISM
      equipment) by the transmitter portion of a YAESU brand FT-1000MP
      Mark-V transceiver by clipping certain blocking components as
      known to those skilled in the art. The RF generator and
      transmission head may have associated antenna tuner circuitry (not
      shown) in circuit communication therewith or integral therewith,
      e.g., automatic or manual antenna tuner circuitry, to adjust to
      the impedance of transmission head and the reaction chamber (and a
      receiver, if any). The transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
      FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver has such integral antenna tuner
      circuitry (pressing a "Tune" button causes the unit to
      automatically adjust to the load presented to the RF generator
      portion). The RF generator and transmission head may have
      associated antenna tuner circuitry (not shown) in circuit
      communication therewith or integral therewith, e.g., automatic or
      manual antenna tuner circuitry, to adjust to the combined
      impedance of the reaction chamber and the receiver and compensate
      for changes therein. The transmitter portion of a YAESU brand
      FT-1000MP Mark-V transceiver has such integral antenna tuner
      circuitry. Various configurations for the transmission head and
      reception head are possible, as exemplified herein.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figures 5-6</span><br>

      <br>
      [0037 ] The transmission head 104 may be any of a number of
      different transmitter head configurations, such as an electrically
      conductive plate having a coaxial coil in circuit communication
      therewith. In the alternative, as exemplified by Figure 5, the
      transmission head 104 may comprise (or consist of) an electrically
      conductive plate 502 (e.g., a 6" diameter, flat, planar plate made
      of 0.020" stainless steel) without a corresponding coil. The
      transmission plate 502 may be circular and may be sized depending
      on the size of the target area and the desired voltage field
      generated by the plate. Similarly, as exemplified by Figure 6, the
      receiver head 112 may comprise (or consist of) an electrically
      conductive plate 602 {e.g., a 6" diameter, flat, planar plate made
      of 0.020" stainless steel) without a corresponding coil. The
      reception plate 602 may be circular and may be sized depending on
      the size of the target area and the desired voltage field
      generated by the plate. The reception plate 602 may be sized
      substantially smaller or substantially larger than the
      transmission plate 502 to change the field generated in the
      reaction chamber 106 by the coupled RF signal 108. In the
      alternative, either the reception plate 602 or the transmission
      plate 502 (which includes both of them) may be parabolic plates
      with their convex side facing the target area (not shown). The
      plates may be made of copper (e.g., 0.090" copper plate) instead
      of stainless steel.<br>

      [0038] In the alternative, the transmission head 104 or receiver
      head 112 may each or both be comprised of a series of spaced,
      stacked electrically conductive plates. The spaced, stacked
      electrically conductive plates may be coaxial, circular plates and
      may have sequentially decreasing diameters. Figure 7 shows an
      exemplary system 700 wherein the receiver head 112 comprising
      spaced, stacked, electrically conductive, coaxial, and circular
      plates that have sequentially decreasing diameters. The plates of
      exemplary receiver head 800 may be constructed as described in
      Figures 8A-8C (e.g., sized as shown with an Aluminum base) and may
      be insulated from each other as described in Figures 8A-8C. The
      plates may be made of copper (e.g., 0.090" copper plate) instead
      of stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Similarly, the transmission head 104 may comprise a series
      of spaced, stacked electrically conductive plates. The spaced,
      stacked electrically conductive plates may be coaxial, circular
      plates and may have sequentially decreasing diameters. Figures
      9A-9C show an exemplary transmission head 900 comprising spaced,
      stacked, electrically conductive, coaxial, and circular plates
      that have sequentially decreasing diameters. The plates of
      exemplary transmission head 900 may be constructed as described in
      Figures 9A- 9C (e.g., sized as shown with a Teflon base) and may
      be insulated from each other as described in Figures 9A-9C. In the
      alternative, plates of exemplary receiver head 800 and/or the
      plates of exemplary transmission head 900 may be in circuit
      communication with each other, e.g., directly electrically coupled
      in their spaced configuration with electrically conductive
      fasteners. The plates may be made of copper (e.g., 0.090" copper
      plate) instead of stainless steel. A transmission head 900 with
      electrically insulated plates may be used with a receiver head 800
      with electrically connected plates, and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 10-16 [0040] The tuning circuit 116 may be in circuit
      communication between the RF generator 102 and the transmission
      head 104 and may comprise and pi-network or a tunable pi- network.
      An exemplary tuning circuit 1000 is shown in Figure 10 formed with
      components listed in that figure. Exemplary component values for
      Figures 10- 16a are shown in Table I. Tuning circuit 1000 may be
      connected between an RF generator 102 and a transmission head 104.
      Thus, as shown in Figure 11 an exemplary system may include an ENI
      OEM-12B RF generator in circuit communication with exemplary
      tuning circuit 1000, which is in circuit communication with
      exemplary transmission head 900 to generate an RF signal 108
      through the reaction chamber 106 by coupling the RF signal 108 to
      a receiver head 112. The receiver head 112 may be the same as
      exemplary receiver head 800, as shown in the exemplary system of
      Figure 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The exemplary implementation of the exemplary tuning
      circuit 1000 used in Figures 10-15 appears to show a voltage gain
      of about 15-to-l with respect to the voltage of the RF signal
      generated by the ENI RF generator. Thus exemplary tuning circuit
      1000 may be considered to be a voltage step up transformer.
      Voltages of the larger plate of the transmission head have been
      estimated to be in excess of 40,000 volts per inch. Accordingly,
      some or all of the transmission head and/or the receiving head may
      be sealed, enclosed in an enclosure, or otherwise encapsulated in
      an insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      [0042 ] Figures 13-15 show different views of an exemplary
      implementation of portions of the exemplary system of Figure 12.
      As shown in those figures, in implementing the exemplary tuning
      circuit 1000 used in Figures 10-12, the larger inductor L2 may be
      positioned with its longitudinal axis substantially coaxial with
      the central axis of plates of transmission head FPi, and the
      central axis of the small inductor Li may be substantially
      perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the larger inductor L2.
      Other components may be used to implement tuning circuit 1000
      instead of the exemplary components listed on Figures 10-12. For
      example, the smaller inductor Lj may be silver-coated or may be
      made of 12 turns of 5/16" copper tubing (or more turns of larger
      diameter copper tubing) for increased current carrying capacity
      (smaller inductor Li can get relatively hot in exemplary
      embodiments), and the capacitor Ci may be made from thirteen (13)
      100 pF capacitors instead of eleven (11) for a 1300 pF capacitor
      C1. As another example, the plates in the heads may be made of
      copper (e.g., made from 0.090" copper plate) instead of stainless
      steel. In the exemplary implementation shown in Figures 13-15, a
      region of the target area slightly closer to the transmission head
      (about 60/40 distance ratio) heats slightly more than dead center
      between the two heads. The grounded portion of the components of
      Figures 10-15 may be mounted to a copper sheet 1300 or other
      suitable conducting sheet, and the conducting stand of reception
      head FP2 may be mounted on a copper sheet 1500 or other suitable
      conducting sheet, as shown in Figure 15. The grounded plates 1300,
      1500 may be connected by one or more copper straps 1302.<br>
      <br>

      [0043] Figure 16 shows another exemplary system 1600 that is the
      same as system 1200 (shown in Figures 8A-8C, 9A-9C, 12-15 and as
      described above), except the transmission head FPi' has a single
      6" plate, the one 6" circular plate of transmission head FPi, and
      the three 6" and 4" and 3" plates of receiver head FP2 are made
      from 0.090" thick copper, capacitor Ci is 1300 pF instead of 1100
      pF, and the smaller inductor Li is silver-coated and made of 12
      turns of 5/16" copper tubing. Figure 16a shows another exemplary
      system 1600 that is the same as system 1600 except that the
      receiver head FP2' has a single 6" circular plate. The
      transmitting portion and the receiving portion may be enclosed in
      one or more suitable enclosures, e.g., enclosures 3502, 3504 in
      Figure 22. Open circuit voltage readings at the transmission head
      of exemplary physical embodiments have taken. Open circuit
      voltages of the RF field at 100 W of transmitted power have been
      measured with a broadband oscilloscope at about 6000 volts (e.g.,
      about 5800 V) peak-to-peak amplitude, which rises to about 22,000
      volts at 1000 W of transmitted power (Figure 16A in the
      configuration of Figures 13-15). Additionally, it is believed that
      in these exemplary systems the voltage and current are not in
      phase (e.g., out of phase by a certain phase angle). Additionally,
      perhaps improved RF heating efficiency and/or RF transmission
      efficiency may be realized by changing the phase relationship
      between the voltage and current to a predetermined phase angle or
      real-time determined (or optimal) phase angle. In addition, the Q
      of exemplary physical embodiments have been estimated using
      bandwidth (S9 or 3 dB point) in excess of 250 (e.g., 250-290)
      (Figure 16A in the configuration of Figures 13-15). As should be
      apparent, the RF heating using these exemplary embodiments is
      significantly different than inductive heating (even substantially
      different from inductive heating at similar frequencies).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As shown in Figure 22, the circuits may be mounted in two
      enclosures: a transmission enclosure 3502 and a reception
      enclosure 3504, with a reaction chamber 3506 there between.
      Exemplary transmission enclosure 3502 has grounded metallic walls
      3512 on all sides except the side 3513 facing the reception
      enclosure 3504 (only four such grounded walls 3512a-3512d of five
      such walls 3512 of exemplary transmission enclosure 3502 are
      shown; the top grounded wall has been removed). Similarly,
      exemplary reception enclosure 3504 has grounded metallic walls
      3514 on all sides except the side 3515 facing the transmission
      enclosure 3502 (only four such grounded walls 3514a-3514d of five
      such walls 3514 of exemplary reception enclosure 3504 are shown;
      the top grounded wall has been removed). The grounded walls 3512
      of transmission enclosure 3502 are in circuit communication with
      the grounded walls 3514 of reception enclosure 3504. Facing walls
      3513 and 3515 may be made from TEFLON or another suitable
      electrical insulator. Transmission enclosure 3502 and/or reception
      enclosure 3504 may be movably mounted to permit variable spacing
      between the transmission head and the reception head to
      accommodate create differently-sized reaction chambers 3506.
      Facing walls 3513 and 3515 may have associated openings (not
      shown) to which various racks and other structures can be
      connected to support a body part or other target structure between
      the transmission head and the reception head. Dispersive pads (not
      shown) may be provided for direct grounding of the target or
      capacitive grounding of the target structure, which grounding pads
      may be connected to the grounded walls 3512, 3514 (such direct or
      capacitive grounding pads may be help smaller target structures
      absorb relatively higher levels of RF and heat better). The
      transmission side components 3522 may be mounted inside exemplary
      transmission enclosure 3502 and the reception side components 3524
      may be mounted inside exemplary reception enclosure 3504.
      Exemplary transmission enclosure 3502 and reception enclosure 3504
      both may be cooled with temperature-sensing fans that turn on
      responsive to the heat inside the enclosures 3502, 3504 reaching a
      predetermined thermal level. Exemplary transmission enclosure 3502
      and reception enclosure 3504 also have a plurality of pass-
      through connectors, e.g., permitting the RF signal to pass from
      the RF signal generator into the exemplary transmission enclosure
      3502 (perhaps via a power meter) and permitting the received
      signal to pass outside exemplary reception enclosure 3504 to a
      power meter and back inside reception enclosure 3504. In this
      exemplary embodiment, the enclosures 3502, 3504 may be moved to
      vary the spacing between the distal, adjacent ends of the heads
      from about two inches to a foot or more apart. Various other
      embodiments may have different ranges of spacing between the
      distal, adjacent ends of the heads, e.g., from about 2" to about
      20" or more apart or from about 2" to about 40" or more apart.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Each such enclosure may have grounded (e.g., aluminum)
      walls with a grounded (e.g., copper) base plate, except for the
      walls proximate the transmission head FPi' and the reception head
      FP2., which may be made from an electrical insulator such as
      ceramic or TEFLON brand PTFE, e.g., TEFLON brand virgin grade
      electrical grade PTFE, or another insulator. The walls may be
      grounded to the copper plate using copper straps and, if a
      plurality of enclosures are used, the enclosures may have copper
      strap between then to ground the enclosures together. A long
      standard fluorescent light bulb can be used to confirm effective
      grounding (e.g., by turning on the RF signal and repeatedly
      placing the light bulb proximate the transmission head to
      illuminate the bulb and then moving the bulb to locations around
      the enclosure watching for the light bulb to cease illumination,
      which confirms acceptable grounding). The grounded walls may have
      a layer of electrical insulator on the inside thereof, such as
      ceramic or TEFLON brand PTFE, e.g., TEFLON brand virgin grade
      electrical grade PTFE, or another insulator.<br>

      [0046] The exemplary systems of Figures 12-16 are believed to
      generate a very high voltage field in the target area, which very
      high voltage field can be used to heat many different types of RF
      absorbing particles as part of RF absorption enhancers in
      connection with the various methods taught herein. For example,
      the exemplary systems of Figures 12- 16 are believed to be capable
      of heating and combusting salt water solutions in connection with
      the various methods taught herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Figure 24 illustrates an exemplary transmission arrangement
      2400 that is adapted for at least partial submersion in a liquid.
      The enclosure includes a sealed circuit housing 2405 in which is
      enclosed a tuning circuit 2420 and a transmission head 2425. The
      tuning circuit receives an RF signal from an RF generator 2410
      that may be enclosed in the enclosure as shown or located outside
      of the enclosure 2405. An insulated region 2430, e.g, an air
      pocket or pocket of another gas, is disposed between the
      transmission head 2425 and the enclosure 2405. The enclosure may
      also include a mounting means, such as a hook or loop 2450, that
      is used to mechanically couple the enclosure to a cable or other
      similar mechanism for lowering the enclosure into a hole or
      confined treatment area, e.g., with a winch or crane (not shown)
      or other means for mowering. If the RF generator 2410 is located
      outside the sealed enclosure 2405, an insulated electrical
      conductor (not shown) may be provided to place the circuit 2420 in
      circuit communication with the RF generator. During construction,
      air from the portion of the enclosure 2405 surrounding the
      coupling circuit may be evacuated and the enclosure 2405 filled
      with an inert gas, such as nitrogen or xenon and then sealed. The
      coupling circuit may be tunable or not (e.g., pre-tuned), and may
      be the same as any of the coupling circuits shown or described
      herein, with virtually any of the transmission heads shown herein.
      If the coupling circuit portion of the enclosure 2405 is filled
      with an inert gas, it is believed that much higher powered RF
      signals may be coupled using the various coupling circuits
      disclosed herein, e.g., Figures 13-15 or Figure 16a. In the
      alternative, if the coupling circuit portion of the enclosure 2405
      is filled with an inert gas, it is believed that significantly
      smaller coupling circuits may be used vis-a-vis the exemplary
      coupling circuit of Figures 13-15, because smaller components may
      be used (by increasing the voltage break down of the coupled
      components within the enclosure). If the coupling circuit is
      tunable, such tuning may be accomplished using remotely
      controllable tunable components, e.g., variable capacitors having
      stepper motors configured to change the value of the capacitor, or
      with remote cables to remotely mechanically change the value of
      the capacitor. Thus, a control unit remove from the enclosure (not
      shown) may be used to send electrical signals to tune the circuit
      to reduce or remove reflected power or a user may mechanically
      remotely tune the circuit to reduce or remove reflected power.
      Although a grounded reception head (not shown) may be used in this
      configuration (e.g., also mounted to the enclosure and configured
      to pe[pi]nit water to flow between the transmission and reception
      heads or between the insulated region and the reception head) it
      is believed that it may be possible to tune the circuit without a
      reception head per se, using the target water as a receiver and a
      current path (as a sort of grounded reception head).<br>

      Methods [0048] Solutions containing salt water and that optionally
      contain (i) at least one additive, or (ii) at least one secondary
      fuel, or (iii) mixtures thereof may be combusted using RF signals
      by passing a high-voltage RF signal through the solution
      containing salt water. In a general sense, the methods may be
      characterized by providing a solution containing salt water and
      that may optionally contain (i) at least one additive, or (ii) at
      least one secondary fuel, or (iii) mixtures thereof and passing an
      RF signal through the solution containing salt water to combust
      the solution containing salt water (Figure 23). Alternatively, in
      a general sense the methods may be characterized as methods for
      adding salt to enhance the heating of water or other liquids. Salt
      water has been combusted using an exemplary system that included a
      circuit implementation of the circuit of Figure 16 being used to
      transmit an RF signal through the salt water to combust the salt
      water. A solution of OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix having a
      specific gravity of about 1.026 g/cm&lt;3&gt; was used. A 13.56
      MHz RF signal from an ENI OEM-12B RF generator having a power of
      about 800-1000 Watts (e.g., about 900 Watts) was used to combust
      the salt water.<br>

      [0049] Figure 17 illustrates a high level exemplary methodology
      1700 for producing hydrogen from salt water or from solutions
      containing salt water.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The methodology begins at block 1702. At block 1704 the
      salt water is provided. The salt water comprises water and at
      least one salt wherein an effective amount of salt is dissolved in
      the water, hi certain embodiments salt is added to water or other
      liquids to enhance heating. Optionally, a solution containing salt
      water may be used that contains salt water and (i) at least one
      additive, or (ii) at least one secondary fuel, or (iii) mixtures
      thereof. The salt can be any type of useful salt which is water
      soluble. Several examples of useful salts are described in greater
      detail below. An effective amount of salt is the amount of salt
      necessary to absorb sufficient energy output from the RF signal
      such that salt water or a solution containing salt water undergoes
      decomposition to generate hydrogen. OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt
      Mix may be used to approximate the composition of naturally
      occurring seawater having an effective amount of salt, and that
      may be used further as either salt water or as the salt water
      component in a solution containing salt water that is used in the
      systems and methods discussed and shown herein. Such
      approximations of naturally occurring seawater may have a specific
      gravity of about 1.02 g/cm&lt;3&gt; to 1.03 g/cm&lt;3&gt;, e.g.,
      between about 1.020-1.024 or about 28-32 PPT, as read off of a
      hydrometer. As an approximation of naturally occurring seawater, a
      mixture of water with the above-identified sea salt having a
      specific gravity of about 1.026 g/cm&lt;3&gt; (as measured with a
      refractometer) was used in exemplary systems and methods. In the
      alternative, it is believed that actual seawater may be used in
      the systems and methods discussed and shown herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] It is contemplated that a reservoir of salt water or a
      solution containing salt water could be made beforehand and stored
      in a tank such that it would be available upon demand. For
      example, the storage tank could be connected to the reaction
      chamber by means of a feed tube. In this manner, a supply of the
      previously prepared salt water or solution could be pumped from
      the storage tank into the reaction chamber via the feed tube;
      wherein the feed tube has one end connected to the storage tank
      and the other end connected to an inlet present on the reaction
      chamber. Again, it is believed that ordinary sea water may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0052 ] At block 1706 an RF transmitter is provided. The RF
      transmitter may be any type of RF transmitter generating a
      suitable RF signal. RF transmitter may be a variable frequency RF
      transmitter. Optionally, the RF transmitter is also
      multi-frequency transmitter capable of providing multiple-
      frequency RF signals. Optionally the RF transmitter is capable of
      transmitting RF signals with variable amplitudes or pulsed
      amplitudes. One or more of a variety of different shapes and sizes
      of transmission and reception heads may be provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0053 ] The transmission head may be selected at block 1708. The
      selection of the transmission head may be based in part on the
      type of RF transmitter provided. Other factors, such as, for
      example, the depth, size and shape of the general target area, or
      specific target area to be treated, and the number of frequencies
      transmitted may also be used in determining the selection of the
      transmission head.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The RF receiver is provided at block 1710. The RF receiver
      may be tuned to the frequency(s) of the RF transmitter. At block
      1712, the desired receiver head may be selected. Similarly to the
      selection of the transmission head, the receiver head may be
      selected to fit the desired characteristics of the particular
      application. For example, a receiver head that is larger than the
      transmission head can be selected to concentrate the RF signal on
      a specific area in the reaction chamber (although it was earlier
      believed that a smaller head would concentrate the RF to enhance
      RF heating, a larger reception head was found to generate a higher
      temperature). For example, a single 6" circular copper plate may
      be used on the Tx side and a single square 9.5" copper plate may
      be used on the Rx side. In this manner, selection of various sizes
      and shapes of the receiver heads allow for optimal concentration
      of the RF signal in the salt water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] At block 1714 the transmission head is arranged.
      Arrangement of the transmission head is accomplished by, for
      example, placing the transmission head proximate to and on one
      side of the reaction chamber. At block 1716 the receiver head is
      arranged. Arrangement of the receiver head is similarly
      accomplished by, for example, placing the receiver head proximate
      to and on the other side of the reaction chamber so that an RF
      signal transmitted via the transmission head to the receiver head
      will pass through the reaction chamber and be absorbed by the salt
      water or the salt water component of the solution containing salt
      water. The transmission head and reception heads are insulated
      from direct contact with the reaction chamber. The heads may be
      insulated from the reaction chamber by means of an air gap.
      Optionally, the heads may be insulated from the target area by
      means of another insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The RF frequency(s) may be selected at block 1718. In
      addition to selecting the desired RF frequency(s) at block 1718,
      the transmission time or duration may also be selected. The
      duration time is set to, for example, a specified length of time,
      or set to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the salt
      water or the solution containing salt water to a desired
      temperature/temperature range, or set to a desired change in
      temperature. In addition, optionally, other modifications of the
      RF signal may be selected at this time, such as, for example,
      amplitude, pulsed amplitude, an on/off pulse rate of the RF
      signal, a variable RF signal where the frequency of the RF signal
      varies over a set time period or in relation to set temperatures,
      ranges or changes in temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] At block 1720 the RF signal is transmitted from the
      transmission head to the receiver head. The RF signal passes
      through the reaction chamber and is absorbed by the salt water or
      the salt water component of the solution containing salt water
      that is contained within the reaction chamber. Absorption of the
      RF energy results in decomposition of the salt water or the salt
      water component of the solution containing salt water to generate
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] At block 1722 the hydrogen produced by decomposition of a
      salt water or solution containing salt water is collected.
      Hydrogen may be collected by any means. An example of a means for
      collecting hydrogen would be to utilize a vacuum or pump apparatus
      to remove the hydrogen gas as it is produced and to then retain
      the hydrogen in a location physically separated from the reaction
      chamber. For example, such a vacuum or pump apparatus could have
      one end attached to an outlet present on the reaction chamber and
      the other end attached to a gas storage container. It is
      contemplated that the gas storage container may be fitted with
      valves, as for example a one way valve, such that gas could enter
      or be pumped into the tank but then the gas could not leave the
      tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The methodology may end at block 1724 and may be ended
      after a predetermined time interval and/in response to a
      determination that a desired amount of hydrogen production has
      been achieved. The method may be performed once or repeatedly, or
      continuously, or periodically, or intermittently.<br>

      1800 for producing hydrogen from salt water and subsequently for
      the combustion of the hydrogen produced. Figure 18(b) illustrates
      a high level exemplary methodology 1800 for (i) sufficiently
      heating a solution containing salt water that may optionally
      contain a secondary fuel in order to volatilize and combust the
      secondary fuel; or (ii) decomposing the salt water component of
      the solution containing salt water to generate hydrogen and to
      subsequently combust the hydrogen produced; or (iii) both.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The methodology for both Figures 18(a) and 18(b) begins at
      block 1802. At block 1804 either salt water or a solution
      containing salt water is provided. In Figure 18(a) the salt water
      comprises water and at least one salt, wherein an effective amount
      of salt is dissolved in the water. In certain embodiments salt is
      added to water or other liquids to enhance heating. In Figure
      18(b) the salt water solution comprises the salt water of Figure
      18(a) and optionally: (i) at least one additive, or (ii) at least
      one secondary fuel source, or (iii) mixtures thereof. The salt
      used in Figures 18(a)-(b)can be any type of useful salt which is
      water soluble. Several examples of useful salts are described in
      greater detail below. An effective amount of salt is the amount of
      salt necessary to allow surrounding water to absorb sufficient
      energy output from the RF signal such that it undergoes
      decomposition to generate hydrogen, or the amount of salt
      necessary to allow surrounding water to absorb sufficient energy
      output from the RF signal such that it undergoes sufficient
      heating to volatilize and combust any secondary fuel source
      optionally present. OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix may be used
      to approximate the composition of naturally occurring seawater

      may be selected at block 1818. In addition to selecting the
      desired RF frequency(s) at block 1818, the transmission time or
      duration may also be selected. The duration time is set to, for

      <br>
      [0068] At block 1820 the RF signal is transmitted from the
      transmission head to the receiver head. The RF signal passes
      through the reaction chamber and is absorbed by the salt water or
      the salt water component of the solution containing salt water
      that is present within the reaction chamber. In Figure 18(a),
      absorption of the RF energy initially results in decomposition of
      the salt water to produce hydrogen, while still further absorption
      of the RF energy eventually leads to the combustion of the
      hydrogen produced by the decomposition of the salt water. In
      Figure 18(b), absorption of the RF energy initially results in (i)
      sufficiently heating the solution containing salt water in order
      to volatilize and to combust any secondary fuel that may be
      optionally present; or (ii) decomposition of the salt water
      component of the solution containing salt water to generate
      hydrogen; or (iii) both.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The methodology may end at block 1822 and may be ended
      after a predetermined time interval and/in response to a

      hydrogen combustion, or alternatively a desired amount of

      [0071] The methodology for both Figures 19(a) and 19(b) begins at
      block 1902. At block 1904 either salt water or a solution
      containing salt water is provided. In Figure 19(a) the salt water
      comprises water and at least one salt wherein an effective amount
      of salt is dissolved in the water. In certain embodiments salt is
      added to water or other liquids to enhance heating. In Figure

      hydrogen, or the amount of salt necessary to allow surrounding
      water to absorb sufficient energy output from the RF signal such
      that it undergoes sufficient heating to volatilize and combust any
      secondary fuel source optionally present. OCEANIC brand Natural
      Sea Salt Mix may be used to approximate the composition of
      naturally occurring seawater having an effective amount of salt
      and that may be used further as the salt water component of the
      solutions containing salt water that are used in the systems and
      methods discussed and shown herein. Such approximations of
      naturally occurring seawater may have a specific gravity of about
      1.02 g/cm&lt;3&gt; to 1.03 g/cm&lt;3&gt;, e.g., between about
      1.020-1.024 or about 28-32 PPT, as read off of a hydrometer. As an
      approximation of naturally occurring seawater, a mixture of water
      with the above-identified sea salt having a specific gravity of
      about 1.026 g/cm&lt;3&gt; (as measured with a refractometer) was
      used in exemplary systems and methods. In the alternative, it is
      believed that actual seawater may be used in the systems and
      methods discussed and shown herein. [0072] It is contemplated that
      a reservoir of the salt water or a solution containing salt water
      could be made beforehand and stored in a tank such that it would
      be available upon demand. For example, the storage tank could be
      connected to the reaction chamber by means of a feed tube. In this
      manner, a supply of the salt water or the solution containing salt
      water previously prepared could be pumped from the storage tank
      into the reaction chamber via the feed tube; wherein the feed tube
      has one end connected to the storage tank and the other end
      connected to an inlet present on the reaction chamber.
      Alternatively, it is contemplated that a spray nozzle could be
      attached onto the end of the feed tube leading into the inlet
      present on the reaction chamber. In this arrangement it is
      believed that the salt water or the solution containing salt water
      could be introduced into the reaction chamber in the form of a
      mist or spray.<br>
      <br>
      [0073 ] At block 1906 an RF transmitter is provided. The RF
      transmitter may be any type of RF transmitter generating a
      suitable RF signal. RF transmitter may be a variable frequency RF
      transmitter. Optionally, the RF transmitter may also be a
      multi-frequency transmitter capable of providing
      multiple-frequency RF signals. Still yet, optionally the RF
      transmitter may be capable of transmitting RF signals with
      variable amplitudes or pulsed amplitudes. A variety of different
      shapes and sizes of transmission and reception heads may be
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The transmission head may be selected at block 1908. The
      selection of the transmission head may be based in part on the
      type of RF transmitter provided. Other factors, such as, for
      example, the depth, size and shape of the general target area, or
      specific target area to be treated, and the number of frequencies
      transmitted may also be used in determining the selection of the
      transmission head.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The RF receiver is provided at block 1910. The RF receiver
      may be tuned to the frequency(s) of the RF transmitter. At block
      1812, the desired receiver head may be selected. Similarly to the
      selection of the transmission head, the receiver head is may be
      selected to fit the desired characteristics of the particular
      application. For example, a receiver head that is larger than the
      transmission head can be selected to concentrate the RP signal on
      a specific area in the reaction chamber (although it was earlier
      believed that a smaller head would concentrate the RF to enhance
      RF heating, a larger reception head was found to generate a higher
      temperature). Various sizes and shapes of the receiver heads allow
      for optimal concentration of the RF signal in the salt water and
      solution containing salt water.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] At block 1914 the transmission head is arranged.
      Arrangement of the transmission head is accomplished by, for
      example, placing the transmission head proximate to and on one
      side of the reaction chamber. At block 1916 the receiver head is
      arranged. Arrangement of the receiver head is similarly
      accomplished by, for example, placing the receiver head proximate
      to and on the other side of the reaction chamber so that an RF
      signal transmitted via the transmission head to the receiver head
      will pass through the reaction chamber and be absorbed by the salt
      water or the salt water component of a solution containing salt
      water. The transmission head and receiving heads are insulated
      from direct contact with the reaction chamber. The heads may be
      insulated from the reaction chamber by means of an air gap.
      Optionally, the heads are insulated from the target area by means
      of another insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The RF frequency(s) may be selected at block 1918. hi
      addition to selecting the desired RF frequency(s) at block 1918,
      the transmission time or duration may also be selected. The
      duration time is set to, for example, a specified length of time,
      or set to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the salt
      water or salt water solution to a desired temperature/temperature
      range, or set to a desired change in temperature. In addition,
      optionally, other modifications of the RF signal may be selected
      at this time, such as, for example, amplitude, pulsed amplitude,
      an on/off pulse rate of the RF signal, a variable RF signal where
      the frequency of the RF signal varies over a set time period or in
      relation to set temperatures, ranges or changes in temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] At block 1920 the RF signal is transmitted from the
      transmission head to the receiver head. The RF signal passes
      through the reaction chamber and is absorbed by the salt water or
      the salt water component of the salt water containing solution
      present within the reaction chamber. In Figure 19(a), absorption
      of the RF energy initially results in decomposition of the salt
      water to produce hydrogen, while still further absorption of the
      RF energy eventually leads to the combustion of the hydrogen
      produced by the decomposition of the salt water. In Figure 19(b),
      absorption of the RF energy initially results in (i) sufficiently
      heating the solution containing salt water in order to volatilize
      and to combust any secondary fuel that may be optionally present;
      or (ii) decomposition of the salt water component of the aqueous
      solution to generate hydrogen; or (iii) both.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Alternatively, it is contemplated that an ignition source,
      for example a spark plug, could be attached to the reaction
      chamber. This ignition source would also be in circuit
      communication with a current source, such as for example a
      battery. The arrangement contemplated here would provide for a
      current going to the ignition source to be switched on and off
      when desired. This would result in generation of an ignition
      event, as for example with a spark plug a spark would be produced,
      on demand. It is believed that this ignition event would cause the
      combustion of the hydrogen that had been produced by the
      decomposition of the salt water, or would cause the combustion of
      either the hydrogen or any volatilized secondary fuel or both that
      is produced by RF treatement of a solution containing salt water
      in the reaction chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] At block 1922, the energy generated from the combustion of
      hydrogen, which is produced from the decomposition of the salt
      water (or more generally, the energy generated from either (i)
      combustion of the hydrogen produced from decomposition of the salt
      water, or (ii) the volatilization and combustion of any secondary
      fuel that may be optionally present in a solution containing salt
      water, or (iii) both), is transmitted to a piston in order to
      perform mechanical work. In any event, the combustion of either
      the hydrogen or any secondary fuel or both generates hot exhaust
      gases including steam. These hot exhaust gases expand and in doing
      so create an increase in pressure. It is contemplated that the
      head of a piston could be attached to the outlet present on the
      reaction chamber and the other end of piston attached to a lever
      arm. As expanding exhaust gases push against the piston head, the
      lever arm is moved transforming the chemical energy of expanding
      exhaust gases into mechanical energy and into the performance of
      mechanical work.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] It is further contemplated that this piston arrangement
      could be utilized together with the spray nozzle and ignition
      source described above, to allow one to convert chemical energy
      into mechanical energy and subsequently into the performance of
      mechanical work, on demand. For example, this method could be used
      in such an arrangement in order to power an internal combustion
      engine. It is further contemplated that one example of how this
      method together with the appropriate system could be utilized,
      would be in providing an engine that would be fueled by salt water
      or various solutions containing salt water, or even directly by
      seawater taken from the ocean without further purification, rather
      than requiring gasoline or other water incompatible hydrocarbon
      fuels to operate. Specifically, it is contemplated that this
      engine could be provided in an appropriate size and in a manner
      such that it could be used to power an automobile or other form of
      motorized vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The methodology may end at block 1924 and may be ended
      after a predetermined time interval and/in response to a
      determination that a desired amount of hydrogen production and
      hydrogen combustion, or alternatively that a desired amount of
      volatilization and combustion of any secondary fuel source that is
      optionally present has been achieved. The method may be performed
      once or repeatedly, or continuously, or periodically, or
      intermittently.<br>

      [0083] Figure 20 illustrates a high level exemplary methodology
      2000 for desalinating seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The methodology begins at block 2002. At block 2004
      seawater is provided. Any manner of seawater from any ocean or of
      any concentration or salinity would suffice. Furthermore, it is
      contemplated that the seawater could be taken from the source in
      its natural occurring form and used directly without the need for
      any further purification or processing. Examples of several
      sources for seawater are described below. It is also contemplated
      that an amount of seawater could be stored in a reservoir or
      storage tank such that it would be available to fill the reaction
      chamber upon demand. For example, the storage tank could be
      connected to the reaction chamber by means of a feed tube. In this
      manner, a supply of seawater could be pumped from the storage tank
      into the reaction chamber via the feed tube; wherein the feed tube
      has one end connected to the storage tank and the other end
      connected to an inlet present on the reaction chamber. [0085] At
      block 2006 an RF transmitter is provided. The RF transmitter may
      be any type of RF transmitter generating a suitable RF signal. RF
      transmitter may be a variable frequency RF transmitter.
      Optionally, the RF transmitter may also be a multi-frequency
      transmitter capable of providing multiple-frequency RF signals.
      Still yet, optionally the RF transmitter may be capable of
      transmitting RF signals with variable amplitudes or pulsed
      amplitudes. A variety of different shapes and sizes of
      transmission and reception heads are provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The transmission head may be selected at block 2008. The
      selection of the transmission head may be based in part on the
      type of RF transmitter provided. Other factors, such as, for
      example, the depth, size and shape of the general target area, or
      specific target area to be treated, and the number of frequencies
      transmitted may also be used in determining the selection of the
      transmission head.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The RF receiver is provided at block 2010. The RF receiver
      may be tuned to the frequency(s) of the RF transmitter. At block
      2012, the desired receiver head may be selected. Similarly to the
      selection of the transmission head, the receiver head may be
      selected to fit the desired characteristics of the particular
      application. For example, a receiver head that is larger than the
      transmission head can be selected to concentrate the RF signal on
      a specific area in the reaction chamber (although it was earlier
      believed that a smaller head would concentrate the RF to enhance

      temperature). Various sizes and shapes of the receiver heads allow
      for optimal concentration of the RF signal in the seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] At block 2014 the transmission head is arranged.
      Arrangement of the transmission head is accomplished by, for
      example, placing the transmission head proximate to and on one
      side of the reaction chamber. At block 2016 the receiver head is
      arranged. Arrangement of the receiver head is similarly
      accomplished by, for example, placing the receiver head proximate
      to and on the other side of the reaction chamber so that an RF

      will pass through the reaction chamber and be absorbed by the

      Optionally, the heads may be insulated from the target area by

      <br>
      [0089] The RF frequency(s) may be selected at block 2018. In
      addition to selecting the desired RF frequency(s) at block 2018,
      the transmission time or duration may also be selected. The
      duration time is set to, for example, a specified length of time,
      or set to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the
      seawater to boiling. In addition, optionally, other modifications
      of the RF signal are selected at this time, such as, for example,
      amplitude, pulsed amplitude, an on/off pulse rate of the RF
      signal, a variable RF signal where the frequency of the RF signal
      varies over a set time period or in relation to set temperatures,
      ranges or changes in temperatures or desired phase transitions.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] At block 2020 the RF signal is transmitted from the
      transmission head to the receiver head. The RF signal passes
      through the reaction chamber and is absorbed by the seawater
      contained within the reaction chamber. Absorption of the RF energy
      results in heating of the seawater causing the seawater to undergo
      a phase change and produce steam. The steam produced would be free
      of any salt, minerals, or any other nonvolatile impurities
      initially present in the seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] At block 2022 the steam produced by heating the seawater to
      boiling is collected. At block 2024 the collected steam is
      condensed to form purified water. The steam may be collected by
      any means. An example of a means for collecting and condensing
      steam would be to utilize a the natural tendency of hot gases,
      such as steam, to rise. For example, it is contemplated that an
      exhaust pipe having one end attached to the outlet present in the
      reaction chamber and positioned to be directly above the reaction
      chamber could conduct the steam, as it is produced, away from the
      reaction chamber. It is further contemplated that the other end of
      the exhaust pipe could be attached to a remotely positioned tank
      and that this tank would functioned as a condenser such that, upon
      entering the tank, the steam would cool and convert phases from
      steam into water. As a result, it is believed that purified water
      would be condensed and collect in such a condenser tank. It is
      contemplated that, optionally, the condenser tank could be
      externally cooled in order to facilitate the rate of condensation
      of the steam. [0092] The methodology may end at block 2026 and may
      be ended after a predetermined time interval and/in response to a
      determination that a desired amount of steam production and
      desalination has been achieved. The method may be performed once
      or repeatedly, or continuously, or periodically, or
      intermittently.<br>

      2100 of carrying out the electrolysis of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The methodology begins at block 2102. At block 2104 a salt
      water mixture is provided. The salt water mixture comprises water
      and at least one salt wherein an effective amount of salt is
      dissolved in the water. The salt should be water soluble and, in
      order to effectively form both hydrogen and oxygen gases, the salt
      should be selected such that the corresponding cation of the salt
      has a lower standard electrode potential than H&lt;+&gt; and the
      corresponding anion of the salt has a higher standard electrode
      potential than OH&lt;"&gt;. A more detailed description of various
      salts and their effective amounts which are useful in this regard
      is given below.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] At block 2106 an RF transmitter is provided. The RF
      transmitter may be any type of RF transmitter generating a

      selection of the transmission head may be based in part on the
      type of RF transmitter provided. Other factors, such as, for
      example, the depth, size and shape of the general target area, or
      specific target area to be treated, and the number of frequencies
      transmitted may also be used in determining the selection of the
      transmission head. [0097] The RF receiver is provided at block
      2110. The RF receiver may be tuned to the frequency(s) of the RF
      transmitter. At block 21 12, the desired receiver head may be
      selected. Similarly to the selection of the transmission head, the
      receiver head may be selected to fit the desired characteristics
      of the particular application. For example, a receiver head that
      is larger than the transmission head can be selected to
      concentrate the RF signal on a specific area in the reaction
      chamber (although it was earlier believed that a smaller head
      would concentrate the RF to enhance RF heating, a larger reception
      head was found to generate a higher temperature). Various sizes
      and shapes of the receiver heads allow for optimal concentration
      of the RF signal in the salt water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] At block 2114 the transmission head is arranged.
      Arrangement of the transmission head is accomplished by, for
      example, placing the transmission head proximate to and on one
      side of the reaction chamber. At block 2116 the receiver head is
      arranged. Arrangement of the receiver head is similarly
      accomplished by, for example, placing the receiver head proximate
      to and on the other side of the reaction chamber so that an RF
      signal transmitted via the transmission head to the receiver head
      will pass through the reaction chamber and be absorbed by the salt
      water mixture. The transmission head and reception heads are

      may be insulated from the reaction chamber by means of an air gap.
      Optionally, the heads are insulated from the target area by means
      of another insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The RF frequency(s) may be selected at block 2118. In
      addition to selecting the desired RF frequency(s) at block 2118,
      the transmission time or duration may also be selected. The
      duration time is set to, for example, a specified length of time,
      or set to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the salt
      water mixture to a desired temperature/temperature range, or set
      to a desired change in temperature. In addition, optionally, other
      modifications of the RF signal are selected at this time, such as,
      for example, amplitude, pulsed amplitude, an on/off pulse rate of
      the RF signal, a variable RF signal where the frequency of the RF
      signal varies over a set time period or in relation to set
      temperatures, ranges or changes in temperatures. [00100] At block
      2120 the RF signal is transmitted from the transmission head to
      the receiver head. The RF signal passes through the reaction
      chamber and is absorbed by the salt water mixture contained within
      the reaction chamber. Absorption of the RF energy results in
      decomposition of the salt water mixture to produce hydrogen and
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [00101] At block 2122 both the hydrogen and oxygen produced by
      decomposition of the salt water mixture is collected. Means for
      collecting and separating the hydrogen and oxygen produced by the
      electrolysis of the salt water mixture will be known to those
      skilled in the art. Such techniques may include using two
      evacuated, gas collection bells that are nested within one
      another; where the opening to the innermost gas collection bell is
      covered with a semi-permeable membrane. The semi-permeable
      membrane may be made from a material that has a greater
      permeability to hydrogen gas than it does to oxygen gas. In this
      regard, as the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases are directed
      using a series of tubes and valves towards the two gas collection
      bells nested within one another, only hydrogen gas would be able
      to effectively pass through the membrane covering the innermost
      gas collection bell. As such, the hydrogen gas would become
      concentrated in the innermost gas collection bell, while the
      oxygen gas would become concentrated in the outermost gas
      collection bell. In this manner, it is believed that the hydrogen
      gas could be isolated and collected separately from the oxygen
      gas.<br>

      is capable of generating an RF signal. The RF system may include
      an RF generator, transmitter, and transmission head and be of the
      type described above such that it is capable of generating an
      ignitable gas from sea water in an open container proximate to the
      transmission head. At block 2620 a liquid is provided that
      includes an effective amount of at least one ion dissolved in the
      liquid for generation of an ignitable gas by the RF signal. At
      block 2630 the RF signal is transmitted and at block 2640 a
      portion of the liquid is combusted.<br>

      [00105] Additional methods are contemplated using the systems
      described herein where a frequency for operation of the RF signal
      may be selected such that the frequency is the same as, or
      overlaps (either partially or completely) - or has harmonics that
      are the same as or overlaps - specific RF frequencies that are
      capable of stimulating or exciting any of the various energy
      levels of various ions, e.g., any of the various metal species
      that comprise the salts that are dissolved in the salt water
      solutions. One having ordinary skill in the art will understand
      how to determine and to measure RF frequencies that stimulate or
      excite various energy levels for various metal species. In this
      regard and based on empirical testing, we believe that 13.56
      stimulates and/or excites Na ions better than any other ions
      herein so tested. As such, it is believed that useful embodiments
      of the methods described herein may therefore also include (i)
      selecting an RF signal having a preferred frequency, (ii)
      selecting a metal salt comprising a metal species capable of being
      stimulated or excited by the preferred frequency selected (or a
      harmonic thereof), (iii) transmitting the RF signal having the
      preferred frequency through or to an aqueous solution of the metal
      salt for a sufficient time in order to stimulate or excite the
      metal species present in the aqueous solution to generate heat.
      Alternatively, methods may also include (i) selecting a salt
      comprising a preferred metal species, (ii) selecting an RF signal
      having a frequency (or a harmonic thereof) capable of stimulating
      or exciting the preferred metal species, (iii) transmitting the RF
      signal having the frequency to or through an aqueous solution of
      the metal salt comprising the preferred metal species for a
      sufficient time to generate heat.<br>
      <br>
      [00106] Additional methods are contemplated using the systems
      described herein where the RF signal may be used to process clays
      and soils to heat and sterilize the clays and soils, to directly
      generate hydrogen from the clays and soils, and for remediation of
      the clays or soils by removing or extracting organic contaminants
      and wastes. It is contemplated, as above, that a frequency for
      operation of the RF signal may be selected such that the frequency
      (or a harmonic thereof) is the same as or overlaps with (either
      partially or completely) specific RF frequencies capable of
      stimulating or exciting any of the various energy levels of any of
      the various metal species comprising metal salts or metal
      compounds that are dissolved or distributed within the soils.
      Since soils often contain moisture or the metal species present in
      the soils and clays have water molecules coordinated to them, it
      is therefore believed that the systems and methods described
      herein could be used to heat and process such metal-containing
      soils. As such, we believe the RF signal could be used (in any of
      the various manners herein described for treatment of salt water
      solutions) to produced heat and/or steam and/or hydrogen and
      oxygen free radicals in-situ within various soils, and in
      particular in clays and clay containing soils. The heat and/or the
      steam and/or the hydrogen and oxygen free radical produced from
      the water molecules present in the soil would treat the
      surrounding soil, in particular the heat and/or the free radicals
      generated would perhaps sterilize the soil, killing any animal,
      vegetable or microbial life that may also be present. It is
      further contemplated that steam produced in-situ in this manner
      may also be used to volatize and extract any hydrocarbon
      pollutants that may also be present in the soils and clays. As
      such, it is contemplated that soils of contaminated commercial
      residential and industrial sites, hazardous waste dump sites, gas
      stations, etc. could be remediated using the systems and methods
      described herein. One skilled in the art will understand how the
      RF systems and methods described herein could be coupled with
      known extraction and remediation processes and methods for in-situ
      treatment of contaminated soils. Exemplary hydrocarbon
      contaminants that could be extracted or removed would include but
      are not limited to organic solvents, oil and oil byproducts,
      insecticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Similarly, it is
      contemplated that clathrates, zeolites, and other materials
      containing or having various metal species adsorbed to their
      surfaces or in there structures and containing either moisture or
      water molecules coordinated to the metal species present may be
      processed and heated in similar manners as has been described
      herein for soils and clays.<br>
      <br>
      [00107] In accordance with the systems and methods of the present
      invention previously described, further embodiments are
      contemplated of an RF system for selective disinfection of
      surfaces and materials is provided. The system includes an RF
      transmitter having an RF generator and a transmission head, and an
      RF receiver having a resonant circuit and a reception head. When
      the transmission and reception heads are arranged proximate to and
      on either side of a surface or material and an RF signal is
      transmitted from the transmission head, through the surface or
      material, to the reception head, at least a portion of the surface
      or material is disinfected without direct contact of the heads to
      the surface or material. It is contemplated, as above, that a
      frequency for operation of the RF signal may be selected such that
      the frequency (or harmonic thereof) is the same as or overlaps
      with (either partially or completely) specific RF frequencies that
      are capable of stimulating or exciting any of the various energy
      levels of any of the various metal species or metal salts or metal
      compounds that may, for example, be present within various
      targeted microbes, bacteria, or viruses. Since environments where
      microbes, bacteria, and viruses are found also often contain
      moisture, we therefore believe that the systems and methods
      described herein could be used to disinfect surfaces and materials
      through selectively heating and destroying various targeted
      microbes, bacteria, and viruses that are present on the surfaces
      or materials to be disinfected. The RF signal would be applied for
      a sufficient time to locally heat and destroy any targeted
      microbes, bacteria, and viruses that contain metals (metals that
      are either coordinated by water molecules or in an environment
      containing moisture) that are stimulated or excited by the RF
      signal having the particular frequency so selected.<br>
      <br>
      [00108] In accordance with the systems and methods of the present
      invention previously described, further embodiments are
      contemplated of an RF system for affecting a change in the
      germination and growth of plant life is provided. The system
      includes an RF transmitter having an RF generator and a
      transmission head, and an RF receiver having a resonant circuit
      and a reception head. When the transmission and reception heads
      are arranged proximate to and on either side of a seed or a plant
      and an RF signal is transmitted from the transmission head,
      through the seed or plant, to the reception head, at least a
      portion of the seed or plant is processed without direct contact
      of the heads to the seed or plant. For example, a seed may be
      placed in a brackish environment or a plant may be watered with
      brine solution and natural biological processes such as osmotic
      pumping mechanisms may be taken advantage of in order to create a
      seed or plant having an internal environment with an increased
      salt concentration. We believe that any of the systems or methods
      described herein may be used to then expose the so prepared seed
      or plant to an RF signal, wherein the RF signal would affect a
      change in the rate of germination of the seed or affect a change
      in the rate of growth of the plant. We believed that that a
      frequency for operation of the RF signal may be selected such that
      the frequency (or harmonic thereof) is the same as or overlaps
      with (either partially or completely) specific RF frequencies that
      are capable of either increasing or decreasing the rates of seed
      germination and plant growth in order to affect such a change in
      the germination and growth of plant life.<br>
      <br>
      [00109] In accordance with the systems and methods of the present
      invention previously described, further embodiments contemplating
      RF systems and methods for processing a fluid are provided.
      Processing a fluid includes but is not limited to heating and/or
      combusting the fluid. Fluids can be processed whether or not they
      contain any of the useful salts or ions (either cations or anions)
      herein described. An exemplary fluid in this regard includes but
      is not limited to water that is extracted from oil wells and that
      is contaminated with oil residues and/or other hydrocarbon
      contaminants. Methods for processing (including heating and/or
      combusting) a fluid involve using any of the systems previously
      described and (i) providing a fluid to be processed (including
      heating and/or combusting the fluid), (ii) adding an effective
      amount of salt to the fluid (e.g., by adding solid salt or by
      adding a salt solution), and (iii) passing RF through the fluid
      containing an effective amount of salt to process the fluid. In
      general, useful systems may include an RF transmitter having an RF
      generator and a transmission head, and an RF receiver having a
      resonant circuit and a reception head. When the transmission and
      reception heads are arranged proximate to and on either side of
      the fluid having an effective amount of salt added to it an RF
      signal is transmitted from the transmission head, through the
      fluid containing the salt, to the reception head, and at least a
      portion of the fluid is processed. Processing in this regard may
      include heating the fluid and/or combusting the fluid and in such
      situations salt is added to enhance heating of the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Salt Water, Salt Water Solutions,
        and Salt Water Mixtures</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00110] Ordinary and naturally occurring seawater may be used.
      Generally, a salt which is useful as the salt water or in the
      solution containing salt water or in the salt water mixtures
      employed in these systems and methods disclosed herein include any
      salt which has solubility in water. For example, NaCl is a useful
      salt because NaCl is very soluble in water. Other useful salts may
      include salts that have as their cation any element in cationic
      form, which may selected from the group consisting of Li&lt;+&gt;,
      Na&lt;+&gt;, K&lt;+&gt;, Rb&lt;+&gt;, Cs&lt;+&gt;, Be&lt;2+&gt;,
      Mg&lt;2+&gt;, Ca&lt;2+&gt;, Ba&lt;2+&gt;, Sr&lt;2+&gt;,
      Mn&lt;2+&gt;, Fe&lt;2+&gt;, Fe&lt;3+&gt;, Ni&lt;2+&gt;,
      Cu&lt;2+&gt;, Zn&lt;2+&gt;, Ag&lt;+&gt;, Au&lt;+&gt;, B&lt;3+&gt;,
      Al&lt;3+&gt;, Ga&lt;3+&gt;, In&lt;3+&gt; and that have as the
      anion any element in anionic form that is selected from the group
      consisting of Cl&lt;"&gt;, Br&lt;"&gt;, I&lt;"&gt;, borate,
      citrate, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and hydroxide.
      The salt used in the systems and methods disclosed herein can be
      used as either a pure salt, the salt made from one type of cation
      and one type of anion that are those cations and anions listed
      above; or it can be a salt mixture, made from more than one type
      salt, made from one or more types of cations and/or one or more
      types of anions that are those cations and anions listed above.
      Again, ordinary and naturally occurring seawater may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [00111] Another useful salt water (or salt water component of
      either solutions containing salt water or salt water mixtures) for
      use in the systems and methods disclosed herein is seawater. This
      includes all types of seawater, including water taken from any of
      the oceans or other naturally salty bodies of water found on the
      earth. Using seawater as disclosed herein includes using seawater
      in its natural occurring form, that is, seawater which is taken
      from the ocean and used directly without any further processing or
      purification.<br>
      <br>
      [00112] Another useful salt water or salt water solution for use
      in the systems and methods disclosed herein is brine water. Brine
      water may be water extracted from the ground (ground water) and
      includes water that is taken from water wells and oil wells. Using
      brine water as disclosed herein includes using brine water that
      has been further processed or treated (for example, by addition of
      salt, e.g., adding solid salt or a salt solution) or that is in
      its naturally occurring form and used directly without any further
      processing or purification.<br>
      <br>
      [00113 ] OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix may be used to
      approximate naturally occurring seawater having an effective
      amount of salt and used as the salt water or salt water component
      of solutions containing salt water and salt water mixtures
      employed in the systems and methods discussed and shown herein.
      Such approximations of naturally occurring seawater may have a
      specific gravity of about 1.02 g/cm&lt;3&gt; to 1.03
      g/cm&lt;3&gt;, e.g., between about 1.020-1.024 or about 28-32 PPT,
      as read off of a hydrometer. A mixture of the above-identified sea
      salt mix having a specific gravity of about 1.026 g/cm&lt;3&gt;
      (as measured with a refractometer) was used in exemplary systems
      and methods. In the alternative, it is believed that actual
      seawater may be used in the systems and methods discussed and
      shown herein. The precise amount of salt in salt water or in the
      salt water component of the solutions containing salt water and
      salt water mixtures used and contemplated herein may vary from
      specific application to specific application.<br>
      <br>
      [00114] In order to form both hydrogen and oxygen gas, salts
      capable of forming salt water mixtures that are useful for use in
      the electrolysis systems and electrolysis methods disclosed
      herein, should be water soluble salts and also should have a
      cation and an anion selected such that the cation has a lower
      standard electrode potential than H&lt;+&gt; and the anion has a
      greater standard electrode potential than OH&lt;"&gt;. For
      example, the following cations have lower standard electrode
      potential than H&lt;+&gt; and are therefore suitable for use as
      electrolyte cations: Li&lt;+&gt;, Rb&lt;+&gt;, K&lt;+&gt;,
      Cs&lt;+&gt;, Ba&lt;2+&gt;, Sr&lt;2+&gt;, Ca&lt;2+&gt;,
      Na&lt;+&gt;, and Mg&lt;2+&gt;. For example, a useful anion would
      be SO4&lt;2"&gt;, because it has a greater standard electrode
      potential than OH&lt;"&gt; and is very difficult to oxidize. It is
      contemplated that Na2SO4 would be a useful salt for use with the
      electrolysis systems and methods disclosed here within because it
      is a water soluble salt that is composed of a cation (Na&lt;+&gt;)
      that has a lower standard electrode potential than H&lt;+&gt; and
      an anion (SO4&lt;2"&gt;) that has a greater standard electrode
      potential than OH&lt;"&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additive</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00115] As previously indicated, as used herein an additive may be
      an organic, organometallic, or inorganic chemical compound having
      solubility, miscibility, or compatibility with salt water and
      solutions containing salt water and salt water mixtures (including
      seawater or solutions containing salt water and optionally
      containing at least one secondary fuel) and that is capable of
      altering the response of the salt water, various solutions
      containing salt water, and salt water mixtures in response to
      stimulation by RF energy. Both molecular and polymeric species are
      contemplated as being useful additives. It is further believe that
      useful amounts of additive include solutions containing salt water
      where the additive is present as at least one minor component in
      the solution containing salt water. Embodiments contemplated in
      this regard would include solutions containing salt water and
      having from about 0.001 to about 10.0 weight % additive, and more
      preferably from about 0.001 to about 1.0 weight % additive, and
      even more preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.1 weight %
      additive.<br>
      <br>
      [00116] It is contemplated that a salt water solution or salt
      water mixture containing an additive will respond differently to
      RF stimulation versus comparable salt water solution or salt water
      mixture that does not contain any additive. We believe that the
      response of a salt water solution or salt water mixture to RF
      energy may be altered in a variety of ways. For example, an
      alteration in RF response that an additive may have may include
      but is not limited to increasing or decreasing the rate at which a
      solution or mixture containing the additive either heats,
      combusts, or both upon exposure to a fixed amount or flux of RF
      energy; exhibiting a desired temperature change or level of
      combustion of a salt water solution containing an additive with
      exposure to a larger or a smaller amount of RF energy; and
      decreasing the surface tension of a salt water solution containing
      an additive such that combustion of the salt water solution or
      mixture occurs upon application of an RF field without any need
      for externally perturbing the surface of the salt water solution.
      Surfactants, including soaps and detergents, are embodiments of
      useful additives in this regard since they are known to lower the
      surface tension of aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we believe that
      water soluble organic compounds that can lower the heat capacity
      of an aqueous solution or that can change the freezing point of
      water or that can fo[pi]n azeotropic mixtures with water would
      also be useful additives in this regard.<br>
      <br>
      Secondary Fuels [00117] As previously indicated, as used herein a
      secondary fuel may be any combustible organic compound that has
      solubility, miscibility, or compatibility with salt water or
      various solutions containing salt water or salt water mixtures
      (including seawater, salt water or solutions containing salt water
      that optionally contain at least one additive). It is believe that
      a useful amount of secondary fuel includes solutions containing
      salt water were the secondary fuel is present as the minor
      component. Alternatively, it is also believe that a useful amount
      of secondary fuel includes solutions containing salt or salt water
      were the secondary fuel is present as the major component. In this
      regard, embodiments are contemplated of salt water solutions
      containing from about 0.01 to about 99.99 weight % of at least one
      alternative fuel, and preferably from about 1.0 to about 99.0
      weight % of at least one alternative fuel, and more preferably
      from about 10 to about 90 weight % of at least one alternative
      fuel, and even more preferably from about 30 to about 70 weight %
      of at least one alternative fuel, and even more preferably from
      about 40 to about 60 weight % of at least one alternative fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [00118] It is contemplated that exposure to RF energy of a salt
      water solution containing at least one secondary fuel, wherein the
      secondary fuel is the minor constituent, may result in an
      enhancement or in a boost in performance in terms of the
      combustibility of the salt water solution versus the results
      obtained by a comparable salt water solution that does not contain
      any secondary fuel. Alternatively, it is also contemplated that
      exposure to RF energy of a salt water solution containing at least
      one secondary fuel, where the secondary fuel is the major
      constituent of the mix, allows RF energy to be used to combust the
      secondary fuel even though the secondary fuel itself may be RF
      inert. Without intending to be bound by theory, we believe that
      the secondary fuel may be useful as either the minor or the major
      component in a salt water solution because the salt water
      component of the salt water solution is stimulated by the RF
      signal and absorbs energy. As such, absorption of RF energy by the
      salt water component causes the temperature of the salt water
      solution to increase to the point where secondary fuel present in
      any amount volatilizes and becomes more capability of combusting
      in the presence of a spark, flame, or any other incendiary source.
      In this regard, methanol, ethanol, and iso-propanol are useful as
      secondary fuels because they are combustible organic solvents and
      are soluble with or have chemical compatibility with water.
      Furthermore, we believe that many additional organic solvents and
      compounds, which may have both volatility and solubility or
      miscibility with aqueous solutions, would also be useful as
      secondary fuels in this regard. For example, we contemplate that
      n-propanol, acetone, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and formic acid
      may also be useful secondary fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RF Absorption Enhancers</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00119] Salt water, solutions containing salt water, and salt
      water mixtures may be processed using RF as-is. In the
      alternative, it is also believed that RF absorption enhancers may
      be added to the salt water, solutions containing salt water, and
      salt water mixtures prior to processing with RF to enhance the
      effects of the RF energy on the salt water, e.g., enhanced
      heating, enhanced, combustion, enhanced desalination, etc. The RF
      absorption enhancers may be particles made from RF absorbing
      materials that absorb one or more frequencies of an RF
      electromagnetic signal substantially more than other materials.
      This may pe[pi]nit the RF signal to heat salt water (or any
      solution containing salt water or salt water mixture) containing
      RF absorbing enhancers substantially more than it would salt water
      (or salt water solution or salt water mixture) that does not
      contain additional RF absorption enhancers.<br>
      <br>
      [00120] Exemplary RF absorption enhancers include particles of
      electrically conductive material, such as silver, gold, copper,
      magnesium, iron, any of the other metals, and/or magnetic
      particles, or various combinations and permutations of gold, iron,
      any of the other metals, and/or magnetic particles. Examples of
      other RF absorption enhancers include: metal tubules (such as
      silver or gold nanotubes or silver or gold microtubes, which may
      be water-soluble), particles made of piezoelectric crystal
      (natural or synthetic), particles made of synthetic materials,
      particles made of biologic materials, robotic particles, particles
      made of man made applied materials, like organically modified
      silica (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles. Examples of yet other RF
      absorption enhancers that may be useful include RF absorbing
      carbon molecules and compounds: fullerenes (any of a class of
      closed hollow aromatic carbon compounds that are made up of twelve
      pentagonal and differing numbers of hexagonal faces), carbon
      nanotubes, other molecules or compounds having one or more
      graphene layers, and other RF-absorbing carbon molecules and
      compounds e.g., C60 (also known as a "buckyball" or a
      "buckminsterfullerene"), C70, C76, C84, buckytubes (single- walled
      carbon nanotubes, SWNTs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs),
      and other nano-sized or micro-sized carbon cage molecules and
      compounds. Such carbon-based particles may be in water-soluble
      form. Such carbon-based particles may have metal atoms (e.g.,
      nickel atoms) integral therewith, which may affect their ability
      to absorb RF energy and heat in response thereto. Any of the
      foregoing (and subsequently listed) particles may be sized as
      so-called "nanoparticles" (microscopic particles whose size is
      measured in nanometers, e.g., 1-1000 nm) or sized as so-called
      "microparticles" (microscopic particles whose size is measured in
      micrometers, e.g., 1-1000 [mu]m).<br>
      <br>
      [00121] Additionally, RF absorbing carbon molecules and compounds
      may be fabricated as RF absorption enhancers to be particles with
      non-linear I-V characteristics (rectifying characteristics) and/or
      capacitance. Such non-linear I-V characteristics may result from,
      for example, nanotubes with a portion doped (e.g., by modulation
      doping) with a material giving n-type semiconducting properties
      adjacent a portion doped with p-type semiconducting properties to
      form a nanotube having an integral rectifying p-n junction. In the
      alternative, nanotubes can be fabricated with an integral Schottky
      barrier. In either case, it may be helpful to use nanotubes having
      at least two conducting regions with a rectifying region
      therebetween. Accordingly, rectifying circuits for RF absorbing
      particles for RF absorption enhancers may be fabricated from RF
      absorbing carbon molecules and compounds having non-linear I-V
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [00122 ] Any of the RF absorption enhancers described herein may
      be used alone or in virtually any combination of and/or
      permutation of any of the particle or particles described herein.
      For example, it may be beneficial to use a plurality of different
      RF absorbing particles described herein for purposes of tuning the
      reaction kinetics of the various methods herein described.
      Accordingly, virtually any combination or permutation of RF
      absorption enhancers may be used in virtually any combination of
      and/or permutation of any RF absorbing particle or particles
      described herein to create RF absorption enhancers for use in
      accordance with the teachings herein. [00123 ] Of the RF
      absorption enhancers mentioned herein, some may be suitable for a
      13.56 MHz RP signal, e.g., silver nanoparticles, gold
      nanoparticles, copper nanoparticles, magnesium nanoparticles,
      aqueous solutions of any of the metal sulfates mentioned herein,
      and RF absorbing carbon molecules and compounds. RF absorption
      enhancers using these RF absorbing particles are also expected to
      be effective at slightly higher frequencies, such as those having
      a frequency on the order of the second or third harmonics of 13.56
      MHz.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RF Signal</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00124] The RF signals may have a frequency corresponding to a
      selected parameter of an RF enhancer, e.g., 13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz,
      915 MHz, 1.2 GHz. Several RF frequencies have been allocated for
      industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment, e.g.: 6.78
      MHz +-15.0 IcHz; 13.56 MHz +-7.0 kHz; 27.12 MHz +-163.0 kHz; 40.68
      MHz +-20.0 kHz; 915 MHz +-13.0 MHz; 2450 MHz +-50.0 MHz. See Part
      18 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These and other
      frequencies of the same orders of magnitude may be used in
      virtually any of the systems and methods discussed herein,
      depending on which RF absorbing particles are used. For example,
      RF signals having a fundamental frequency of about 700 MHz or less
      might be suitable for many of the systems and methods described
      herein. RF signals having a fundamental frequency in the high
      frequency (HF) range (3-30 MHz) of the RF range might be suitable
      for many of the systems and methods described herein. Similarly,
      RF signals having a fundamental frequency in the very high
      frequency (VHF) range (30-300 MHz) of the RF range might also be
      suitable for many of the systems and methods described herein. Of
      course, RF signals at any fundamental frequency may also have
      harmonic components that are multiples of the fundamental
      frequency of frequencies. Also, RF signals at any fundamental
      frequencies or periodic multiples of such fundamental frequencies
      that are harmonics of a fundamental frequency may be selected such
      that the frequency is the same as or has overlap with (either
      partially or completely) specific RF frequencies capable of
      stimulating or exciting any of the various electron energy levels
      of any of the various metal species that comprise the salts that
      are dissolved in the salt water solutions. For example, based on
      empirical testing we believe that an RF signal with a frequency of
      13.56 MHz stimulates and/or excites Na ions better than any other
      ions herein so tested. [00125] Additionally, in any of the
      embodiments discussed herein, the RF signal used may be a pulsed,
      modulated FM RF signal, or a pulse fixed frequency signal. A
      pulsed signal may permit a relatively higher peak-power level
      (e.g., a single "burst" pulse at 1000 Watts or more, or a 1000
      Watt signal having a duty cycle of about 10% to about 25%) and may
      create higher local temperatures at RF absorption enhancer
      particles. Such pulsed signals may have any of various
      characteristics. For example, the RF pulse may be a square wave,
      or may be a sine wave, or may have a sharp rise time with an
      extended ringing effect at base line, or may have a slow rise time
      and a fast decay, etc. Pulsed RF signals (and other shaped RF
      signals) may produce very localized temperatures that are higher
      for a length of time on the order of about a millisecond or
      longer. For example, a short 5 kilowatt RF pulse of less than a
      second, e.g., on the order of microseconds (e.g., 3-4
      microseconds) may be sufficient to raise the temperature of the
      mixture sufficiently to achieve the desired effect, e.g.,
      combustion of the salt water, desalination, heating, creation of
      hydrogen gas, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [00126] As discussed herein, the RF energy directed toward the
      salt water (or any solution containing salt water, or salt water
      mixture) may be RF energy having a very high field strength and
      may also be coupled through the portion of the reaction chamber
      with coupling heads having a very high Q (e.g., a Q on the order
      of 250 or more). A pulsed RF signal with a relatively higher power
      may be effective to quickly heat the salt water, etc., such as a
      pulse of HF or VHF RF energy (e.g., 27.12 MHz).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate of Combustion</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00127] Salt water combusts relatively quickly in a test tube
      using a 600 Watt 13.56 MHz RF signal. For example, sea water-
      natural or artificial-combusts in a test tube on the order of
      about 1 ml per minute initially and later combusts on the order of
      about 1 ml per every 30 seconds as a substantial amount of water
      has been combusted from the test tube. In some cases, less salt
      permits better combustion than more salt. For example, a mixture
      of 99.5% ethanol and 0.5% salt solution combusts much better
      (faster) than a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and salt solution (see
      examples below). As another example, sea water from the Gulf of
      Mexico combusted at about 2-3 ml per 90 second period at about
      1000 watts, using either a 10 ml or 100 ml test tube, with the
      upper surface of the sea water in the RF field. Comparative
      Examples<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Series 1: Experiments with ocean
        water</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00128] It was previously demonstrated that salt water made from
      sea salt mix will combust using the RP system described in the
      '530 Application. It has been confirmed that ocean water will
      combust using the ENI RF generator using the coupling circuit of
      Figures 46-49 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
      60/915,345, filed on May 1, 2007, and entitled FIELD GENERATOR FOR
      TARGETED CELL ABLATION (Attorney Docket 30274/04036) ("the '345
      Application"), the entire disclosure of which is hereby
      incorporated by reference in its entirety, with a 6" silver coated
      circular copper Tx head (single plate) and a 9.5" silver coated
      square copper Rx head (single plate).<br>
      <br>
      [00129] It is believed that the RF field that combusts salt water
      is substantially the same as the field discussed in the '345
      Application (see Figures 53-end of that application). (It is also
      believed that Ocean water will combust with the other head
      configurations discussed in the '530 Application, as well.)<br>
      <br>
      [00130] With respect to the combustion of ocean water, water from
      the Gulf of Mexico having the following characteristics was
      capable of being rapidly combusted with the above- described RF
      system (a 10 ml sample was analyzed prior to any combustion):<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 771px; height: 212px;" src="at1.jpg" alt=""><br>
      <br>
      Sulfate 5/10/2007 2633 0 mq/! 1 O 300 0[00131] In this example,
      combusted ocean water differed from uncombusted ocean water in the
      concentration of most of these components increases, while the
      concentration of calcium decreases. Two 10 ml samples of the above
      water from the Gulf of Mexico were combusted down to 5 ml each and
      combined, and the resulting 10 ml of combusted ocean water was
      analyzed to reveal the following:<br>
      <br>
      [00132 ] A white residue forms on the inside of the test tube
      after combustion of salt water. The calcium may be part of that
      residue.<br>
      <br>
      [00133 ] Using the above-described RF system, salt water will
      combust, as will solutions of HCl and NaCl. Distilled water will
      boil in the RF field, but will not combust. Adding additional sea
      salt mix (e.g., OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix) to ocean water
      causes the rate of combustion to increase. Adding sea salt mix
      sufficient to approximately triple the sodium of ocean water
      causes a dramatic increase in the rate of combustion of the
      resulting salt water mixture. Thus, the methods herein may be
      modified by including the additional step of adding additional
      ions to the sea water prior to combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [00134] Salt water (ocean water and/or salt water made from
      OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix) will begin to combust in the
      above-described RF system at RF wattages of about 250 Watts and
      salt water will continue to combust at lower wattages, e.g., about
      200 Watts, after igniting. Salt water may begin to combust
      spontaneously at higher temperatures, or may require some sort of
      igniter (e.g., a drop of salt water dropped through the RF field,
      which combusts and ignites the other salt water in the field).
      Additionally, some sort of wick (e.g., a piece of paper towel)
      extending above the surface of the salt water in the field will
      greatly increase the tendency of salt water in the RF field to
      spontaneously ignite. Filling the test tube to the brim with salt
      water and then adding a couple more drops of salt water
      facilitates ignition.<br>
      <br>
      [00135] Using a setup with about 5.5" spacing between Tx plate and
      Rx plate, and the test tube being about 2" from the Tx plate at
      about the top of the Tx plate, and applying RF to the salt water,
      the products produced from exposure of salt water to RF energy
      bum. The temperature of the burning products of salt water exposed
      to RF energy has been measured as high as about 1700&lt;0&gt;C
      using a FLIR Systems ThermaCAM P65 thermometer with ThermaCAM
      Quick View V2.0 Software, which measures temperatures up to
      1700&lt;0&gt;C (it is believed that the salt water is combusting
      at a higher temperature). Surprisingly, the temperature of the
      salt water in the test tube remains relatively low (e.g., less
      than 45[deg.]C) while the salt water is combusting.<br>
      <br>
      [00136] Without intending to be bound by this description, it is
      believed that the special RF field generated by the
      above-described RF system causes hydrogen in salt water to
      separate from oxygen, and then the hydrogen is burned in the
      presence of the released oxygen and the oxygen in the surrounding
      air.<br>
      <br>
      [00137] Heat from RF-induced combustion of salt water may be used
      in any of the traditional methods of gathering and using heat,
      e.g., a heat exchanger, a Stirling Engine, a turbine system, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [00138] Additionally, multiple Tx and Rx heads may be used at one
      or more frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Series 2: Experiments with salt water and solutions with additives
      and secondary fuels<br>
      <br>
      [00139] For all the Series 2 examples described below, a circuit
      implementation of Figure 16 was used to transmit the RF signal
      through the exemplary solutions to yield the various results.
      Unless otherwise indicated, for all examples a 13.56 MHz RF signal
      from an ENI OEM-12B RF generator having a variable power output of
      up to about 1000 Watts was applied for thirty seconds to the
      reaction chamber, which in these instances consisted of a glass
      test tube (in which the various exemplary solutions were placed)
      connected to a support arm that was positioned such that the test
      tube was suspended between the transmission head (one plate) and
      the reception head (three plates). Unless otherwise indicated, the
      salt water solutions used in carrying out the various examples
      included Gulf of Mexico salt water, Brine salt water extracted
      from an oil well (located in Erie, PA) , and a 3.5 wt % stock
      solution of OCEANIC brand Natural Sea Salt Mix having a specific
      gravity of about 1.026 g/cm&lt;3&gt;. For all examples containing
      ethanol, denatured, Apple Products(c) brand ethanol was used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Salt Water</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [00140] A first 100 ml, sample containing salt water was placed in
      a test tube and the test tube was then attached to a support arm
      and positioned between the transmission head and receiver head of
      the RF apparatus (described above). The temperature of the salt
      water was measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF
      signal at about 300 Watts was then applied for about 30 seconds,
      after which the temperature was again measured using a fiber optic
      thermometer. Starting temperature = 24.0 &lt;'&gt; C; Ending
      temperature = 25.9 &lt;[deg.]&gt; C.<br>
      <br>
      [00141] A second 100 mL sample of salt water was placed in a test
      tube and the test tube was then attached to a support arm and
      positioned between the transmission head and receiver head of the
      RF apparatus (described above). The temperature of the salt water
      was measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF
      signal at about 600 Watts was then applied and, as soon as the RF
      signal was applied, combustion of the salt water was initiated by
      momentarily placing an ordinary steel screwdriver in contact with
      the lip of the test tube. The screw driver was removed and the RF
      signal was left on for about 30 seconds as combustion of the salt
      water continued. After about 30 seconds, the RF signal was turned
      off and the combustion of the salt water ceased. The temperature
      of the salt water sample was then measured using a fiber optic
      thermometer at both the top part of the test tube and the bottom
      part of the test tube. Starting temperature = 20.5 ' C; Ending
      temperature (Top) = 66.0 &lt;"&gt;C; Ending temperature (Bottom) =
      28.0 &lt;[deg.]&gt; C.<br>
      <br>
      [00142] A third 100 mL sample of salt water was placed in a test
      tube and the test tube was then attached to a support arm and
      positioned between the transmission head and receiver head of the
      RF apparatus (described above). However, the salt water used here
      contained 1 mL of stock salt water diluted to 100 mL with
      distilled water to give a 0.0035% salt water solution. A 13.56 MHz
      RF signal at about 600 Watts was then applied for about 30
      seconds, after which the temperature was again measured using a
      fiber optic thermometer. Unlike the second sample of salt water,
      combustion of this third sample of salt water could not be
      initiated by placing an ordinary steel screwdriver in contact with
      the lip of the test tube. Starting temperature = 26.6 &lt;'&gt; C;
      Ending temperature = 75.5 ' C.<br>
      <br>
      Salt Water + Carbonate and/or CO2 (as the "Additive ")<br>
      <br>
      [00143 ] Carbon dioxide may be useful as an additive, as may other
      additives that produce carbon dioxide. Photographs 9-11 of the
      incorporated material show the combustion of ground water- here a
      sample of brine water collected from an oil well (located in Erie,
      PA), while photograph 12 of the incorporated material shows the
      combustion of a sample of brine water obtained from the Gulf of
      Mexico. We have observed that the brine water obtained from the
      Gulf of Mexico combusts in a less sporadic manner than brine water
      collected from the oil well located in Erie, PA. Without intending
      to be bound by theory, we believe high levels of carbonate salts
      present in the brine water collected from the oil well located in
      Erie, PA, that is not present in the brine water collected from
      the Gulf of Mexico, effects the combustibility of the brine water
      collected from the oil well located in Erie, PA. We further
      believe that, as the brine water collected from the oil well
      located in Erie, PA combusts carbonate salts that are present
      release carbon dioxide into the sample which acts to suppress or
      limit further combustion of the brine water as the RF signal is
      applied. Therefore, additional embodiments are contemplate wherein
      additives capable of inhibiting combustion or that are combustion
      suppressants may be added to any of the various salt water
      solutions herein disclosed in order to control or hinder the rate
      of salt water combustion or limit the amount of overall
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Salt Water + Surfactant (as the "Additive ")<br>
      <br>
      [00144] A 100 niL sample of salt water that also contained 1
      metric drop (about 0.05 mL) of an ordinary hand soap (Liquid
      Nature Antibacterial Hand Soap) was placed in a test tube and the
      test tube was then attached to a support arm and positioned
      between the transmission head and receiver head of the RF
      apparatus (described above). A 13.56 MHz RF signal at about 600
      Watts was then applied to the sample and as soon as the RF signal
      was applied, combustion of the salt water sample was initiated
      immediately. No external perturbation of the test tube (by a
      screwdriver, a drop of salt water, use of a wick or otherwise) was
      required. The RF signal was repeatedly switched on and off; each
      time the RF signal was switched on the salt water sample
      immediately began combusting, while each time the RF signal was
      switched off the salt water sample immediately ceased combusting.<br>
      <br>
      Salt Water + Ethanol (as the "Secondary Fuel")<br>
      <br>
      [00145] A first 100 niL sample containing a mixture of 50 mL of
      ethanol and 50 mL of salt water was placed in a test tube and the
      test tube was then attached to a support arm and positioned
      between the transmission head and receiver head of the RF
      apparatus (described above). A 13.56 MHz RF signal at several
      hundred Watts was then applied to the sample and, as soon as the
      RF signal was applied, combustion of the sample was initiated by
      momentarily placing an ordinary steel screwdriver in contact with
      the lip of the test tube. Once the RF signal was turned off the
      combustion of the sample ceased. Surprisingly, in the absence of
      any applied RF signal combustion of the sample could not be
      initiated even when an open flame was used to attempt initiation
      of combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [00146] A second 100 mL sample containing a mixture of 99.5 mL of
      ethanol and 0.5 mL of salt water was placed in a test tube and the
      test tube was then attached to a support arm and positioned
      between the transmission head and receiver head of the RF
      apparatus (described above). The temperature of the salt water was
      measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF signal at
      several hundred Watts was then applied for about 15 seconds, after
      which the temperature was again measured using a fiber optic
      thermometer. Starting temperature = 26.6 ' C; Ending temperature =
      62.0 ' C. This example shows that an effective amount of salt
      (e.g., solid salt or a salt solution) can be added to enhance
      heating of liquids.<br>
      <br>
      [00147] A third 100 mL sample containing a mixture of 99.5 mL of
      ethanol and 0.5 mL of salt water was placed in a test tube and the
      test tube was then attached to a support arm and positioned
      between the transmission head and receiver head of the RF
      apparatus (described above). The temperature of the salt water was
      measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF signal at
      several hundred Watts was then applied and, as soon as the RF
      signal was applied, combustion of the sample was initiated by
      momentarily placing an ordinary steel screwdriver in contact with
      the lip of the test tube. Combustion of the sample was highly
      energetic and resulted in a very large flame as compared to RF
      combustion of a stock solution of salt water that did not contain
      any ethanol. The screw driver was removed and the RF signal was
      left on for 15 seconds as energetic combustion of the sample
      continued. Combustion was so energetic that some of the sample
      solution bubbled out of the test tube and onto the laboratory
      floor when it continued to combust. After about 15 seconds, the RF
      signal was turned off. However, combustion of the sample did not
      cease and the sample had to be extinguished using a fire
      extinguisher.<br>
      <br>
      CONTROL 1: Distilled Water<br>
      <br>
      [00148] A 100 mL sample containing distilled water was placed in a
      test tube and the test tube was then attached to a support arm and
      positioned between the transmission head and receiver head of the
      RF apparatus (described above). The temperature of the distilled
      water was measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF
      signal at about 300 Watts was then applied for about 30 seconds,
      after which the temperature was again measured using a fiber optic
      thermometer. Starting temperature = 24.0 &lt;[deg.]&gt; C; Ending
      temperature = 24.8 &lt;[deg.]&gt; C.<br>
      <br>
      CONTROL 2: Tap Water<br>
      <br>
      [00149] A 100 mL sample containing ordinary tap water was placed
      in a test tube and the test tube was then attached to a support
      arm and positioned between the transmission head and receiver head
      of the RF apparatus (described above). The temperature of the
      ordinary tap water was measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A
      13.56 MHz RF signal at about 300 Watts was then applied for about
      30 seconds, after which the temperature was again measured using a
      fiber optic thermometer. Starting temperature = 23.7 &lt;'&gt; C;
      Ending temperature = 47.8 ' C.<br>
      <br>
      CONTROL 3: 100% Ethanol<br>
      <br>
      [00150] A 100 mL sample containing ethanol was placed in a test
      tube and the test tube was then attached to a support arm and
      positioned between the transmission head and receiver head of the
      RF apparatus (described above). The temperature of the ethanol was
      measured using a fiber optic thermometer. A 13.56 MHz RF signal at
      several hundred Watts was then applied for about 15 seconds, after
      which the temperature was again measured using a fiber optic
      thermometer. Starting temperature = 25.0 &lt;'&gt; C; Ending
      temperature = 30.0 ' C.<br>

      [00151] While the present invention has been illustrated by the
      description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have
      been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the
      applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the
      appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and
      modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For
      example, in all of the various systems and methods presented
      herein, the RF electromagnetic signal may be applied until no
      liquid remains, or until substantially no liquid remains, or for a
      shorter period of time. Additionally, the steps of methods herein
      may generally be performed in any order, unless the context
      dictates that specific steps be performed in a specific order.
      Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to
      the specific details, representative apparatus and methods, and
      illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures
      may be made from such details without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the applicant's general inventive concept.<br>
