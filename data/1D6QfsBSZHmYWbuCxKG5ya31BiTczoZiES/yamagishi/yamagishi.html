      A toothpaste has been developed that can rapidly and seamlessly
      fix little cavities without need for drilling.<br>
      <br>
      Dental paste of synthetic tooth enamel could revolutionise
      treatment of tiny early lesions, says the study published today in
      the journal Nature by Dr Kazue Yamagishi, of the FAP Dental
      Institute, Tokyo.<br>
      <br>
      Tooth decay is normally treated by removal of the affected part,
      then filling the hole with a resin or metal alloy. This is less
      than ideal because a lot of healthy tooth must be removed to make
      the fillings stick.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Yamagishi and colleagues developed a crystalline white paste of
      modified hydroxyapatite, which is chemically and structurally
      similar to natural enamel, and used it to repair early damage to a
      lower premolar tooth.<br>
      <br>
      An electron microscope showed that the natural and artificial
      enamel became integrated as if they were one substance.<br>
      <br>
      The paste seamlessly repaired early damage caused by acid forming
      bacteria.<br>

      Dentists, put away your drills. Synthetic tooth enamel can seal
      tiny cavities without the pain, and with less damage to the
      patient’s teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Cavities form when acid produced by mouth bacteria starts eating
      away at the tooth’s protective enamel layer. Early on, these
      lesions are too small for fillers such as resins to stick
      properly, so dentists have to drill bigger holes that destroy some
      healthy parts of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      Now Kazue Yamagishi’s team at the FAP Dental Institute in Tokyo
      has found that a fine paste of hydroxyapatite crystals, the
      material of which natural enamel is made, can repair small
      cavities in just 15 minutes. The paste fills cavities with long
      crystals that bond with the tooth’s own structure. But using it
      needs care. The strongly acidic mix required to promote crystal
      growth would be painful if it touched the gums.<br>

          <b>Composition and method for prevention and treatment of
            dental caries</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to compositions and methods for
      prevention and treatment of dental caries. A dental paste is
      produced from a silicate containing hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) powder,
      an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous solution
      of phosphoric acid. The dental paste is applied to an enamel of a
      tooth, dissolves a portion of the enamel and integrates with the
      enamel of the tooth to produce a synthetic enamel. The dental
      paste crystallizes by integrating with a chemically incomplete
      portion of the tooth. The synthetic enamel comprises a chemical
      composition and a crystal structure approximately the same as the
      hydroxyapatite of a tooth prior to treatment with the dental
      paste.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application
      Ser. No. 60/526,890, filed on Dec. 4, 2003, and the entirety of
      this application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to dental treatments, and more
      particularly to a composition and method for the prevention and
      treatment of dental caries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The proper care, maintenance and repair of teeth is of utmost
      concern for people all over the world. From the earliest ages,
      people are taught dental maintenance steps including teeth
      brushing, teeth flossing and regular dental checkups. The
      prevention of dental caries is important for dental health. Almost
      20 percent of children between the ages of 2 and 4 have had dental
      caries, and by the age of 17, about four out of five people have
      had at least one carious lesion (i.e., cavity) or restoration
      (filling). Over two-thirds of adults between 35 and 44 years old
      have lost at least one permanent tooth and about one-half of
      people 75 years or older have had root caries affecting at least
      one tooth. Glock, Martha; Horowitz, Alice M.; Canto, Maria T.,
      compilers, Diagnosis and Management of Dental Caries. Bethesda
      (Md.): National Library of Medicine; 2001 February, Current
      Bibliographies in Medicine (CBM), no. 2001-1 (available at
      www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/dental_caries.html).<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries are common oral and infectious diseases that result
      in the destruction of the tooth structure by the invasion of acid
      forming bacteria that are found in dental plaque, an intraoral
      biofilm. Scientific evidence has shown that the initiation of
      dental caries requires a relatively high proportion of mutans
      streptococci bacteria which is found within dental plaque. This
      bacteria adheres well to the surface of the tooth and produces
      higher amounts of acid from sugars than other bacteria types.
      Dental caries often appears as a white chalky area on the enamel
      of the tooth, that later softens and progresses to the breakdown
      of the tooth structure. Depending upon the severity of the dental
      caries, the disease can lead to the loss of tooth minerals, and
      the extraction of the tooth. Mineral loss is inhibited by the
      availability of fluoride in the mouth, as the fluoride promotes
      remineralization of the tooth structure which leads to rebuilt and
      stronger outer layers of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries are dependent on dietary sucrose that change both
      the thickness and the chemical nature of the plaque. A diet with a
      high proportion of sucrose increases the risk of dental caries.
      When the plaque bacteria come into contact with various foods or
      liquids containing simple sugars, the bacteria metabolize the
      sugars and make organic acids as a metabolic by-product. If the
      acids are not buffered by saliva, the acids dissolve the surface
      of the apatite crystals of adjacent tooth structure, a process
      known as demineralization. In thick gel-like plaque, the pH falls
      with a couple of seconds of contact with dietary sugars. When the
      pH is neutral, the same crystals can regrow, using calcium,
      phosphate, and fluoride from saliva causing remineralization.
      Dental carie disease begins when demineralization outweighs
      remineralization.<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries can be modified by fluoride. The minerals of enamel,
      cementum and dentin are a highly substituted calcium phosphate
      salt called apatite. While the apatite of newly formed teeth is
      relatively soluble, rich in carbonate and low in fluoride,
      demineralization and remineralization in a fluoride rich
      environment creates apatite of lower carbonate, higher fluoride
      and lower solubility. Fluorides present in foods, drinks,
      dentrifices, oral rinses and filling materials can reduce the
      solubility of teeth and reduce the risk of dental caries.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art has not provided an adequate solution to preventing
      dental caries from forming or for treating dental caries.
      Adherence to proper dental care, including tooth brushing,
      flossing and regular dental checkups, may prevent the formation of
      dental caries. Prior art devices and methods have provided
      mechanical solutions for treating dental caries. The prior art
      mechanical devices and methods of treating dental caries are
      invasive and may require local anesthesia. Prior art devices use
      low speed and high speed handpieces in drilling procedures to
      remove dental caries, followed by a subsequent placement of
      restorative materials to replace the void. Prior art treatments
      using organic resin, polymer and inorganic dental cement have not
      been successfully used to replace early lesion of dental caries.
      The organic resins, polymers and inorganic dental cements do not
      bury the dental carie for a sufficient time without deep
      excavation of the affected dental carie. Because an affected part
      of the dental carie is microscopic in the early stages, organic
      resins, polymers and inorganic dental cements lie on the tooth and
      are easily removed over time. The difference in the rates of
      thermal expansion between the enamel and the organic resin,
      polymer and inorganic dental cements prevent adequate adhesion
      between the enamel and the organic resin, polymer and inorganic
      dental cements.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,399 to Rentsch discloses a polymerisable
      dental material and use of apatite fillers in the dental material.
      The Rentsch material has variably adjustable transparency, good
      polishability, high strength and capacity to release and absorb
      ions into and from a biological environment. The Rentsch material
      is a dental material filler that only provides an aesthetic
      solution for the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,311 to Blackshear discloses a method of
      preventing the formation of dental caries and other oral lesions
      and removing sugars from an oral cavity. The Blackshear method
      includes an oral hygiene composition that includes at least one
      carbohydrate-binding protein, and most preferably a lectin or
      other sucrose or galactose/glucose binding protein. The Blackshear
      method is used to remove sugars and is not effective for
      preventing non-sugar related sources of dental caries. In
      addition, the Blackshear method does not integrate into the tooth
      to prevent subsequent caries or produce a hydroxyapatite synthetic
      enamel.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,454,566 to Lynch et al. discloses an apparatus for
      the treatment of dental caries that includes a source of oxidizing
      gas and a handpiece for delivering the gas to a tooth. A cup
      attached to a handpiece of the Lynch et al. device is provided for
      receiving the gas and exposing a selected area of the tooth having
      the dental carie to the gas, the cup having a resilient edge for
      engaging and sealing the tooth. The Lynch et al. cup does not
      adequately seal the tooth to prevent escape of the gas into the
      mouth of a patient, thereby exposing the patient to health risks.
      The Lynch et al. device can remove the existing dental carie
      without preventing future dental caries and leaves a void in the
      surface of the enamel of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides compositions and methods for the
      prevention and treatment of dental caries. The compositions of the
      present invention offer several advantages over conventional
      compositions used to prevent and treat dental caries of a tooth
      including integrating with a chemically incomplete portion of the
      tooth to crystallize the chemically incomplete portion of the
      tooth and replace the dental carie; and integrating with an enamel
      of the tooth to form a synthetic enamel.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a dental paste to treat a dental carie of
      a tooth comprising: a silicate containing hydroxyapatite powder;
      an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide; and an aqueous solution
      of phosphoric acid.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a method of treating a dental carie of a

      <br>
      The present invention is a method of making a dental paste to
      prevent and treat a dental carie comprising: mixing an aqueous
      solution of phosphoric acid-sodium silicate and a calcium
      phosphate; filtering a precipitate of a mixture of the aqueous
      solution of phosphoric acid-sodium silicate and the calcium
      phosphate; reducing the precipitate to a plurality of small
      particles and passing the plurality of small particles through a
      sleeve to yield a silicate containing hydroxyapatite powder; and
      mixing the silicate containing hydroxyapatite powder with an
      aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous solution of
      phosphoric acid.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a method of whitening a tooth that
      includes: applying a dental paste comprising a silicate containing
      hydroxyapatite powder mixed with an aqueous solution of hydrogen
      peroxide and an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid to the tooth;
      and washing an excess amount of the dental paste from the tooth.
      The method may further include applying a second dental paste
      comprising a fluorized apatite powder mixed with an aqueous
      solution of hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous solution of
      phosphoric acid to the tooth and washing an excess amount of the
      second dental paste from the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to offering all of the advantages discussed above, the
      compositions and methods of the present invention are safe, simple
      to prepare, effective and require a short duration and painless
      procedure. These and other advantages of the present invention
      will be obvious through the embodiments described hereinafter.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides compositions and methods for the
      prevention and treatment of dental caries. An embodiment of the
      present invention provides a dental paste comprising a fluorized
      apatite (FHAp) powder, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide
      and an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid. In an embodiment of
      the present invention, the fluorized apatite powder is comprised
      of a calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder and an aqueous
      solution of sodium fluoride. Another embodiment of the present
      invention provides a dental paste comprising silicate containing
      hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) powder, an aqueous solution of hydrogen
      peroxide and an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid.<br>
      <br>
      For a tooth with a dental carie, a dental paste of the present
      invention, either alone or in combination, is applied to a dental
      carie in an enamel of a tooth and then integrates with the enamel
      of the tooth to form a synthetic enamel. The integration of the
      enamel and the synthetic enamel occurs within the depth of the
      natural enamel of the tooth. The integration of the synthetic
      enamel and the enamel of the tooth should not extend beyond the
      dentin and enamel junction, although it may extend beyond the
      dentin and enamel junction. The dental paste integrates with the
      existing chemically incomplete portion of the enamel of the tooth
      by an inorganic crystallization process which completes the
      chemically and physically incomplete portion of the enamel of the
      tooth to replace the dental carie. For a healthy tooth, the dental
      paste of the present invention, either alone or in combination, is
      applied to the tooth, integrates with the enamel of the tooth to
      form a synthetic enamel and completes the incomplete natural
      enamel structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a vertical cross section of a tooth 15. The tooth 15
      comprises an exposed crown 27 and a root 29. The crown 27 is
      usually at least partially covered by an enamel 16, an outer layer
      of a hard substance similar to bone. Beneath the enamel 16 is a
      dentin 17, an intermediate layer of material which is also similar
      to bone but not as hard as the enamel 16. The crown 27 comprises
      the enamel 16 and a portion of an outermost section of the dentin
      17 located proximal to the enamel 16. The dentin 17 surrounds an
      inner pulp cavity 18 comprised of a pulp 19. Blood vessels and
      nerves reach the inner pulp cavity 18 through a channel called a
      root canal 20 that penetrates the root 29. The root 29 is the
      lower portion of the tooth 15 that comprises the root canal 20,
      and at least a portion of the inner pulp cavity 18. A cementum 21,
      a thin coating, covers the root 29 of the tooth 15.<br>
      <br>
      The enamel 16 is calcified bone that serves as a protective layer
      of the tooth 15. The enamel 16 is comprised of a plurality of
      small enamel rods or prisms which form the framework of the tooth
      15. The enamel 16 is translucent and can vary in color from
      yellowish to grayish white based upon variations in thickness,
      translucent properties, and the quality of the crystal structure
      and surface stains of the enamel 16. The enamel 16 is comprised of
      about 96% inorganic materials, about 1% organic materials and
      about 3% water. The main inorganic material components of the
      enamel 16 are calcium and phosphorus as a hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      The dentin 17 is a light yellow and porous substance that is more
      radiolucent than the enamel 16. The dentin 17 comprises the
      largest portion of the tooth 15 and is harder than bone, but
      softer than the enamel 16. The dentin 17 carries sensations such
      as temperature and pain to the pulp 19. The dentin 17 comprises
      about 70% inorganic material and about 30% organic material and
      water. The main inorganic material components of the dentin are
      calcium and phosphorus as a hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      The pulp 19 is the only soft tissue of the tooth 15 and makes the
      tooth 15 a living tissue. The pulp 19 contains blood vessels,
      nerves and other cells and supplies nutrients to the tooth 15 and
      the nerve endings of the pulp transmit sensations such as pain and
      temperature. The pulp 19 responds to irritation, either by forming
      reparative secondary dentin or by becoming inflamed.<br>
      <br>
      The cementum 21 is a bonelike tissue that is light yellow in color
      and slightly lighter in color than the dentin 17. The cementum 21
      is comprised of about 55% organic material and about 45% inorganic
      material. The main inorganic material components are calcium
      salts.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a top view of the tooth 15 comprising a dental carie
      44, shown as a line at an approximate center portion of the enamel
      16 of the tooth 15. FIG. 2 shows the top of the tooth 15 before a
      treatment of the tooth 15 by a dental paste 36 containing FHAp of
      the present invention. The dental carie 44, also known as a
      cavity, is a soft, decayed area in the tooth 15 that can progress
      from the enamel 16 to the dentin 17 and ultimately the pulp 19 of
      the tooth 15. Bacteria present in the mouth convert all foods, and
      especially sugars and starches into acids. Bacteria, acid, food
      debris and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance
      called plaque that adheres to the teeth. Plaque that is not
      removed from the teeth 15 mineralizes into calculus or tartar. The
      acids in the plaque dissolve at least a portion of the enamel 16
      of the tooth 15, creating the dental carie 44.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows a top view of the tooth 15 after treatment of the
      dental carie 44 through an application of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp of the present invention that integrates with the
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15 to form a synthetic enamel 46. As shown
      in FIG. 3, the dental carie 44, shown as the line in the center
      portion of the tooth of FIG. 2, is removed and replaced with the
      synthetic enamel 46.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also prevents the formation of the dental
      carie 44 in a manner similar to the treatment of the dental carie
      44. The chemistry and mechanism for preventing the formation of a
      dental carie 44 and the treatment of a dental carie 44 are
      similar. In one embodiment of the present invention, for a healthy
      tooth 15, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is applied to the
      tooth, integrates with the enamel of the tooth 15 to form a
      synthetic enamel 46, and completes the incomplete natural enamel
      structure. In another embodiment of the present invention, the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied to the tooth,
      integrates with the enamel of the tooth 15 to form a synthetic
      enamel 46, and completes the incomplete natural enamel structure.
      In another embodiment of the present invention, both the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp and the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp
      are applied to the tooth, integrate with the enamel of the tooth
      15 to form a synthetic enamel 46 and completes the incomplete
      natural enamel structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 can be used to discuss the prevention of the
      formation of a dental carie 44. A tooth 15 having an incomplete
      enamel structure is susceptible to the formation of the dental
      carie 44. The formation of a dental carie 44 on a healthy tooth 15
      involves a process whereby the healthy tooth 15 has a
      susceptibility to a dental carie 44 and, if not properly treated,
      progresses to the formation of a dental carie 44. A dental paste
      of the present invention, either alone or in combination,
      integrates with the incomplete enamel structure of a tooth 15 to
      form the synthetic enamel 46 and mechanically and chemically
      completes the enamel structure of the tooth 15 to prevent the
      formation of the dental carie 44. The extent of integration is
      governed by the depth of the natural enamel 16 of the tooth 15.
      The dental paste completes the apatite of the enamel 16 to prevent
      the formation of the dental carie 44.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the dental paste is
      comprised of a fluorized apatite (FHAp) powder, an aqueous
      solution of hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous solution of
      phosphoric acid. In an embodiment of the present invention, the
      fluorized apatite powder is comprised of a calcium phosphate and
      an aqueous solution of sodium fluoride. Calcium phosphates,
      especially hydroxyapatite, have physiochemical properties similar
      to those of the enamel 16. In an embodiment of the present
      invention, the calcium phosphate is a calcium deficient
      hydroxyapatite powder. In another embodiment of the present
      invention, the calcium phosphate is a hydroxyapatite. In another
      embodiment of the present invention, the calcium phosphate is a
      hydroxyapatite and a calcium deficient hydroxyapatite. In another
      embodiment of the present invention, the calcium of the calcium
      phosphate may be substituted partially by strontium, barium,
      cadmium, lead, copper, sodium, potassium and others. Preparation
      of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp that prevents and treats
      the dental carie 44 consists of several steps.<br>
      <br>
      The hydroxyapatite includes calcium phosphate materials with
      various chemical compositions. In one embodiment of the present
      invention, the chemical composition is Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. In another
      embodiment of the present invention, the hydroxyapatite is a
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite with a calcium to phosphorus
      molar ratio between about 0.5 and about 1.67. In another
      embodiment of the present invention, the hydroxyapatite is a
      calcium excess hydroxyapatite with a calcium to phosphorus molar
      ratio larger than about 1.67. In another embodiment of the present
      invention, the hydroxyapatite is a carbonated apatite with either
      the whole or part of the PO4&lt;3-&gt; ions and/or OH&lt;-&gt; ion
      are substituted by the CO3&lt;2-&gt; ion. In another embodiment of
      the present invention, the hydroxyapatite is a fluorapatite and a
      chlorapatite in which either the whole or part of the OH&lt;-&gt;
      ion are substituted by F- ions and/or Cl- ions. In another
      embodiment of the present invention, the hydroxyapatite is a
      cation substituted hydroxyapatite in which part of the calcium
      (Ca) ion is substituted by a metal such as magnesium, zinc,
      strontium and others. In another embodiment of the present
      invention, the hydroxyapatite is a combination of the calcium
      deficient hydroxyapatite, the fluorapatite and chlorapatite.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the present invention, the fluorized
      apatite powder is comprised of the hydroxyapatite and other
      thermodynamically metastable calcium phosphates. A
      thermodynamically metastable material transforms to the
      hydroxyapatite with time under wet conditions such as in solution
      or in gel like paste, especially when the hydroxyapatite coexists.
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the thermodynamically
      metastable calcium phosphate is amorphous calcium phosphate having
      a representative chemical composition of Ca9(PO4)6*nH2O. In
      another embodiment of the present invention, the thermodynamically
      metastable calcium phosphate is selected from the group consisting
      of octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4*5H2O, dicalcium
      phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4*2H2O), dicalcium phosphate anhydrous
      CaHPO4, tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite) including [alpha] and
      [beta] phases (Ca3(PO4)2, [beta]-Ca3(PO4)2, tetracalcium phosphate
      (Ca4(PO4)2O), monocalcium phosphate monohydrate Ca(H2PO4)2*H2O and
      monocalcium phosphate anhydrous (Ca(H2PO4)2). Those skilled in the
      art will recognize there are other thermodynamically metastable
      calcium phosphates known in the art that are within the spirit and
      scope of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present
      invention, about 1 gram (g) of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite
      powder (calcium to phosphorus (Ca/P) ratio of about 1.64)
      (available from UBE Material, Ltd., Japan) is added to about 100
      milliliters (ml) of an about 200 millimolar (mM) concentration
      aqueous solution of sodium fluoride. After the mixture of the
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder and the sodium fluoride is
      stirred for about one hour at about 60[deg.] C., the mixture is
      filtered and a precipitate from the mixture of the calcium
      deficient hydroxyapatite powder and the sodium fluoride is
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the mixture of the
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder and the sodium fluoride is
      stirred with a Bioshaker. The precipitate is then washed with
      water and dried at about 110[deg.] C. for about 24 hours, yielding
      a fluorized apatite powder. In an embodiment of the present
      invention, the fluorized apatite powder is a fluoride treated
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder.<br>
      <br>
      In the process of the formation of the fluorized apatite (FHAp)
      powder, the OH of the calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder
      (Ca10(PO2)6(OH2) is substituted with F&lt;-&gt; for stability,
      allowing the calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder to convert
      into the stable fluorized apatite powder (Ca10(PO4)6F2). The
      fluoride content of the fluorized apatite powder can be about 0.3
      weight to weight percent (w/w %). In the present invention, the
      fluoride content of the fluorized apatite powder preferably is
      between about 0.01 to about 1.0 weight to weight percent (w/w %).
      The fluorized apatite powder is crushed and passed through a 100
      mesh sleeve (aperture size about 150 microns). About 2 ml of a mix
      of an about 35% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and an about
      85% aqueous solution of phosphoric acid is added to and mixed with
      about 1.5 g of the fluorized apatite powder to yield the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp of the present invention. Those skilled
      in the art will recognize that various aqueous solutions and
      powders known in the art can be used with the present invention
      and other amounts and concentrations of the aqueous solutions and
      powders in addition to other processing conditions known in the
      art are within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The phosphoric acids used to yield the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp includes, but are not limited to, metaphosphoric acid,
      pyrophosphoric acid, ortho-phosphoric acid and triphosphate. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, the phosphoric acid
      content of the dental paste 36containing FHAp is between about 1.0
      to about 20 w/w %. Those skilled in the art will recognize other
      acids known in the art can be used with the present invention and
      are within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      After the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is mixed, the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp is applied to the enamel 16 of the tooth
      15 where the dental paste 36 containing FHAp integrates with the
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15. In integrating with the enamel 16, the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp fills in a in a lattice of the
      hydroxyapatite compound comprising the enamel 16. The dental paste
      36 containing FHAp crystallizes with a chemically incomplete
      portion of the enamel 16 of the tooth, forming fluorized apatite
      crystals of the synthetic enamel 46. In a preferred embodiment of
      the present invention, the ingredients used to make the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp are mixed prior to use, as the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp will undergo gradual loss of activity.
      About fifteen minutes after application of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp to the enamel 16, the excess dental paste 36
      containing FHAp that has not integrated with the enamel 16 is
      removed by washing the tooth 15 with a washing medium. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, the washing medium
      is purified water. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
      the dental paste can remain on the tooth for various lengths of
      time and be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      After application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp, the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp dissolves a portion of the enamel
      16 of the tooth 15. The dental paste 36 containing FHAp is
      comprised of a strong acid having a pH of about 1-2 from the
      addition of the aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide and
      phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is the primary contributor to
      the low pH of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp. The dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp dissolves the enamel 16 on a microscopic
      level to allow for the integration of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp within the enamel 16. The dental paste 36
      containing FHAp is removed after a specified time to dissolve a
      specified amount of the enamel 16 to produce the synthetic enamel
      46 through integration of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp.
      After dissolution of a portion of the enamel 16, there is a
      recrystallization as the fluorized apatite crystals of the
      synthetic enamel 46 are formed. The extent of integration is
      governed by the depth of the natural enamel 16 of the tooth 15.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp is applied to the enamel 16 of the tooth 15
      several times. In an embodiment of the present invention, the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp is applied to the enamel 16 of the
      tooth 15 from about two times to about six times. In an embodiment
      of the present invention, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is
      applied to the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 about three times. Each
      application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp to the tooth 15
      increases the thickness of the synthetic enamel 46, allowing for
      additional integration of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp into
      the enamel 16 of the tooth 15. After each application of the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp to the tooth 15, the excess dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp is removed by washing the tooth 15 with
      the washing medium. In an alternative embodiment of the present
      invention, a high and/or low speed handpiece is used in addition
      to the application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp. Those
      skilled in the art will recognize that any number of applications
      of the dental paste to the tooth are within the spirit and scope
      of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will also
      recognize that the dental paste 36 containing FHAp can be removed
      from the tooth 15 in many ways known in the art and be within the
      spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      For a tooth showing a susceptibility to the formation of a dental
      carie 44, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp integrates with the
      incomplete enamel structure to form the synthetic enamel 46. The
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp mechanically and chemically
      completes the enamel structure of the tooth 15, completing the
      apatite of the enamel 16 to prevent the dental carie 44 from
      forming.<br>
      <br>
      The dental paste 36 containing FHAp of the present invention
      treats the dental carie 44 and replaces the dental carie 44 with
      the synthetic enamel 46. Those skilled in the art will recognize
      the dental paste 36 containing FHAp can be used to treat dental
      caries 44 in various stages ranging from a stage where there is no
      dental carie 44 to stages where the dental carie 44 is deep within
      the tooth 15 and be within the spirit and scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      For the tooth having a dental carie 44, the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp is used to treat the dental carie 44 existing in
      the enamel 16 of the tooth 15. In another embodiment of the
      present invention, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is used to
      treat the dental carie 44 that has advanced into the dentin 17 of
      the tooth 15. In another embodiment of the present invention, the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp can be used as a cement. Those
      skilled in the art will recognize the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp can be used to treat dental caries 44 that have progressed
      into various portions of the tooth 15 and are within the spirit
      and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4A shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a
      portion of a polished cross section, including the synthetic
      enamel 46, of the tooth 15 after application of the dental paste
      36 containing FHAp of the present invention. In the embodiment
      shown in FIG. 4A, the synthetic enamel 46, the enamel 16, the
      dentin 17 and the pulp 19 are shown. After at least one
      application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp, the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp integrates with the enamel 16 to form the
      synthetic enamel 46. In the embodiment of the present invention
      shown in FIG. 4A, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is strongly
      integrated with the enamel 16 shown by the lack of contrast
      between the enamel 16 and the synthetic enamel 46. The transition
      zone 50 is shown as the area where the synthetic enamel 46
      integrates with the enamel 16. The transition zone 50 is shown
      where the light grey intersects the darker grey.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4B shows a back scattered scanning electron microscope image
      of a portion of the polished cross section, including the
      synthetic enamel 46, of the tooth 15 after application of the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp of the present invention. FIG. 4B
      is the same tooth 15 and view as FIG. 4A, but with the back
      scatter technique used to show the absence of a contrast between
      the synthetic enamel 46 and the enamel 16. In the embodiment of
      the present invention shown in FIG. 4B, the back scattered
      scanning electron microscope image shows the portion of the
      polished cross section of the tooth 15 as if the polished cross
      section of the tooth 15 was comprised of a single constituent. By
      showing the polished section of the tooth 15 as a single
      constituent, the back scattered scanning electron microscope image
      of FIG. 4B confirms the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is
      strongly integrated with the enamel 16 to form a strong synthetic
      enamel 46. In addition, without a contrast between the applied
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp and the enamel 16, FIG. 4B shows
      the integrated dental paste 36 containing FHAp has a similar
      chemical composition as the enamel 16.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4C shows a secondary scanning electron microscope image of an
      inner structure of the portion of the polished tooth 15, including
      the synthetic enamel 46, after application of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp of the present invention. In the embodiment of the
      present invention shown in FIG. 4C, the thickness of the synthetic
      enamel 46 is between about 30 microns and about 50 microns. As
      discussed previously, various factors including the number of
      applications of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp to the tooth
      15 affect the thickness of the synthetic enamel 46. As shown in
      FIG. 4C, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp integrates into the
      enamel 16 producing the synthetic enamel 46, shown as a net like
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4D shows a high magnification secondary scanning electron
      microscope image of the synthetic enamel 46 after application of
      the dental paste 36 containing FHAp of the present invention. As
      shown in FIG. 4C, the synthetic enamel 46 comprises a plurality of
      micron-scaled pillar crystals 25. The plurality of pillar crystals
      25 are arranged in a direction not parallel (approximately
      perpendicular) to a surface of the tooth 15. The structure and
      direction arrangement of the plurality of pillar crystals 25 of
      the synthetic enamel 46 is approximately the same as the structure
      and arrangement direction of the enamel rods or prisms of the
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15.<br>
      <br>
      The integration of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp into the
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15 fills in a plurality of voids in a
      lattice of the hydroxyapatite compound comprising the enamel 16.
      The dental paste 36 containing FHAp integrates with a chemically
      incomplete portion of the tooth 15 to crystallize the chemically
      incomplete portion of the tooth 15. The integration of the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp results in the pillar crystal 25
      morphology shown in FIG. 4D. The plurality of hydroxyapatite
      crystals of the enamel 16 are products of the integration of the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp with the enamel 16. When compared
      to the chemical composition and the crystal structure of the
      hydroxyapatite of the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 that has not been
      treated with the dental paste 36 containing FHAp, the chemical
      composition and the crystal structure of the synthetic enamel 46
      shown in FIG. 4B and FIG. 4D are about the same as the chemical
      composition and crystal structure of the untreated tooth 15 prior
      to treatment with the present invention. In addition, the
      crystallization of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp to the
      enamel 16 provides a smooth contrast between the dental paste 36
      and the enamel 16.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5A shows a wide scan x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
      spectrum of the synthetic enamel 46 of the present invention. FIG.
      5A shows a graph of the intensity versus the binding energy. When
      compared to a XPS spectrum of the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 that
      has not been treated with the dental paste 36 containing FHAp, the
      various intensity peaks shown in FIG. 5A corresponding to the
      synthetic enamel 46 approximately coincide with the peaks of the
      XPS spectrum of the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 prior to treatment
      with the present invention. Intensity peaks corresponding to F,
      Ca2s, Ca2p3, P2s and P2p of the synthetic enamel 46 are shown on
      FIG. 5A and coincide with F, Ca2s, Ca2p3, P2s and P2p intensity
      peaks of the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 prior to treatment with the
      present invention. The synthetic enamel 46 comprises Ca&lt;2+&gt;
      , P&lt;5+&gt; and F- ions that are fundamentally the same as the
      Ca&lt;2+&gt; , P&lt;5+&gt; and F&lt;-&gt; ions in the enamel 16.
      In addition, the amount of F&lt;-&gt; ions in the synthetic enamel
      46 is about the same as the amount of F- ions in the enamel 16.
      The Ca/P atomic ratio of the synthetic enamel 46 in the present
      invention is about 1.58 while a Ca/P atomic ratio of the enamel is
      about 1.64.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5B shows a x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthetic
      enamel 46 of the present invention. When compared to a XRD pattern
      of the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 prior to treatment with the
      present invention, the detected peaks shown in FIG. 5B
      corresponding to the synthetic enamel 46 approximately coincide
      with the detected peaks of the XRD pattern of the enamel 16 of the
      tooth 15 prior to treatment with the present invention. Sharp
      intense 002 reflections indicate that the synthetic enamel 46
      consists of single crystals with arranging [0001] direction. The
      apatite crystal is bounded by the (0001) crystallographic face
      (also known as the c-face), and the (10{overscore (1)}0) face
      (also known as the a face). The (0001) face corresponds to the
      basal face of the apatite crystal while the (10{overscore (1)}0)
      face corresponds to the sides of the crystal. The single crystals
      arranged in the [0001] direction are in a direction approximately
      perpendicular to the (0001) face.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 6A-6C show the integration of the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp of the present invention with the enamel 16 and how the
      morphology of the fluoride treated hydroxyapatite crystals are
      extended to [0001] direction. FIG. 6A shows an atomic force
      microscopy (AFM) image of a polished surface of the enamel 16 of
      the tooth 15 before treatment with the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp of the present invention. FIG. 6A illustrates a plurality of
      stretched lines resulting from the polishing of the surface. FIG.
      6B shows the AFM image of the polished surface of the tooth 15
      after application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp to the
      enamel 16 for about one minute and a subsequent rinse of the
      dental paste 36 containing FHAp with a washing medium from the
      tooth 15. FIG. 6B shows an intermediate step where the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp dissolves a portion of the enamel 16 and
      the dental paste 36 containing FHAp is partially integrated into
      the enamel 16. FIG. 6C shows the AFM image of the polished surface
      of the tooth 15 after about 15 minutes of treatment and a
      subsequent rinse of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp with the
      washing medium from the tooth 15. As shown in FIG. 6C, the surface
      of the tooth 15 is covered with particles having diameters between
      about 30 nanometers (nm) and about 50 nm. Combined with the SEM
      images of FIGS. 4C-4D, FIG. 6C shows that the particles are the
      top part of the pillar crystals 25 shown in FIG. 4D.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the present invention, a dental paste 38
      containing SiHAp is applied to the tooth 15 either alone or in
      addition to the dental paste 36 containing FHAp to enhance the
      prevention and the treatment of the dental carie 44. In one
      embodiment of the present invention, the dental paste 38
      containing SiHAp is applied after application of the dental paste
      36 containing FHAp. In another embodiment of the present
      invention, the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied before
      application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp. The dental
      paste 38 containing SiHAp can enhance the treatment of the dental
      carie 44 and help promote the replacement of the dental carie 44.
      The SiHAp powder may be applied to the tooth either before or
      after application of the dental paste 36 containing FHAp. By
      applying SiHAp powder to the tooth after application of the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp, the thickness of the synthetic enamel is
      increased and the appearance of the tooth is improved due to a
      greater luster, shine, and polishability. Those skilled in the art
      will recognize that any number of applications of either or both
      of the dental pastes to the tooth are within the spirit and scope
      of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will also
      recognize that the dental pastes can be removed from the tooth 15
      in many ways known in the art and be within the spirit and scope
      of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp consists of
      several steps. In the process of the formation of the silicate
      containing hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) powder, samples are synthesized
      by using a wet process. A mixed solution of phosphoric acid-sodium
      silicate (both available from Kanto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd.,
      Japan) is prepared having a total concentration of PO4&lt;3-&gt;
      and SiO4&lt;4-&gt; of about 0.3 mol.dm&lt;-3 &gt; and added to a
      calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 slurry containing about 0.5 mol.dm&lt;-3
      &gt; of Ca&lt;2+&gt; ion (available from UBE Material, Ltd.,
      Japan). The sodium silicate decreases the viscosity of the
      silicate containing hydroxyapatite paste. The compositions of the
      samples can be controlled by changing synthesis temperature, and
      contents of trace elements are controlled by selecting the purity
      of Ca(OH)2. Furthermore, the molar ratio of phosphate ion and
      silicate ion (Si/P ratio) in samples are controlled by selecting
      the Si/P ratio in mixed solution of phosphoric acid-sodium
      silicate. The molar ratio of Si/P may range from about 0.11 to
      about 0.43. The synthesis temperature may range from about 5 to
      40[deg.] C. A method of forming the silicate containing
      hydroxyapatite powder is known in the art, such as for example,
      the silicate containing hydroxyapatite powder taught in Okada and
      Suzuki, 2001, Journal of the Society of Inorganic Materials,
      Japan, 8: 118-124, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by
      reference. About 2 ml of a mix of an about 35% aqueous solution of
      hydrogen peroxide and an about 85% aqueous solution of phosphoric
      acid is added to and mixed with about 1.5 g of the mixture of the
      phosphoric acid, the sodium silicate and the calcium hydroxide
      suspension to yield the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp of the
      present invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
      various aqueous solutions and powders known in the art can be used
      with the present invention and other amounts and concentrations of
      the aqueous solutions and powders in addition to other processing
      conditions known in the art are within the spirit and scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      After the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is mixed, the dental
      paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied to the tooth 15 where the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp integrates with the enamel 16.
      The extent of integration is governed by the depth of the natural
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15. In integrating with the enamel 16, the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp fills in a plurality of voids in
      a lattice of the hydroxyapatite compound comprising the enamel 16.
      The dental paste 38 containing SiHAp crystallizes with a
      chemically incomplete portion of the enamel 16 of the tooth,
      forming silicate apatite crystals of the synthetic enamel 46. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ingredients
      used to make the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp are mixed prior
      to use, as the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp will undergo
      gradual loss of activity. About 10 minutes after application of
      the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp to the enamel 16, the excess
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp that has not integrated with the
      enamel 16 is removed by washing the tooth 15 with a washing
      medium. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
      washing medium is purified water. Those skilled in the art will
      recognize that the dental paste can remain on the tooth for
      various lengths of time and be within the spirit and scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the dental
      paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied to the enamel 16 of the tooth
      15 several times. In a preferred embodiment of the present
      invention, the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied to the
      enamel 16 of the tooth 15 from about two times to about six times.
      In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is applied to the enamel 16 of
      the tooth 15 about three times. Each application of the dental
      paste 38 containing SiHAp to the tooth 15 increases the thickness
      of the synthetic enamel 46, allowing for additional integration of
      the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp into the enamel 16 of the
      tooth 15. After each application of the dental paste 38 containing
      SiHAp to the tooth 15, the excess dental paste 38 containing SiHAp
      is removed by washing the tooth 15 with the washing medium. In an
      alternative embodiment of the present invention, a high and/or low
      speed handpiece is used in addition to the application of the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp. Those skilled in the art will
      recognize that any number of applications of the dental paste to
      the tooth are within the spirit and scope of the present
      invention. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp can be removed from the tooth 15
      in many ways known in the art and be within the spirit and scope
      of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      For a tooth showing a susceptibility to the formation of a dental
      carie 44, the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp integrates with the
      incomplete enamel structure to form the synthetic enamel 46. The
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp mechanically and chemically
      completes the enamel structure of the tooth 15, completing the
      apatite of the enamel 16 to prevent the dental carie 44 from
      forming.<br>
      <br>
      The dental paste 38 containing SiHAp of the present invention
      treats the dental carie 44 and replaces the dental carie 44 with
      the synthetic enamel 46. Those skilled in the art will recognize
      the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp can be used to treat dental
      caries 44 in various stages ranging from a stage where there is no
      dental carie 44 to stages where the dental carie 44 is deep within
      the tooth 15 and be within the spirit and scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      For the tooth having a dental carie 44, the dental paste 38
      containing SiHAp is used to treat the dental carie 44 existing in
      the enamel 16 of the tooth 15. In another embodiment of the
      present invention, the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is used to
      treat the dental carie 44 that has advanced into the dentin 17 of
      the tooth 15. In another embodiment of the present invention, the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp can be used as a cement. Those
      skilled in the art will recognize the dental paste 38 containing
      SiHAp can be used to treat dental caries 44 that have progressed
      into various portions of the tooth 15 and are within the spirit
      and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7A shows a low magnification (40*) scanning electron
      microscopy image of a portion of a polished cross section,
      including the synthetic enamel 46, of the tooth 15 after
      application of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp of the present
      invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7A, the synthetic
      enamel 46, the enamel 16 and the dentin 17 are shown. After at
      least one application of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp, the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp integrates with the enamel 16 to
      form the synthetic enamel 46. The integration of the dental paste
      38 containing SiHAp into the enamel 16 of the tooth 15 fills in a
      plurality of voids in a lattice of the hydroxyapatite compound
      comprising the enamel 16. The dental paste 38 containing SiHAp
      integrates with a chemically incomplete portion of the tooth 15 to
      crystallize the chemically incomplete portion of the tooth 15. The
      transition zone 50 is shown as the area where the synthetic enamel
      46 integrates with the enamel 16. The transition zone 50 is shown
      where the light grey intersects the darker grey.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7B shows a high magnification (500*) scanning electron
      microscope image of the synthetic enamel 46 after application of
      the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp of the present invention. The
      integration of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp results in a
      pillar crystal 25 morphology. The plurality of hydroxyapatite
      crystals of the enamel 16 are products of the integration of the
      dental paste 38 containing SiHAp with the enamel 16. The
      crystallization of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp to the
      enamel 16 provides a smooth contrast between the dental paste 38
      containing SiHAp and the enamel 16. The transition zone 50 is
      shown as the area where the synthetic enamel 46 integrates with
      the enamel 16. The transition zone 50 is shown where the light
      grey intersects the darker grey.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a scanning electron microscopy image of a portion of
      a polished cross section, including the synthetic enamel 46, of
      the tooth 15 after application of the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8,
      the synthetic enamel 46, the enamel 16 and the dentin 17 are
      shown. After at least one application of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp, the dental paste 36 containing FHAp integrates
      with the enamel 16 to form the synthetic enamel 46. In the
      embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 8, the dental
      paste 36 containing FHAp is strongly integrated with the enamel 16
      shown by the lack of contrast between the enamel 16 and the
      synthetic enamel 46. The transition zone 50 is shown as the area
      where the synthetic enamel 46 integrates with the enamel 16. The
      transition zone 50 is shown where the light grey intersects the
      darker grey.<br>
      <br>
      When comparing FIGS. 7A and 7B with FIG. 8, it is evident that the
      application of dental paste 38 containing SiHAp to a tooth 15
      results in an increase in the crystallization of the synthetic
      enamel 46 as compared with application of the dental paste 36
      containing FHAp.<br>
      <br>
      Without being limited to any particular theory, the increase in
      the crystallization of the synthetic enamel 46 after application
      of the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp is partly due to the
      larger size of the SiHAp molecules as compared to the FHAp
      molecules. The larger size of the SiHAp molecules also results in
      an increase in the thickness of the dental paste 38 containing
      SiHAp as compared to the dental paste 36 containing FHAp for the
      same number of applications. Thus, if fewer layers of dental paste
      are desired, one should use the dental paste 38 containing SiHAp.
      The dental paste 38 containing SiHAp provides, among other things,
      better polishability (i.e., better surface finish after polishing
      with dental tools) and an increase in viscosity (which affects the
      wettability of the dental paste) as compared with the dental paste
      36 containing FHAp.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9A-E show transmission electron microscopy images of a thin
      tooth section after application of the dental paste 36 containing
      FHAp of the present invention. FIG. 9A is a low magnification of
      the tooth 15 including the synthetic enamel 46 (labeled as R in
      FIG. 9A) and the enamel 16 (labeled as E in FIG. 9A). The
      transition zone 50 is shown as the arrow and dotted line and is
      the transition between the synthetic enamel 46 and the enamel 16
      (scale bar is 5 [mu]m). FIG. 9B shows a magnified image of the
      synthetic enamel 46 of the tooth 15. The synthetic enamel 46
      consists of elongated pillar crystals 25 arranged in the same
      orientation (scale bar is 100 nm). An electron diffraction pattern
      of the observed area is superimposed at the bottom right corner of
      FIG. 9B. FIG. 9C shows a magnified image of the enamel 16 region
      (scale bar is 100 nm). An electron diffraction pattern of the
      observed area is superimposed at the bottom left corner of FIG.
      9C.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9D is a magnified image around the interface between the
      synthetic enamel 46 and the enamel 16 region of the tooth 15. As
      shown in FIG. 9D, pillar crystals 25 grow continuously, i.e.,
      there is no discontinuous boundary observed (scale bar is 100 nm).
      Continuous growth of pillar crystals leads to better integration
      of the synthetic enamel 46 and the enamel 16. FIG. 9E is a
      high-resolution image showing the crystal structure of the
      synthetic enamel 46 of the tooth 15 (scale bar is 1 nm). Crystal
      lattice periodicities on the nanometer scale were observed as
      shown in FIG. 9E (0.817 nm and 0.688 nm). The arrows in FIG. 9E
      indicate the elongated direction of the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that apatite powders other
      then fluorized apatite (FHAp) and silicate containing
      hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) can be used in the compositions and methods
      of the present invention. The general chemical formula for the
      apatite used in the compositions of the present invention is
      A10(BO4)6C2, where A is calcium (Ca), B is phosphate (P) and C is
      fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl (F, Cl, OH). The F, Cl and OH ions
      can freely substitute in the crystal lattice of apatite and all
      three are usually present in every specimen although some
      specimens have been close to 100% in one or the other. For
      example, the fluorized apatite (FHAp) powder used in the dental
      paste of the present invention has a chemical formula of
      Ca10(PO4)6F2, in which the C is fluorine. The silicate containing
      hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) powder used in the dental paste of the
      present invention has a chemical formula of Ca10(POSi)6OH2, in
      which the C is hydroxyl and the PO4&lt;3-&gt; ion in the
      hydroxyapatite has been partially substituted for SiO4&lt;4-&gt;
      ion.<br>
      <br>
      In three-dimensional space, fourteen different lattices divided
      among six crystal systems may be constructed. These are the
      isometric or cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic,
      triclinic, and hexagonal systems, as established by French
      crystallographer Auguste Bravais. The apatite mineral belongs to
      the hexagonal crystal system of the Bravais lattice. Minerals of
      the hexagonal crystal system are referred to three
      crystallographic axes which intersect at 120[deg.] and a fourth
      which is perpendicular to the other three. This fourth axis is
      usually depicted vertically. All crystals of the hexagonal
      division possess a single 6-fold axis of rotation. In addition to
      the single 6-fold axis of rotation, crystals of the hexagonal
      division may possess up to six 2-fold axes of rotation. Crystals
      of the hexagonal division may demonstrate a center of inversion
      symmetry and up to seven mirror planes. Those skilled in the art
      will recognize that any apatite powder that meets the above
      criteria can be used in the compositions and methods with the
      spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the dental paste
      compositions of the present invention can be used in various
      fields both inside and outside of the field of dentistry. For
      example, the dental paste compositions can be used in the field of
      orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics,
      operative/restorative dentistry, prosthodontic dentistry,
      preventive dentistry, implantology, column chromatography,
      piezoelectric materials and semiconductors.<br>
      <br>
      In the field of orthodontics, the dental paste compositions reduce
      the need for strategic tooth extractions, such as the extraction
      of premolars in order to create space to mobilize teeth. By
      combining the enamel plasty technique, a technique that usually
      removes enamel from the mesial and distal sides of the tooth, and
      the application, building and contouring of the dental paste
      compositions, the orthodontist is able to control the space needed
      for orthodontic treatment without teeth extraction.<br>
      <br>
      In the field of oral surgery and periodontics, the dental paste
      compositions can be used to treat a site of alveolar bone loss or
      deficiency. For example, the fluoride treated calcium deficient
      hydroxyapatite powder dental paste composition of the present
      invention is mixed in succinic acid solution or a similar solution
      and applied to fill the void from the bone loss or deficiency as a
      bone cement or artificial bone.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to its use for filling sites of bone loss in the
      fields of oral surgery and periodontics, the fluoride treated
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite powder dental paste composition
      of the present invention can be used in operative/restorative
      dentistry and prosthodontic dentistry to protect the pulp, prevent
      further tooth decay and reduce the sensitivity which a patient
      experiences. When the pulp chamber is close to being exposed after
      excavation of the dental caries and preparation of the
      restoration, the solidified and shaped fluoride treated calcium
      deficient hydroxyapatite powder dental paste composition can be
      placed instead of the base material to protect the pulp, prevent
      further tooth decay and reduce the sensitivity. The dental paste
      compositions also transition unsupported enamel into a supported
      enamel by integrating into the tooth to provide a synthetic
      enamel, thereby making restorations more conservative.<br>
      <br>
      The dental paste compositions have use in the field of operative
      dentistry and prosthodontic dentistry. In these fields, the dental
      paste compositions can be used as a restorative material in place
      of composite resins or cement materials.<br>
      <br>
      Further enhancement of the prevention of dental caries in the
      field of preventive dentistry can be achieved by mixing the dental
      paste compositions of the present invention with toothpaste,
      prophy paste and fluoride treatment gel. The dental paste
      compositions of the present invention are more effective than
      prior art dental sealants that stay in place due to adhesion,
      rather than integration to the tooth structure.<br>
      <br>
      The dental paste compositions can be used in the field of
      implantology as well. For applications in this field, the dental
      paste compositions are applied to a metal base of the implant and
      used as an artificial calcium of the natural tooth to coat the
      base metal.<br>
      <br>
      When periodontitis, gingivitis and/or other factors cause an
      exposure of the cementum of the tooth and a subsequent sensitivity
      due to the exposed cementum occurs, the dental paste compositions
      can be used as a coating agent on the exposed cementum to reduce
      the sensitivity. Furthermore, the dental paste compositions, mixed
      with polysaccharide (especially maltotriose) and/or soy bean fiber
      powder, can be applied to the cementum to act as an artificial
      cementum.<br>
      <br>
      The dental paste compositions of the present invention are also
      useful as disinfectants or antibacterial agents. The disinfectant
      effect or antibacterial effect helps prevent the formation of
      dental caries. The dental paste compositions can be applied to a
      tooth with or without a dental carie.<br>
      <br>
      Various applications of the dental paste compositions outside of
      the field of dentistry include the use of the dental paste
      compositions as a filler material for column chromatography,
      piezoelectric materials or surface application materials of
      semiconductors. For these uses, for example, the fluoride treated
      calcium deficient hydroxyapatite dental paste composition is
      ionized in the low pH solution and then recrystallized. This
      produces a more dense, regular, larger and higher quality of the
      crystal when compared to the case where the naturally occurring
      calcium phosphate cluster is ionized in the same low pH solution
      and recrystallized. The higher quality of the crystal allows use
      in the aforementioned fields outside of the field of dentistry.<br>
