      <p>In the silent world of underwater warfare, the slightest noise
        can bring sudden death to a submarine. The electronic eats of
        the enemy can detect conventional engines and screw propellers
        as far as 100 miles away. A computer interprets the sounds and
        directs a deadly homing torpedo to their source in minutes. How
        do you go about maneuvering a 3260-ton nuclear submarine without
        making a sound? Two medical researchers at St. Louis
        University’s School of Medicine may have found the answer --- a
        revolutionary undersea propulsion unit dubbed the "sea engine".
      </p>
      <p>The interesting phenomenon upon which the sea engine is based
        was first observed in 1964 by Alfred W. Richardson, a
        physiologist, and Sujoy K. Guha, a young biomedical engineer
        from India. The two men were looking for a method of stimulating
        the flow of blood through the human body. They tried various
        types of mechanical pumps without success. The pumping action
        was too irregular. </p>
      <p>While investigating the effects of magnetic fields on weak salt
        solutions similar to blood, the two researchers stumbled across
        an interesting fact They could make the electrically charged
        atoms in such solutions move in one direction by applying a
        magnetic field in just the right way. Then they made a second
        important discovery: The moving atoms dragged water molecules
        along with them so that the entire solution moved. </p>
      <p>Richardson and Guha suddenly realized that they had the makings
        of a new type of pump. They quickly assembled an experimental
        model and found, as they had expected, that the device really
        worked. Their "pump" consisted of nothing more than an
        unimpressive collection of junk-box electronic components. Yet
        the instant they connected it to a source of electrical power, a
        weak salt solution inside it began to move. A number of tests
        were made and new models were constructed, some of which
        permitted very accurate control over the quantity of liquid
        being pumped, and others which made the liquid move in a series
        of pulses, duplicating the pumping action of the human heart.
        Amazingly, the pumps could move a variety of liquids ---
        including ordinary tap water --- without difficulty. Then a
        visiting scientist from the Office of Naval Research suggested
        they try pumping sweater. The pump worked better than ever. </p>
      <p>The sea engine is a form of electromagnetic pump, which is
        nothing new. Units working on the same principle have been used
        to pump liquid metals such as sodium through nuclear reactors
        for coolant purposes. However, a pump had never before been
        constructed to move seawater --- electronically, with no moving
        parts, with no sound. And that’s what intrigues naval engineers.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Navy Problem ~</b> </p>
      <p>Nuclear submarine skippers have had to develop a variety of
        ways of escaping detection. At times, they dive to fantastic
        depths where sub noises may be confused with other ocean sounds.
        Or they may sit quietly on the bottom and wait for the enemy to
        come to them. In any case, starting the engine may mean
        immediate destruction. </p>
      <p>An electromagnetic pump large enough to propel a submarine
        would require a lot of electrical power, but this would present
        no power on a nuclear submarine. Naval engineers made a study of
        an advanced pump constructed by Richardson and Guha, and found
        that conversion from pump to sea engine necessitated only minor
        changes. </p>
      <p>A submarine would be equipped with two sea engines: one to port
        and one to starboard. Each engine would operate independently,
        the direction andforce4 of its propulsive jet of seawater
        changed by the mere flick of a switch. In this way, the sub
        could move forward, backward, or turn by pumping water in one
        direction on one side and in the other direction on the other
        side. </p>
      <p>Most likely, sea engines would be installed along with
        conventional high-speed screw engines for normal use. The sea
        engines enable the sub to engage in silent warfare by gliding
        along the ocean bottom and maneuvering close to its prey. </p>
      <p><b>How It Works ~</b> </p>
      <p>The simplest form of sea engine consists of two metal-plate
        electrodes mounted parallel to each other inside a rectangular
        chamber called a "cannula". An opening at each end of the
        cannula permits seawater to flow between the electrodes. The
        cannula is mounted between the poles of a powerful
        electromagnet, so that the magnetic field is concentrated on the
        water between them. </p>
      <p>When alternating current is applied to the two electrodes,
        large numbers of ions --- sodium and chlorine atoms in sweater
        --- are immediately attracted to the water between them. These
        ions attempt to move back and forth between the electrodes.
        Their individual magnetic fields (each ion is surrounded by its
        own tiny EM field) are repelled, however, by the powerful
        external magnetic field. Many of the ions are thus forced to
        move sideways, away from the electrodes. As they move along,
        they drag water molecules with them, causing the water to move
        out of the cannula. More seawater enters from the other opening,
        producing a continuous flow. </p>
      <p><b>Torpedoes &amp; Destroyers ~</b> </p>
      <p>There is every reason to believe that a sea engine will power a
        radically now type of torpedo. The ones we’re using now produce
        a relatively loud sound, giving an alert enemy a chance to duck.
        A somewhat slower fish, powered by a silent sea engine using
        high-capacity batteries, would change this. </p>
      <p>Highly specialized types of surface ships, such as the
        hunter-killer destroyers, could also profit from periods of
        silent running with sea engines. </p>
      <p>How about the pumping of blood --- the application of the EM
        pump that Richardson and Guha first set out to explore?
        Experiments are currently under way to use a modified sea engine
        to temporarily replace the human heart during surgical
        operations. Another model may one day by used to pump waste from
        a patient’s body during long operations. </p>
      <p>Fifteen years ago, a government report said: “"Undersea warfare
        is a deadly game of blindman’s bluff, in which the winning side
        is likely to be that with the most acute hearing". A footnote
        might add, "and the quietest engines". </p>

      <p>Switch on the power and watch a stream of slat water
        mysteriously begin to flow around and around a closed loop of
        plastic tubing. How? Build your own sea engine --- a fascinating
        gadget for the amateur scientist or a top-flight science-fair
        project. It costs just a few dollars. There are many other
        things about it that still puzzle scientists; perhaps you can
        make an improvement. </p>
      <p>Make an electromagnet from an isolation transformer with a
        100-watt rating. Cut through the transformer laminations in two
        places with a hacksaw (see drawing below) and remove these
        pieces. Next, cut a 5/8" gap (no larger) in the remaining
        laminations. Connect primary and secondary windings in series (A
        to B in the schematic below). Connect C and D to the AC line.
        Quickly test the gap for a magnetic field with a screwdriver
        tip. Try connecting A and C together and B and D to the AC line,
        and again test the gap. One hookup will give a much stronger
        field than the other: that’s the one to use. </p>
      <p>Make a cannula out of a length of plastic tubing. It must fit
        into the magnet gap. Two copper or stainless steel electrode
        plates are mounted inside the cannula. Copper is best, but is
        attacked by salt water and eventually it has to be replaced. </p>
      <p>Carefully solder wire leads to the electrodes. They leave the
        cannula through snug holes sealed with a good cement. Use the
        same cement to attach ends to the cannula. The ends have holes
        fitted with short lengths of glass tubing. Two tiny holes
        drilled through the top of the cannula will allow captured air
        to escape, permitting it to fill with water. The holes can later
        be sealed to prevent leakage. Run a length of plastic tubing in
        a closed loop from one end of the cannula to the other. A
        T-connection in the loop will aid in filling. </p>

      </p>
      <p><b>The Assembly ~</b> </p>
      <p>Use stove bolts to hold the transformer laminations together.
        Mount it on a base, with some type of supports to keep the
        tubing at the level of the cannula. Switch S1 is optional. Do
        not use a lower-wattage resistor for R1. Since it will give off
        some heat, mount it and R2 (optional) on a heat-sink. </p>
      <p>Fill a glass with tap water and let it sit for a day to
        eliminate air [or boil it]. Add half a teaspoon of table salt
        and stir until dissolved. Carefully fill the cannula and tubing
        with the salt water. Work out all the air bubbles. </p>
      <p>Check all electrical connections before applying power to the
        model. Inspect the cannula for leaks, particularly where the
        lead wires and glass tubes pass through the walls, If everything
        is okay, plug it into an outlet and throw the switch. Watch tiny
        dust particles and other impurities in the water to detect flow.
        If there is no visible movement, try adding a tiny drop of ink
        to the water as an indicator [or install a flow meter]. </p>
      <p>Try various resistances for R2. Eliminate it entirely and note
        the result. Vary the resistance of R1 and see what happens. With
        a little experimentation, you’ll quickly find the best settings
        for maximum pumping action. Watch the effect of increased
        conductivity (adding more salt) on flow rate. </p>
      <p><b>Parts List ~</b> </p>
      <p>R1 --- 20-ohm, 160-watt wire-wound power resistor <br>
        R2 --- 100-ohm, 25-watt fixed wire-wound power resistor <br>
        S1 --- Single-pole, single-throw switch rated at 6 amps or
        better, optional <br>
        T1 --- 115-120 volt AC isolation transformer rated at 100 watts
        or better <br>
        Misc. --- Small sheet of copper or stainless steel, wire,
        solder, transformer mounting brackets, plastic tubing, glass
        tubing, sheet plastic for tubing supports, AC power cord,
        &amp;c. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1 ~</b> Arrangement of electromagnet with cannula,
        containing electrodes positioned in the 5/8" gap, is shown in

        primary and secondary of T1 together as described for the
        strongest magnetic field. Leads A and D and B and C are the end
        leads of the primary and secondary windings, respectively. Cut
        off or tape any adjustable-voltage taps on T1; these connections
        are not used. Be sure to remove the plug from the socket before
        making any adjustments. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Today, electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) for submarines --- a
        propellerless and therefore silent and maintenance-free way to
        drive a craft through water --- is getting new attention. A
        hypothetical design for a 15-ton sub using this form of
        propulsion was presented at the recent SAE meeting in Detroit by
        Dr Stewart Way of Westinghouse R&amp;D Center, Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p>According to Dr Way, a Russian inventor has already begun to
        test a prototype like the on Way suggests, and engineers at the
        Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, indicate an intention of
        soon building a similar prototype of their own. </p>
      <p><b>Repulsive Principle ~</b> </p>
      <p>Way tested the first prototype, a 10-ft model, more than two
        years ago (Prod. Engg., September 12, 1966, p. 39). Since then,
        he a others have worked, off and on, to explore the idea. The US
        Navy had been keenly interested in the concept from 1958 to 1961
        but had found the outlook poor for practical application of the
        theory. </p>
      <p>Latest in superconducting magnet technology may have changed
        that outlook, Dr Way believes, by greatly increasing the power
        plant’s efficiency. </p>
      <p>The "solid-state" propulsion principle is as simple as high
        school physics. If a wire is placed between the poles of a "U"
        magnet and current is passed through the wire, the wire jumps
        away from the magnet, in response to Lorentz forces. Make a
        submarine the magnet and the surrounding water the wire, and you
        have an underwater vessel with a no-moving-parts propulsion
        system. </p>
      <p><b>Super Magnets for Super Subs ~</b> </p>
      <p>For his 15-ton vessel, about 24 feet long, Dr Way concludes
        that two tons of batteries could furnish enough energy to drive
        the current through sea water. Reaction with a superconducting
        magnet aboard the craft could propel the submarine at about 6
        knots. And the 2-man vessel could cruise more than 9 hours at a
        time, Way says. </p>
      <p>Way’s 10ft earlier prototype weighed 900 lb and had 300 lb of
        batteries, which had to be recharged after about 15 min. It had
        a conventional rather than superconducting magnet, and its top
        speed was only about ½ knot. </p>
      <p>The researcher says the advent of the practical superconducting
        magnet, which draws no power on board, had vastly increased an
        EMP craft’s potential range and speed. He suggests that someday
        mammoth EMP cargo submarines with displacements of 1`00,000 tons
        may be hauling freight silently through the ocean depths at
        speeds up to 25 knots. The energy for generating the current
        around these supersubs would come from nuclear power plants. </p>
      <p><b>Feasible Today?</b> </p>
      <p>Right now, EMP may be highly suited to small research
        submarines, Dr Way says, and he would like to see a full-scale
        prototype developed in this country for practical&nbsp;
        evaluation. </p>
      <p>Silence of operation would mean research subs could literally
        sneak up on fish. Water around them would not be agitated, and
        ocean-bottom materials wouldn’t be stirred up. Dr Way estimates
        tht overall disturbance of the ocean would be reduced 90%. A
        small electromagnetic force would be acting over a large area,
        rather than a large physical force acting over a very small
        area, as with a propeller. </p>
      <p><b>Other Advantages ~</b> </p>
      <p>In addition, an EMP sub would be more maneuverable than a
        conventionally propelled craft. At slow forward speeds,
        conventional submarines don’t respond well to lateral or yaw
        changes of direction. Auxiliary propellers to correct this
        deficiency only add to ocean disturbance. An EMP sub could
        easily be designed to provide lateral and turning forces as well
        as "fine control" of elevation. </p>
      <p>Dr Way also suggests it may be possible to reduce hull drag by
        using the Lorentz force s on the wter that surrounds the hull,
        though he didn’t consider this effect in his design. </p>
      <p><b>Design Considerations ~</b> </p>
      <p>To be sure, the designer of a working EMP sub would face some
        problems. To begin with, the external magnetic field would
        attract metal objects on the ocean floor (treasure hunters might
        consider this a boon). Dr Way judges that his 15-ton model would
        have to steer clear of iron objects by at least 5 ft, else it
        might have to deenergize its superconducting magnet in order to
        get free. </p>
      <p>The crew’s proximity to magnetic fields inside the sub is
        another problem. But Dr Way reasons it can be solved by placing
        the field coil slightly aft and the crew well forward, with an
        iron shield between. </p>
      <p>Also, liquid helium would have to be circulated around the
        superconducting magnet to maintain it at cryogenic temperature.
        But Dr Way thinks an on-board refrigeration plant would not be
        necessary; the rate at which the helium would boil off is not
        excessive. However, the lost helium would have to be replenished
        periodically. </p>

      <p>Anyone who has played with magnets knows it is possible to push
        one magnet along by forcing the north or south pole of another
        close to the same pole of the first. Such a magnetic shove
        wouldn’t be a bad form of propulsion if there were a way to keep
        it going. In fact, some Japanese scientists are trying to propel
        ships using this principle --- but instead of forcing actual
        magnets close to the ones built into their ships, they
        continually generate repulsing magnetic fields in the surround
        seawater to push vessels along. Yoshiro Saji and his colleagues
        at the Kobe University of Mercantile Marine in Kobe, Japan, are
        convinced that their method of electromagnetic propulsion has
        the potential to provide more efficient, faster way of powering
        even large tankers. </p>
      <p>Saji begins with a large electromagnet mounted along the ship’s
        sides. An electric current from on-board generators is then
        passed from one side of the ship to the other through conductive
        seawater, creating a magnetic force that pushes against the
        ship’s magnet. The seawater is driven backwards, and the ship is
        pushed forward, As the ship moves ahead, a current continually
        flows through a constant repulsive field to drive it onward, In
        a sense the ship is lifting itself by its own bootstraps. </p>
      <p>The idea of electromagnetic propulsion was first developed in
        the 1950s primarily by Stewart Way, then a consultant for
        Westinghouse Electric Corporation. He wanted to use it for
        submarines, since at the higher speeds promised by
        electromagnetic propulsion it would make them faster than
        surface vessels, which are hindered by waves. In 1968 Way&nbsp;
        constructed a 10-ft working model of an electromagnetically
        propelled submarine using conventional magnets. But a full-scale
        version of his test vessel would have required magnets weighing
        500,000 tons --- about 80 times the total weight of a Polaris
        submarine. Lightweight superconducting magnets could have solved
        the weight problem, but at the time they were prohibitively
        expensive to operate. Work on electromagnetic propulsion the US
        came to a standstill. </p>
      <p>Saji’s recent work in Japan followed the development of highly
        efficient niobium-titanium superconductors, cooled by liquid
        helium to a temperature of -550 F. Armed with these new
        materials, his group has built two experimental scale models
        that he says prove the feasibility of EM propulsion. The second
        and larger model is nearly 12 ft long, weighs 1650 lb, and has a
        superconducting magnet with a field 60,000 times stronger than
        the Earth’s natural field. Experiments have shown that it can
        travel about 1.5 miles per hour. </p>
      <p>Extrapolating from his studies, Saji believes that a
        full-scale, 10,000-ton submarine tanker can achieve a top speed
        of 100 knots, or 115 mph; the fastest submarines, now limited by
        water resistance to the screw propeller, cannot exceed 70 knots,
        or 81 mph. Today’s surface vessels, because of wave drag, are
        much slower. Saji estimates the cost of building the sub would
        be comparable to the cost of a conventional tanker of the same
        size. And he predicts that the sub’s demand for fuel --- to deed
        the onboard generator that powers the electromagnet and the
        seawater current --- would be less than the fuel needs of a
        traditional tanker. </p>
      <p>Although there are no current plans to put Saji’s studies to
        practical use, the principles of EM propulsion have other
        potential application. </p>

        <p><b>Propulsion System</b> </p>
        <p><b>Warren A. Rice</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The present invention relates to a propulsion system for
        vessels traveling in an ionic media and more particularly
        relates to drive systems wherein the outer surface of the vessel
        constitutes an electrolytic cell employing the ambient ionic
        media as an operating electrolyte. Still more particularly the
        present invention relates to a vessel propulsion drive requiring
        no moving parts and wherein the thrust is accomplished
        electromagnetically to promote laminar fluid flow at the
        interphase between vessel and media. </p>
      <p>The instant drive or propulsion system is applicable to all
        vessels, such as ships, submarines, torpedoes, and the like
        traveling in salt water. Insofar as can be experimentally shown
        the device also has utility as a space drive system for
        imparting thrust to a vessel traveling in an ionic atmosphere,
        for example, space. </p>
      <p>It has long been known that when an electrical current is
        passed through a magnetic field that a thrust is accomplished
        which obeys the "left hand rule" and which is of a magnitude
        directly proportional to the magnetic field&nbsp; strength and
        the current density. Such electrical principles are applied in
        electromagnetic pumps for the handling, for example, of liquid
        material which is an electrolyte. Such a device is illustrated
        in US Patent # 2,786,416 issued to Alan Fenemore (March 26,
        1957). </p>
      <p>Similarly, particle acceleration in vacuum tubes has
        demonstrated the concept of thrust obtained by intersecting
        lines of magnetic flux with a suitable current flow in an ionic
        atmosphere. Reference is made to US Patent # 2,397,891 to Donald
        Kerst (Februarry 21, 1950). </p>
      <p>However, until the instant invention there was no appreciation
        of the application of the known principles to the problem of
        propelling a vessel in an electrolyte and space. </p>
      <p>It has now been found that the structural members of the vessel
        itself can be utilized to generate a thrust of sufficient
        magnitude to be useful. It has also been found that the flow
        obtained at the interphase between hull and fluid media is
        substantially laminar so as to impart an added credit to the
        concept of vessel propulsion by material reduction in friction.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the hull itself generates the force to propel the vessel
        and the hull form imparts direct surface thrust in contrast, for
        example, to prior art propeller propulsion and its accompanying
        turbulent flow. </p>
      <p>Accordingly one of the objects is to provide a propulsion means
        integrated into the hull structure of the vessel to be
        propelled. </p>
      <p>Still another object is to provide a hull surface capable of
        serving as a cell in an ionic media so as to provide desired EM
        force. </p>
      <p>Other objects include the provision of a highly efficient
        propulsion means eliminating the necessity for intricate
        mechanical movements extending into the liquid media to require
        intricate and expensive seal means. These objects include
        obvious design simplification which can result from the adoption
        of the presently described propulsion means. </p>

      <p>Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a tube across which
        is gapped a magnetic flux field and showing an EMF crossing the
        gap using, for example, sodium chloride in water as the ionic
        media, and indicating the direction of force generated by the
        tube. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 is a perspective schematic view of a tube encasing,
        for example, the hull or shell of a projectile, vessel, or the
        like where the EMF is generated by the cell established by the
        silver hull and the magnesium sleeve and where the magnetic flux
        lines are available from permanent magnets used as spacers. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 is a schematic view of a device which also utilizes a
        cell created by structural portions of the hull separated by
        suitable insulating strips and having a permanent magnet
        internally oriented so as to establish magnetic flux lines
        intersectable by the EMF established by the cell in the
        electrolyte to provide a thrust force in the direction
        indicated. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 illustrates a hull structure in schematic cross
        section indicating a segmentalized external system of alternate
        N and S magnetic poles supplied with an EMF from a suitable
        generator and being conducted by the electrolyte or ionic media
        in which the hull is immersed. </p>
      <p>Figure 5 illustrates in schematic perspective a system in
        accord with the present invention whereby the hull establishes
        an electrolytic cell and the magnetic flux density is obtained
        by the use of a generator-served electromagnet. </p>
      <p><b>General Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>In electromagnetic phenomena it has long been known that if a
        current is passed across a magnetic field a force is set up
        which generally is dependent upon the flux D, the distance
        between conductors, and the amperage or current. The general
        formula may be expressed as: </p>
      <p>Thrust in kilograms = (10.2 x 10-8 [flux density (gauss) x d
        (centimeters) x I (amperes)] </p>
      <p>Conversion to pounds of thrust is accomplished by multiplying
        the thrust in kilograms b the rough factor of 2.2. </p>
      <p>Experimental work based on this data has generally validated
        this above expression and supplementally has shown that the
        thrust is a reaction to the movement of the electrolyte through
        which the current passes. Viewed in a vacuum the thrust may be
        expressed in terms of ionic drive employing beta particle
        emission with the bonus obtained by appreciation of mass.
        Further, the flow pattern appears "laminar" in nature in
        contrast to a type of thrust imparted by a driven propeller, the
        latter being characterized as "turbulent". Peculiarly the
        laminar flow is substantially independent of hull design, that
        is, the hull design becomes considerably less critical assuming
        that the entire hull is used as a drive fixture. </p>
      <p>In general a magnetic field is established using components of
        the vessel as alternate N and S poles. As between these
        structurally established poles a magnetic flux is established
        through an ionic media, for example, an ionized atmosphere such
        as space or an electrolyte such as salt water. An electric
        current, also emanating from the structural members of the
        vessel passes through the ionic media cutting the magnetic lines
        of force. The result is a movement of the electrolyte in
        obedience to the "right hand rule". The movement is equivalent
        to the force exerted in accord with the foregoing general
        formulation and a reaction force thus propels the vessel. </p>
      <p>When the above expression is applied in space it can be said
        that hull members provide the magnetic field and that hull
        members also serve the function of anode and cathode for current
        flow in an ionic media. However, in the case of space the
        electron flow is established by the system and the particle
        emission comprises beta particles which appreciate in mass as
        they approach the speed of light. Thus, it is felt that some
        correction in value of the total thrust should be applied in the
        instance of an application to space versus the situation
        existing for propulsion in an electrolyte. </p>
      <p>In sopme instances the source of EM force may be cell-derived
        in which instance the hull of the craft, or portions thereof
        comprise a single cell or a plurality of cells where the latter
        is advantageous. Where this cell system is desirable permanent
        magnets establish the required magnetic field. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that an electric generator within the
        craft may also supply EM force to the anode and cathode members
        of the structure and provide an electromagnet with current for
        the establishment of magnetic flux lines of desired magnitude. </p>
      <p>Similarly, the scope of the contribution to embrace
        combinations of cell, magnet, and mechanically generated source
        of EM force wherein the magnetic poles and the cathode and anode
        elements comprise a structural adjunct to the vessel hull.
        Inasmuch as the current must pass through a magnetic field in an
        ionic media, a simple form of the device is annular where the
        annulus is immersible in the ionic media. </p>
      <p><b>Specific Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>The invention may be better appreciated by reference to the
        accompanying drawings. With reference to Figure 1, an annular
        form of enclosure or hull 11 is illustrated. Thus, the hull 11
        is tubular in character and is immersed in an ionic media 12,
        for example salt water or ionic space. Magnets 13 and 4,
        comprising elements of the hull 11, establish a magnetic field
        15 bridging the gap shown. Insulators 16, space the magnets 13
        and 14 from closed contact with each other. An anode 17 and
        cathode 18 are positioned between the magnets 13 and 14. The
        anodes 17 and cathode 18 are positioned oppositely from each
        other. When current 19 is caused to pass across the gap through
        the electrolyte 12 intersecting the magnetic lines of force 15,
        an electrolyte is caused to move in the direction of the force
        arrow F propelling the hull 11 in an opposite sense. The
        required EM force is supplied by a cell means or from a
        hull-contained source such as a battery or generator. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 the cell supplying the requisite EM force is made
        up of hull components. For purposes of illustrations a segment
        22 of the hull 21 is made up of silver. An annulus 23 made, for
        example, of magnesium spacedly surrounds the silver segment 22.
        The space relationship is maintained by magnets 24 leaving gaps
        through which electrolyte is permitted to flow. The alternate
        opposite positioning of the magnets provides a magnetic field
        25. In an electrolyte, current is caused to flow between the
        silver and magnesium intersecting the magnetic lines of force
        and provides a thrust in the direction of the force arrow F. </p>
      <p>It will be understood that a suitable external circuit is
        provided as a means of controlling or regulating current flow
        within the cell and this circuit is schematically represented by
        the bus bar connection 21a. An equivalent reactive force moves
        the hull 21 through salt water, for example. While a silver
        magnesium cell has been described it will be appreciated that
        other combinations of anode and cathode chemical cells are well
        known in the art and are intended to be included in the scope of
        the present invention. Experimental results in brine has
        indicated satisfactory performance with the system as described,
        the EMF being directly proportional to the area provided by the
        cell plates and the strength of the electrolyte. As the plates
        22 and 23 deteriorate they may be replaced. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figure 3 the hull 31 is longitudinally provided
        with a stripe-like pair of plates 32 and 33 running for a
        substantial length of the hull 31. These provide an anode and
        cathode for cell operation in an electrolyte. When the plate 32
        is silver and the plate 33 is magnesium, for example, a current
        is caused to flow as between the plates 23 and 33. Insulating
        stripes or plates 34 electrically separate the plates 32 and 33.
        A magnet 35 structurally bridges the hull cavity, its poles
        coinciding with the insulating stripes or plates 34. In this
        form the magnetic lines of force travel peripherally around the
        hull 31. As an EMF passes between the plates 32 and 34 they
        intersect the magnetic lines of force providing an axial thrust
        to the electrolyte as expressed by the force arrow F. The
        reactive force moves the vessel. As indicated in Figure 2
        regulation of current flow in the resulting cell is accomplished
        by an external circuit as illustrated in Figure 3 by the bus bar
        31a. </p>
      <p>The EMF passing between the plates, while illustrated as the
        product of a chemical cell may be supplied by a generated EMF
        from a generator source not shown within the vessel. Similarly
        the magnet 35 may be of the permanent type or may be of
        conventional electromagnet construction where the field strength
        is established by a winding around a suitable core. In a similar
        way the EMF and magnet fields of all the structures described
        may be supplied by a source of generated EMF. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figure 4 a hollow hull 41 is illustrated wherein a
        plurality of alternating N and S magnetic poles 42 and 43
        respectively line the periphery of the hull 41, the lines of
        force emanating from the magnetic poles providing a peripheral
        series of magnetic bridges around the hull 41,immersed, for
        example, in an electrolyte. Intermediate each of the magnetic
        poles 42 and 43, and completing the schematic annular hull 41
        are alternate cathodes 44 and anodes 45. Insulating spacers 46
        separate the magnets from conducting the EMF emanating from the
        electrodes 44 and 45. When a current is fed as between the
        electrodes 44 and 45 the current passes through the electrolyte
        media in which hull 41 is immersed and cuts the peripherally
        bridged lines of magnetic flux to cause a resultant force in a
        direction as indicated by the force arrow. The resultant
        reactant force drives the vessel 41. A generator 47 supplies the
        requisite EMF, the generator being located, as shown
        schematically within the hull of the vessel. As previously
        indicated a chemical cell may supply the required EMF and the
        magnets may be of the permanent or electromagnet types. In the
        vessel 41 as shown in Figure 4 it will be appreciated that the
        thrust is intimately related to the interphase between hull 41
        and the ambient ionic media. In this design the laminar flow
        predominates and studies thus far advanced show maximum thrust
        substantially at the interphase and diminishing with radial
        progression outward. </p>
      <p>Figure 5 shows the hull 51 with a single magnet 52 which is in
        effect a core served by the winding 53 powered by the generator
        54. Anode 55 and cathode 56 comprise electrode means in suitable
        ionic media to self generate an EMF which cuts the magnetic flux
        lines moving peripherally about the hull 51. This hull structure
        illustrates the use of electromagnetic means in combination with
        a suitable generated EMF. Insulation spacers 57 prevent the hull
        system from "shorting out" in service. As previously described
        it will be appreciated that the members 55 and 56 may comprise a
        suitable chemical cell. </p>
      <p>In operation, structures as described have demonstrated
        unusually excellent propulsion seemingly indicative of minimum
        hull "drag" at the interphase between hull and ionic media. The
        flow at the interphase seems to obey laminar principles. </p>
      <p>Having thus described my invention other modifications will be
        immediately apparent to those skilled in the art and such
        modifications are intended to be included herein limited only by
        the scope of the appended claims. </p>

          no drive shaft. Instead, a superconducting magnet, more
          efficient and powerful than conventional magnets, exerts a
          magnetic force on sea water passing through its core, driving
          water out the back and creating forward motion.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The technology is featured in the movie
          ''The Hunt for Red October,'' based on the book by Tom Clancy
          in which an advanced Soviet submarine powered by the process
          is hunted by the American and Soviet navies.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In real life, scientists say MHD
          propulsion might find both military and civilian uses. It
          might economically power commercial ships and cargo
          submarines. And it might pave the way for a new generation of
          military submarines that are quieter than ever, helping them
          elude foes.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">''It's provocative in its simplicity,''
          said Dr. Michael Petrick, a scientist who directs research on
          the idea at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. ''But
          there's lots of work that needs to be done to make it
          viable.''</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Questions to be answered include both its
          technical feasibility and utility. So far, the idea has
          undergone no known large-scale trial, although that is about
          to change.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Early next year, the Japan Foundation for
          Shipbuilding Advancement plans to launch a 100-foot-long,
          prototype MHD-powered ship that will carry up to 10 people.
          The test is a sea trial for commercial operations.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">And the Argonne lab is spearheading a
          military-sponsored program that centers on a 21-foot-long,
          180-ton monster superconducting magnet. Its trials, confined
          to the laboratory, are to begin early next year. In a
          different project, the Navy is considering sea trials for MHD
          propulsion.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">''The marriage of an MHD propulsion
          system to underwater vehicles is a natural,'' said Dr. Daniel
          W. Swallom, who manages the Navy-financed program on the
          propulsion system at the Avco Research Laboratory in Everett,
          Mass. His program's goal is an open-ocean test with a remotely
          piloted vehicle.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Soviet Union has carried out much
          basic research on this form of propulsion, but intelligence
          experts are at odds on whether the Russians are applying the
          idea to their submarines.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Magnetohydrodynamics involves magnetic
          fields (magneto) and fluids (hydro) that conduct electricity
          and interact (dynamics). The phenomenon occurs naturally in
          the Earth's core, giving rise to the planet's magnetic field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In MHD propulsion, a pair of electrodes
          on either side of the thruster pass an electric current
          through sea water. The process does not work effectively with
          fresh water because it can carry little current. At a right
          angle to the current is the magnetic field generated by the
          superconducting magnet. The interaction of the magnetic field
          and the current produces a strong force on the water, moving
          it through the duct in the center of the magnet. If the
          polarity of the current is reversed, so is the direction of
          thrust.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The action is identical to what happens
          with an electric motor when its magnetic field crosses a
          bundle of copper wires carrying an electric current, causing
          it to move and the central shaft of the motor to rotate.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The activity in each case revolves around
          charged particles. In the motor, the current-filled wires are
          filled with moving electrons, which carry a negative charge,
          and are strongly acted upon by the magnetic field. In MHD
          propulsion, the electric current flowing through the seawater
          causes the formation of charged particles, or ions, which in a
          similar manner</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">are acted upon by the powerful field of
          the superconducting magnet. It propels both the ions and the
          seawater.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The direction of the force is at right
          angles to the matrix formed by the current and magnetic field.
          This effect, known as the Lorentz force, was first quantified
          by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz in the late 19th
          century.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">'The Same Old Story'</font></b> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">This form of propulsion was conceived and
          tested in the United States more than two decades ago but
          languished until the advent of superconducting magnets. These
          can be made very powerful and very efficient because, when
          their coils are cooled almost to absolute zero, they lose no
          electricity to resistance.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In the late 1980's, Japan became the
          first nation to publicly embark on a sizable program meant to
          achieve MHD propulsion. ''It's the same old story,'' said Dr.
          Petrick at Argonne. ''The idea evolves in this country but
          someone else picks it up and runs with it.''</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Leading the Japanese work is the
          Foundation for Shipbuilding Advancement, a private concern
          working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hitachi Zosen and

          Armed Services Committee who was once associated with the
          American MHD effort.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Japanese work focuses on the 100-foot
          ship, whose top speed is to be eight knots. It has two MHD
          thrusters on two huge fins protruding from the craft's hull,
          according to a paper by the foundation. A thruster is made up
          of six magnetic modules, each fitted with a sea-water duct
          some 10 inches in diameter. One thruster assembly is being
          built by Mitsubishi</font> <br>

          test, its small thrusters being relatively inefficient. If the
          technique is to work commercially, magnets must become
          lighter, larger and more powerful.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Japanese work has helped increase
          American interest in MHD propulsion, although the Defense
          Department had been studying it for many years. At Argonne, a

          under way sponsored by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced
          Research Projects Agency.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The centerpiece of the lab's work is a
          huge $12 million superconducting magnet originally built for
          research on super-efficient generation of electricity from
          coal. The program's funds were cut, so the giant magnet was
          never used. Argonne is adapting the behemoth to search for
          subtle troubles that might complicate the MHD process for
          large volumes of water.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The big magnet's water channel, 20 inches
          in diameter, will speed 25,000 gallons of water per minute
          through a 75-foot closed loop, giving researchers their first
          clues about the feasibility of full-scale MHD propulsion. If
          no show-stoppers crop up, the next challenge will be
          engineering, mainly making heavy superconducting magnets much
          lighter and more powerful.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">''Because the conductivity of sea water
          is so low, you have to go to very large sizes on the thruster,
          with big superconducting magnets,'' said Argonne's Dr.
          Petrick. ''They have to be lightweight. All that's going to
          require almost a breakthrough.'' The problem is that
          superconducting magnets are so strong they literally try to
          tear themselves apart. Intense magnetic fields cause tiny
          movements of internal parts and coils, in turn generating heat
          that can trigger the violent loss of superconductivity. To
          solve the problem, magnet designers use heavy metal fixtures
          to inhibit</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">For ships and submarines, said Dr.
          Petrick, the new generation of super-strong, super-light
          composite materials would have to be applied to the making of
          superconducting magnets. ''Theoretically, you can exceed the
          efficiencies of propellers,'' he said.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">An 'Acoustic Signature'</font></b> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Even at low efficiencies, MHD propulsion
          may be attractive to the military because of its relative
          silence. Much tracking of enemy submarines centers on
          listening for the sounds generated by complex power trains and
          propellers.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">MHD propulsion, notes a recent statement
          from the Navy's David Taylor Research Center in Annapolis,
          Md., ''offers the potential for an extremely quiet system for
          propelling underwater vehicles.''</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Potential problems from the Navy's point
          of view include hydrogen bubbles given off at the system's
          electrode from the electrolysis, or breaking into component
          parts, of sea water. The bubbles, according to the Taylor
          statement, ''have an acoustic signature and may produce a
          visible wake.'' Potential solutions, it said, include gasless
          electrodes and bubble capture.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Another potential hurdle is a magnetic

        This is an electrical propulsion method with no moving parts
        which applies to any conductive fluid including water, liquid
        metal or plasma. Here I am demonstrating the principle with
        water.&nbsp; Essentially two electrodes in water have a current
        passed between them in a magnetic field and the water is forced
        out the back creating thrust.&nbsp; It is not really a
        commercial proposition but was featured in "The Hunt for Red
        October" as the Soviet stealth sub. </p>
      <p>In my model there are two 1 inch NIB magnets about an inch
        apart. At right angles to this are two electrodes which pass
        about 1.6 A 9.6 VDC in salt water. ie about 15 watts.&nbsp;
        Power is by a model car NiCd pack. The whole decidedly
        unseaworthy construction is made of Balsa and is about 8 inches
        long. </p>
      <p>Performance is underwhelming and I would guess at 1cm/sec boat
        speed. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Using off board power of 1kW (100V 10A) there is a lot
        more action and production of hydrogen and ?oxygen or chlorine
        bubbles streaming from the stern, but I don't have a big enough
        tub of saltwater to test it for speed.&nbsp; On the right is the
        ignition of the hydrogen bubbles with the bright yellow flame
        from the sodium in the seawater bubbles. Normally a hydrogen
        flame is almost colourless.&nbsp; After a short while the
        electrodes wear away and the water fills with debris, presumably
        insoluble salts of the metal electrodes. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The 2005 model is now here!&nbsp; Features:&nbsp; 2.5
        times the power (16 alkaline AA cells giving 24V - previously
        9.6V NiCd pack)&nbsp; Typically 50W output from salt water
        swimming pool (20V 2.5A) through to near saturated salt solution
        (12V 4.5A.) Vertical twin magnets to avoid compass rotation
        effects and now one magnet is within the hull hence reduced
        friction. Heavy Aluminium electrodes more completely contained
        in the magnetic field. It's red hence should go three times as
        fast. </p>
      <p>Small print.&nbsp; It's still incredibly slow. Handles like a
        brick. It's still no use to anyone. Full sea trials yet to be
        conducted </p>

        the "Yamoto" made by Mitsubishi in the 1990's and weighing 185
        tons which travelled at 15 km/h. It uses a superconducting 4
        Tesla magnet, and the round cross section of the motor looks
        remarkably like mine but about 10 times the diameter (260mm).
        Electrodes are Titanium with anode coating of DSA (?) and the
        cathode plated with Platinum. The length of electrodes is 3.4 m.

      <p>Magnetohydrodynamics is a subject that concerns itself with
        several branches of fundamental physics, in particular
        electricity and magnetism, and thus makes a good demonstration
        for the senior high school years. Magnetohydrodynamics, or MHD
        for short, is an application of the Lorentz Force Law which can
        be used to propel boats and such in an ionic solution, such as
        salty sea water. </p>
      <p>This type of propulsion unit is still being considered as an
        efficient mode of transportation by some industries of the world
        however there are still some major engineering problems to
        overcome. For example the average magnetic field strength to
        propel a freighter would have to be in the order of 8 to 20
        teslas (a fridge magnet, that you would find in your home, is
        only about 0.01 tesla!). A way to overcoming this particular
        problem is through the use of high temperature superconducting
        magnets. </p>
      <p>This presentation will be primarily concerned with the theory
        behind the operation of a magnetohydrodynamic propulsion
        mechanism that will propel a model boat in a pool of salt water.
        The static display and the converted model boat are a relatively
        inexpensive way to demonstrate some fundamental theories of
        electricity and magnetism. The total cost should not exceed the
        200 dollar mark (depending on the resources available to you).
        The presentation itself might have some added demonstrations
        involving the relationship between electricity and magnetism
        (for example to make an electromagnet out of a nail and some
        copper wire.), but in general the core presentation is to
        explain, at a senior high school level, the concept of
        magnetohydrodynamics. </p>
      <p>There exists at least one other design for a MHD powered boat
        of this nature which might be a good reference for any students
        interested in building one for themselves: </p>
      <p>Self­powered Magnetohydrodynamic Motors, by Stanislaw Bednarek.
        Found in the <i>American Journal of Physics</i>, Volume 64, No.
        1, January 1996. </p>
      <p>The basic structure of the MHD mechanism is schematically
        represented in Figure 1. The two electrodes and two magnets are
        placed in a salt water solution (preferably saturated) so that
        the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current flowing
        through the water. The ions in the water will be attracted to
        their respective electrodes (opposite charges attract) creating
        a situation where the Lorentz force law can be applied. </p>

        <p><img src="imageS28.JPG" height="432" width="576"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This schematic diagram can be used to find the direction of the
        force on the charged sodium and chlorine ions. To do this you
        can use the right hand rule directly, however remember that the
        right hand rule described here only applies to POSITIVELY
        charged particles. To fully understand how to apply the right
        hand rule to negatively charged particles you need to go into
        the concept of VECTOR CROSS PRODUCTS which is beyond the scope
        of this presentation ie: not covered in grade 12 physics. </p>
      <p>A better way to figure out the direction of the force is to
        construct a set of axes, as shown in fig.1, and use the scalar
        equation of the Lorentz force law </p>
      <p>To construct the axis you need the right hand rule. The
        positive velocity direction is in the direction of conventional
        current ie: the direction of the positive charge flow (+ to -).
        All the other positive axes follows from the right hand rule
        (Thumb in + v direction ...). </p>
      <p>Now using F = QvB you ignore the actual numbers of Q, v, B
        (since they would be difficult to measure) and work with the
        SIGNS of the numbers. In the cases of v and B, the signs
        correspond to the respective DIRECTIONS of v and B according to
        the axes you just set up. For Q the sign corresponds to whether
        the particle is positively charged or negatively charged (in
        this case Na+ or Cl-). Thus the sign of the resultant force is
        just found by multiplying all the signs together, according to F
        = QvB, and the direction is found from the axes you constructed.
      </p>
      <p>For example refer to fig.1 and take Cl- : <br>
        # The sign of Q is - <br>
        # The sign of v is - <br>
        # The sign of B is + </p>
      <p>Therefore two negatives and a positive all multiplied together
        gives a positive and so the force on the chlorine ion is in the
        positive F direction which is out of the page. The same can be
        done for the sodium ion and the resultant force is in the same
        direction. </p>
      <p><b>Right Hand Rule</b> </p>
      <p>Lorentz Force Law </p>
      <p>The Lorentz Force Law can be used to describe the effects of a
        charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. The
        simplest form of this law is given by the scalar equation </p>
      <p>F = QvB <br>
        # F is the force acting on the particle (vector) <br>
        # v is velocity of particle (vector) <br>
        # Q is charge of particle (scalar) </p>
      <p>B is magnetic field (vector) </p>
      <p>NOTE: this case is for v and B perpendicular to each other
        otherwise use F = QvB(sin(x)) where x is the angle between v and
        B. When v and B are perpendicular x=90 deg. so sin(x)=1. </p>
      <p>The right hand rule comes into play here to figure out which
        way the force is acting. </p>
      <p>Right Hand Rule </p>
      <p>For a POSITIVLY charged particle moving (velocity v) in a
        magnetic field (field B) the direction of the resultant force
        (force F) can be found by: <br>
        # 1) THUMB of right hand in direction of VELOCITY, v (first
        vector) <br>
        # 2) INDEX FINGER of r.h. in direction of FIELD, B (second
        vector) <br>
        # 3) Your PALM (or middle finger if you like) now points in the
        direction of the FORCE, F (final vector) </p>
      <p>The force will ALWAYS be perpendicular to the PLANE of the
        vectors v and B, no matter what the angle between v and B is.
        Just pretend the following picture is of your right hand: </p>

      <p><b>Calculating the Magnitude of the Force</b> </p>
      <p>Once you have found the direction of the force you need to
        calculate its MAGNITUDE. You can't directly use the standard
        form of the Lorentz force law since the values of Q, v and B
        would be very difficult to measure. So you have to convert the
        equation in terms of things which are easily measured: <br>
        Start with F = QvB <br>
        # I = Q / t (definition of current) therefore Q = I t <br>
        # v = d / t (definition of velocity) <br>
        # substitute to get </p>
      <p>F = (I t)(d / t)B simplify... <br>
        F = IdB <br>
        # I is the current of charges <br>
        # d is the distance traveled by the charges <br>
        # B is the magnetic field (perpendicular to the direction of the
        current) </p>
      <p>The boat itself needs a reasonable force to accelerate it. The
        following calculations are based on my construction of the boat.
      </p>
      <p>Use F = I d B </p>
      <p>I = 3 A (short circuit current between electrodes) </p>
      <p>d = 2.7 cm (0.027 m) (distance between electrodes) </p>
      <p>B = 0.2 T ( S.I. units: 0.2 N/(A*m) measured) </p>
      <p>therefore force on water (force propelling the boat) is: </p>
      <p>F = (3.0 A)(0.027 m)(0.2 N/(A*m)) <br>
        F = 0.0162 Newtons </p>
      <p>It is only natural that students in grade 12 physics don't have
        an intuitive idea of how much this force actually is, so to put
        things into perspective you ask the question: </p>
      <p>what mass would this be if the force is due to gravity acting
        on that mass? <br>
        # F = ma = mg therefore m = F / g <br>
        # F = 0.0162 N ; g = 9.8 m/s2 <br>
        # m = (0.0162 kg*m/s2) / (9.8 m/s2) = 1.6 grams <br>
        # is about the mass of a penny. <br>
        What acceleration does this produce on the boat? </p>
      <p>Boat has mass 0.470 kg </p>
      <p>F = ma therefore a = F/m = (0.0162N)/(0.47kg) = 0.04 m/ s2 </p>
      <p>What speed will the boat be going after 30 s? </p>
      <p>a = v/t therefore v = at = (0.04m/s2)(30s) = 0.0012 m/s = 1.2
        mm/s </p>
      <p>Not fast but still noticeable! </p>

      <p>This section contains pictures and descriptions of the MHD
        motor, static display and boat which I used in my presentation.
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, you need to see how many batteries you need to carry
        on the boat. By experimentation and calculation it was found
        that the force produced by a current of 3A, supplied by a 9 volt
        battery, would do nicely. Is 9 volts enough to produce this
        current in a saturated salt water solution? </p>
      <p># Use R = d/(A) where d is the distance the current travels </p>
      <p>A is the cross sectional area of the material in which the
        current is traveling </p>
      <p>is the conductivity of the material </p>
      <p>In this case the material is a saturated salt water solution
        and: <br>
        # d = 0.04 m is the distance between the electrodes <br>
        # A = 0.0008 m2 is the area of an electrode = 22.6 (m)-1 for
        saturated salt water at 20 deg. Celsius <br>
        # Carrying the calculation through to get R = 2.21 . Now use
        Ohms Law: V = IR where I = 3A (short-circuit current of a 9 volt
        battery) V = 6.64 volts So a 9 volt battery should do the job. </p>
      <p>If the water is not saturated, which was the case with my
        project, you might want to put some more batteries in series. (I
        had 3 in series; on the heavy side) </p>
