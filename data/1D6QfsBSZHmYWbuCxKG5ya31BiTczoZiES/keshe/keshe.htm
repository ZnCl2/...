      The Keshe Foundation is proud to announce the development of "<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Day &amp; Night Panels</span>" which
      deliver day and night current at levels which are considerably
      higher than the actual generation of solar panels. This means that
      D&amp;N-panels will be able to power constantly electrical and
      electronic devices. This new technology is under patent
      application.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time these panels have the possibility to capture CO2
      and CH4 in liquid state from the air. CO2 and CH4 are important
      greenhouse gasses.<br>
      <br>

      Photo of solid CO2 at room temperature. This mastic-like substance
      is not "dry ice", which is the state we normally would consider
      solid CO2 to be. Therefore we consider it to be in GANS-state (GAs
      + Nano + Solid state).<br>
      <br>
      The solid CO2 can be bent or manipulated like a chewing gum or a
      mastic. It has the temperature of the room.<br>
      <br>
      Our CO2 jell is measured at 2630 wavelength of the spectrum, where
      the asymetric stretch is normally predicted at 2640 cm-1 (after
      ref. science.widener.edu), so an almost perfect match.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Several static and dynamic working prototypes confirms the new
      insights related to the PME's (Plasmatic Magnetic Energy) and the
      Keshe concept of <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEPMAF's
        (Specific Entangled Plasmatic Magnetic Fields)</span>. In the
      design and technology of our reactor systems, the same principles
      and methods as in the universal physics are developed and similar
      effects have been achieved.<br>
      <br>
      One of most simple static plasma reactors is the Cola Bottle. This
      is equipped with a number electrodes, from two to five.<br>
      <br>
      In this cola bottle reactor we achieve several outputs of voltage
      and current, we create atomic hydrogen and we process
      simultaneously deposits of atomic carbon on electrodes. The
      processing in not based on chemical interaction, like with acids.
      The working of these static reactors is completely different from
      as it happens in existing batteries. Current is for example also
      collected from electrodes which are not submerged in the liquid,
      thus is collected from pure plasma. Next it is noted that the
      reactor recharges itself automatically while other terminals
      generate voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The main goal to perform these tests is proving that the carbon
      from the gasses inside the liquid can be collected and deposited
      on the electrodes. This is to demonstrate that the same principle
      can be utilized for separation of carbon from the exhaust gasses
      of cars and industry.<br>
      <br>
      The acids contained in the cola drink are not essential to create
      current.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img
            style="width: 450px; height: 372px;" alt=""
            src="1startkeshe.jpg"><br>

          <img style="width: 450px; height: 260px;" alt=""

        </span></div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Other outcomes have been found with other combinations of
      the electrodes. Similar voltages and current are also reached with
      both electrodes only in the plasma area (upper part), thus not
      submerged in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      All photos were taken during the same test. After further
      processing the electrodes become black by the deposits of sp2's
      and sp3. Sp2 carbon (called 'graphene') is a ballistic
      (super-super) conductive material that can be used in micro- and
      nano-electronics. Sp3's are diamond-like structures. This all
      happens in a simple cola bottle, and not in complex systems with
      lasers and high pressure or vacuum!<br>
      <br>
      Transparent testing: During demonstrations for potential partners
      they can provide themselves proper electrodes (and the cola
      liquid). They can use their own multi-meter to measure the
      outcome. They are allowed to videotape the demonstration. After
      demonstration the electrodes with carbon deposits will be given
      back for proper or independent testing. We are even prepared to
      agree on more stringent testing set-up, like the making of the
      reactor (proper glue, and gluing the electrodes in an empty
      reactor bottle provided by the potential partner himself) in their
      presence.<br>
      <br>
      The proof of concept shown by the processes in these static
      reactors when applied in dynamic reactors deliver a much higher
      electrical outcome, able to deliver electricity for various
      applications, such as for households, villages, cars, electronics,
      machines, industry, lighting and industrial processing.<br>

          TECHNOLOGY</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      This web page gives a new insight into the energy production
      capabilities of the systems.<br>
      <br>
      The technology behind the development of this reactor goes back to
      basic understanding of the laws of physics.<br>
      <br>
      The concept of creation of energy for this reactor is on the basis
      of the understanding of the cooperation, interaction and
      application of the atomic structure of the gases and matters up on
      each other.<br>
      <br>
      The principal of the behavior of gases and liquids in the
      environment has been studied and catalogued in detail over the
      past decades. This is an important factor in development of any
      energy system, which has to be portable and light, but at the same
      time flexible, energetic and functional for it to be used for its
      merit in any system. This being used for power production, gravity
      or anti-gravity, shielding and medical use and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      For this system to be able to take advantage of above criteria it
      is important to use Hydrogen as the primary catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the system as an Energy source<br>
      <br>
      This system is a fully integrated Electro-Nuclear-Magnetic power
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      The system, at its core, will be a creator of magnetic field
      forces that man is used to as part of the magnetic fields of the
      earth. The unit generates magnetic fields that can pass through
      tissues and atoms without affecting their characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic fields created by planets are called the Passive Magnetic
      Field Forces (PMF). These properties are what the whole universe
      uses to move moons, planets, stars and the galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      In utilizing these forces and technology available through this
      system, electric energy can be created using hydrogen as its fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The creation of electric energy in this reactor is achieved
      through the simple process of hydrogen ionization. Elaborate
      systems have been developed to tap into this process during its
      interactions with other matters in the core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen supplied for this purpose is of a natural form, which
      can be realized from water or the atmosphere through already
      established, known technologies.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Keshe Electric Generator</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The most important actual systems for the production of
      electricity heat up water to create steam, where the steam then
      will provoke the rotation of a turbine which is connected to a
      magnet. This magnet rotates in coil structures.<br>
      <br>
      These systems produce a lot of negative waste effects.<br>
      <br>
      We can simplify the generation of electricity by the new Keshe
      generators which will contain only low, short term, nuclear
      sources. These generators will produce electricity over a long
      time, since the basic interactions are self-sustaining.<br>
      <br>
      This is one of the concepts of a Keshe generator. A spherical
      self-rotating reactor core spins inside a set(s) of coils. On the
      reactor-body additional magnets can be mounted.<br>
      <br>
      These electric generators can be installed on the locations where
      current is needed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">HYDROGEN</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Hydrogen gas at an atomic and molecular level has some fascinating
      properties. That, if they are used for the right purpose at the
      right time in the right combination, this element will provide and
      facilitate most of the needs of systems for all above
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      So, it does not matter in what form Hydrogen is used, when this
      gas is used in conjunction with other elements. Primary conditions
      can be created in the reactor that brings about all above desired
      effects in any system.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen atoms by having one proton and one electron are the
      lightest element in the universe; it is one of the most common
      elements used for creation of plasma.<br>
      <br>
      To create plasma there is a need to separate the electron from its
      nucleus by means of injecting enough energy into the atom so that
      the nucleus can be freed of its electron. This process is known as
      the ionization of hydrogen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have successfully achieved this principal for some
      time. If the excited electron, which is created, can be made to
      lose its energy in an appropriate way, it can return to its
      original state. Then the production of current and heat is made
      simple.<br>
      <br>
      How these effects are created and used, are the principals behind
      the energy and gravity creation of this reactor. In this reactor,
      electrons are released from their nuclei with a method that has
      been known for some time by scientists, where the reaction is
      achieved by a very simple method of magnetic environment injection
      using natural hydrogen atoms. This is a very simple but effective
      method especially developed for the application in this reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Then as other elements come in to play, the true nature of
      hydrogen will reveal its potency in this system as a whole as it
      has done in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      Where, how, how much, when and the way these gases and matters are
      applied in the system, will create the desired effect that is
      required of the system at that time.<br>
      <br>
      So the system can be a power generator, then with a slight change
      in one of the parameters of one of the matters the system will
      become a gravity machine. Then, by combining the two effects, one
      will have a system that not only generates energy, but it holds
      gravity and creates anti-gravity too.<br>
      <br>
      With this system one cannot bring in to play the conventional
      present day fuels, and methods to create energy and magnetism.<br>
      <br>
      In this system energy production is achieved simply by the normal
      creation of heat first, then gravity in the center of the core,
      with the help of the generation of magnetic fields through the
      right method of circulation and cooling system, within the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      In the world of science, it has always been considered that the
      core of a planet possesses magnetic fields that cause it to
      rotate.<br>
      <br>
      For the first time and through new understanding of the system of
      creation of gravitational forces in planets, it has been proven
      theoretically by Mr. M. T. Keshe that the center of the Earth
      possesses two magnetic fields rather then one.<br>
      <br>
      In understanding the “double magnetic field” operation of the
      earths core, with the design of this new reactor, the
      gravitational system of the earth is replicated, leading to the
      creation and control of gravity in the center of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      In understanding the operation of this double magnetic field
      force, and incorporating it in the reactor that is being
      developed, new horizons are opened in the world of science.<br>
      <br>
      For example, this leads to the creation of heat sufficient to
      generate a super heated head of steam at the outer boundaries of
      the system adequate to run the present PowerStation turbines if
      need be.<br>
      <br>
      Where production of the electric current directly from the reactor
      core is achievable.<br>
      <br>
      The system is fueled by hydrogen, so that there are no
      possibilities of radiation leakage or radioactive waste problems
      due to other effects in this system.<br>
      <br>
      In present nuclear reactors, heat is collected using all sorts of
      moderators, cooling and blanketing in a concentrated way inside
      and outside the reactor’s core. Then, the collected heat is fed
      through, to run a (steam) turbine creating energy.<br>
      <br>
      Through the specific design of this reactor all the heat
      distribution, removal and circulation is done inside the reactor,
      without the need to remove heat from the boundary of the reactor
      in a concentrated method as has been done in the past.<br>
      <br>
      This has been possible through the understanding of the natural
      method of heat dissipation as done in planets.<br>
      <br>
      The concept behind this technology comes from the simple fact that
      in the Universe planets do not have cooling towers or exhaust
      pipes.<br>
      <br>
      Efforts were made to look at the real method of energy creation in
      the planets in possession of internal heating systems, but cool
      enough that man can walk on their surface, like earth. Through a
      simple but effective way, this has been achieved in the core of
      this reactor, where heat is dissipated so that it will never reach
      the outer boundary of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage with this system is, that when heat is redistributed
      in a slightly simpler way, and not in a concentrated method as
      done in the present thermal nuclear reactors, totally different
      properties from the reactor with the same fuel can be attained.<br>
      <br>
      These properties created in this system, are what the whole
      Universe uses to heat and move planets, stars and galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      This system uses technology which can and will lead to fusion,
      semi-fusion and fission if required.<br>
      <br>
      All this is achieved by using a reactor, which has in its core no
      valves or screws, and as in the center of planets, requires a very
      small amount of hydrogen.<br>

      [0001] An important part of research on energy happened since
      about 1940 when the quest for nuclear power and it's control
      really started. We see that several concepts were developed since
      then. Some special more performing concepts without the nuclear
      waste problem are still under development, like the Tokomak
      reactors. The world of nuclear industry seems to be infatuated by
      the dream to create the power of the Sun on Earth. But a change in
      the physical design structure of the present reactors is needed
      because the fusion industry of today has not managed to produce
      any sustainable and substantial amount of energy after some fifty
      years of research and development. The reason for the failure of
      these reactors is rooted in the following three major
      miscalculations.<br>
      <br>
      Miscalculation 1: These reactors all suffer from the central
      column syndrome. That is to say that, these all have a center
      solid body right in the middle of the reactor. This is to
      facilitate the physical loops of the magnetic coil rings, so that
      the magnetic fields can be produced and maintained to bring the
      plasma to the right temperature and speed, in order to achieve
      fusion. This is a fundamental problem if the scientists are trying
      to imitate and reach the temperature of the center of the Sun. As
      when has any one seen a central column in the center of the Sun?<br>
      <br>
      Miscalculation 2: The fundamental reversal of laws of physics. If
      one looks at magnetic field forces in the universe. The magnetic
      force is created and maintained, from the center outwards, in any
      star in possession of fusion core. In these man-made designs, the
      laws of physics are turned inside out, where the magnetic fields
      are enforced from the outside, inward. This is an explanation as
      to why the scientists are using so much energy for such a small
      output.<br>
      <br>
      Our view: The magnetic field force has to be created and
      maintained from the inner part to radiate out and thus allowing
      creation of the second magnetic field force inwards, to contain
      the plasma within the center of the core.<br>
      <br>
      Miscalculation 3: Current concepts of fusion production and
      maintenance lack a source of Gravitational Field Forces like the
      one in the center of the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      Our view: The secret of the Sun in holding together all the
      elements that can sustain fusion, is the existence of a massive
      gravitational field force at its core. What this means, is that
      the center of the Sun possesses and maintains a very high level
      gravitational field force, that can hold on to the plasma of its
      massive body.<br>
      <br>
      This gravity around the center of the Sun is calculated to be in
      the order of hundreds and thousands of times more powerful then
      the gravitational force on the surface of the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] If one reads all the past and present reported results of
      the tests on TOKOMAK-type fusion reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Even, when one asks the men in charge of the latest fusion
      experiments in UK, they all report the gravity in the reactor core
      to be a fraction of the gravitational force on the surface of the
      earth. This is primarily due to the fact, that, there is no system
      devised to create and maintain a gravitational field force to hold
      the plasma in the reactor core and pull it together.<br>
      <br>
      If this was or could be achieved there would not be a need for
      such a large input of current to create the magnetic field force
      from outside coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] So how can a nuclear fusion reactor maintain its power
      without the existence of a Gravitational Field Force?<br>
      <br>
      This is like baking a sponge cake without having any flour or egg
      in the dough. How can one achieve fusion when they do not posses
      the main ingredient to hold the plasma together to sustain fusion?<br>
      <br>
      [0005] When these problems are understood and rectified by the
      scientists they may then use these forces and materials
      appropriately as in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The other problem which scientists in the world of fusion
      do not tell and have not considered, is the truth about the one
      hundreds million degrees centigrade temperature they try to create
      in the TOKOMAK reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A few thousand degrees melted the Columbia shuttle on
      re-entry into earth's atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The present technology cannot handle a few thousand degree's
      temperature. The question is: How are they going to handle one
      hundred million degree temperatures for a long time in a two-meter
      diameter TOKAMAK core without making provision for removing
      heating from the core?<br>
      <br>
      This question is what the fusion engineers are avoiding to answer.
      They are hoping to have an answer in fifty years, after spending
      thirteen billion dollars in the next twenty years from the common
      market and Japan.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Nor we see the correct approach in patent-applications by
      other inventors.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The method which is claimed in this patent application is
      such that - under centrifugal and vacuum conditions - a
      turbulence, rotation, compressive and heating of a gaseous matter
      is created in a reactor by at least one central rotative magnetic
      field with the purpose of creating plasmatic conditions leading to
      various physical phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] We claim also a method where - under centrifugal and vacuum
      conditions in presence of ionization condition - a turbulence,
      rotation, compressive and heating of a gaseous matter is created
      in a reactor by at least one central rotative magnetic field with
      the purpose of creating plasmatic conditions leading to the
      creation various magnetic fields where at least the interaction of
      two magnetic field would lead to the creation of at least one
      gravitational force phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In this patent-application we disclose a concept, method
      and technology for more efficient and higher, electric energy
      levels as well as creation of gravity and anti-gravity within a
      center of an object or a matter that can be created at a
      relatively very low cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It is important to understand that we see an analogy with
      the planetary concept and positioning of planets in our solar
      system. The Earth and all planets and stars possess a centrally
      heated core. The creation and maintenance of the heat and motion
      is not in the level and method which scientist have chosen for
      motion and energy technological progress up to this moment in
      time. Planets possess and maintain heat, magnetic forces and
      gravity through one integrated system with mostly one common
      element as the source of the energy. In the center of planets the
      temperature acquired is more like in thousands of degrees
      centigrade rather than millions of degrees as in stars. But all
      the same, all effects in creating heat, magnetism and gravity can
      be achieved at all temperatures. It is to be proven through the
      design of the reactor in this patent that the strength of magnetic
      field and gravity of these planets is more dependent on the
      composition of the material and the speed of motion in the center
      core of the planet, rather then the size or any other factors in
      the planet or the star internal structure. In the universe vast
      amount of heat are not suddenly produced and presented in one
      instance for fusion to takes place for systems and stars to be
      created. There are laws and procedures to follow to succeed in
      achieving a large or a small system in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      These laws have to be followed to the letter in the design of any
      system or reactor for creation of heat, magnetic forces fields and
      subsequent gravitational forces field and so on, for a system to
      be successful and operational. Planets and stars using the natural
      laws of physic and materials do all these, all at once and
      together without separate machinery and control rooms and fuels.
      They do this as one fully integrated system. Thus for the first
      time in the world of technology and intellect, in and by the
      design of this reactor, fundamental principals are set out and
      developed to show how all these above effects and many more could
      be very simply attained. All at the same time and as in a natural
      universal manner in one fully integrate system.<br>
      <br>
      This is explained very explicitly in the annex that is joined to
      this patent application. That annex is integral part of this
      patent application, and may help the reader to better analyse and
      understand the concepts and ideas about our new reactors and their
      functioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The invention relates to a gravity producing system,
      method, concept and technology whereby in a reactor-embodiment
      (10) a chain of energetic events is created via a rotative
      magnetic (17A), initiation of a basic ionization of a gas (i.e.
      hydrogen 18A) or other matters, which then triggers a controllable
      chain of energy transfers (so called Scintillation) to the next
      following layer(s) of introduced gasses (i.e. He 18B, Ne 18C, Ar
      18D, Kr, Xe 18E), of all other introduced elements of the periodic
      table (i.e. Li, Be, K, Ca, Ti, ... Pt, etc.) and/or their
      introduced molecule combinations (i.e. a vapor).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Without scintillation in a low density, low volume ration
      of atomic hydrogen environment of galaxies, the process of
      ionisation will not take place, that the rest of the chain of
      events for the creation of any system or galaxy can take is
      initiated. Scintillation is the ignition key for start of creation
      of any system in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      All inert gases in conjunction with different materials and
      conditions in the cores can be used for or as scintillation
      material in the core of the reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The use of liquid helium and neon and other inert gases as
      scintillators is the essential ingredient of the operation of any
      system that needs to generate heat, power and gravity. Helium and
      neon have no unstable naturally occurring isotopes, therefore any
      inherent radioactive backgrounds. That is why these are good
      source for creation of the extreme ultraviolet ray catalyst source
      needed for initial ionisation of hydrogen atoms to start the
      heating of gases and plasma in the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In galaxies the ultraviolet photons from reminisce of the
      explosion of stars have sufficient energy to strip the electrons
      completely away from hydrogen atoms and ionised hydrogen atoms.
      When and if the atom of hydrogen absorbs a photon with wavelength
      of 912¬A. The atom is ionised with the extra energy going in to
      kinetic energy of the electron. This requires a photon energy
      greater then 13.6 eV or wavelength of 912 ¬A in the ultraviolet
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Collision between electrons 'thermalise" their energy, this
      energy heating the gas in the region to higher temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Theoretical models of the installer cloud are providing new
      insights into the role of extreme ultraviolet rays and soft X-ray
      photoelectric heating, as well as thermal conductive interfaces,
      in explaining the observed high ratios of hydrogen HI at very low
      pressures. These indicating not the need for the use of ionised
      Hydrogen but natural hydrogen in the process of heating up a gas
      to Plasma State.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] At the present most considerations are given to use of
      ionised hydrogen and its relation with extreme ultraviolet rays
      emissions. Recent research and findings allows the endeavour to
      new territory of reverse state of condition. Where it has been
      observed in the galaxies that ground state hydrogen receiving
      energy photons in the extreme ultraviolet rays range would and is
      excited to be ionised. Then by returning to ground state through
      catalyses it can be used to release this energy to heat up the
      surrounding gas to heated Plasma State.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] This opening a new approach into development of systems
      where not ionised but natural hydrogen and atomic hydrogen can be
      used to generate energy and currents, by using extreme ultraviolet
      rays rather then ultraviolet rays to create the ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] This new understanding allows low temperature operation and
      less energy input for the higher energy out put, allowing
      operation in the non-nuclear environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] These being due to the fact as natural hydrogen is used,
      there are no possibility of emission above extreme ultraviolet
      rays by the hydrogen atoms, as an atom can not emit more then it
      has absorbed. That is as the extreme ultraviolet rays energy
      absorbed by natural hydrogen atom, this atom to return to ground
      state can only release energies below extreme ultraviolet rays, at
      the same time releasing sufficient energy and free electrons that
      can be useful in a system. For this reason the need for new
      ignition system using extreme ultraviolet rays for hydrogen rather
      then ionisation by ultraviolet rays microwave can be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] By passing liquid helium over Alpha or Beta source to
      generate the extreme ultraviolet rays, Thorindike in late 1950th
      discovered liquid-helium scintillation. Stockton later showed the
      emission of very intense wavelength range in the extreme
      ultraviolet ray's spectrum is centered at about 80 nm. Adams
      confirmed the transparency of liquid helium to its own
      scintillation light reason for the intensity of the photons.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Scintillation of the liquid helium by can be achieved
      through use of Alpha or a beta radiation source, where the use of
      Alpha or Beta source excitation in liquid helium determines the
      density of the ionisation. Adams calculated that, energy deposited
      by Beta particles in super fluid helium are emitted promptly as
      extreme ultraviolet rays light, and is considered to be as much as
      35% of total energy released by the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The initial stage in the process of heating all the
      elements in the core of a reactor has to be the ionisation of
      atoms of hydrogen in the Caroline core by using extreme
      ultraviolet rays, carried by compressed liquid helium into the
      core, which has been exposed to radioactive source prior to entry
      in to the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] This method of ionisation of hydrogen atoms has been
      observed in the galaxies, therefore it should be easy to achieve
      the same in reactor environment under the right condition. The
      extreme ultraviolet rays in vacuum condition cause prompt and
      direct photoionization of hydrogen. Where as lower energy photon
      causes a combination of fragmentation and delay thermionic
      ionisation. Thus use of extreme ultraviolet ray is the fast and
      direct way to start the reactor from cold.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The right choice of radioactive element for production of
      extreme ultraviolet rays in presence of liquid helium or neon is
      important. With the correct selection, the possibility that liquid
      helium will carry any gamma ray energy level radiation into the
      core of the reactor can totally be eliminated. Therefore the
      choice irradiation source for scintillation will have direct
      effect on different combination and the amount of gases used in
      the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Use of neutron traps facilities, in the outlet of
      irradiated chamber of the scintillation unit can make sure no
      neutrons can enter the caroline core, that can create high energy
      rays in the core, that can create radioactive chain of events of
      releasing X-rays or higher level energy rays with the interaction
      with other materials in the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The reactor-embodiment has at least one (26) or more (27)
      spaces (i.e. cavities 11, layers, sub-chambers). This is very
      important to understand. 26 and 27 show two different approaches.
      26 shows a reactor which has one chamber and inside will be - in
      the pure gaseous concept - several layers of inert gasses (or
      other matters or a mixture of gasses and matter). These layers are
      formed in the reactor chamber by the centrifugal and vacuum
      conditions according to their the atomic weight. Since the layers
      have a different rotational speed there will be kinetical,
      magnetic and other effects in the inter-layer regions. 27 shows
      instead a reactor concept where there is a real physical wall
      (i.e. steel wall, liquid substance, vearing energy strength
      matters) in the reactor which separates two zones inside the
      reactor, and each may have it's own internal process(es) and
      specific layer ordering. The magnetic fields in both will
      interfere with each other in a controlled way. This physical wall
      may be dynamical too, meaning to be opened under certain secured
      conditions for various reasons or the separated area's may
      interchange matter or plasma - by connection means - if that is
      appropriate in the processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The concept of creation of energy for this reactor is on
      the bases of the understanding of cooperation, interaction and
      application of the atomic structure of the plasma, gases, liquid
      and solid of all matters known in the world of science.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The principal of the behaviour of these in a vacuum and
      centrifuge environment has been studied and catalogued in detail
      over past decades.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] It is paramount to understand that gases in a vacuum
      environment for their containment behave very much like liquid and
      the two can switch state. With one element changing properties at
      the same time in the same system by slight change of temperature
      or pressure within the core of the reactor. This holds the same
      between the liquid and solid state too.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] If the behaviour of a drop of water in space and the way
      they float in vacuum condition are observed, gases behave the same
      in the vacuum too, they stay in cluster but take over the whole of
      the space of their containment.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] From past research it is understood that gases in a vacuum
      and centrifuged encapsulate each other according to their atomic
      weight, from the lighter gases in the center of the cluster and
      the heaviest on the outer layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] This means that neon will encapsulate helium and heavier
      gas will encapsulate the neon and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The second important principal for inert gas laws is that
      they do not mix with each other in a vacume and centrifuges
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] This factor will play an important part in the development
      of any energy system, which has to be portable and light. But at
      the same time flexible, energetic and functional able for it to be
      used for its merit in any system, this being for power production,
      gravity, anti gravity, shielding and medical use and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] For this system to be able to take advantage of above
      criterion it is important to have Hydrogen in atomic, molecular,
      its isotopes and ionised form are the primary element in
      production of initial heating of the reactor core, as it is done
      in the cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Hydrogen gas in atomic and molecular level has some
      versatile properties, that if they are used for the right purpose
      at the right time in the right combination, this element will
      provide and facilitates most the needs of systems energy creation
      requirement for all applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In this patent, systems are developed, that makes it
      possible for the first time, does not matter in what form hydrogen
      is made available in a core of system, primary condition can be
      created in the core of the vacuum, centrifuge chamber, that brings
      about the desired effect in any system to create the initial heat
      for the onset of chain of events, that will lead on to creation of
      heat in vast amount, electric current in predetermined large
      quantities, single magnetic field condition in molecular level in
      and around the core of the reactor, creation of double magnetic
      field in the molecular level, which the interaction of two
      magnetic fields will lead to creation and control of gravity in
      the center of a system for the first time "creation of gravity" M
      T Keshe.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] When Hydrogen is used in conjunction with other elements,
      hydrogen has the properties of being easy to be ionised by any
      source that can deliver a 13.6 eV of energy to achieve the
      ionisation of its atom. At the same time hydrogen has the
      capability to release this attained energy to a third elements in
      its neighbourhood and return to the ground state rapidly through
      this interaction with this third matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] How ionisation and release of energy are created and used
      are the principals behind the design of this reactor for the
      creation of energy, magnetic effect and gravitational forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Then as other elements are introduced into the core of the
      reactor, then the true nature of the hydrogen will revile its
      potency in this system as a whole. Where, how and how much, when
      and the way all elements are introduced or applied in this system
      cores will create the desire effect that is required of the system
      as the whole at that time.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] So that the system can be power generator, then with slight
      change in one of the parameters of one of the gases or
      introduction of other elements the system will become a gravity
      machine. Then maybe by combining the two effects. One will have a
      system that not only generates energy but it holds gravity and
      creates anti gravity too.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Thus for matter of simplicity in this disclosure the
      simplest forms of the energy and gravity system will be discussed
      and disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In this patent application we name the central area of the
      total reactor the central core (or caroline core) and the outside
      area the outer core.<br>
      So several layers of matter or plasma may be possible wise
      separated by a solid (14A) or by a gaseous (14B) or by an other
      state layering matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] By the chain of inter-layer transfers several other
      physical phenomena are caused, such as:<br>
      <br>
      1. Compression and decompression inside the reactor chamber,<br>
      <br>
      2. Rotation of the matter inside the reactor chamber,<br>
      <br>
      3. the interaction of two magnetic fields (20 and 21) in the
      center core of the reactor,<br>
      <br>
      4. the creation and development of heat (40) due to ionization in
      a soft or hard magnetic fields and their reconnection(s) by the
      matters in the center core (also called caroline core (13, 28A,
      28C) and the magnetic field in turn created in the outer core(s)
      (12, 28B, 28D) in the reactor chamber (11),<br>
      <br>
      5. magnetosphere effects (22) of the two magnetic fields of the
      center core, and the magnetic field of the outer core,<br>
      <br>
      6. the emission of rays up to Ultra Violet for heating up the
      materials in the core(s) or plasma's,<br>
      <br>
      7. the creation and convection motion (71, 81) for creation of
      current (80, 82) and the single and double magnetic fields which
      create the fundamental cyclic transformation /retransformation of
      the gas and/or matter involved from ground-state to

      <br>
      [0048] The interaction between the two magnetic fields, of at
      least two cores, leads to the creation of gravity and anti-gravity
      due the creation of the double spherical or other shaped
      superimposed magnetic fields (20 and 21, 30). This will cause the
      rotation (50) of the containment vessel(s) (see all 18) of the
      caroline core, and the rotation of the inner core (84) will cause
      the rotation in at least one central column in at least one
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] That central column (16A) may have several designs in
      relation to the reactor chamber, the desired functioning depending
      of the type of reactor and it's purpose of design, and may:<br>
      <br>
      a. Either turn completely, powered by a power source (15F) that is
      positioned outside the chamber,<br>
      <br>
      b. Either from which only at least one part with magnetic means
      turns, i.e. the tip-part (51)(in the center of the chamber),<br>
      <br>
      c. Either from which only a part with topological means turns,
      i.e. at least one mixing blade (in the center of the chamber),
      possible wise covered with at least one scintillating material
      (16E) unit (15C), or i.e. a spinning ejection mouth,<br>
      <br>
      d. Either is completely immobile (fixed)(Fig. 9) but which has on
      it's surface at least one set of electro-magnets (90) and/or coils
      which can be activated (92A) or deactivated (92D) - possible wise
      controlled by electronic means (i.e. a microchip 93) - in a
      preferred periodical and/or positional way, which - preferable -
      can change polarity and/or strength (92A, 92B, 92C), that way able
      to create turbulence in the center core, and/or in other superior
      cores,<br>
      e. Either is completely immobile (fixed) but by which the basic
      gas an<br>
      <br>
      d/or matter is pumped in a core by at least one ejection mouth,
      (called the statistic reactor),<br>
      <br>
      f. Either has at least one symmetrical or asymmetrical channel in
      it's tip which can pump gas(ses) from one side to the other,<br>
      <br>
      g. A combination of previous,<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The central column (16A) has possible wise - but very
      preferable - at least one internal channel (16D) (i.e. a borehole
      16B) for the distribution and/or collection of relevant gas(ses),
      matter and/or plasma (23).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The central column possible wise can have at least one
      electrode (17B) - but very preferable several - to collect
      electric current for transportation (17C) to the outside of the
      reactor. This way the currents can be collected for several
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The central column can have - depending from the type of
      reactor (i.e. 14A, 14B) and corresponding to the type of gas,
      matter or plasma - one or more injection-mouths on different
      levels, each for another type of gas, matter and/or plasma,
      preferable on a height that correspondents with the layering
      position that this gas or matter will have after it's atomic
      weight and/or the purpose of the injected plasma or matters.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The reactor (10) comprises a body (24) that can made of any
      natural or man-made material or several materials, or in atomic or
      molecular state - at least made of one part - in which at least
      one hollow space (11) is positioned, and whereby all relevant
      parts (i.e. the wall 25) - if needed to be protected (i.e. coated,
      laminated, painted, etc.) in well known manners against corrosion,
      aggressive acids, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] At the outside of the reactor (10) a number of relevant
      supporting systems are positioned, such as: pressure-tanks (15A),
      reverse tanks (15B), turbo molecular pump (15E), gas seals,
      scintillation unit(s)(15C), electrical brushes (15D), heat removal
      chamber, valves, pumps, tubes, closing means, measuring means,
      control sensors, engine(s)(15F), gears, power-source, electrical
      components (i.e. fuse), computer(s), IC's, etc.<br>
      <br>
      After the initial mechanical rotation (i.e. at 3,000 rpm) and/or
      electromagnetic triggered rotation the internal rotation (50) will
      be continued due the interaction of the magnetic fields involved
      (self-sustained process), in correspondence with one of more
      core-layers and their containment.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Possible wise one of the reactor concepts may have one of
      more of next specifics:<br>
      <br>
      a. The central column may be mechanically withdrawn (52) if the
      internal interaction goes after wish, and can be repositioned
      inside the chamber if there is a need to collect current, to add
      new gas(ses), matter and/or plasma, and/or to adapt or correct the
      balance of the lower or higher volume-ratio of the matter and
      density.<br>
      <br>
      b. In another concept or a combined concept the central column
      will have on his tip (53)(central position) at least two magnetic
      means (54) of different pole, but preferable several sets which
      can be ring wise or polarity faced wise and sized positioned above
      or next to each other, and on the top of the column tip one
      magnet, either in polarity strips (95) or as a single body.<br>
      <br>
      c. The central column may be treated at the inside and/or outside
      surface by radioactive material (16E)(i.e. liquid, solid or a
      spray), or materials which can radioactively decay, or by fixed
      methods of scintillatizion like microwave lamps.<br>
      <br>
      d. A reactor may have more than one column, one (91) with it's tip
      positioned in the center area, and at least one (94) with it's tip
      on a different level, but separated from each other.<br>
      <br>
      e. At least two central columns (fig.7) may be positioned opposite
      to each other, either creating a similar rotational effect, either
      creating a conflicting rotational direction.<br>
      <br>
      f. The reactor body contains at least two separate hollow spaces
      of identical or different dimensions,<br>
      <br>
      g. The reactor body may contains at least two separate material
      cores (i.e. by a wall-layer 14A), a larger encircling a smaller,
      and each may have a proper internal independent process, and
      magnetic interactions may occur between their magnetic fields, and
      matters may be exchanged between physically separated chambers
      (28C and 28D) by connection means (58).<br>
      <br>
      h. The reactor can be connected by connection means with at least
      one other reactor, either of a different type, dimension, concept,
      either identical.<br>
      <br>
      i. In an external container (15C) - outside the chamber - at least
      one scintillating unit (i.e. made of partially of Cs137) is
      available which will have a normal radioactive behavior or his
      natural decay inside or outside the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      j. A reactor may have either a solid structure (10), either a
      dynamical structure and being able to adapt it's structure after,
      (i.e. the internal pressure and temperature), and being secured by
      magnetic seals (16C) and/or fields.<br>
      <br>
      k. A reactor core can have also several overall shapes, such as:
      perfect spherical, elliptic, half-circular, etc.<br>
      <br>
      l. The reactor wall (25) and/or material core wall (29B) can have
      also locally or overall several topological shapes, skins and/or
      furnishings, such as: perfect smooth, dimpled, grooved, triangled,
      etc. Such surface properties may add additional effects on the
      internal process(es).<br>
      <br>
      m. A material core (29B) can also be surrounded by conductive
      wires (i.e. copper) or bands, or similar, which can create
      additional Alternating Current, which can be superimposed on the
      Direct Current(s) which are created within the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Above mentioned reactor concepts, method and technology
      results in a completely new type of dynamic energy-source and
      energy concept which also implies the control over local gravity.
      This brings a large number of new products and applications. These
      are also described in the annex document, which is part of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] One of the most important results is the creation of
      gravity and anti-gravity. We see a number of applications next.<br>
      Next the creation of internal heat source leading to creation and
      the interaction of two or more magnetic fields, leading to
      creation of gravity, shielding and current production in
      alternating or direct or electrovolts levels, can be used in
      applications for space, aircraft, and submarine, sea-bottom
      habitat, liquid habitat (like in a container tank or for nano
      technology in blood vessels), colonisation crafts and colonisation
      systems (i.e. cocooned atmosphere conditions on a sea bed, beneath
      surface or on surfaces). The same can also be created by at least
      one extra layer with a magnetic field rotating in opposite
      direction to at least one other magnetic field, within at least
      one core or outside the boundary of the system, creating in
      example a impenetrable field and useful for reentry or exit of
      atmospheric conditions, or for laser-like effects of co-existing
      magnetic fields (i.e. surgery, cutting tools and long-distance
      communication).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The production of energy via soft fusion (i.e. cold and
      warm fusion) is a major application.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The production of plasma due the creation of gravity at
      molecular level between two magnetic fields (41, 42)(62, 63) of
      two cavities or more in a system for creation high temperature
      plasma in fusion industries (40) is very important.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] New concepts of batteries, lighting devices (i.e.
      transparent reactor-housing, light-bulb, floor light, wall light
      and flood-light, etc.), security products (i.e. traffic lights,
      sensors, water purifiers, etc.) and industrial and household
      devices and apertures, like water-production machines become
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      Also heating and drying devices, the use of energy production
      capabilities for creating heating like warming the surrounding
      maters, like in boilers and heaters in the house for central
      heating systems or individual heating systems, and warm
      blanketing, using as boiler for warming up or boiling matters like
      liquids and malting solid materials, for use as drying system like
      hair dryers for industrial or commercial drying system, or heating
      oven, or stove or cookers in the house appliances, or grilling of
      food appliances for private or commercial or industrial use. Other
      application can be i.e. the heating of the roads in winter, the
      soils for plant growth, etc.<br>
      <br>
      New cooling devices can be constructed due the reverse gravity
      magnetic field_generation system(s), where the system will absorb
      heat from its surrounding, to cool its surrounding for use in the
      air-conditioning for buildings and cars, and crafts or any object
      which can carry any other object, refrigeration systems of any
      kind , production of ice or frozen state of any material or
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The production of new materials in and outside the reactor
      chamber under specific magnetic and/or gravitational conditions
      (i.e. directional nano growth, the welding of atoms and molecules,
      etc.) becomes possible. A number of processes related to atom
      creation become possible, such as for human or animal or plant
      cells, where the micro gravitational field in presence of magnetic
      fields in one or more magnetic fields created in the center of the
      one or more cavities will allow magnetic fields above dark
      magnetic levels to manifest themselves and cluster together to
      create the nucleolus of the atom and in use of multi layering,
      then the electrons are allowed to manifest themselves, and these
      processes can be continued for leading to production of molecules,
      and base material for the DNA, where specific energies or magnetic
      fields are inserted leading to creation of the right
      characteristic of the foundation of the any cell or organs or
      creatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In space refuelling and accessing new material for food or
      oxygen, or parts will easily done, simply by retracting basic
      matters in the cosmos soup and using this method in conjunctions
      with atomic welding methods, all maters on continuous bases can be
      produced or manufactured as demand arises, so there are no need
      for huge inventory to carry, one produces in the core as what it
      is needed at that point of space and time.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Gravitational devices become possible which can move
      without contact with a carrying substrate (i.e. earth surface,
      sea, air, etc.), such as gravitational lifted transport devices,
      lifters for heavy products, wheel chairs for able and disable
      bodies, the push chair for children , or elevators in building,
      the use of hollow center loop fitted with rotor blade of any kind
      for the manufacture of current, for sky or water board , sliding
      board for play where the board hover, for movement large objects,
      this being for automotive or commercial vessels, trucks and
      trailers or shipping over liquid or solid bodies from one
      continent to other or planets or solar systems and galaxies, for
      use of cycles sliding over surface, craft which can fly and have
      magnetic shielding and gravitational force field inside, for
      railway like system where the object of any size or length can
      flout over the track, use in the fork lift and crane and platform
      lifting of an object of any kind and size in industry for lifting
      objects or liquids to any height, for the use in the gates and
      doors which will elevate and levitate or revolve by use of
      antigravity and vice versa, tables and chairs, beds, furniture's
      of any kind with or without legs or attachments to the physical
      surrounding, shoes for walking, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] New methods and applications become possible in the
      inter-terra development and exploration (i.e. transport tunnels
      and hollow habitat spaces by rock melting in deeper earth and
      planet layers),<br>
      <br>
      [0065] We see also an interesting number of applications in
      Transforming units for the decomposition and recompositions of
      waste and old products in new basic matter and materials or
      specific combinations (i.e. plastics) with perfect internal atomic
      ordering.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] There are also products related to the creation of double
      or more magnetic fields_superimposed (30), at least two, and fully
      in circulating each other in layers, on top of each other for
      multi-layer shielding of an object, where at least one magnetic
      fields can rotate in one direction or at least one rotating in the
      opposite direction to one or more fields, like for the use in
      submarine or space craft industry, air- and space transport
      systems and devices (i.e. with magnetic shielding effect with
      creation of imposition gravity) and non-air-friction-systems,
      products for welding industry, this being material or atomic
      welding or molecular welding.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] New electronic devices and components become possible (i.e.
      computers, scanners, etc. with 3D-dynamische layers), nano-wire
      transistors, three dimensional screen, three dimensional
      communication holographic systems, etc., and various aspects of
      nano-technology, where the minuet machines needed to be energised
      and controlled, where the packages of energy can be made or
      delivered to the energy cells or the battery of the system for it
      to continue operation, or the use of minuet battery system which
      only creates electrovolts current needed for the operation of
      these micro machines.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] A important application is in the field of communication
      systems, by the use of the soft body, or port of the reactor at
      least with one cavity, where the high energy magnetic wave are
      released in the spherical domain, or at least in one direction,
      where the magnetic energy will be code in the sequence as in the
      present system but this will be hard to decipher in the inter
      galaxy system, the best method of space rapid response
      communication will be the magnetic plasma of the element in the
      sequential chambers, what this means is that the Hydrogen plasma
      magnetic energy will be A, Helium plasma magnetic energy will be B
      and so forth, according to atomic weight if the element, where
      simultaneous small chamber magnetic charge will be released in the
      magnetic energy field level, then there is no need for decoding or
      losing information in the solar system or galaxy media, as each
      element of the periodic table carries it own magnetic energy
      frequencies in the plasma magnetic state, and then the time laps
      will be insignificant, and inter solar magnetospheric bouncing
      will be used, like satellite dishes of the present time to forward
      a massage onto the next system or craft in the other part of the
      same system or others.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] New decontamination systems, and growth provoking magnetic
      conditions for human, animal and plant cells and life (i.e.
      plasma-multi-color light), and radiation protection,
      CO2-decomposition system, etc., are possible.<br>
      <br>
      New development are possible in weapon systems (i.e. a fragment of
      the reactor wall is opened under controlled conditions or at least
      one layer-core is opened by physical means and/or at least one
      magnetic field), partial or complete magnetic disintegration of
      matter on any atomic or molecular level (i.e. meteorites) becomes
      possible, protection fields for various object like air craft,
      ships, tanks, housing, and also radar-stealth systems (for stealth
      effect where the incoming energy from a radar can fully be
      absorbed in the tangles of one or more magnetic fields),
      EM-absorption systems,<br>
      <br>
      [0070] New magnetic blanketing can be reached in a perfect way
      (internal magnetic ordering in objects, tools and devices).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Another field of applications is in field of Housing
      concepts and products, due the use of the magnetic field
      shielding, as an object to prevent passage or block or obscure the
      view into or out of an object, like as doors or walls for entering
      into or out of an object, like the door of a house or walls of the
      house, or as replacement of or the glass or any other materials
      used for this purpose where the double glazing or any kind of
      glazing, or prevention of entry of small or certain object can be
      predetermined by the field, like to be used as of mosquito nets
      and window fly nets, or as umbrellas for preventing the sun or the
      rain from reacting any matter or object, roofing, and flooring.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Products and applications can be designed related to the
      energy release mechanism using soft or retractable wall system of
      the core that can be used for release of plasma or energy or an
      object, or material in one or more direction from the at least one
      or more cores of the system, this being used as the rivet
      machines, nail machines or guns of all sorts, shooting guns for
      defence and laser or leisure or hunting, using for destruction of
      matter ahead like dynamite, drilling machine in any scale or with
      any power, dentist drilling machine, space weapons for destruction
      of meteorite or object ahead, where the delivered mater will not
      have a physical container as of the rockets and bolts of present
      time, but packages of energy being magnetic or plasmas or matter
      of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] New type of suction machines for vacume system for
      absorption or attraction of other matters by use of magnetic field
      attraction or physical suction of the system, this being used for
      likes of household vacuum cleaners or industrial vacuum cleaners,
      or for absorption of any gas or liquid, or solid material from its
      immediate environment like in contamination clean up conditions,
      and this can be created through magnetic strength helicities
      between at least two inter-layers (57, 55) of material with
      different speed of rotation and varying atomic weight, creating
      it's own localized magnetic field black hole (56) condition where
      by the use of soft body core or magnetic tunneling material can be
      sucked into the black hole region from the core region of the
      reactor or by facilitating a port hole from matters outside into
      the black hole condition, as described in annex (section "creation
      of black hole") and in the description.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] We see also new products related to the creation of
      internal heat source leading to creation and the interaction of
      two or more magnetic fields, leading to creation of gravity,
      shielding and current production in alternating or direct or
      electrovolts levels, used in the space, aircraft, and submarine,
      colonisation crafts.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Several consumer products will be created, such as textiles
      (i.e. with memory), and vacuum suits for human or animal or any
      object in possession of internal gravity for play or industrial or
      apace application, like toys (i.e. human lifting belts) and
      sporting products, all sorts of material used for floating, belts
      for levitation , where gravity can be reversed, magnetic shield
      bowls, diving suits for submerging in to any liquid or gas in
      possession of gravity and heating elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Products, machinery and applications become possible which
      are related to using the magnetic pressurises for the production
      or shaping of all kinds of material or containers and use in the
      pressure moulding and pressure casting, or for the pressure pumped
      systems of all types of materials and matters, like the water
      pumps, injectors for computer industry printing and etching system
      and lithography, printing industry (i.e. transfer print), and
      platting and lamination industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Zero gravity machines can be used for production of
      material, where the reactor will, by in circulating the inner
      cavity, where the material is produced, like in flask or a room ,
      where the magnetic fields of one or more do not pass the inner
      physical boundary of the containment but creates the zero gravity
      condition in the inner cavity but not at the same time a vacume
      condition, this being used for like production of silicone or for
      the micro chip industries where clean but zero gravity condition
      is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Also new medical devices and applications are possible, due
      the creation of one or more soft magnetic fields for matching the
      magnetic field but at the same time in possession of gravitational
      force system, with temperature level control requirements for
      medical use, for like reseating of the magnetic or energy levels
      of human cell for eradication of cancer cell from a tissue, for
      blood cell for blood cancer, like dialysis's machine, or creation
      of condition for the growth of body part in the exact position on
      the body, of remote matter or organs replacement without cutting
      tissues or organs from outside to reach the organs or part in the
      matter, this is un-intrusive surgery, incubators for premature
      bore child, where the gravity can be reduced to allow breading in
      a softer conditions, where heat and liquid condition of the
      internal environment of mother reproduction organs can be
      replicated, Incubators for animal production, Organ transplant
      without intrusive method by transmutation of the organ in its
      position and in position reconnection of the organ through remote
      one or more gravity laser beam for the swing of the organ in its
      position.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Of course an very important application and method is
      related to the generation of electrical power, using one or more
      materials in the cavities, by the use of collection of the
      appropriate charge particles from the right electrodes specially
      positioned in the He (83) and Ar (82) layers or on the appropriate
      material layer, where the positive charges can be utilised as well
      as the negative charges for operation and used within or the
      outside the parameters of the system, that is to say the protons
      carry as much energy or most instance more than the its electron
      counter parts, where ever they are collected in one or more
      cavities of the reactor, and by which the total utilisation of all
      energies from all parts of an atom even the magnetic dark matter
      is possible, and not just the electrons as has been done up to
      now.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Atomic welding applications and technology, becomes a
      simpler way to produce or fuse matter together than fusion methods
      - where large energies are required to fuse to atoms together -
      where atomic welding brings to near similar atoms or molecules
      together and only add one electron or proton, or an neutron for
      the two atoms to become one, which is in reality the reverse
      atomic decay or half life system method, which the world of
      science has never understood, where for example potassium goes
      through beta decay to become argon, where if one add beta in the
      magnetic and gravitational condition one can create potassium from
      argon, thus applying the material creation in the universe, where
      the atoms do no start always from hydrogen to go to uranium, but
      they just simple weld into higher element to create heavier
      elements, like creating 113 element out of Iron 56 and 57 (which
      is a double magnetic element and therefore can be called
      magnetically a 'dark' matter).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Space travel without use of any fuel using the
      gravitational pull of a targeted planet, where the double magnetic
      material created in one or more cores could be fed into three
      independent, 120 degrees positions, for creation of the planetary
      gravitational pull, where one reactor will be filled and two other
      reactors on approach to or near the destination will be reversed
      back in gravitational force using a different magnetic dark matter
      for break or slow down system.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Even non-tangible magnetic locks in position of gravity are
      possible where the two magnetic fields are matching but opposite
      that they can lock into each other. These applications are claimed
      here, now, and may be developed in more detail in future patents.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Next are some specific claims related to this invention,
      and they are also described in for mentioned annex.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] A reactor-embodiment (26) can have only one rotating
      chamber. This reactor body (26) can contain at least two inserted
      gasses of different atomic weight which position themselves due
      the centrifugal effect in layers: (1) the lighter gas(ses) at the
      inside (so called <br>
      inner core 28A) and (2) the heavier gas(ses) at the outside (so
      called outer core 28B).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Another type of reactor-embodiment (27) will have at least
      two internal chambers (28C and 28D).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The reactor can have at least two internal chambers, from
      which at least one in stationary (28D).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The reactor body can have at least two internal chambers,
      from which at least one (28C) is connected with the central column
      (29) and both rotate together.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] It is possible that the reactor (10) has a central column
      (16A) which is in rotation, but is also possible to make a reactor
      where the central column is static.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is also possible to build a reactor where there is not
      central column in at least one chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A reactor can also been build where there is a different
      central column in at least two chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The central column can have several shapes and/or concepts,
      at least in one chamber, such as: fully telescopic, partly
      telescopic, with a pipit inside, without a pipit inside, partly
      dynamic (i.e. only tip part rotates). The central column will be
      designed after the intentional purpose, the materials to be used,
      the way to insert them and the conditions to meet.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The central column may have rotary-blade(s) or saddle(s),
      covered with various materials (i.e. radioactive), equipped with
      magnetic means (i.e. solid, liquid, coils, electromagnetics,
      ionization emitters (i.e. lamps, microwave, chemicals, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0093] A reactor (fig. 1 to 9) will create at least one spherical
      or other shaped non-tangible magnetic field (20, 21, 30, 40, 41,
      50, 62, 63) at least in one chamber.<br>
      <br>
      But a reactor (fig. 6, 8) is also claimed that can create at least
      two spherical or other shaped non-tangible magnetic fields
      superimposed or encircled one inside the other at least in one
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      A reactor (fig. 2) is also claimed that can create at least two
      spherical or other shaped non-tangible magnetic fields (20, 21)
      superimposed or encircled one inside the other at least in one
      chamber, for the creation of gravity and antigravity (i.e. lift,
      levitation), and/or at least a double magnetospheric (22) effect.<br>
      <br>
      A reactor (fig. 2) is also claimed that can create at least two
      spherical or other shaped non-tangible magnetic fields (20, 21)
      superimposed or encircled one inside the other at least in one
      chamber, for the creation of plasma for cold or hot fusion
      process, including the containment of such plasma, in position of
      gravity for fusion processes (i.e. power generation, production of
      new materials).<br>
      <br>
      A reactor is also claimed to generate electric current (80, 81,
      82, 83) at least in one chamber through ionization, turbulence,
      convection, rotation and plasma, and magnetic fields and
      interaction between at least two magnetic fields, and at least in
      one layer of the material in one chamber.<br>
      <br>
      A heat reactor is also claimed to generate heat in at least in one
      chamber through ionization, turbulence, convection, rotation and
      plasma, and magnetic fields and interaction between at least two
      magnetic field, and at least in one layer of the material in one
      chamber, which will deliver heat (70) to at least one material in
      at least one chamber or to the surrounding outer layer of the
      inside of the reactor, or at the outer boundary of the reactor
      (i.e. for heat-transfers, heat exchangers or heating or lighting
      (i.e. steam).<br>
      <br>
      A reactor is also claimed to generate cooling in at least in one
      chamber through ionization, turbulence, convection, rotation and
      plasma, and magnetic fields and interaction between at least two
      magnetic field, and at least in one layer of the material in one
      chamber, which create cooling effect to at least one material in
      at least one chamber or to the surrounding outer layer of the
      inside of the reactor, or at the outer boundary of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] And finally a reactor (fig. 10) which possesses - in at
      least in one chamber - all type of heat, current, magnetic field
      (gravity and plasma), i.e. space-craft technology, magnetic
      shielding.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] This invention is intended to bring substantial progress
      and freedom for mankind in various domains.<br>

      The principals of new gravitational and energy system design and
      technology (ITNOTGOG)<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Scientist have yearned to understand the intellect and
      technology behind the secret of creation and maintenance of energy
      and gravity and motion as has been achieved in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Utilising the intellectual and technology given in this
      patent document, it is possible to generate a vast amount energy
      and gravitational force as in the universal order within a core of
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In the following documents systematic principals,
      phenomenons and designs of the new system to achieve energy and
      gravity by the universal method is discussed and explained in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The technology to be explained is a totally integrated
      inclusive system for creating energy and gravity in the center of
      the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Using this technology, it will be understand how to
      construct and utilise the systems to fly in the space free of man
      made fuels and shekels of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The energy production of this system is of natural
      universal system, where the system uses geomagnetic forces and
      principals to create energy, magnetic fields and then gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The system through understanding of the astrophysics and
      the cosmology methods, make it possible to come true the concept
      of lift without use of fuel by use of creation of antigravity and
      in the space with ability to be in possession of gravity through
      direct creation of it within the center of a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The system technology will incorporate the theories of
      geomagnetic atmosphere conditions as the protection, and defend
      itself from any environmental and outside physical intervention.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The system will be a unique illustration of coming of the
      age of man to his natural wisdom and glory.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Our hope is that the intellect in this paper and the
      systems that can be achieved through its knowledge can bring and
      will become a toll for the pleasure of man and not of his
      inhalations.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The full potential of this fundamental disclosure is not be
      all apparent at the present. It will take time, in decades and
      centuries to comprehend and utilise the full potential of what is
      to be disclosed in the design of this reactor technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Here we lay the correct foundation of this new science of
      creation of universal energy and gravity, needed for life and
      travel, and are for the man to choose his correct path into the
      future. In time and through error and trial man will find the
      methods to suit his time and position in space to use these
      methods to achieve his needs<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0110] The Earth and all planets and stars possess a centrally
      heated core. The creation and maintenance of the heat and motion
      is not in the level and method which scientist have chosen for
      motion and energy technological progress up to this moment in
      time.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Planets possess and maintain heat, magnetic forces and
      gravity through one integrated system with mostly one common
      element as the source of the energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In the center of planets the temperature acquired is more
      like in thousands of degrees centigrade rather than millions of
      degrees as in stars. But all the same, all effects in creating
      heat, magnetism and gravity can be achieved at all temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] It is to be proven through the design of the reactor in
      this patent that the strength of magnetic field and gravity of
      these planets is more dependent on the composition of the material
      and the speed of motion in the center core of the planet, rather
      then the size or any other factors in the planet or the star
      internal structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In the universe vast amount of heat are not suddenly
      produced and presented in one instance for fusion to takes place
      for systems and stars to be created. There are laws and procedures
      to follow to succeed in achieving a large or a small system in the
      universe.<br>
      These laws have to be followed to the letter in the design of any
      system or reactor for creation of heat, magnetic forces fields and
      subsequent gravitational forces field and so on, for a system to
      be successful and operational.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Planets and stars using the natural laws of physic and
      materials do all these, all at once and together without separate
      machinery and control rooms and fuels. They do this as one fully
      integrated system.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Thus for the first time in the world of technology and
      intellect, in and by the design of this reactor, fundamental
      principals are set out and developed to show how all these above
      effects and many more could be very simply attained. All at the
      same time and as in a natural universal manner in one fully
      integrate system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0117] The technology behind the development of this reactor goes
      back to basic understanding of laws of physics.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The concept of creation of energy for this reactor is on
      the bases of the understanding of cooperation, interaction and
      application of the atomic structure of the plasma, gases, liquid
      and solid of all matters known in the world of science.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The principal of the behaviour of these in a vacuum and
      centrifuge environment has been studied and catalogued in detail
      over past decades.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] It is paramount to understand that gases in a vacuum
      environment for their containment behave very much like liquid and
      the two can switch state. With one element changing properties at
      the same time in the same system by slight change of temperature
      or pressure within the core of the reactor. This holds the same
      between the liquid and solid state too.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] If the behaviour of a drop of water in space and the way
      they float in vacuum condition are observed, gases behave the same
      in the vacuum too, they stay in cluster but take over the whole of
      the space of their containment.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] From past research it is understood that gases in a vacuum
      and centrifuged encapsulate each other according to their atomic
      weight, from the lighter gases in the center of the cluster and
      the heaviest on the outer layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] This means that neon will encapsulate helium and heavier
      gas will encapsulate the neon and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The second important principal for inert gas laws is that
      they do not mix with each other in a vacume and centrifuges
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] This factor will play an important part in the development
      of any energy system, which has to be portable and light. But at
      the same time flexible, energetic and functional able for it to be
      used for its merit in any system, this being for power production,
      gravity, anti gravity, shielding and medical use and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] For this system to be able to take advantage of above
      criterion it is important to have Hydrogen in atomic, molecular,
      its isotopes and ionised form are the primary element in
      production of initial heating of the reactor core, as it is done
      in the cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Hydrogen gas in atomic and molecular level has some
      versatile properties, that if they are used for the right purpose
      at the right time in the right combination, this element will
      provide and facilitates most the needs of systems energy creation
      requirement for all applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In this patent, systems are developed, that makes it
      possible for the first time, does not matter in what form hydrogen
      is made available in a core of system, primary condition can be
      created in the core of the vacuum, centrifuge chamber, that brings
      about the desired effect in any system to create the initial heat
      for the onset of chain of events, that will lead on to creation of
      heat in vast amount, electric current in predetermined large
      quantities, single magnetic field condition in molecular level in
      and around the core of the reactor, creation of double magnetic
      field in the molecular level, which the interaction of two
      magnetic fields will lead to creation and control of gravity in
      the center of a system for the first time "creation of gravity" M
      T Keshe.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] When Hydrogen is used in conjunction with other elements,
      hydrogen has the properties of being easy to be ionised by any
      source that can deliver a 13.6 eV of energy to achieve the
      ionisation of its atom. At the same time hydrogen has the
      capability to release this attained energy to a third elements in
      its neighbourhood and return to the ground state rapidly through
      this interaction with this third matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] How ionisation and release of energy are created and used
      are the principals behind the design of this reactor for the
      creation of energy, magnetic effect and gravitational forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Then as other elements are introduced into the core of the
      reactor, then the true nature of the hydrogen will revile its
      potency in this system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Where, how and how much, when and the way all elements are
      introduced or applied in this system cores will create the desire
      effect that is required of the system as the whole at that time.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] So that the system can be power generator, then with slight
      change in one of the parameters of one of the gases or
      introduction of other elements the system will become a gravity
      machine. Then maybe by combining the two effects. One will have a
      system that not only generates energy but it holds gravity and
      creates anti gravity too.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Thus for matter of simplicity in this disclosure the
      simplest form of the energy and gravity system will be discussed
      and disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The object of designing this
        system</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0135] The object of this disclosure is to design and develop a
      system, with the following capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Development of the system for the creation of heat and
      energy, magnetism and gravity is one of the prim objectives of
      this design.<br>
      <br>
      A) To create motion using matters and forces by utilising
      positioning factors. As it has been achieved in the universe,
      rather then burning elements, or using fission chain of reaction
      or converting energies.<br>
      <br>
      B) To use magnetic and gravity forces for lift and motion, instead
      of trying to overcome surface and atmospheric frictions by
      physical movement of the air replacement method.<br>
      <br>
      C) To create gravitational force within the system that overcomes
      the space weightlessness.<br>
      <br>
      D) Development of a comprehensive and extensive method of
      atmospheric conditions protection for a system.<br>
      <br>
      E) Development of a full system of offensive and defensive
      capability by using natural energy forces. Instead of physical
      firing of an object.<br>
      <br>
      F) To develop a material and containment mixture method for space
      travel for motion. To attain speeds far beyond the present
      achievements.<br>
      <br>
      G) To develop a refuelling method for the system in the space,
      which is position dependent and can be done in mid- space
      utilising the cosmoses matters.<br>
      <br>
      H) Development of a soft fusion system, for the creation of heat
      and energy, magnetism, gravity and materials.<br>

      The new principals and concepts behind the intellects and
      technologies of the proposed system.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The following disclosures in this section of the patent
      application has been specifically introduced in these papers to
      explain and clarifies new understandings and concepts in the world
      of atomic, nuclear, Geophysics, Astrophysics and Cosmo physics.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] These disclosures are important to be understood and
      comprehend before attempt are made to proceed with the whole of
      the concepts and principals behind the design and the developments
      of this new technology and patent disclosures to be followed.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] These are parts of disclosures from the papers written by M
      T Keshe under different titles.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The seed of the Earth 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0140] The theory that the heat of the core of the Earth is due to
      inertia of the material pilled on top of each other has and is
      completely dismissed through this new disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] World of science has managed to see the atom, further
      investigation reviled the existence of nuclease, the neutron, the
      proton, the electron and so much more different parts in that
      centre.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The world of science through new technological advancements
      has now started to do the same too, with the real construction of
      the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] It has been reported through twenty years of seismological
      data's gathered from all the earthquakes around the world, that
      there are more parts to the inner core of the Earth then just the
      inner core and the outer core known to scientists assumed up to
      now.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Through seismological data's it has been proven that the
      inner core of the earth has six hundred kilometre inner core
      (Professor Guy Master in 2002 nuclear planet).<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Further more, it has been assumed from the same data's,
      that the centre of this core has a further an inner core of eight
      kilometres. This core is considered to be made of uranium,
      plutonium and other heavy radioactive materials, which sank to the
      center of the center of the earth as it cooled over millions of
      years.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Scientists presume that this core is made of nuclear
      materials, that in the process of nuclear decays of their
      materials, create fission chain of events, which leads to
      generation of heat, which manifest's itself as heat of the inner
      core creating convection in the outer core leading to generation
      of current in this core, in turn this causing the creation of the
      magnetic field of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The author M T Keshe postulates that this centre core is
      made of hydrogen, other gases and mixture of liquid and solid
      matters which where in the vicinity of the center of the core of
      the earth at the time of its inception in the solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] These gases and materials were entrapped and embedded in
      the centre of the planet at time of the birth of the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] Through this new understanding of the new inner cores of
      the planet, this brings to play the fact that the old inner core
      of the earth that is already assumed to be made of a solid piece,
      itself becomes a sealed container for the new inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The author assumes that this new core of the earth is
      totally isolated from the rest of the matters of the planet by the
      old inner core. Which in fact the old inner core is like a
      pressure cooker for the newly discovered core, right in the center
      of the planet for confinement of the newly discovered material
      within it.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] This new chamber in reality has a mixture of plasma, gases
      and molten matters, under soft irradiation conditions which was
      present in the region of its birth at the time of its inception
      due to presence of small radioactive matters which were mixed in
      this mixture, which this has lead to a semi-fusion chain of
      events, rather than fission chain of events as it has been thought
      up to now due to presence of radioactive materials like uranium.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] In reality the small amount of radioactive material in this
      mixture has initiated the ionisation chain of the events of the
      hydrogen atoms and possibly helium atoms in this newly discover
      core. This ionisation is achieved through creation of extreme
      ultraviolet through scintillation of ideal gases like helium
      present in the vicinity, leading to a ionisation of hydrogen atoms
      chain of events, creating the heat in the center of the core of
      the earth which manifest itself, through motion of the outer core
      in the form convection of materials in outer layer of the core of
      the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The author through design of a parallel system has set to
      confirm the corrects of this assumption, that the center of the
      earth possess a semi- fusion atomic reactor and not a fission
      reactor as has been assumed by other scientist.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] This 8 km mixture in the center of the planet, under the
      encapsulation of the inner core, at the same time has been under
      the influence of the spherical magnetic field created by the
      interaction between the inner core and the outer core, which this
      creates the environment of a semi-fusion nuclear reactor plasma
      magnetic confinement for the new found inner core MT Keshe "The
      creation of gravity"<br>
      <br>
      [0155] The fundamental fuel in this new encapsulated cavity is
      hydrogen, its nuclei's and molecules of other components.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] The writer concludes that, the centre of the earth possess
      a semi-hydrogen fusion atomic/nuclear reactor, which can not lose
      its elements, as they are entrapped by the inner core solid
      material under the pressures of the matters from above it.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] This theory of hydrogen in the center of the planet is
      inline with physical reality of the creation and present situation
      in the physical construction of the solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Where by laws of physics all the gases in solar system
      should have been in the giant gas planets at the outer layers of
      the solar system like in Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] The physical reality in the solar system, is that the
      lights of all these gases, the Hydrogen, has taken its place right
      in the center of the solar system in the its star the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] This is against all the theoretical laws of physics, where
      the majority of the hydrogen gas should have been on the outer
      boundary of the solar system in the giant gas planets.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] The existence and reality that the center of the earth
      possesses a hydrogen reactor mixed core with some metallic
      elements is correct and inline with the physical effects of the
      magnetic field and rotational effect of any solar system or
      galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] The reason why hydrogen takes this position in the center
      of the earth and this theory is inline with physical truth, and
      has the same pattern as in the solar system is very simple. The
      most fundamental reason why the hydrogen takes its position in the
      center of all the planets surrounded with metallic or heavier
      gases or elements, come from the natural characteristic of
      hydrogen, where the electronegative and the magnetic potential
      properties of the hydrogen and the strength of the spin in
      hydrogen atoms due to their respecting surrounding materials
      position this element to be in the center of any planet or star.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Secondly, the center of the earth is surrounded with heavy
      metallic center, that is the inner core of the earth, in parallel
      as in the solar system, where the hydrogen gas of the sun is
      surrounded with metallic planets like the Mars.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The center of planets, does not matter what their inner
      layers are made of, need a metallic matter for the electromagnetic
      effect due to motion electrons and ionised hydrogen's in their
      core, for them to generate current, for it to maintain magnetic
      field force leading to the creation of double magnetic field and
      finally gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] This semi-fusion state of affairs in the inner sanctum of
      the earth is the reason for continues creation of heat from the
      centre of the earth radiating outward.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] This hydrogen mixture is the seed of the earth. This is why
      the magnetic field in the centre of the Earth is and will not
      disappear for a long time.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Compared to mass of the planet, and contrary to logical
      understanding of the mass and forces needed to keep the planet in
      motion, it will be proven through the design of the ultimate
      reactor by the author, and through the theoretical papers in the
      scientific world, that the volume ratio of hydrogen in the core of
      earth is very small, and the density of the hydrogen gas in this
      new core is very low.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] Otherwise the system with large volume of gas ratio and
      high density would have disintegrated or the whole system would
      have shout down due to saturated ionisation condition of the new
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] This could be one of the reasons why Mercury has lost its
      gravitational field force, where too much ionised hydrogen are
      trapped in its inner core, that did not and would not allow the
      ionisation chain to take place in the center of the core, even
      though the core could posses large amount of hydrogen, that the
      core could be heated for magnetism to take over for the core to
      attain its gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] The author will prove through tests that there is a direct
      relation between the gas volume ratio and the density of the
      hydrogen in any system in possession of heat, magnetism, and
      gravity in its center.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] This is how all the planets attain their inner heat energy
      in comparison with small amount of hydrogen in their core and
      become in possession of magnetosphere and gravity. Which in
      reaction with their solar wind and other factors allows them to
      rotate and move within their system. This in the larger scale
      happens to solar systems in the galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] It has to be recognised that the centre of all planets in
      possession of gravity due to centre cores heating, always, these
      planets are in possession of two Magnetic Field Forces in their
      inner sanctum M T Keshe " The creation of gravity".<br>
      <br>
      [0173] In case of the Earth up to now and with the present
      knowledge there has been acceptance of only one inner core and one
      magnetic force.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] As it is explained in the paper titled "the creation of
      gravity" M T Keshe, there is an inner core in the inner core.
      Which this inner core due to it physical content, motion and
      position in the center of the earth, creates its own and maintain
      its own magnetic field force, independent of the magnetic force
      which has been known created by the interaction inner core and the
      outer core of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] These two magnetic fields interact to create planet's own
      double magnetic fields in its centre.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] Which the interaction of these two magnetic fields forces
      up on each other will leads to the new concept of "DOUBLE MAGNETIC
      FIELD EFFECT", which the interaction between these two field
      forces in the center of the planet leads to creation of the
      gravity and the magnetic forces of the planet M T Keshe, " The
      creation of gravity".<br>
      <br>
      [0177] Where this new second core is the seed core of the planet,
      the mother seed of the planet positioned in this new inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] This core is always made of the mixture of hydrogen,
      hydrogen nuclei's and in one form or other some metallic
      components in the Milky Way galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] The presence of hydrogen can be replaced by other matters
      and not necessary in all galaxies, where this matter could be
      different, like helium or heavier gases which can go through the
      same process initial heat generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] These metallic components are different for each planet.
      These combinations of materials determine the strength and the
      gravitational power of each planet in its final position in its
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] The content of this seed determines the gravitational and
      magnetic field force of the planet. Where this is unique for each
      planet, star and solar system, this is the magnetic fingerprint of
      the planet unique and unmistakable like for each planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] This strength and mixture are unique for each planet. Which
      can be used and copied in a reactor for space mapping and space
      travel in the future (this is explained in more detail in papers
      to be released under the titled of travel and space fuel by the
      author). These being determined by the factors like position,
      material available, temperatures and pursuers for the planets at
      the point of its inception in its vicinity at the time of its
      creation.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The real seed of the Earth which heralded its creation has
      to have new name, that it can be distinguished from the seconded
      core which comes about much later in the life of the planet, as in
      the case of the earth, the inner core and outer cores existence
      has been known for sometimes.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] This seed, under the right conditions in the planet, a
      solar system or a reactor, will leads to creation of the new
      system in possession of and capable to create heat, current,
      magnetism and gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] For clarity this newly core as of now will be known as
      caroline.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Now that the assumption for the new core is made, it is
      important to prove its function and method of heating which this
      new system uses for creating heat and magnetism leading to
      creation of the gravity in the planet in a simple reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] For the principal of heating of the caroline core, one has
      to look at the real condition of the cosmos at the point of
      creation of stars, the method which is used for the generation of
      the heat and material and conditions and sequence of events which
      leads to manifestation of a solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] From the technical literatures available in the world of
      science some close indication in how the entrapment of hydrogen
      leads to the first stage heating of the mother seed of a planet
      can be extracted. The rest, like creation of current, magnetism
      and consequent creation of double magnetic field leading to
      establishment of gravity are the natural sequence events and
      follow up of the original event.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Therefore the pattern for creation of the heat in the
      center core of the planet has to be established, according to the
      real time condition and positioning of all the elements and events
      which always ends up to the creation of an atom, planet, a system
      or a galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] These principals are the same for all cases, the only
      difference is how much energy can be collected in the right
      condition to lead to creation of condition that energy can be
      collected that can manifest itself as one of above matters of atom
      to a galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] The only difference is the amount of energy they can master
      to hold on to by the matter, at time of its inception is what that
      can lead to their size, position, strength of their magnetic
      fields and gravitational force in their environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] With the difference that, an atom attracts cold condition
      energy magnetism of a weak scale and weak gravitational field, and
      a solar system attracts a hot condition energy magnetism and
      stronger gravitational force.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] A cold magnetism condition always leads to atomic structure
      and a hot magnetism condition leads to a solar system structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Where the hot magnetism condition can always influence and
      gather matters of cold magnetism in its vicinity due to its
      heating condition and stronger gravitational field force to
      manifest itself as large viable and visible system.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] The principal of working of the caroline core has to be
      based as in the universe on the existence of the following five
      key elements and conditions for pattern of heating to exist that
      can assert its influence on its surrounding to lead to creation of
      a planet or star in possession of magnetism and gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] If any of these five factors ever be missing or changes
      from the set, the creation of a system or operation of the heating
      of the planet will change, with it changing the characteristic of
      the system, then the planet or the system will lose its components
      like its moons or system, and will change it pre-determined
      position or strength.<br>
      <br>
      The first and the prime material for the first stage of the
      heating in the system, is the availability of the Hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] There is not a need for a large amount of this matter to
      initiate the first stage of heating of surrounding environment
      through ionisation of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] The second prime condition is the presence of a radiation
      energy source, which can ionise the atoms of the hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] That the energy released by the ionisation of the atom into
      its surrounding matters can lead to heating of its environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] Cosmologists have always noted the presence of the
      ultraviolet radiation or x-rays in the vicinity of the hydrogen
      densities in the galaxies (100-1000 Hydrogen atoms), which has
      been thought emanating from the atoms of hydrogen through
      ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] The reality is that, to ionise hydrogen atom, energy line
      in ultraviolet light is not strong enough to achieve direct
      ionisation of hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] At the same time due to presence of radioactive material in
      the cosmoses medium, the helium and/or other inert gases present
      in the soup mixture of the cosmos plasma, through alpha or beta
      irradiation, become catalyse to cause the ionisation of the
      hydrogen atoms, by releasing an extreme ultraviolet radiation
      strong enough to ionise the hydrogen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] In scientific term the inert gases become scintillated, and
      through scintillation, they release energy in the extreme
      ultraviolet region or soft X-ray that can cause the ionisation of
      hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] Consequently the theory of ultraviolet radiation through
      ionised hydrogen is in reality the appearance of the second phase
      of an already irradiated atom of inert gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] Understanding of this important phenomenon that extreme
      ultraviolet play in the creation of initial stage of heating of
      plasma is what has not been understood and utilised in the world
      of nuclear physics of the preset day.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] Therefore, now, it has become possible to ionise atomic
      hydrogen with a simple presence of extreme ultraviolet radiation
      source using inert gases as catalyst, that can go through the
      process of scintillation, that can deliver the correct amount of
      energy in the extreme ultraviolet levels to hydrogen atoms, that
      can ionise hydrogen atom. Which this can lead to further heating
      of the matter in the vicinity of the ionised hydrogen atom, as the
      ionised hydrogen has to go through de- energization, for it to
      return to its ground energy state, by relinquishing its energy
      absorbed energy through scintillation process, for it to appear as
      heat using third matter in its neighbourhood, that can accept the
      energy from hydrogen ion, without absorbing the ionised hydrogen
      in itself and releasing this acquired energy as heat it is
      surrounding.<br>
      <br>
      [0207] The third prime factor in any chain of ionisation is
      existence of a weak magnetic field in the vicinity of the hydrogen
      atom. The existence of the weak magnetic field has several
      advantages which helps with ionisation of the atom of hydrogen,
      and then it helps with the generation of current in the plasma
      which is created through ionisation in heating the plasma, and
      this leading to further strengthen the already existing magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] One of the advantages of the presence of the weak magnetic
      field in the vicinity of the hydrogen atom which is to be ionised
      by the extreme ultraviolet light, due to the already existence of
      the magnetic filed of the atom, which holds the protons and
      electron of the hydrogen atom together, the presence of a stronger
      magnetic field in the already low density environment of hydrogen
      atom in the vacume condition, this facilitates for the inter
      atomic bound between the proton and electron of the atom to be
      much more in a diluted energy soup state, than for if the atoms
      components where in the normal atmospheric condition, that they
      were closely pact magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] This loser energy bind of the atomic hydrogen facilitated
      by the presence of the weak magnetic field allows the energy from
      the extreme ultraviolet to be able to ionise the atom of the
      hydrogen much easier, at the same time allowing the electron and
      the proton to carry maximum energy that they absorb, to the third
      element in the vicinity, to release the maximum energy to it. That
      this makes the process of heating much more rapid and easier, then
      trying to use other method to ionise hydrogen to create heating
      condition of their surrounding.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The second advantage with presence of weak magnetic field
      in the vicinity of the hydrogen atoms is that, after the
      ionisation of the hydrogen atom, and due to charge carrying and
      free motion characteristic of the proton and free electron, these
      within magnetic environment, does not matter how weak this field
      might be, will lead to generation of current in this area, through
      the principal of motion of charge particle within a magnetic field
      (this is like the rotation of rotor between the poles of a magnet
      in the electric power generators machines of today).<br>
      <br>
      [0211] This current in turn leads itself to making and
      strengthening the magnetic field forces, and further heating of
      the surrounding the hydrogen environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0212] Therefore once the first ionisation through scintillation
      is established in the vicinity of a weak magnetic field in the
      vacuum environment, then the creation of current which leads to
      creation of more magnetism due to motion of current through
      magnetic field, and so one leads to creation of the other and
      increase in its own strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0213] The forth prime factor is the existence of the turbulence
      within the region of the operation of the magnetic region.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] In the cosmos convection leading to generation of current
      can only take place in the turbulent environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] Secondly, the turbulence creates the compression variation
      within the cosmos plasma, for it to create different conditions
      for the material within the cosmos soup.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] The turbulences in the galaxies are created by different
      methods, but majority of the turbulences are considered to be very
      localised areas in the active regions, created ionisation of the
      hydrogen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] The fifth prime factor is the presence of motion in the
      vicinity of the ionisation region.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] The motion of the ionised gas within the region of its
      interaction plays an important factor in the whole process of
      creation and maintenance of ionisation and distribution of heat,
      and effectiveness of uniform compression within the region of
      creation of a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] If the mixture of the ionised hydrogen can not move, to be
      able to deliver its energy to the third elements to release it
      extra energy for it to be able to return to its ground state, due
      to lack of being able to interact with further new atoms of the
      third element, or even for the scintillation to take place on the
      continues bases in the region, then due to the lack of motion to
      sustain movement in the mixture, the condition of saturation or
      stagnation in the region will be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] Therefore for a system to be active, it has to be in
      possession of all above five principles and criterion. This can be
      simply shown in the form of the active schematic system designed
      by the author known as the five parameters necessary for any
      system to exist in the universe. This is to be called the diagram
      of the universe circle for generation of system (fig A).<br>
      <br>
      [0221] No atom, planets, system or galaxy can exist and operate,
      without it possessing posses gravitational field forces, that can
      hold on to its elements, without existence of all these five
      points.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] If one of theses parameters is lacking or is not up to
      power at any point of the creation or existence of any system,
      then the system will not start, or if any one of these parameters
      is changed during the process due to what ever reason, then
      different outcome from the system is attained.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] Therefore for the seed of the earth which is condensed and
      isolated in the caroline inner core, for it to be active and be
      able to sustain its existence and position in its system, the
      caroline core must be possessing and obeying the sequence of
      events of universal circle of a system at all time.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] Through understanding this concept, it will be proven that
      not a vast amount of the hydrogen atoms are required to sustain a
      full chain of events for along period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0225] It is now comprehendible why the author believes that the
      center of the core of the earth in the caroline core is made up of
      hydrogen atoms and in a semi-fusion reaction chain of event.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] The density and the volume ratio of the hydrogen in this
      core has to be very low, as high temperatures and compression
      created in the core of the planet at 7000 degree centigrade, will
      be so high, that by laws of physic only a low density hydrogen
      level in the core can sustain such long term chain of events.<br>
      <br>
      [0227] This low-density method of heat and magnetic field
      generation is inline with observations in the cosmos by scientist
      in this field. Where only 100 000 atoms per centimetre square of
      hydrogen atoms has been observed for the process to start the
      creation of a solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [0228] Where as scientists have been assuming that the outer core
      could possess liquid matters, like molten metal that created the
      current in the outer core through convection, infect, vapour
      metallic gases like sodium or potassium 1, could be the real
      alternative for this outer core of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0229] Where the metallic vapour nature of these materials will
      allow atomic loosee structure for electrons to be free at much
      lower temperatures which are created in the caroline core of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0230] Thus the outer core is not necessarily made of metallic
      iron alloys which has been assumed up to know.<br>
      <br>
      [0231] There is parallel for this in the Cosmo physical
      observations, where usually in the vicinity of atomic hydrogen in
      the cosmic clouds sodium and potassium in atomic and molecular
      structure of these clouds are observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0232] Even in the case of Saturn the non metallic helium is
      considered to behave like metallic material under such extreme
      pressures, therefore this concept tallies with all the present
      observations and assumptions.<br>
      <br>
      [0233] Therefore any martial under the right condition of pressure
      or heat or magnetism within any cores of the reactor can behave as
      metallic elements, that can allow the release or freedom of
      position to its outer electron to become loosee or behave as they
      are loosee in their environment, that they can act and assists as
      the material that can initiate the first stage or even on
      continues bases as the generator of current in the cores of the
      planets, and due to their physical motion within the core be the
      initiators and cause of continues magnetic fields in there
      respective cores of the planets.<br>
      <br>
      [0234] Then it is logical to assume that some of these elements or
      most of them are the same as hydrogen and get trapped or embedded
      in the outer and even in the caroline core, leading to or helping
      with the creation of current in much simpler way as what has been
      assumed by the astrophysicists, leading to creation of magnetic
      fields in either cores of the planets.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The creation of gravity 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0235] The universe is built and held together and operates on the
      basis of two forces. One cannot work without the other and when
      one force dominates the effects is drastic. These two principal
      forces are one, the gravity field force, which manifests itself as
      the gravitational field force of the planet, second, the magnetic
      filed force, which manifest itself as the magnetic shielding or
      the magnetosphere of the planet with interacting with other
      magnetic field forces in its vicinity.<br>
      <br>
      [0236] Contrary to scientific belief and for the first time to be
      explained in these papers, that source of creation and sustainers
      of the gravitational field force and the magnetic field force of
      the planets are one and the same materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0237] That is to confirm that the sources of the magnetic field
      force and the gravitational field force are one and the same
      elements and materials in the center of planets.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] The creator and sustainer principal materials for the
      gravitational field force are the same as magnetic field force.<br>
      <br>
      [0239] For the creation of the geomagnetic and gravity several
      basic and fundamental assumption were made by the writer.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] For a planet to create heat to lead to creation of current
      through convection leading to creation of magnetic field in the
      center of the planet, conditions have to created for the
      environment that allows the existence of a confined collection of
      slow energy releasing material in the centre of a planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] Working on real bases for heat production at the center of
      the planet, the author set out to design and produce a real and
      practical reactor which could replicate the universal order for
      creating heat and magnetism and finally the gravity to prove the
      correctness of the principal of creation of above phenomenons.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] The writer assumed that the centre of the earth in its
      inner part has and maintains a semi-nuclear fusion reaction chain
      of events.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] The interaction between materials and processes that this
      semi-fusion chain of event in the caroline core of the planet lead
      to creation and maintenance of its apparent physical forces of
      Magnetic Field (MF) and Gravitational Field (GF).<br>
      <br>
      [0244] This semi-fusion sequences of events and existence of
      lighter gases and other materials in the containment vessel of the
      inner core construction and material and the convection process
      due to the heat transferred from the caroline core to the outer
      core of the planet, in which due to motion of the materials inside
      the caroline inner core, which is in possession of a charged
      partials rotating, turbulent, in a vacume, creating current and
      magnetic field, and the motion of the materials in the outside of
      the inner core, which creates its own magnetic field through
      convection in the outer core material.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] Where the two independent magnetic fields, which are
      separated by means of the physical barrier made by the existence
      of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] Which the interaction of these two magnetic field are close
      enough to interact on each other, that leads to the creation of
      the central gravitation field force 1 of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] Therefore for the first time in the world of intellect, it
      is to be made clear that the source of the Gravitation of the
      earth and all planets in possession of internal heat source is due
      to the interaction of two magnetic fields 1 which are created
      independently in the center of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] The caroline inner core of the Earth creates its own
      magnetic field, which this second field locks loosely onto the
      already known magnetic field of the inner and outer core to create
      the pulling power known as the Gravity of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      Gravity does not and can not exist with existence of one magnetic
      field force.<br>
      <br>
      The gravity manifest itself up on the creation of the seconded
      magnetic field generated by the convection of the matter in the
      outer core, interacting with magnetic field which was originally
      created in the caroline section of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore the gravity is an outcome of the interaction at
      molecular level between two magnetic fields of two cores of the
      planet up on each other 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] Ultimately for creation and maintenance of gravitational
      field force for all stars and planets or any system, with an
      internal heat, there is a need for establishment of two
      molecularly loosely interlocking magnetic fields, which are
      separate by any physical separation and are created, and
      maintained, separately and independent from each other. Even
      though one could be the cause of the creation of the second one.<br>
      <br>
      [0250] Where the separation of the magnetic fields could be
      established by the means of solid, liquid and gases, plasma and
      energy layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0251] Once the strength of the inner core (caroline), or the
      outer core, magnetic field in a system by controlling any of the
      five principal of creation 1 of the heat in the caroline core can
      be attained, consequently the strength of the gravitational field
      forces of the system can be dictated.<br>
      <br>
      Through this system the strength of the magnetic fields can be
      adjusted, so that this will allow the creation and control of the
      gravity and anti-gravity 1 in respect to the environment in which
      the system is operating in.<br>
      <br>
      [0252] Looking at overall view of the centre of the earth, with
      the new understanding of it composition, one will have two
      spherical magnetic fields, one being superimposed on top of the
      other. One being the magnetic core maintained by the core due to
      turbulent, compressive, rotation of hydrogen gas in presences of
      two magnetic fields in the center of the earth in the caroline
      core, and the other is the magnetic field created through
      convection through its materials in motion in the old outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0253] Therefore in reality the physical positioning of the hollow
      solid sphere of the inner core is the catalysts for the
      contribution to and creation of both magnetic fields independent
      of each other but at the same time interconnecting or magnetically
      reconnecting tool for both magnetic fields on either side of the
      inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0254] Where the interaction between these two magnetic fields in
      the physical body of the inner core leads to creation of the
      double magnetic fields phenomenon needed for creation and control
      of the strength of the gravitational field force and magnetic
      field force of the planet needed for the maintenance of the
      magnetic field necessary for the magnetosphere creation essential
      for the creation of atmospheric condition around the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0255] The magnetic field reconnection of the two fields is
      totally on atomic and molecular levels. This leading to a loosee
      magnetic field forces that operate at weak levels, but strong
      enough to cover a vast area in their surrounding.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] That is why a small caroline core of eight kilometres in
      the center of the earth can create a strong magnetic effect of up
      to 60 000 kilometres to boundary of the magnetosphere of the
      earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0257] As the magnetic fields could be created by use of any
      elements in both cores of the planets, that can create any amount
      of heat, this being like center of a star like the sun, several
      thousands of times larger mass than the earth, with the surface
      gravitational force of about twenty eight times more than the
      earth, which operates at central temperatures of several millions
      of degrees centigrade, or the center of the earth with surface
      gravitational force of one g which operates at several thousands
      of degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0258] Therefore the following statement can be made that "the
      strength of gravitational force of any system is largely
      independent of temperature 1, and is primarily dependent on, the
      composition of its inner cores materials, and the physical
      condition which it was created, or maintained, which creates the
      two magnetic field strength leading to creation of the
      gravitational field of the system within its inner sanctum", is
      correct as was assumed by author originally,<br>
      <br>
      [0259] In relation to the physical data's available, the present
      gravitational field system which has been assumed to be created by
      the single magnetic system between the inner and the outer core in
      the center of the planet is not scientifically acceptable and can
      not stand the physical truth.<br>
      <br>
      [0260] The concept of single magnetic field which has up to now
      been assumed does not stand the laws of physics, as for the planet
      to be able to create gravity and magnetism for magnetosphere, that
      can span a vast area of the solar system irrespective of its
      position and the material it carries in it outer shells, has to
      have two active magnetic field forces in the center core.<br>
      <br>
      [0261] The planet has to be able to have two interacting magnetic
      parts, that the interaction between these two magnetic fields can
      create the fields that the elements around the interaction of
      these two fields can effect their behaviour, for them to be
      attracted by the effective magnetic field area.<br>
      <br>
      [0262] The reality is that if earth has had only one magnetic
      filed as has been assumed until now, all elements on the planet
      would have been firmly attached to it rather then loosely being
      moving within its magnetic field force.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] Without the shadow of a doubt the center of the planet
      maintains two independent magnetic fields, that the interaction
      between these two magnetic fields at the molecular level leads to
      creation of the magnetism and gravity of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0264] The magnetic field force created on these levels in the
      inner cores physical body of the planet, creates the condition
      where all magnetic forces within this field will be influenced
      through magnetic reconnection, this being in molecular level,
      creating pulling forces inwards for the two fields of the matter
      and the planet to be locked into each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0265] This creates the effect of the gravitation field force, as
      the matter magnetic force and the planet magnetic field created by
      the double magnetic field reconnect to keep each other at a
      physical interactive but loose distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0266] In reality gravity is the strength of the magnetic field
      created by the interaction of the two magnetic force fields of the
      planet that can influence to pull the matters around the field to
      stay within its strength, or what is called gravitational filed
      force.<br>
      <br>
      [0267] The inter locking of these forces are the same as with two
      bars of magnets when they are brought close to each other but
      their binding of forces in planetary levels are at loose molecular
      interlocking.<br>
      <br>
      [0268] With the difference that in the planetary or astro levels
      these magnets are in the form of closed lope spherical shape and
      in possession of internal heating system, where the magnetic field
      force can vary, and they can change their strength due to the
      compression and other factors in the center cores, as in solid
      magnet the strength of the magnet is constant and permanent.<br>
      <br>
      [0269] In the closed loop spherical magnets, the system of the
      magnetic field lines have to find their magnetic reconnection line
      for the loop to be completed.<br>
      <br>
      [0270] This magnetic fields reconnection leads to the directional
      polarity as magnetism in the one direction and gravitational on
      the other direction, leading to creation of the north and South
      Pole phenomenon of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0271] Magnetic fields produced under thermal conditions has a
      minimum threshold common (MTC). This is due to the fact that the
      magnetic field produced due to the heat interaction or convection
      has the minimum common attraction power. This means that all
      elements have a common lowest level magnetic field force
      attraction due to their inner magnetic atomic structure equal to
      the magnetic field force of the atom of hydrogen. That is why
      gravity effects all matters of hydrogen nuclei and its components,
      and up ward in atomic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0272] The gravitational force in stars and planets is created
      only under the condition, and purely due to magnetic forces
      created by help of heat generated in the center of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0273] In the case of motion of an object in possession of its own
      gravitational power production, in the gravitational pull of a
      planet, the use of the creation of the gravity in the centre of an
      object can be treated in the same manner. Where the gravity
      created in the centre of an object needs to be slightly changed in
      the positive or negative for the object to repel or be attracted
      to towards the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0274] The magnetic and gravitational forces of the Star are
      dictated to an extent by the planets as much as the constituent
      materials of the Star itself. On these bases the gravitational
      forces of the system is created and controlled by it planets.<br>
      <br>
      [0275] This is very much like the rotational magnetic fields of
      the electrons circulating around the nucleus of an atom. Where,
      the magnetic rotational spine of the electron decides the magnetic
      field strength of the nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      [0276] Even though the magnetic field of the nucleus is much
      powerful then the magnetic field of the electrons around it, or in
      other word the gravitational forces of the nucleus is needed for
      the electrons to be kept in their orbit and vice versa. This holds
      true, where if this was not correct the planet would have been
      attracted into the star or the star should have been attracted
      into the planets due to its gravitational forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0277] But in systems there are always several planets, where the
      collective movement of the planets of the system will keep the
      gravitational forces of the star of the system at bay, rather then
      an individual planet gravitational force.<br>
      <br>
      [0278] Thus the gravitational forces of a system or a galaxy is
      not only dependent on the magnetic forces of its centre or its
      star, but it is fully controlled and determined by a bigger scale
      dimensions of its planets in that system.<br>
      <br>
      [0279] Magnetic fields and gravitational field forces of planets
      are without the doubt created by interaction of two fields. Where
      the magnetism is like the repulsion forces between to similar
      poles of two magnets and the gravity is like the pulling power of
      the forces of the two dissimilar poles between two magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0280] From the topography of the earth gravity pattern provided
      by NASA, earth magnetic field does not keep a constant pattern.
      There are constant changes in strength of this field, dictated by
      the activities within the center cores of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0281] Changes in these forces could be due to the variation of
      the interaction of the inner and the outer magnetic fields of the
      centre of the earth. For example, where they cancel each other,
      one gets distortion of the field and reduction in the
      gravitational field force in that region of the planet by small
      factor. Then where one force field like the field created in the
      caroline core is more powerful due sudden short burst of
      scintillation in the core, at that point and that moment, the
      magnetic fields interaction of the centre field is more powerful
      the gravitational force will be more powerful, but these changes
      due to close confinement of the center cores not usually so large.<br>
      <br>
      [0282] Even thou Newton did note this effect of interaction of two
      magnetic forces and he called it gravity, they could never
      establish the source of its creation and method of its existence.<br>
      <br>
      [0283] He measured its strength but they never came to understand
      method of its creation. He speaks about the effects of the gravity
      in relationship between two objects and not two magnetic forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0284] This is where Newton could not make connection between the
      interaction of matter and force, when it comes to gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0285] Scientists explain the gravity as the relationship of
      attraction between position of two bodies in respect to each
      other, and not the reality that gravity is manifest itself in
      relation of interaction and attraction of two bodies in possession
      of magnetic field forces created by heat in respect to each other
      position 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0286] Through design of this reactor again this principal will be
      proven to be correct, and the difference between inertia and
      gravity is to be proven. Where gravity is an attribute of a body
      with two magnetic field forces, and inertia is the attribute of
      collective molecular magnetic force of an object, even though both
      behave the same and due to their magnetic fields appear to be the
      same thing.<br>
      <br>
      [0287] Where in reality the creation and maintenance of gravity is
      dependent on the positioning of two bodies in possession of heated
      center core, in possession of two magnetic field forces and
      totally independent of the mass of the object, but dependent on
      the position of their magnetic forces from the center core of the
      planet in respect to their magnetic field strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0288] Which this is totally different then inertia, where the
      gravitational pull is due to atomic magnetic field maintained by
      any object due to their atomic magnetic binding, without heating
      source in its center of object.<br>
      <br>
      [0289] The clear difference between inertia and gravity is the
      element of heating and creation of double magnetic field force in
      an object in possession of gravity, and the inertia which is
      attraction force of an object due to its atomic magnetic field
      force without internal heating source.<br>
      <br>
      [0290] For the first time, by knowing now how the gravity in real
      conditions in a system can be replicated, and by being able to
      create gravity as done in the cosmos and being able to control and
      observe its effect, this natural phenomenon can be realised within
      a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0291] In this reactor idea of gravity as Newton tried to explain
      exists, but these are at levels of attraction between two magnetic
      field forces in an object in possession of internal heat source,
      and two super imposed spherical magnetic fields, which is
      different from the attraction forces between two objects with a
      single magnetic field or due to inertia of solid bodies without
      internal heat source.<br>
      <br>
      [0292] This is the difference between gravity and inertia between
      two objects. Where due heat the binding of the forces of the
      molecules are more on a loser binding conditions where they have a
      more prominent and overall spherical magnetic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0293] This is very important fundamental principal, which if this
      understanding is applied in a system, then the fundamental of
      creation and control of gravity will become apparent.<br>
      <br>
      [0294] The interaction of the these two newly discovered magnetic
      fields in the center of the planet is the cause of the rotational
      motion of the inner core of the earth, which leads to creation of
      magnetic field of the inner core solid body.<br>
      <br>
      [0295] Where this motion of the inner core becomes itself the
      containment body of the centrifuge for the gases in the caroline
      core for the atomic fusion chain of events in this chamber, for it
      to sustain the initial ionisation process in the this chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0296] R H Dicke (1964 nature 202; 432 ) in his report confirms
      that rapid interior rotation of matter inside the sun could
      distort the external gravitational fields which can consequently
      effect theories of gravitational effect which are observed by
      planetary motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0297] At the time he did not understood the relationship between
      the speed of the rotation of the caroline core, which can effect
      the strength of the magnetic field created in the central cores of
      the planets, where the interaction of magnetic field of the
      caroline core with magnetic field of the outer core would have
      changed the combined magnetic field effect of the whole planet,
      which in reality would have changed the gravitational field
      strength of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0298] Even though he noted the changes, but he never could relate
      the concoction between magnetism and the gravity as to be the same
      thing but manifesting itself in two different ways.<br>
      <br>
      [0299] In a way his theory confirms that rotation in the gas
      layers of the caroline core in conjunction with turbulence, which
      leads to convection in the materials in the cores of the reactor
      effects the generation of current and magnetic field in the core
      of the reactor and consequently the gravitational forces created
      by the core of the system.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism and gravity 1--&gt;</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0300] The world of science has chosen to ignore the reality of
      the connection and interaction between gravity and magnetism due
      to lack of data and technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0301] Lack of full comprehension of science regarding the
      creation, the existence, the control, maintaining and utilisation
      of these two most powerful forces in the universe, has run the
      world of science in to problems as in handling these two forces of
      creation as one.<br>
      <br>
      [0302] This has been purely due to the physical time gape between
      the discovery and understanding of these two forces of creation.<br>
      <br>
      [0303] Probably if scientist would have discovered the two
      magnetic forces and the gravitational forces at the same time,
      then they would have had totally different understanding of their
      principals, their capabilities and their connections.<br>
      <br>
      [0304] Most probably the human race would have taken a different
      course in its intellectual and scientific world too.<br>
      <br>
      [0305] At the time when Newton discovered the gravity the
      correlation between these two phenomenons and forces have never
      been established properly.<br>
      <br>
      [0306] This is why the scientists did not handle them, as to be
      created by one source, and they considered them as being created
      and maintained by two different sources and forces. Where, both
      forces need each other for their creation and survivals, as they
      are made from the same elements and they are the same forces
      appearing in two different side of the same matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0307] The true relationship between these two forces needs to be
      explained that the reality about the two important physical forces
      of nature in the correct manner can be established.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] This is to establish that " creator of the magnetic force
      and the gravitational force" is the same source and the same
      material and they are the same forces acting in different
      direction through a physical matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0309] This means that the source of the planetary passive
      magnetic forces (PMF) and the gravitational forces (GF) is the
      same material and they are the same forces. But acting as, and
      appearing in two different ways or directions with appearance of
      two different characteristics. The only difference is the fact
      that they appear in different form and under different conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0310] When the forces pulls two matter to each other it become
      force of gravity and when the same force pushes away two matters
      it becomes the magnetic force.<br>
      <br>
      [0311] At the time of creation of these forces, physical
      conditions in universe allow one or the other takes over first,
      then by interacting with its surrounding matters for the second
      force to manifest itself out of the same original material.<br>
      <br>
      [0312] These forces could be created in plasmas from different
      atoms, gas, liquid or solid.<br>
      <br>
      [0313] This process of manifestation of gravity is very important
      to be comprehended fully and distinguish from the solid state
      magnetism. In the past the magnetism and gravity have been
      explained according to the physical understanding of a solid
      magnet and not the planetary magnetic forces, where this new
      understanding of creation of magnetism and gravity, is one of the
      corner stones of creation of solar systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0314] This is why scientists have fallen in the pitfall of always
      trying to overcome the forces gravity and magnetism rather then
      using and working with and within them to attain motion and lift.
      Where it has become a challenge even to overcome the gravity in
      just trying to send a small rocket into the Earth orbit.<br>
      <br>
      [0315] Because world of science has not managed to understand the
      simple relationship between these two forces of gravity and
      magnetism, to use them to its advantage to acquire lift and
      motion. This is the point where one has achieved the ultimate
      knowledge of existence in the world of creation.<br>
      <br>
      [0316] Scientist have chosen simply to burn tones of fuels to
      overcome gravity to send a craft in to space, then they have the
      dilemma of protecting it from the other force's onslaught for it
      to be return back to earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0317] The power of magnetism and gravity of planet is independent
      of its size, this holds true the same for systems as solid magnet,
      where if a piece of magnet could be cut into halves or quarters.
      Each piece still will carry the same a north and a South Pole.
      Still each piece will have the same powers as the original piece.<br>
      <br>
      [0318] That is to say, that if one uses the same volume ratio of
      the same matter and proportional physical conditions in the core
      of a system, one will attain the same magnetism and gravitational
      force field from the system as it bigger dimension system.<br>
      <br>
      [0319] With the only difference that the bigger dimensional system
      will and can cover a larger physical area, as the smaller system
      boundary of interaction between two force will cove more confined
      area in the vicinity of its core.<br>
      In physical term the gravitational force is the pulling power
      created by two spherical magnetic field forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0320] In astrophysical term magnetic field forces of the planet
      is what keeps the planets away and apart from each other not to
      collide in their systems. Where this pattern of the distribution
      of the magnetic forces of planet in interacting with its star is
      shown as the magnetosphere of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0321] This planetarium magnetic force is a passive force filed
      (PMF) and has no relation with the magnetism as is known in the
      solid state magnet. This is called passive magnetism due to the
      fact that, this type of magnetism cannot magnetise a material.
      Otherwise all the materials in the outer layers of the Earth would
      have stock to each other. But, this force has, behaves, appears
      and has characteristics of magnetic field force.<br>
      <br>
      [0322] The reason it is called the passive is due to its
      capability of passing through human tissue without effecting the
      function of its atoms and its molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0323] The fact that due to the spherical shape of material in the
      universe, the gravitational force or the pulling force of planets
      has the tendency to encircle inside the planets. This being due to
      the fact that these objects are always in motion in the space due
      to the phenomenon of others planets magnetic field powers. Which
      in space the motion has the power to entrap or concentrate this
      power in to the centre of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0324] This is the reason why the gravitational forces increased
      as the one moves close to these objects and the as one moves
      toward the centre of these matters.<br>
      <br>
      [0325] If one takes the fundamentals of the motion and heat away
      from the Astro-physical matters, They will posses no gravity and
      no magnetism but simply they posses inertia.<br>
      <br>
      [0326] The difference between the solid magnetism and geomagnetism
      are two clear factors. In this particular orders First the motion
      and then the heat.<br>
      <br>
      [0327] If one were able to create the right motion and then the
      right heat in a material one can create control magnetism and then
      the gravitational forces within that object.<br>
      <br>
      [0328] Once this is understood, one by controlling the heat and
      the motion. One can like in the atom in the solid magnet move from
      one side through the matter and posses the other force.<br>
      <br>
      [0329] It is important to realise that due to the spherical shape
      of the objects in possession of both forces creates and open ended
      magnetic loop, where they create the two poles of the magnet as
      the north and the South Pole of the earth plane. If a system can
      take advantage of this phenomenon, for it to move within these
      forces of a planet, rather then trying to overcome them, or to
      resist them for its motion, then not much energy or efforts are
      need to create the right gravitational forces within a system for
      it move inside or outside the atmosphere of a planet or a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0330] These are the principals and the most important differences
      between powers of the passive and active magnetism, where the
      active magnetism in the normal condition is created in tangible
      elements. The planetarium magnetism does not behave this way and
      does not need certain particular matter to create the two forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0331] The passive magnetism is created through different method
      that its is not dependent on the atomic structure of the material.
      This means that the behaviour of material under this magnetic
      field force is slightly different.<br>
      <br>
      [0332] The planetary magnetism can not exist and be created where
      there are no gravitational forces. At the same time no
      gravitational forces or gravity on a planet exists, if the planet
      does not posses any magnetic force of its own.<br>
      <br>
      [0333] The sequence of the changing of the polarity of the earth
      and the sun and all other centrally heated objects in the universe
      is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0334] The two liquid materials, both in the caroline cores and
      outer core, are in rotation and conductive state, and creating
      magnetic filled of their own, due to the fact of the angular spine
      of the their atoms, where a matter passes through a magnetic
      field, two things can happen, one is that, if the atom is neutral
      the matter will be going through the magnetic field with out
      de-separation in any direction. M T Keshe "Einstein theory of
      relativity"<br>
      <br>
      [0335] In reality the hydrogen and the other components of the
      inner core and outer core are not neutral, so their passage
      through the magnetic field of the other core by the elements of
      the first field, will create motion in that martial through
      magnetic field forces, the matter circulates creating the current
      in the core of the planet. This is the same in the order of the
      outer magnetic fields towards the Caroline core material as the
      magnetic field of core towards the materials in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0336] When the effect of these two magnetic fields, due to their
      rotation speed reaches equality one field effect's the motion in
      the matter of the other core, and manages dominate magnetic field
      of the other causing the flip over the strength of the other. As
      the materials are in state of fluid, the taking over is in
      molecular level, then the weaker of the two, changes polarity to
      bring balance in the overall magnetic field of the two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [0337] This change of polarity will create an immediate motion and
      new cycle of magnetic field to the angular motion of the atoms in
      its core and the gravitational forces of the planet will come back
      to stable magnetic realignment.<br>
      <br>
      [0338] This can clearly be shown in the operation of the
      gravitational cores of the reactor to be disclosed in this patent.
      Where, this change of polarity in the reactors of a system has to
      be avoided, as if this happens during the operation, this can lead
      to overturning of the craft that the reactor is attached to.<br>
      <br>
      [0339] From surface magnetic data observation prior to each
      switching of magnetic polarity, there has been a reduction in the
      magnetic field strength of the planet. This is an indication as a
      safety point of control, and what to look for before switching of
      the polarity in the reactor cores occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0340] The speed of the rate of the polarity change is very
      dependent on the components of the centre of the planet or the
      star.<br>
      <br>
      [0341] If the planet is made of near enough similar material on
      both side of the inner core, the flips of polarity will be much
      faster and on shorter terms like in the Sun. But if the planet is
      made of a composite core, and made of two or more different
      materials in its caroline core, for the two fields to realigned
      will take longer time for the magnetic flip of polarity like in
      the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0342] In any case as the material in both cores are always
      constant and can not change that much, the timing of the change
      stays on the same time intervals. In the case of the sun this is
      takes eleven years and in the case of smaller planet like earth
      which is made of composite mixtures this change of polarity will
      be longer.<br>
      <br>
      [0343] This switching of polarity is a neutral outcome and the
      nature of the atomic structure of each element charges
      characteristic and atomic natural angular rotation of its
      electrons of the matter within a magnetic environment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetosphere</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0344] The shape and the strength of the magnetosphere of a planet
      is exactly what finger print is to Man. It is unique to each
      planet and star. It is teller of all its attributes, and it is the
      reveller of its internal material structural hidden mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0345] The most exciting part of space travel will be in
      recognizing the planet long before reaching it, Where the
      magnetosphere is like the scent of a flower long. Where one can
      tell the type of the planet one about to observe loge before one
      could see it. Like one smell a rose before one sees the flower one
      knows its identity.<br>
      <br>
      [0346] This is the same in the world of space, where the pattern
      of the distribution of the magnetosphere of the plant gives away
      the secret of the planet long before one could reach it.<br>
      <br>
      [0347] The magnetosphere has been measured and calculated for all
      the planets in the solar system by the experts in this field for
      some years.<br>
      <br>
      [0348] One point, which must be paid attention to is the shape and
      the pattern of the distribution of the Trapping region of the
      magnetosphere, then its relationship to the planet internal
      construction. If a closer attention is paid to the pattern of
      distribution of the Trapping region, One could tell a lot about
      the structure, components constituent, relation of each component
      to each other, their mixture and separation inside the planet, the
      pattern of their motion inside the planet, the way the planet was
      made at the outset and so many other factors and properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0349] The study of the Trapping region the most important part of
      magnetosphere of a planet where all about the health, condition,
      the materials needed to copy the gravitational and magnetic field
      of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0350] The most appropriate point for any system to enter a planet
      atmosphere is at the point where the magnetosphere of the planet
      is at its weakest at cusp of the magnetosphere of the plant. Where
      the magnetospheric interaction between the planet and the craft
      will be at minimum, once passing the bow shock region.<br>
      <br>
      [0351] It is important to understand the effect and operational
      effect of the magnetosphere of a planet like earth in coming in
      touch with magnetic field of the its star, where the interface
      between the two magnetic fields is a very volatile region.<br>
      <br>
      [0352] This is the same when ever two passive magnetic fields
      confront each other, where there are charged materials in the
      vicinity of the this interface, where charge particles of solar
      wind interacts with two magnetic charges interface of two magnetic
      fields of the sun and the earth. Where in the atmospheric side of
      the earth the temperature of the air is at about fifty degrees
      below centigrade at fifty kilometre altitude, at the same time the
      temperature of the atmosphere in the higher magnetosphere near at
      the interface of the two magnetic fields in the presence of the
      solar plasma is about 2000 to 3000 degree centigrade.<br>
      <br>
      [0353] This heating due to magnetosphere region of two spherical
      magnetic fields inside a core 1 of a system, in presence of charge
      particles due to ionisation of hydrogen, will play an important
      part in the whole operation characteristic of the reactor. This
      being in the ionisation, magnetic field effect, position of the
      interface of the magnetic field in the reactor, the current
      production of the reactor and the gravitational power of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0354] To be able to travel in space with ease, there is a need to
      learn to work with and within the universal principal and not at
      all time try to over come them, that is why space travel has been
      such long struggle in the past.<br>
      <br>
      [0355] Universe works on one principal of magnetism, if one works
      within it, One will harvest the wonderful fruits of it, if one
      tries to overcome it by physical means, like use of burning fuel
      as in the rockets, then one has always to fight the physical
      limitations of its physical existence of the material one uses.<br>
      <br>
      [0356] In the design and operation of the reactor in this new
      technology, the interface between two magnetic fields of the outer
      core and caroline core and even in the multi-layer cores magnetic
      fields, these will create the same magnetosphere effect between
      the interaction of two magnetic fields forces of two as between
      the sun and the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0357] The effect of the magnetic forces in conjunction with
      interaction of the charge particles within the vicinity of the
      interface of these two spherical magnetosphere inside the core
      creates heat, energy and current with a disproportionate rate
      compared to the normal magnetic condition outcome in relation to
      the input energy into the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0358] This in turn reduces the amount of the excited charge input
      needed through other sources like hydrogen or from scintillated
      helium (Scint-He).<br>
      <br>
      [0359] Thus the interaction at the interface of the two magnetic
      field and presence of the charge particles within the core, makes
      the system a more energy efficient, not through thermal heating
      but by the radiative heating.<br>
      <br>
      [0360] In turn this increasing the creation of the heat in the
      cores of the reactor core.<br>
      At the same time increasing the generation of the current through
      convection in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0361] In the core of the reactor this effect and position of this
      interface of the two magnetosphere is and will be a dominant
      factor in the all aspects of operation of any reactor. This even
      determines the amount of hydrogen needed to be available at the
      start point of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The creation of Black Hole<br>
      <br>
      [0362] Since first disclosures of this phenomenon, Scientist and
      the rest of academic world have tried to find, understand and
      explain the reasons for the existence of this mysterious being in
      the universe.<br>

      creation of galaxies, stars and planets. One could be able to
      understand the creation and existence of the Black Hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0365] One has to understand the fundamental principal that,
      galaxies like solar systems and planets are given their inner mass
      and energy at the point of their birth in the universe. So they
      can not create new masses and new source of energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0366] Thus, Galaxies can only recycle what they have been given
      at the start of their lives, to create different new objects like
      stars or plants within themselves.<br>
      <br>
      [0367] In universal terms they have a finite mass and energy
      available to them and nothing more. But at the same time as a part
      of bigger picture Galaxy's have to obey the universal laws of
      physics. Consequently, all galaxies fallow the same rules and so
      do their physical contents within them.<br>
      <br>
      [0368] The Black Hole is created only and only under one condition
      in the Universe.<br>
      <br>
      Black holes are created as the consequences of other acts in a
      galaxy. They are not created as a deliberate and as predetermined
      plan in and by a galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      But in their way they make an enormous contribution in keeping the
      matters in check in their surrounding during their relatively
      short life.<br>
      <br>
      [0369] At the same time they redistribute fresh material
      throughout the galaxy during their cycle of existence. This is
      done through and as the consequent of them being the source for
      the creation of cosmic rays in the galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      [0370] This is very much like natural fertilisers. Where the old
      gives its nourishment in an indirect way for the existing plant to
      keep healthy and receive sustenance.<br>
      <br>
      [0371] Black Holes in the universe are nothing but the centre for
      collection and re-cycle waste bin of cosmic debris.<br>
      <br>
      [0372] As they grow bigger and their gravitational forces takes
      over. Then the Black Hole becomes a prior of its part of the
      galaxy. They become vast eating machines of the debris and stars
      and planets. This is exactly what is to be expected of them.<br>
      <br>
      [0373] The Black Hole is originally created totally by chance.
      There are no patterns in their creation. They are simply a
      creation or an outcome of natural interaction between two or more
      passive magnetic fields in motion within the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      Conditions for creation of the Black Hole<br>
      <br>
      [0374] To explain the concept, phenomenon's which are normal and
      familiar on Earth and from Earth will be relied up on. Then a
      parallel will be drawn with them in the galaxies for the creation
      of the Black Hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0375] Black Holes are created according to the rules of physics
      in galaxies to collect and then replenish the galaxies with fresh
      recycled materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0376] This recycling is the vital factor in sustaining and making
      sure that as the galaxy moves. There are new materials available
      to start new systems within the galaxies. At the same time nourish
      the other Planets within the galaxy with fresh supply of
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0377] The parallel similarities between the Black Hole and
      presentation of new material in the universe on earth are the
      effect of collision of earth tectonic plates. When, two sources of
      solid materials interact with each other. Then, in turn in the
      long run the planets in the galaxy and submerged tectonic plates
      on earth become the source of the supply of new materials and
      planets in the galaxy and the lava or new continents on the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0378] Let's explain this in the following manner. The continental
      plates and star systems are forever on the move. They move slow
      but surly they are on the move.<br>
      <br>
      On the Earth when two or more plates move in random manners over
      centuries and millions of years. At some point they come on each
      other's path. So do the stars and their systems. Like solar system
      and others in our galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0379] When on earth the two or more continental plates come
      together. Several things can happen. This happens in galaxies but
      in a different form too.<br>
      <br>
      [0380] Where the continental plates are replaced by cosmic
      magnetic fields spheres of the stars or systems. This is the
      strength of the magnetic field of a star or a system that it
      covers in that galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0381] Imagine this to be the content of an egg on a plate in a
      cosmic way. Then bring two of these eggs together that they have
      an interface or touching each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0382] The next steps in the procedure are very familiar to us on
      earth. As, the continental plates push against each other. If,
      they are of similar strength, they rise together to create the
      mountains over millions of years. Do not forget that they are
      still pushing and moving while they are muscling their strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0383] So, large mountain ranges on the surface of planets are
      created. Other things can happen too. That is if, one of the
      continental plates is weaker. The weaker plate will slide under
      the other. So the continentals plate which sub-merges, in the long
      run becomes the material in the lower levels inside the planet.
      This then become the base material for the magma. Then some times
      in the future these to become the source material for new
      continents or an island and so on through volcanic eruptions. So
      this means that the material drawn in to centre of the planet does
      not disappear but for the time being is hidden from the view.<br>
      <br>
      [0384] Parallel to this scenario happens in the galaxies. When,
      two or more systems in the galaxy reach each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0385] Their passive magnetic field pushes against each other like
      continental plates.<br>
      <br>
      A point is reached in this process of two passive magnetic fields
      passing each other. Where, an area in the space is created that
      the two passive magnetic fields have to interact with each other.
      As they are on a collision path with each other. At the same time
      the surrounding systems as they are pushing for their position do
      not allow any other course of motion, for two systems to move away
      from each others path.<br>
      <br>
      [0386] You have a point where there are solid materials in motion
      from both systems available and they have no choice but to
      interact with each other. Because they have been thrown at each
      other by their systems. That, pieces of inter planetary garbage or
      parts of moons or meteoroids and other bits of the two systems in
      this region are thrown at each other in to the same pot<br>
      <br>
      In this area, where the two systems physical materials are pushed
      and thrown at each other. So do their passive magnetic fields are
      exerting their power and authority. like the hidden forces pushing
      the continental plates in to each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0387] A point is reached where these two force fields cancel each
      other out and create a condition of magnetic equilibrium. Where
      one field force can not dominate the other passive magnetic field
      force. Inevitably, an area of no or a very week passive magnetic
      field force in this region is established.<br>
      <br>
      [0388] During all this process materials from both systems are
      still being piled up in this no-man's-land of space. Where the two
      systems materials are brought together due to pure force of the
      Passive Magnetic Field forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0389] Even stars themselves in the later stages of the
      development of the Black Hole could be the victim of the Black
      Hole which their system was partially the cause of creation.<br>
      <br>
      [0390] The new mass of the Black Hole may even be a larger mass
      than the individual systems that created the Black Hole in the
      first instance. One can not forget that these masses are still in
      motion and rotating at very high speeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0391] This new mass in the centre of no- mans- land is piled up
      together and creates a very large gravitational force within its
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0392] By laws of physics, one knows that the only reason that
      stars shine or cosmic rays glow is the phenomenon of charged
      particles passing through a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0393] In this region the magnetic fields are very weak. This
      region lacks the main component that could make it shine or to be
      bright.<br>
      <br>
      [0394] That is the lack of the passive magnetic field in this
      region due to the equilibrium and canceling of the two interacting
      magnetic field forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0395] Or for a time in the motion of the two magnetic fields of
      the systems. In passing each other, in some parts there are non or
      there will be very little magnetic field force.<br>
      <br>
      Thou, even we have charged practical in the area, but there are no
      magnetic fields. No glow and no shine. Reason why this is called
      the Black Hole. As they emit very little light due to the lack
      interaction between particles and non-existence of the magnetic
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      This is the reason why if one look's at these areas of the galaxy
      they seem to be darker compared to their surrounding areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0396] This is Why this region of space is seems to be black. But,
      from an outsider everything looks as is thrown in to this dark
      spot from one side and nothing is coming out of the same side.
      This appears as to be a Hole. But in reality some rays of light
      should be observed as some charged particles still interact with
      the some weak PMF or what is left them before they enter the hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0397] Consequently physical term of The BLACK HOLE is invented.
      Where in this part of the galaxy there are no visible light but
      matter disappears too.<br>
      <br>
      So in this region of the galaxy astronomers observe a large
      gravitational force due to the large amount of mass thrown in to
      this area by the two systems as they pass each other.<br>
      <br>
      But they have no explanation as what is happening to all this
      mass. Now one understands the reason for this false assumption and
      appearance.<br>
      <br>
      [0398] This is the region where the gravitational forces can
      become beyond mans present understanding.<br>
      <br>
      [0399] In the future papers the writer will explain how these
      Black Hole's effects can be useful in helping Man to travel
      through galaxies and in the Universe. These are at this moment of
      time beyond mans understanding.<br>
      <br>
      [0400] One has to remember that as these two or more systems are
      passing each other. Several scenarios can happen again. Which
      every one of these will have and has drastic and profound effect
      in that region of the galaxy. But generates a vast amount of new
      recycled material for the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0401] One at all times has to remember that one is dealing with a
      three dimensional picture. At the same time one has to take into
      account the time factor. This is important. As in some cases the
      Black Hole exists for millions of years during the crossing of the
      two system passing each other path. The truth is that the Black
      Holes are a temporally condition so to speak in the bigger picture
      of cycle of the life of a galaxy. But, they surly look like being
      there forever.<br>
      <br>
      [0402] Some of the residual of these interactions will be some
      cosmic rays (read the paper by the writer as to the birth of
      cosmic rays). Or the outcome could be the birth of a new system
      with a new mass from the mixture of the masses of the two old
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0403] In this case the masses of elements are as they were in
      their original systems. But now the new Black Hole could have a
      combined mass of two old systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0404] One can not forget that the centre mass of the Black Hole
      is still rotating. In the same direction as the systems were
      rotating which created it.<br>
      <br>
      [0405] But as the centre mass is void of the Passive Magnetic
      Field (PMF). The usual interaction between the passive magnetic
      force and gravitational force do not take place that usually
      creates the first basses of heating and sustaining that heat. So
      that the temperature gradient could take hold.<br>
      <br>
      That in turn could create the conditions for the mass to become a
      star or a system. So the mass relies up the heat that are produced
      mainly by the natural friction of the elements pilling on top of
      each other. So the centre mass have enough mass but not the right
      condition to create the necessary heat for the time being to make
      the jump to become the source for a new system or a new star. This
      is how in reality the Black Holes become the creator of new stars
      and systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0406] These interactions between passive magnetic fields happen
      on regular basses in our galaxy as systems are at all times on the
      move in a confined space of their galaxy's.<br>
      <br>
      Do not forget that at all time that this is in progress over
      thousands of years. The Black Hole at points due to weak interface
      with passive magnetic fields of the system is leaking cosmic rays
      into the galaxy. The reader understands now that why the
      scientific world find's materials from the Universe that are not
      or have not the same age as the original component of the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0407] As like supernovas, the Black Holes are the source of the
      new material for the galaxy primarily because of the way they are
      created and the way their life cycle finishes.<br>
      <br>
      The other scenario of the interaction of the two systems could be
      totally different with an interesting outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0408] This is the most horrendous way that the two systems could
      come in contact with each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0409] In this case as the two magnetic fields come too close to
      each other. At the same time, other systems around them push these
      Passive Magnetic Fields themselves together. The two fields
      interact and the first stage of creation of the Black Hole is
      reached. But, as the two systems surrender more and more of their
      debris and planets to the Black Hole. The central mass of the
      Black Hole increases. As the Black Hole is receiving its contents
      from two different systems simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0410] This reaches to a point that weight and the gravitational
      force of the new centre mass of the Black Hole super passes the
      mass weight of one of the systems. Which created it in the first
      place.<br>
      <br>
      [0411] Now, gradually, the magnetic field from one side disappears
      totally. As the Black Hole has already devoured the star from one
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0412] The second system which has already lost some of its mass
      to the Black Hole at the outset of the creation of it. Now loses
      control of its magnetic field control too as it losses its star.<br>
      <br>
      [0413] The second system over time losses all its mass to the
      centre masses of Black Hole too.<br>
      <br>
      To an outsider looking at this, as these events are happening. It
      seems as the Black Hole is consuming every thing around it.<br>
      <br>
      [0414] As the centre mass of the Black Hole has consumed the
      entirety of two systems. It is operating in a no magnetic field
      zone for a period of time. This can take thousands of years. Until
      a temperature gradient in the centre of the mass is established.
      Which, this happens due to friction with in the new mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0415] If material is held for long enough within the centre mass!
      That magnetic force could be produced and maintained. New systems
      will come to be born and new materials will be distributed in the
      galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0416] If not! This giant of a mass of the Black Hole will be
      nothing but a huge Gravity machine. The Black Hole will be a dark
      place but not necessarily cold.<br>
      <br>
      [0417] If the centre mass during its creation does not manages to
      heat up. The third phase of the Black Hole syndrome takes hold.
      This is, that, the centre mass at this stage becomes so big. As it
      never had a chance to hit up due to total absence or lack of
      strong magnetic force. At the same time, the new large centre of
      the mass is rotating.<br>
      <br>
      [0418] This new mass inherits a huge natural gravitational force
      from its collective mass with no or little magnetic field to keep
      it at bay. So, this massive large body will start pulling smaller
      objects near to it into its trap.<br>
      <br>
      [0419] This will have the most horrendous outcome for that parts
      the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0420] Do not forget that the same phenomenon applies when two
      galaxies come to pass each other's path too. But the outcome of
      that is beyond imagination. This has happened before and
      astronomers forecast it for our galaxy in the future as it passes
      the nearest galaxy to us in the next few billion years.<br>
      <br>
      [0421] In this scenario, the whole of the God's calamites will be
      brought on the two galaxies. Even the surrounding areas near the
      newly created Black Hole will not be safe from the onslaught.<br>
      <br>
      [0422] One can not forget that this mass at all time of its
      existence has the same fundamental problem of all other systems.
      That is to hold on to all its elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0423] At the same time like other system's the lighter elements
      in the mass move to the outer layers and to the edges of the mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0424] This happens to all systems even in our solar system this
      happened during its inception and its final settlement. As seen
      today, as the lighter giant gas planets exist on the outer
      bounders of our system.<br>
      <br>
      [0425] As gases move to outer region of the mass. They become
      better candidates to be pulled away from the centre mass by any
      opening in the adjacent magnetic systems. When the mass reaches a
      point that gravitational force become weak on the edges that
      lighter elements can mange to loosen themselves and escape from
      its grip. These freed elements will become part of galaxy dusts.
      So object leak out of the galaxy even during the time of its
      creation.<br>
      <br>
      [0426] If these elements are pull out of the power of the centre
      mass. Through the strength or gap in the adjacent systems. They
      become the comic rays, as we know them. This is due to the fact
      that during extraction atoms get striped of their electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0427] Some heaver atoms lose their electrons in the same way, and
      so they appear as part of the cosmic rays in the galaxy too.<br>
      <br>
      [0428] Do not forget as it has been said before Black Holes are
      the mother of most of cosmic rays in the galaxies due to this
      effect (read the cosmic ray document by the writer for a clear
      understanding).<br>
      <br>
      [0429] At this stage one can not forget that the Black Hole is
      still surrounded by other systems. This new Black Hole power is
      kept at bay by the systems around with larger magnetic field
      forces and gravitational forces. Which it is still encapsulate
      amongst.<br>
      <br>
      [0430] Black Holes are normally observed close to the centre of
      the galaxies, as there are more systems clustered together in that
      region. This increases the chances of different systems to come in
      the path of each other. In turn increasing the chance of the
      collision and hence increase the chance of the creation of Black
      Holes.<br>
      <br>
      [0431] One has to remember that heavier elements of the galaxy are
      largely concentrated in and near the centre of galaxies. So the
      passive magnetic fields and gravitational forces of the systems
      are many times more powerful near the centre of galaxies then what
      is experience in the outer edges of them. Consequently, the
      gravitational forces and passive magnetic forces in the centre
      regions of the galaxy will soon bring and keep the size and the
      power of these giants Black Holes under control.<br>
      <br>
      [0432] What is achieved by these collisions of systems and
      creation of Black Hole! Is the fundamental principal of
      regeneration of new systems out of the old. At the same time
      unclogging of the galaxy of all the loss debris.<br>
      <br>
      [0433] If one looks at a three dimensional overview of these areas
      in space. Surely due to the movement of stars and planets and the
      interaction of their forces one should be able to predict where
      the next Black Hole in that part of galaxy could be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0434] In time, a point will be reached where passive magnetic
      fields in one of the immediate neighbours to the Black hole will
      move on. At this point the feeding frenzy of the Black Hole will
      come to an end. Which means that very much like volcanic eruptions
      on earth where the mantle is thin enough that pressure of the lava
      can takeover. The lava, then push it's way out into the atmosphere
      as a volcanic eruption.<br>
      <br>
      [0435] This is exactly what happens when one of the passive
      magnetic field's in this area moves or weakens. This creates a gap
      for the material, which has been pushed previously into the Black
      Hole into one direction. Where, these materials will be released
      or scattered in to the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0436] In the process part of them mange to cluster together and
      generate the temperature gradient essential for creation of one or
      more systems or stars.<br>
      <br>
      [0437] The rest of the materials of the centre mass becomes cosmic
      dusts, Some become comets and some become cosmic rays and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0438] Thus, It is proven here for once and for all, that the
      Black Holes are not a gigantic eating machine. They are a
      temporary condition due to movement as systems in the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      Contrary to common belief they always release and produce new
      recycled material in to their surrounding. They are not bottomless
      pits where everything disappears in to them.<br>
      <br>
      They are like a funnel that if one looks at one end it seems that
      they are taking everything in. But exactly like a funnel they have
      a hole on the other end that what goes in has to come out. With a
      difference the funnel is connected to a kitchen waist unit. Where,
      the sink waist unit that crunches everything up and mix what every
      goes in before spewing the waist out through the waist pipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0439] So the behaviour of the Black Hole is very much dependent
      on the position of the observer.<br>
      <br>
      [0440] If one looks from one end they are massive eating machines.
      From the other end they are the supplier and feeder of new life in
      the Galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Examples</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0441] The phenomenon of Black Hole happens in our own solar
      system. This happens on a smaller scale on the surface of the Sun
      itself. These are called the Dark Spots of the Sun. In reality
      they go through the same cycle as the creation of the Black Hole.
      With the difference that the magnetic fields on the surface of the
      Sun. Even thou they are so powerful. They interact with each
      other. They cancel each other out as they come across each other.
      Or their strength reduces drastically.<br>
      <br>
      [0442] So the same cycle as creation of the Black Hole repeats
      itself. That, there are no passive magnetic fields or a very
      little of it in the region of the Dark Spots on the surface on the
      Sun. Hence, there are no interactions between the charged
      particles and the passive magnetic fields. Consequently there are
      no or very little emission of light from the surface of the Sun in
      that region.<br>
      <br>
      [0443] Now the same scenario as the first phase of creation of the
      Black Hole starts again. But this time there is a slight
      variation.<br>
      <br>
      [0444] The variation is that the gravitational force of the Sun is
      so powerful and very close. The gravitational force of the Sun is
      in proportional many times stronger then the gravitational force
      of the particles captured within the dark region.<br>
      <br>
      [0445] Consequently the mass of particles are pulled back inward
      in to the Sun. So, they collapse back in to the surface of the
      Sun. By this time, most of the other passive magnetic fields of
      the Sun have physically push and cajole the passive magnetic
      fields (PMF) that created the Dark Spot. That, they move and so
      they shift from their position .So, the dual between the PMFs
      around the Dark Spot comes to an end.<br>
      <br>
      [0446] At the same time as there are no more active PMFs to
      interact with each other. The charged particles start interacting
      with the PMFs around them. Then everything goes back to normal.
      The light or the shine on the surface of the sun returns to
      normality.<br>
      <br>
      [0447] As it was said before. Something similar to this happens in
      the centre of the galaxies. Where there are more PMF available.
      Consequently, there are more chances of interaction between two
      adjacent PMF of systems. Which increases the chance of more
      production of the Black Holes.<br>
      <br>
      [0448] When too many PMFs start canceling each other out. As on
      the surface of the Sun become congested. Here there are less and
      less PMF available to posh other PMFs to cause them to move. Like
      congestion in traffic, they clog up the surface of the Sun. Hence
      the number of the Dark Spots start increasing. So one feeds the
      other in a way. The Whole thing comes to an end. Where the PMFs in
      these areas for one reason or other are pushed or forced to move
      and the whole system of Dark Spot start to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      This is the very reason why the eleven-year cycle of increase in
      the Dark Spots on the surface of the Sun arises on regular manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0449] During the Sun's polar change which happens every eleven
      years. Then there are more of these Passive Magnetic Fields to
      interact. This being due to the fact that as the polarities of the
      Sun changes so more PMF start moving from one pole to the other to
      accommodate the physical practicality of the polar change. Thus, a
      larger number of the PMF become to cross each other's path.<br>
      <br>
      [0450] Consequently there are more chances of the Black Hole
      phenomenon to take place. Which in fact it does happens. Which, in
      turn an increase in the dark spots of the Sun in a regular cycle
      is noticed.<br>
      <br>
      [0451] This is the period when the Sun PMF activities increase. At
      this time there are large numbers of PMFs available. As the PMF
      interact in a large numbers, they create more Dark Spots. Then the
      number of these Dark spots increases. When suddenly a vast number
      of PMF cancel each other out. Masses of charged Particles gets
      pulled back in to the surface of the Sun. The whole cycle of
      collapse of the Black hole re-accurse. That is, where the Dark
      Spot collapse and their energies are released as massive Sun
      flares.<br>
      <br>
      As it was described before, large amount of the centre mass of the
      Dark Spots explodes out ward and becomes solar flare as in the
      Black Holes.<br>
      <br>
      [0452] Sometimes, as the mass of particles collected in the Dark
      Spot is pulled back in to the surface of the Sun. Due to it's mass
      and speed. This creates a second chain of events. This is as a
      meteorite hits the surface of the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      [0453] Therefore, a secondary splash of the Sun material is thrown
      in to the space. This double act causes more then usual derbies
      and charged particles to be leaving the Sun surface in to space.
      The rest is well known to us as what happens next (read the
      article on creation of the dark spots by the writer).<br>
      <br>
      [0454] This has to be understood that the cycle of the Sun's
      polarity changes of every eleven years is the direct cause of
      increase in the creation of the Dark Spot of the on the surface of
      the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The reality is that the darkness on the surface of the Sun is not
      due to what is commonly thought due to cooler temperature in that
      region. But, the Dark Spots are due purely to the fact that there
      is no or very little PMF in this region available to interact with
      the charge particles to create light.<br>
      <br>
      [0455] So underneath the Dark Spots on the surface of the Sun the
      temperature of the surface is still the same as the rest of its
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0456] But from an outside observer like on the Earth the surface
      looks dark purely due to the fact that there are little
      interactions between the PMF and the charged particle in this
      region immediately above the surface of the Sun. So, there is very
      little light produce. <br>
      <br>
      So the surface appears as to be darker.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Benefit and use of</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0457] When this phenomenon is understood and utilised correctly
      within the confinement of a reactor. The control of the size and
      speed of the creation of the Black Hole will allow the control of
      the creation and control of the gravity within the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0458] This characteristic in turn can and will be utilised to
      control the gravity with in the boundaries of the reactor. Which
      in turn this property can used to create lift in the atmospheric
      confides.<br>
      <br>
      [0459] In the open space of the universe the control of this
      phenomenon can be use to be attracted or repelled from one point
      to or from in a system or a galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0460] So the present speed phenomenon known to Man has to be
      redefined sometimes in the future. Do not forget the scientist use
      the effect of this phenomenon of gravity to get close to a star to
      gain speed for the long journey and call it the catapult effect of
      the planets.<br>
      Armed with this knowledge of understanding the reality of the
      Black Hole. In reality now they can now produced and control the
      gravity of a system from inside to achieve more efficient methods
      of motion from any position in the Universe with the system. The
      design of this system will be explained in the future papers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusions</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0461] The Irony with the Black Hole has been that one of the
      geniuses of the race of Man with out seeing it. He thought of its
      existence correctly in his wisdom.<br>
      <br>
      [0462] The rest of intellectuals and scientists of the human racy
      for decayed tried to find it.<br>
      <br>
      [0463] Once this mysterious object was found in the universe. The
      Professor Hawking made his assertion on the condition for its
      existence.<br>
      <br>
      [0464] In this paper, for the first time. The realty about the
      Black Hole physical creation and its purpose in the universe is
      explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0465] This clear explanation of the principals and theories
      behind the creation of the Black Hole put forward in this paper
      are undisputable on any scientific ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0466] In this paper it is proven that the Black Holes are real
      objects, they are physical by product of the forces and matters
      like every other object in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0467] The only difference for this body to appear and exist.
      There is a Fundamental shortage or total lack of one of the three
      main ingredients of the creation. This is the lack or weakness of
      the Passive Magnetic Force Field.<br>
      <br>
      [0468] This is another creation of universe like the uniqueness of
      the Blue planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0469] Once one has understood the methods of universe powers of
      creation within its three physical parameters. Every aspect of the
      appearance of objects can only be explained with understanding of
      the interactions of these with each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0470] The most beautiful part of this phenomenon will be. How Man
      will use this knowledge now for the advancement of its race?<br>
      <br>
      [0471] Understanding of the life and behaviour of the Black Hole
      in the space opens new doors for the Man to plan his future
      excursions in the space.<br>
      <br>
      [0472] The appropriate name for this object should not be a Black
      Hole. This is as giant as a solar system. With all the physical
      attribute of a star. With the deference that is not shining due to
      the lack of PMF.<br>
      <br>
      [0473] This system, now that we know its real physical shape
      should not be called a Black Hole. The appropriate name for this
      object as has one body and two distinctive characterises
      behaviours of first a gigantic eating machine of cosmic derbies.
      The second character of allowing new life to start from what it
      has destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      [0474] There is an old Aryan name for an arrow with two heads as
      the Black Hole with two characters. This object is called ZHUBEEN.
      That is one body with two heads serving two proposes. So I called
      this unpredictable object In the galaxy with this name as now it
      is a known object and not a mystery any more.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0475] Explanation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The helioseismology is the study of the internal structure and
      dynamic of the Sun using sunquakes data gathered mainly by NASA.
      The Sun oscillates continuously by varying degrees and directions.
      These oscillations are caused mainly by turbulent convection just
      below the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0476] The data from spherical-symmetrical solar model of the same
      condition shows close coloration to physical collected data
      through inversion. This showing that the data simulation is close
      to the physical reality of what is happening in the inner sanctum
      of the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      [0477] This confirming that the rotation and the turbulence have
      direct effect on the heating of the matter within the confined of
      the reactor and consequently in the creation of the current
      through convection and magnetic fields production within it.<br>
      The turbulence of the matter in the core of the chamber A creates
      the dynamo which has the direct effect in the production of the
      magnetic field in the reactors central chamber.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Explain also?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0478] Turbulent convection and differential rotation in the Sun
      are thought to be the cause of the creation of the solar magnetic
      fields. The directions in which these magnetic fields appear to
      flow out of the surface of the Sun according to their direction of
      rotation are known as helicity of the magnetic field in the
      region. Helicity simply describes the handedness of this field.
      This field literally opens up like a cone as it moves away from
      the centre towards outer region.<br>
      <br>
      [0479] Magnetic helicity is in fact a measure of the knottedness
      and the twisted ness of the magnetic field within a region. This
      closely related to the turbulent dynamo effect. From all
      observation in the past large-scale poloidal magnetic fields have
      a direct linkage with strong toroidal field leading to finite
      helicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0480] As, in this reactor core all parameters are finite and the
      rotation and turbulence are predetermined. Therefore the helicity
      of the magnetic fields has to be the same at different point but
      equal for all distance from the centre. Due to the small size of
      the core a mean or average strength or tightness of the magnetic
      field could be assumed.<br>
      <br>
      [0481] The speed and the strength of creation and interaction of
      the helicity within the core have a direct and fundamental effect
      on the operation of the reactor. This is explained in the
      following manner. If the rate of the turbulence is that the number
      of the magnetic fields helicity covers a large area of the outer
      surface boundary of the spherical plasma. At the same time two
      equal helicity in strength in an area of magnetism is achieved.
      That they have to interact with each other's.<br>
      <br>
      [0482] At the same time they get stagnated in a point in the core
      but rotating within the plasma. If they do not pass each other
      quickly enough. These can create the condition of the equilibrium
      or nonmagnetic field in the interfacing points. This is a very
      dangerous position for the core. Where if this condition lasts too
      long and these two forces have to interact with each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0483] Thus a point of interaction of two magnetic forces will
      create condition as what is called the dark spot on the surface of
      the plasma. Which if this collapses can through plasma towards the
      boundary of the B. Which this sudden hot plasma can damage, by
      melting effect, the physical structure of the B.<br>
      <br>
      [0484] This is very much like the Sun flairs. Which one sees on
      the surface of the Sun. The creation of this is very much
      explained in the paper titled the Black hole theory. Which is
      already been provided before. Now one might understand why this
      paper was released first and there are no doublets in its
      accuracy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dark matter</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0485] The existence of dark matter is not questionable. But
      proving its existence and its effect on the energy balance of the
      universe and all matters as small as in the hart of an electron
      needs to be proved and detected and it effect measured.<br>
      <br>
      [0486] The theory of dark matter does not and has not to be
      considered to be complicated, if one understands the real term
      energy of matter in the visible and invisible dimensions of the
      universal work at any size or proportion that might be.<br>
      <br>
      [0487] The principal of the existence of The Dark Matter in the
      center of an atom is exactly as the one in the whole of galaxies
      and universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0488] The dark matter has two distinctive characteristics, which
      make it totally apart from the visible matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0489] These two characteristics of the dark matter as they can
      change to visible, they can make the visible matter to invisible
      when the matter reaches the same state of energy and magnetic
      field balance.<br>
      <br>
      [0490] The first principle of the dark matter for it to exist but
      not be detectable through any system, is the existence of the
      double magnetic field of the matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0491] Where the matter is of the same dark atoms particle of the
      same matter, interlocked, that the magnetic filed force of the two
      cancel each other out. Due to the principal of the interaction of
      motion of charge particle which can create magnetic field and
      magnetic reconnection within the matter itself that are visible
      and vice versa for the same magnetic field, causes the current for
      the matters within the dark matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0492] In the dark matter the main ingredient, which is of the
      magnetic filed of two dark matters cancel each other out, but at
      the same time, they are strong enough for the particles of their
      dark atoms to be kept together.<br>
      <br>
      [0493] This in principal is the same as the theory of the black
      hole which it has been explained in full in the paper titled the
      creation of "BLACK HOLE" by the author.<br>
      <br>
      [0494] That is to say as the two dark atoms interlock to be come
      dark molecules, they balance each other magnetic field out, but
      the energy constituent of their physical body stays intact and
      functioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0495] The reason dark matters or molecules can penetrate and
      exist on each level of universal existences, is purely due to the
      fact that molecules of matters with no magnetic field or balance
      magnetic field are and can pass through any matter or atom or hold
      their position in any levels of universe due to the fact that, as
      they do not have effective magnetic force filed they are, and
      become, and have no and meet no resistance in penetrating through
      elements with magnetic field force which are physical and
      consequently visible.<br>
      <br>
      [0496] As dark matters possess a double magnetic field force , or
      are in the possession of the north pole and the south pole at the
      same time, which are internal reconnected, so they accept no
      gravitation force.<br>
      <br>
      [0497] This being from atomic, molecular or galaxy gravitation
      forces. They have and do not create the typical double magnetic
      shielding created due to magnetic effect of their molecules. So
      they meet no resistance to pass through any matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0498] That is to say due to their inherent internal bounding
      characteristics, they do not create any magnetospheric shielding
      that can cause resistance for them to pass through any matter
      which creates it own magnetic shielding type effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0499] If this concept could be understood, as it is explained and
      replicated in a system, then the object within a dark matter can
      be transported across galaxies without any resistance.<br>
      <br>
      [0500] Then again the matter of speed of light become to totally
      obsolete and irrelevant. In any case light itself is created of
      lower energy magnetic force of the universe, which makes the
      matter visible to human eye, but not necessary this speed is the
      highest level of motion that a matter can travel in space. As the
      visible light itself is a creation by the real mother of the
      light.<br>
      <br>
      [0501] This means just because the human eye can detect this
      light, there are no other faster speeds or so called lights of
      motion of energies dose not exist in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0502] Due to this effect of no magnetic boundary, the fifth state
      of matter that is the dark matter has no size boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [0503] That is to say, they are tightly connected to their
      molecular counter part but at the same time loosely connected as
      in gases that they can cover the center of atom due to its
      magnetic pressures or they can cover a whole of one solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [0504] That is why they do not need to be many of them to fill a
      solar system. But they could be a few that can create a new system
      out of no where in a galaxy or appear as atomic creation, as it
      happens in a very small scale where the proton can split itself
      into an electron and a neutron in the proton to proton of hydrogen
      fusion chain in the stars.<br>
      <br>
      [0505] In this case the proton losses its hidden dark matter
      interlock between the energies which have the characteristics of
      neutron and electron. But it only needs the presence of the second
      proton for it to disturb the balance of the hidden or dark energy
      in the matter for the two new elements to manifest themselves.<br>
      <br>
      [0506] In reality protons are constituent of neutron themselves as
      neutron carries a proton and an electron mass and energy level.<br>
      <br>
      [0507] But how two protons can create something bigger than and
      more magnetic file force then themselves like additional neutron
      and proton, to lead to chain of even of fusion, this is exactly
      the dark energy which the proton carries but can only manifest
      itself when it is in presence of equal magnetic field force of
      another proton.<br>
      <br>
      [0508] Where in the presence of the stronger magnetic fields of
      the surrounding plasma which the two magnetic fields of the
      protons where existing, up on receiving the additional necessary
      energy from the magnetic field of plasma they can appear
      themselves as the heavier matter of neutron and an extra electron
      and some energy release.<br>
      <br>
      [0509] In fact the magnetic field of the plasma become the ground
      for the two hidden magnetic field of neutron and electron to
      absorb enough energy that they can balance each other out and
      manifest themselves as two new parts of the same element.<br>
      <br>
      [0510] The reality of this interaction is the same for larger
      molecular dark matters that exist in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0511] When they lose their magnetic field forces due to certain
      conditions in their universe, they regain part of their energy
      that they can disassociate from the other dark atom in their
      bound, so they become visible.<br>
      <br>
      [0512] This is how matters in the universe manifest themselves out
      of no where within a system where there has been nothing in the
      past.<br>
      <br>
      [0513] The ground which they appear as visible matter is very much
      like the seed of poppy flower, where seed in the ground and hidden
      for centuries. Then when an unknown effect changes in the ground
      they seed suddenly flower where there has been non before.<br>
      <br>
      [0514] Therefore the dark matter up on receiving the right
      condition to be able to receive enough energy or give enough
      energy or get demagnetised that two magnetic field forces of atoms
      of dark matter can disassociated from each other, then the
      invisible matter gain their individual magnetic field and appear
      always in atomic level and then molecular level.<br>
      <br>
      [0515] It is paramount to understand that these magnetic field
      forces are at the present beyond detection with present
      equipments.<br>
      <br>
      [0516] But through the development of the cold double magnetic
      field rector core these conditions can be replicated and detected,
      that this levels of creation of dark matter in atoms can be
      detected and replicated and atoms for the first time being able to
      be created through a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0517] These can de done for any atomic weight element known to
      man. That is to say if one could create a balance double magnetic
      molecule of the Iron, then the matter will be invisible until the
      time the external or internal magnetic field of the two atoms are
      changed, that they become able to attain their magnetic fields and
      due to their existing charged energy in their embedded sanctum
      create current due to rotation of charge particles that they
      become visible matter again.<br>
      <br>
      [0518] The half life decay is one way of dark matter creation, but
      this releases invisible magnetic energy which can be absorbed by
      the other matters in their vicinity or be embedded in the new
      matters which appear as part of the leveling down of the element.<br>
      <br>
      [0519] If this leveling down is followed through and element goes
      through lose of magnetic field due to interaction of the two
      matters with equal matching magnetic file then the matter will
      behave as the same as dark matter and becomes invisible.<br>
      <br>
      [0520] If this understood and utilised, then the theory of the
      Wormhole is not a dream or possibility , but it is absolute
      certainty.<br>
      <br>
      [0521] This technique of pushing the magnetic field out of the
      boundary of the system, and its interaction with the magnetic
      field of the planet, used in a way, that, the magnetosphere field
      of two cores, or magnetosphere field interaction of the system and
      the planet, can be confined to a pin point or a long line, then
      the system can be used in a similar way as the welding torch 1,
      where the heat at the magnetosphere will be hot enough that can
      cause melting of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0522] Therefore this can weld any two matter together, even in
      the molecular or atomic level 1, leading to manufacture of
      elements 1, not in a fusion method but the atomic welding level to
      create new molecules, where there will not be a need for huge
      fusion energies to cross the coulomb barriers as has been tried in
      the fusion reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0523] By this method of using magnetospheric condition all atomic
      boundaries at the highest electron levels away from the nuclease,
      in strong magnetic field in presence of heat , this will allow by
      injection of electrons or protons directly from the center of the
      Caroline core, to lead to interlocking of two atoms and the
      necessary demanded charge, this being positive (proton) or
      negative (electron) particle energy , to be incorporated and
      sheared between the two atoms to lead to welding of two atoms,
      without creation of heat as is expected in the fusion reactors of
      today.<br>
      <br>
      [0524] Therefore any two atoms and molecules can be welded
      together, where there is no need to start from hydrogen atom,
      where even two atoms of heaviest elements known to man can be
      welded, for it to create the dark matter of that element.<br>
      <br>
      [0525] This phenomenon if understood fully, will lead to creation
      of fuel for inter solar system travel, and especially the use of
      this technique will be useful for travel in inter galaxy space
      travel.<br>
      <br>
      [0526] Where each galaxy has its own gravitational field according
      to its main constituent ingredient element.<br>
      <br>
      [0527] Therefore to travel to a galaxy where the main constituent
      element is uranium, where in the Milky Way is hydrogen, then the
      welding method will allow the production of the double magnetic
      filed molecule of the uranium, which the gravity of the target
      galaxy will use this to pull the matter to itself, thus the system
      which has created the double magnetic uranium will be attracted in
      to the targeted galaxy through the principal of the dark matter,
      at speeds beyond the speed of light, and fraction of the earth
      minutes. This technology even simple to understand , it will take
      some years tom be mastered.<br>
      <br>
      [0528] The reason being is that the power and the knowledge of
      galaxial material constituent, is a mater that world of science
      has not come to understand, as of yet.<br>
      <br>
      [0529] The simple explanation for this is, the reason each galaxy
      shines with different light, is because of its main constituent
      material, therefore to reach the galaxy the system has to generate
      the dark mater or the double magnetic molecule of that mater that
      can be attracted to it.<br>
      <br>
      [0530] This is space travel without fuel and this is how dark
      matters are for ever in motion in the universe and they cove all
      dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Materials used for the cores</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0531] The material used for the physical body of the cores are
      all the materials in the periodic table, including their isotopes
      and mixtures with all other elements in the combination or resin,
      plastic, silicones, in the form of metallic, gases, gas mixture,
      vapour, vapour mixture, liquid, molten condition, frozen
      condition, radioactive materials in the form of past, spray, or
      liquid, or solid.<br>
      <br>
      [0532] The material used for the filling of all the cores (these
      being single, double or multiple core layers) are all the
      materials in the periodic table, including their isotopes and
      mixtures with all other elements in the combination or resin,
      plastic, silicones, in the form of metallic, gases, gas mixture,
      vapour, vapour mixture, liquid, molten condition, frozen
      condition, radioactive materials in the form of coated, spray, or
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0533] Radioactive materials used for the helium excitation can be
      all the radioactive materials in their natural state, or their
      isotopes, or material which are not radioactive but due to their
      relatively short half life will go through alpha or beta
      radioactive process to become stable, these being like potassium
      going through beta decay to become stable argon atom, is
      considered as source of radiation, which can be utilised to create
      scintillation. The combination of chemical reaction between two or
      material which can lead to release of extreme ultraviolet light
      which can be used to start the ionisation chain of process in the
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0534] Or the irradiation of the matter to cause laser beam that
      can cause scintillation or direct ionisation of the hydrogen or
      other gases that can lead to creation of single or double magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0535] Or use of microbe's technology that can create ionisation
      of hydrogen or other gases that can lead to creation of the heated
      core of any amount of heat that can lead to single magnetic field.
      These are considered as the material used in the reactor for its
      operation and its construction.<br>
      <br>
      [0536] The initial gases used for testing of the reactor are
      hydrogen and all the inert or ideal gases of the periodic table
      other materials which can lead to creation of the gases which can
      lead to creation of the heating and magnetic field in a system
      which is in rotation and in possession of turbulence in the any
      levels of vacuum condition<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gases used in the cores of the
        reactor--&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0537] Choice of fuel for the proto type reactor is not very
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      To chose gases one has to consider most of properties of the gases
      under varying pressures and temperatures and magnetic filed
      forces. As these gases will have different and varying
      characteristics due to conditions and parameters within both cores
      of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0538] For the operational condition all gases are considered to
      be under a vacuum, and centrifuge, rotation, compressive
      condition, in environment in possession of one or more magnetic
      fields and variable temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydrogen</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0539] This gas will take the central position of the gases in the
      hart of the Caroline core, this being due to its lowest atomic
      weight within a vacuum chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0540] This is the favourable gas for ionisation and heating of
      the plasma. This element can not create radiation above the
      extreme ultraviolet (EUV), therefore by low that the hydrogen can
      release more energy then it has absorbed and by going through
      energy lose, that hydrogen can not release energy higher then EUV
      which has received from the scintillated helium.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore there are no possibilities of radiation releasing higher
      then lower level energy EUV; therefore there is no possibility of
      radioactive contamination of the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0541] Hydrogen gas is used for production of the plasma in the
      center of the core, through ionisation and in conjunction with use
      of argon gas as catalyst for rapids heating.<br>
      <br>
      Where these ionised particle will give their energy up to the
      argon gas for the plasma to be heated, before return to their
      ground state level and trough vacuum and centrifuge back to the
      center of the chamber. The helium through the central column
      delivers where they can repeat the same with the next wave of the
      EUV rays.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Helium</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0542] This gas is used for verities of reasons in this reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0543] Helium liquid enters the Caroline core of the reactor
      through central column through separate borehole, after
      scintillation process, as deliver of the extreme ultraviolet
      source in to hydrogen gas level of this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0544] Helium gas is used as part of the Caroline core as catalyst
      for heating up of the core, as it can absorb the right energy from
      some of the ionised hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0545] The helium can be continually be pumped with right delay
      factor through the borehole at its gas layer in the caroline core,
      that it leaves the core and returns back as the scintillators and
      blackout of the chamber to repeat the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0546] Helium has cooling capability. Which this happens at
      pressures around 300 pisg. So when creating compression this
      factor becomes important. This could be used to the advantage for
      some systems operation mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0547] As this gas is chemically and biologically inert. It is
      non-combustible and non-radioactive as energies at about 27 eV
      will never enter the core to cause the ionisation of this matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0548] He in some operations could be used as coolant too.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neon</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0549] This is the cooling gas for the reactor chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0550] Liquid Neon can be used as the scintillation material
      instead of liquid helium.<br>
      <br>
      [0551] This is the best gas to chose, as there is little or no
      chance of neutron leakage from both cores.<br>
      This gas is used as insulator where the heat in the plasma needs
      to be maintained at high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0552] Where the body of the inner core has to be cooler then the
      outer chamber temperature, this gas is good for the outer or the
      last gas before the outer wall of the outer core of the reactor,
      where the temperature of this wall has to be at body temperature,
      like in cases where the reactor is used in the medical
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0553] Using neon as cooling gas this encourages convection within
      the material immediately below it.<br>
      <br>
      [0554] This gas has cooling capability of forty times better than
      He does. This is the cooling gas to be used in these types of
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Argon</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0555] The choices of using argon gas for this type of reactor are
      several folds.<br>
      <br>
      [0556] Under pressure or vacuum argon could be a good insulator.<br>
      <br>
      [0557] Argon gas is the perfect catalyst for extracting the energy
      from the ionised H and He in different mode of operation. Which
      this released energy is used to heat the plasma within the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0558] Argon acts as a good electron collector, where by placing
      of copper electrodes on the wall of the central column at this gas
      layer in the caroline core, these charges could be picked up from
      the Argon gas layer of the core, for the reactor to be used as the
      electric current source of supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0559] Argon can act as source of EUV/UV emitter catalyst during
      the operation of the core as it is polarised during the rotation
      and turbulence of the plasma at right temperatures and pressures
      in the Caroline core<br>
      <br>
      [0560] The recombination of hydrogen and helium in the chamber
      during the compression and expansion of ionisation of gases, when
      the Argon gas is under pressure and it is closely packed in its
      layer, by pressures created by the outer core magnetic field, this
      increases the conductivity properties of this gas, this further
      enhanced by the magnetic pressures of the inner core due to
      turbulences.<br>
      <br>
      [0561] Thus the circulation and the high conductivity of this gas
      in a magnetic filed and electrons field, which this gas operates
      in, this, creates further current flow within this layer of the
      cores material.<br>
      <br>
      [0562] This is similar to rotation of cooper wire of a rotor
      cutting through the magnetic lines in a generator that creates the
      flow of electric current. Where the rotating copper wires is
      replaced by the rotation of highly conductive Argon gas saturated
      by charged particles of ionised hydrogen and electrons arriving
      constantly from the center of the core internally outwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0563] Where the quantity of the electric power produces becomes a
      function of the speed of the rotation of argon gas. Then this can
      hold vice versa for the creation of the magnetic filed force too.<br>
      <br>
      [0564] Then the potency and importance of the choice of this gas
      layer will become apparent.<br>
      <br>
      [0565] An important factor that this gas will have in this reactor
      will be due to its ability to receive energy from electrons and
      ionised hydrogen gas, as they return to their ground state, or
      before they are absorbed by the copper pickup for the current out
      put of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0566] What is significant with positioning of this gas, is that
      due to positioning of neon gas in the core, which behaves as
      insulation in this layer of the caroline core, the neon gas being
      under pressure due to operation of the reactor and due to its
      volume ration in the core will become a heat barrier for the
      separating the heat generated in the hydrogen side away from the
      argon side of this gas layer causing the plasma to heat up.<br>
      <br>
      [0567] Neon plays the same roll in reveres and keeps the heat
      created in the argon layer away from the plasma in the center of
      the core too, up to a large extent.<br>
      <br>
      [0568] Therefore majority of the heat delivered to the argon layer
      will go up towards the inner core boundary, for it to be
      transferred to the outer core for its materials to be heated up,
      helping with input of heat in that core necessary for the
      convection of the matter needed for creation of current and
      magnetic field in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0569] Therefore the thickness of the neon layer as its volume
      ratio of the core will have direct effect on the performance of
      the core operation and the outcome of the power and gravity
      produced by the system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Krypton</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0570] This gas is primarily used in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0571] Krypton has a good insulating properties. Especially when
      it is used in vacuum in conjunction with magnetic and molecular
      forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0572] Krypton in the reactors are used where there is a weak
      possibility of low energy neutrons and gamma rays. This is a
      better choice of gas than xenon.<br>
      <br>
      [0573] Krypton has to be at lest the last gas in any reactor, as
      argon can never under any circumstances come in touch directly
      with body of the inner core. This being due to the fact that argon
      is the current carrier in the core.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Xenon</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0574] This is good as the last layer gas in the inner chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0575] Xenon by having a large absorption cross section is the
      best inert gas for the absorption of any neutron loose in the
      reactor core.<br>
      <br>
      [0576] This gas layer has to be monitored at all time for it's
      poisoning neutron effect, that hot spot of the material of the
      inner core due to this effect does not become a possibility.<br>
      <br>
      [0577] Xenon exhibits a highly non-liner behaviour of density
      against pressure. That is why it is better to have a layer of
      Krypton a head of this gas in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radon</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0578] This is one of the most important inert gases for this type
      of reactor operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0579] This gas will carry the element of scintillation of the
      helium gas, at this stage of patent this gas will not be used as
      part of the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extreme Ultraviolet</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0580] Availability and presence of extreme ultraviolet rays is
      one of the corner stones of the creation and maintenance of
      ionisation of hydrogen atoms, consequent leading to fusion, and
      creation of systems, stars and planets in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0581] In investigating the creation of stars and planets in
      cosmos, In the universe, the ionisation of hydrogen, passing
      through a point in the galaxy, has usually has taken place, where
      the hydrogen atom comes in contact with extreme ultraviolet rays.<br>
      <br>
      [0582] Which the energy absorbed by hydrogen atoms or molecules
      from extreme ultraviolet ray initiates the first stage ionisation
      of the hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0583] That this ionisation becomes the first stage for the
      creation of the heat in the plasma needed for start of fusion
      later on, in the core of a star, K. P Chang (the hydrogen
      ionisation in the interstellar medium), Mike Gaylard
      (Recombination line spectrum of hydrogen, Gene Smith astronomy, R.
      J Reynold and L. M. Haffer (Temperature variation and
      non-photoionization heating in the warm ionised medium of
      galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      [0584] Utilisation of the extreme ultraviolet, in any reactor, as
      a catalyse for the ionisation of the hydrogen, is one of the most
      important criterions in any system in possession of the
      gravitational field force.<br>
      <br>
      [0585] In the operation mode of a system, this will become
      assuring and controlling factor for the heat emission and
      stability of the chain of ionisation in the caroline core, as new
      irradiated helium molecule, or different method of delivering
      extreme ultraviolet rays in to the core, are feed into the core
      during continues operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0586] The principal to be able to generate heat in the core of
      the reactor, is to bring about all elements in a reactor, to play
      their part in time and collectively. Generation and presence of
      the extreme ultraviolet on its own in a reactor to ionise the
      hydrogen atoms is start of the process for creation of magnetic
      field leading to finally creation of gravitational forces in the
      center of a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0587] The presence of extreme ultraviolet ray within the hydrogen
      gas in the reactor core, collectively with presence of soft
      magnetic field, compression, turbulence and rotation in the
      vicinity of caroline core will grantee and determines the success
      of the ionisation and subsequent heat production and the other
      effects of a system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scintillation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0588] Scintillation is the most important, and its presence is
      the fundamental step in the creation of any process in the
      universe cycle of life.<br>
      <br>
      [0589] Without scintillation in a low density, low volume ration
      of atomic hydrogen environment of galaxies, the process of
      ionisation will not take place, that the rest of the chain of
      events for the creation of any system or galaxy can take is
      initiated.<br>
      <br>
      [0590] Scintillation is the ignition key for start of creation of
      any system in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0591] All inert gases in conjunction with different materials and
      conditions in the cores can be used for or as scintillation
      material in the core of the reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0592] The use of liquid helium and neon and other inert gases as
      scintillators is the essential ingredient of the operation of any
      system that needs to generate heat, power and gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0593] Helium and neon have no unstable naturally occurring
      isotopes, therefore any inherent radioactive backgrounds. That is
      why these are good source for creation of the extreme ultraviolet
      ray catalyst source needed for initial ionisation of hydrogen
      atoms to start the heating of gases and plasma in the caroline
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0594] In galaxies the ultraviolet photons from reminisce of the
      explosion of stars have sufficient energy to strip the electrons
      completely away from hydrogen atoms and ionised hydrogen atoms.
      When and if the atom of hydrogen absorbs a photon with wavelength
      of 912¬A .The atom is ionised with the extra energy going in to
      kinetic energy of the electron. This requires a photon energy
      greater then 13.6 eV or wavelength of 912 ¬A in the ultraviolet
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0595] Collision between electrons `thermalise" their energy, this
      energy heating the gas in the region to higher temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0596] Theoretical models of the installer cloud are providing new
      insights into the role of extreme ultraviolet rays and soft X-ray
      photoelectric heating, as well as thermal conductive interfaces,
      in explaining the observed high ratios of hydrogen HI at very low
      pressures. These indicating not the need for the use of ionised
      Hydrogen but natural hydrogen in the process of heating up a gas
      to Plasma State.<br>
      <br>
      [0597] At the present most considerations are given to use of
      ionised hydrogen and its relation with extreme ultraviolet rays
      emissions. Recent research and findings allows the endeavour to
      new territory of reverse state of condition. Where it has been
      observed in the galaxies that ground state hydrogen receiving
      energy photons in the extreme ultraviolet rays range would and is
      excited to be ionised. Then by returning to ground state through
      catalyses it can be used to release this energy to heat up the
      surrounding gas to heated Plasma State.<br>
      <br>
      [0598] This opening a new approach into development of systems
      where not ionised but natural hydrogen and atomic hydrogen can be
      used to generate energy and currents, by using extreme ultraviolet
      rays rather then ultraviolet rays s to create the ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0599] This new understanding allows low temperature operation and
      less energy input for the higher energy out put, allowing
      operation in the non-nuclear environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0600] These being due to the fact as natural hydrogen is used,
      there are no possibility of emission above extreme ultraviolet
      rays by the hydrogen atoms, as an atom can not emit more then it
      has absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      [0601] That is as the extreme ultraviolet rays energy absorbed by
      natural hydrogen atom, this atom to return to ground state can
      only release energies below extreme ultraviolet rays, at the same
      time releasing sufficient energy and free electrons that can be
      useful in a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0602] For this reason the need for new ignition system using
      extreme ultraviolet rays for hydrogen rather then ionisation by
      ultraviolet rays microwave can be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0603] By passing liquid helium over Alpha or Beta source to
      generate the extreme ultraviolet rays, Thorindike in late 1950th
      discovered liquid-helium scintillation.<br>
      <br>
      [0604] Stockton later showed the emission of very intense
      wavelength range in the extreme ultraviolet ray's spectrum is
      centered at about 80 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0605] Adams confirmed the transparency of liquid helium to its
      own scintillation light reason for the intensity of the photons.<br>
      <br>
      [0606] Scintillation of the liquid helium by can be achieved
      through use of Alpha or a beta radiation source, where the use of
      Alpha or Beta source excitation in liquid helium determines the
      density of the ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0607] Adams calculated that, energy deposited by Beta particles
      in super fluid helium are emitted promptly as extreme ultraviolet
      rays light, and is considered to be as much as 35% of total energy
      released by the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0608] The initial stage in the process of heating all the
      elements in the core of a reactor has to be the ionisation of
      atoms of hydrogen in the Caroline core by using extreme
      ultraviolet rays, carried by compressed liquid helium into the
      core, which has been exposed to radioactive source prior to entry
      in to the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0609] This method of ionisation of hydrogen atoms has been
      observed in the galaxies, therefore it should be easy to achieve
      the same in reactor environment under the right condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0610] The extreme ultraviolet rays in vacuum condition cause
      prompt and direct photoionization of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0611] Where as lower energy photon causes a combination of
      fragmentation and delay thermionic ionisation. Thus use of extreme
      ultraviolet ray is the fast and direct way to start the reactor
      from cold.<br>
      <br>
      [0612] The right choice of radioactive element for production of
      extreme ultraviolet rays in presence of liquid helium or neon is
      important. With the correct selection, the possibility that liquid
      helium will carry any gamma ray energy level radiation into the
      core of the reactor can totally be eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0613] Therefore the choice irradiation source for scintillation
      will have direct effect on different combination and the amount of
      gases used in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0614] Use of neutron traps facilities, in the outlet of
      irradiated chamber of the scintillation unit can make sure no
      neutrons can enter the caroline core, that can create high energy
      rays in the core, that can create radioactive chain of events of
      releasing X-rays or higher level energy rays with the interaction
      with other materials in the caroline core.<br>

      <br>
      [0615] Once 1000 k region temperatures of plasma in the reactor
      are achieved. If, strontium vapour is injected into the plasma!
      This has proven to lead to creation of extreme ultraviolet rays in
      conjunction with presence of the hydrogen and argon gas. This
      effect can be used to circulate the strontium in the chamber once
      the initial heating for energy production of about 700 C deg. in
      the center core plasma is achieved. Where there would be no need
      for the further continues injection of irradiated Helium through
      center column.<br>
      <br>
      [0616] Strontium in the presence of Argon gas and availability of
      hydrogen atoms or molecules behaves as catalyses. Which, will
      leads to the creation of extreme ultraviolet rays needed for the
      ionisation of Hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0617] Once the other hydrogen ions, which have given up their
      energy to argon, gas, on the way back to the hydrogen layer region
      of the core, due to vacuum principal and centrifuge at, hydrogen
      ions are energised by the extreme ultraviolet rays by going
      through the same process again, to create further heat.<br>

      [0618] The use of microwave or light bulbs and other systems for
      the creation of extreme ultraviolet ray needed for ionisation of
      hydrogen<br>
      <br>
      [0619] There are several different methods to create and initiate
      the creation of extreme ultraviolet rays necessary for the
      ionisation of the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [0620] These systems are like use of microwave cells, all types of
      glow discharge cell, pressurised gas cell using different
      radioactive materials, plasma torch cells and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0621] There are new and novel methods to create extreme
      ultraviolet rays being researched for the semi conductor industry,
      which these can be utilised as they become available in the near
      future.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Turbulence</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0622] In the universe, existence of turbulence in a region under
      the right condition is an essential factor to eventual creation of
      stars and fusion conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0623] Stars are born in turbulent interstellar clouds of
      hydrogen. Stars form by gravitational collapse of shock-compressed
      density fluctuation generated from turbulence in these clouds.<br>
      <br>
      [0624] Turbulent convection and dynamic action of the gas play a
      fundamental role in processes of transportation of energy, mixing,
      angular momentum, generation of magnetic fields and creation of
      condition for start of heating process.<br>
      <br>
      [0625] In computerised three-dimensional models of turbulent
      compressible convection, including effects of rotation and
      magnetic field in the reactor, turbulent motion mostly achieves
      the energy transport across the plasma needed for the creation of
      convection leading to thermoelectric current generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0626] Helioseismic inversion has shown that turbulence in
      conjunction with rotation can create high-speed rotation at
      equator and slower rotation at high latitude of the sphere of
      plasma within a spherical shape body.<br>
      <br>
      [0627] Where this rotation influences the thermodynamic mixing
      properties when turbulence is present within the plasma. The
      effect of turbulence compressible convection with rotation has
      shown a mean spiral flow with depth of the plasma. At the same
      time the mean helicity has a profile which is positive in the
      upper portion and negative in the lower of the plasma, a property
      bearing on magnetic dynamo process that may be realized within
      such rotating layers of turbulent convection of gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0628] This brings about the condition for the heat convection,
      essential for creation of thermoelectric condition necessary for
      the temperature gradient effect in producing the current to heat
      the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0629] In these bodies result shows remarkable increase in
      convection transport of energy in presences of turbulence within
      the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0630] This emphasizing that highly turbulent flows can possess
      transport properties. Encouraging and sustaining the production of
      cosmic type magnetic field forces within the plasma due to this
      type of convection in the core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0631] Due to spherical reactor core design, in this reactor the
      spherical confined space of the core does not allow creation of
      turbulence as in the TOKAMAK reactors, where the plasma is free to
      rotate and magnetic fields are enforced from outside of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0632] Therefore a new method of generating turbulence for the
      plasma in spherical reactor is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0633] The turbulence can only be introduced by means of a
      variation in the amount of the ionisation created in the center
      chamber. Where this itself is mainly controlled by the injection
      of irradiated liquid helium or delivery of the extreme ultraviolet
      rays by some other methods to the core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0634] Turbulence created through pulse ionisation of the
      hydrogen, through scintillation method, creates wave expansion of
      the gas, leading to creation of wave turbulence in the whole of
      the Caroline core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0635] With the capability to be able to heat the gases in the
      core, and due to closed confmement of the core, through heating of
      the gases, enforce compression on and within the gas molecules of
      the Caroline core chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0636] The inevitable collaboration between the turbulence and
      compression in the gases becomes an important part of the
      operation of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0637] Where this is necessary to create continues turbulence and
      compression variation to help with permanent convection within the
      reactor gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0638] Thus creating sequences of variation in compression allow
      the hydrogen molecules of the gas to come under such a regime is
      needed. Then through selected method of ionisation of the
      hydrogen, pulses of the turbulence could be released within the
      plasma needed for the successful system operation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rotation of the core</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0639] Recent scientific works has shown plasma in rotation, has
      sheared toroidal rotation, which peaks at the center of plasma.
      This in turn at high speed, at the center of the plasma causes
      reduction in the momentum of the plasma speed. Which, leads to
      dissipation of heat due to lose of momentum energy of the plasma.
      Which the heat created helps to heat the plasma inward out.<br>
      <br>
      [0640] At the same time the gases in the Caroline core need speed
      of rotation for the hydrogen to reach its required condition of
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0641] Where this is initially provided by a simple motor, and
      later the rotational will be dictated and controlled by the
      interaction of the magnetic field forces between the Caroline core
      and the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0642] The initial rotation of the inner core of the reactor is
      achieved through adjustable speed control standard motors. Where,
      high speeds of rotation initially are required for the center
      core. Then when desired condition is attained by the elements
      within the core. The speed of the core is reducing to more normal
      and much lower rotational speeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0643] These speeds are all determined by the purpose, which the
      system is developed for to perform.<br>
      <br>
      [0644] The Caroline core, as in centrifuge systems, has to operate
      in the vacuum condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0645] This system has the need for all the facilities of
      operation of gas and vacuum centrifuge.<br>
      <br>
      [0646] With the difference that cores for some specific purposes
      the cores have to be able to handle high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0647] So these points has to be taken into consideration when
      choosing the right motor for the development of a system rotation
      parameters<br>
      <br>
      [0648] The automatic rotation of the center core due to the
      interaction of the two magnetic fields will eliminates partially
      the use of the motor. Once this stage is reached. Where, according
      to the laws of physics, as it is observed in the center of the
      earth, where the inner core is continuously in rotation without
      use of a motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0649] Now through this system it could be understood for the
      first time why the inner core of the earth is always in rotational
      motion. The speed of the rotation of the inner core of all the
      planets is dictated by the strength of the magnetic fields and the
      materials, which creates both magnetic fields (the Caroline core
      and the outer core).<br>
      <br>
      [0650] Thus once a system is up and running to vary the
      gravitational force of the system, created by the interaction
      between the two magnetic field on the cores, in any direction
      negative or positive, only the speed of the rotation of the inner
      core needs to be increased or decreased.<br>
      <br>
      [0651] Where this can be achieved by simple controlling the rate
      of the ionisation of the hydrogen in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0652] At the same time, if a constant minimum gravitational speed
      is required, and only sudden increase and decrease in the
      gravitational force is needed, the only parameter that needs
      altering then would be the speed of the rotation of the physical
      body of the inner core, through intervention of the original
      motoring system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The magnetism and gravity of the
        system</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0653] To create sufficient heat by the hydrogen ionisation in the
      inner chamber. Where, part of this heat will be transferred to the
      outer chamber to start the convection process, which will lead to
      creation of the molecular magnetic field in the outer core, other
      factors in the operation of the cores needs to be taken into
      consideration. Where the principal behind creation of the rotation
      and gravitation and their control is the prime object behind the
      design of these types of reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0654] The double magnetic field phenomenon created between the
      two cores of the reactor, where interaction of these two magnetic
      fields up on each other as double molecular spherical magnetic
      phenomenon leads to creation of the gravity can be created by the
      reactor as it is done by all the planets in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0655] These two spherical magnetic fields will help to partially
      create inter acting molecularly magnetised environment, where they
      have been created through magnetised plasma, thermoelectric
      current, created by combination of convection and compression,
      rotation and extreme ultraviolet rays, driven across the caroline
      core, and through convection and electron temperature gradient,
      leading to creation of current and magnetic field across the outer
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0656] Where up on the interaction of these two magnetic forces on
      either side of the inner core, the gravitational strength of the
      whole system can be established and controlled<br>
      <br>
      [0657] In these rectors due to incorporation of appropriate
      systems, and careful choice of materials, generation of heat and
      its maintenance is first for the purpose of the creation of the
      magnetic field for the containment of the plasma and creation of
      convection in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0658] The rate of heat lose at the boundary of the core is only
      important when reactor is used for energy production. As the
      containment of the inner core is rotating and convection has been
      taken care of. This makes it possible to arrange for the core to
      operate at low temperatures, where temperatures in the region of
      below 1000K are sufficient for high power production systems<br>
      <br>
      [0659] The strength of the creation of the magnetic field in the
      outer core can be controlled by the amount of heat that is allowed
      to reach this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0660] The reduction in the heat transfers to the outer core, if
      necessary, will be done by using variation in the thickness of
      layers of inert gases in the Caroline core, before heat reaches
      the wall of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0661] Heat and neutron flux initiated by injection of
      scintillation material in to the core of the reactor, in these
      types of reactors, has to be controlled and reduced drastically
      and absorbed before reaching boundary walls of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0662] Otherwise for high temperature operation disciplines,
      temperatures and neutron fluxes will be so high that there are no
      known material at the present time that can stand such high
      temperatures and neutron absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0663] With these method of operation and for control of magnetic
      fields strength in these reactors, inert gases used in the
      caroline core and the outer core, are the tools of control of all
      parameters of the system, internally and without the use of
      separate or additional blanketing, moderating, and cooling
      materials outside the physical boundaries of outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0664] Handling such system for production of current, magnetism
      and gravity at high or low temperature operation mode needs a
      totally different concept and cooling technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0665] For example, for cooling system for the power production
      system condition has to be accommodated by use of right amount and
      ratio volume of all the gases in each core of the reactor, which
      has to be accommodated in the physical design of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0666] The appropriate method to cool core of fusion reactor needs
      new method of approach. As, there are no materials, which can
      stand high temperatures of this magnitude. The cooling has to be
      in the same form and utilise properties of all gases available
      including use of magnetic field containment.<br>
      <br>
      [0667] This new system of cooling needs process of multi-layer gas
      reactor. The bases for the development of this type of reactor
      cooling system is explained by the author in the paper titled "
      Saturn".<br>
      <br>
      [0668] This is multi-layer gas and magnetic containment with
      capability to allow high pressure cooling ionised gas to travel in
      between two magnetic fields technology, which is developed and
      will be discussed, in the latter papers.<br>
      <br>
      [0669] This is a highly advance level of fusion cooling system.
      Which present fusion technology has not concurred. A brief
      referral to this technology is explained in the creation of the
      rings of the Saturn paper.<br>
      <br>
      [0670] In fusion reactor high temperature operation mode will
      require technologies which are simple but needs for them has not
      come to light. If the development of these cooling systems are not
      addressed sooner or later. The China syndrome concept will occur
      in the present fusion reactor proto types. When they reach
      continues production. Here the only damage will be a molten
      reactor core and possibility no contamination.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cores of the system</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0671] This system will have and make use of every physical part
      not only for one purpose but may be for several different purposes
      at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      [0672] For energy production the ideal shape for the core is
      considered to be in the shape of hollow sphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0673] Cylindrical shape cores will near have the same outcome.
      The core can be made in any shape, physical practicality of
      ability to stand compression and rotation and the best strength to
      density ratio of the core will play an important factor in the
      shape of the core for any effects to be produced. Thus sphere
      shape is considered to be the best option.<br>
      <br>
      [0674] For gravitational system in a craft several cylindrical
      systems in conjunction with spherical or elliptical core needs to
      be used for the motion of an object.<br>
      <br>
      [0675] The use of multiple cylindrical or multiple spherical
      system in on craft eliminates the rapid use of one core and at the
      same time allows the system to maintain a constant gravitational
      force within its boundaries, while the other cores will allow the
      craft to be moved up or down, or to the side.<br>
      <br>
      [0676] Fancy shapes cores like elliptical for space technology
      will be explained in their appropriate disclosures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Caroline core of the reactor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0677] The physical dimension of the inner spherical core can be
      from few millimeters in diameters for medical use to several
      meters for power generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0678] The principal problem is how to fill large bodies with
      appropriate amount of gases that system operation is safe and
      could be in motion. Stars and planets carry cores like this, which
      have radiuses of several thousands of kilometres.<br>
      <br>
      [0679] The dimension of the core is determined by the purpose the
      core is to be used for.<br>
      <br>
      [0680] For practicality and simplicity a 50-cm radius spherical
      chamber is to be consider in this patent.<br>
      <br>
      [0681] What can be achieved in this size then can be replicated
      for any other size reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0682] The physical material for the reactor can be made of any
      combinations of elements and their alloys.<br>
      <br>
      [0683] The best material for uniformity of effect and rapid
      progress is ferrite, nickel, cadmium alloys or resins.<br>
      <br>
      [0684] This is the ideal material, if the core could be made with
      partially magnetic effect at the start of the operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0685] Even thou most of materials lose their atomic magnetic
      properties at above 400 C deg. temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0686] The material chosen for the body of the cores should not be
      able to interact chemically with the other layers of the gases and
      material inside the cores of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0687] Aluminium and its appropriate alloys for the construction
      of the core for medical and pure gravitational purposes are
      preferable due to their lightness and strength. Where the system
      for these types of use do not operate at high temperatures. Thus
      heat creation and dissipation will not be of much concern.<br>
      <br>
      [0688] It is important to realise that for the first time in this
      type of reactor gravity at cold temperatures could be achieved.
      This technology opens up a totally new horizon in technological.
      Where through the use of cold reactor system, gravities needed to
      travel in coldest part of galaxies can be made possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0689] Where, new elements can be fabricated inside the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0690] Through this new technology, system will allow manufacture
      of chemical gravitational computer like operation of human brain,
      without use of conductors and understanding of use of micron
      electric powers possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0691] For high power energy systems the silicon and silicon
      composites for high temperature operation and its different
      constituents (silicon carbides for 1000 C deg. operation) can be
      used. Where, high temperature resistant and long duration of
      operation is the main object of the use of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0692] Other material like Ferrite steels, Vanadium alloys 0.1-0.3
      carbon steel, fibber resins for cold reactors, Teflon mixture for
      metallic mixture of gas and metal vapour cores (similar to
      centrifuge system for U-235 enrichment) are the best options.
      According for what and under what condition the reactor is to
      operate under.<br>
      <br>
      [0693] The containment vessel of these reactors can be made of any
      of the elements known to man, plasma, gases, liquid, solid, even
      dark matter.<br>
      <br>
      One material becomes the container of the other depending up on
      its physical and its condition at that a specific points in a
      specific position.<br>
      <br>
      [0694] Containment vessel could be made of liquid for the mixture
      of the gases, where through the binding energy of the liquid the
      gas could be confined into that space.<br>
      <br>
      [0695] Containment vessel could be made of heavier atomic gas for
      the mixture of lighter atomic weight gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0696] Containment vessel of on metallic vapour could be the
      another heavier atomic vapour and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0697] The principal of the containment for the material for
      caroline core is that the material within the containment has to
      have the ability to be able to be heated that flow of current can
      be established, that magnetic field within this containment could
      be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0698] Therefore any material can be the containment vessel for
      the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0699] In very advanced systems any physical material containment
      will be to thick and will interfere with operation of the its
      system, so that the contaminate will be on energy levels rather
      than physical.<br>
      <br>
      [0700] The author has already completed technology for this type
      of use of the system, and these systems are possible to
      manufacture and sustain.<br>
      <br>
      [0701] This is the technology for the creation of matter in atomic
      level, where there is no tangible containment, and only energy
      containment possible and required.<br>
      <br>
      [0702] For physical reactor the core, the thickness of the wall of
      the core can be from several millimeters to several tens of
      centimeters. This depending on material to be used and the purpose
      the system is to be use for, and to the extent of vacuum, and
      pressure in the cores.<br>
      <br>
      [0703] These vacuum conditions being from a fraction of a few to
      Torr to 10&lt;-9&gt; Torr or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0704] The pressure condition in the cores could be from fraction,
      to several hundreds of atmospheric.<br>
      <br>
      [0705] For the purpose of the proto type vacume condition of up to
      10&lt;-7&gt; Torr is considered to adequate.<br>
      <br>
      [0706] At the same time it has to be realised that at high
      temperatures of operation, Shock pressure due to expansion of
      gases and Hydrogen shockwaves due to the feed of helium in to the
      core, will play an important part in the choice of the material
      for the material of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      [0707] In some cases the inside of the core could be coated with
      method of chemical vapour deposition technique for abortion of
      these shocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0708] The best material for this purpose is the diamond coating;
      the diamond is grown as a thin film on the surface of the core,
      during finishing stage of production. This coating can give higher
      strength, extreme hardness and high resistance to thermal shocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0709] At the same time if diamond powder is mixed in the
      components of the elements of the core physical construction, that
      can be mixed with nickel or cobalt and iron as steel. This can
      produce a highly thermal conductive, strong and magnetic material
      good for gravitational producing system. Where continues change of
      gravitational field and a strong current source is expected of the
      system. This is a good material for space application of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0710] Both cores could be made of the same material. The choice
      of the material for cores is dependent up on the purpose that the
      reactor is to be used for.<br>
      <br>
      [0711] Xenon poisoning as seen in chernovel reactor disaster is an
      important factor in the operation and the material choice for both
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0712] The increase in the neutron level in this layer and its
      less than ten hours release decay can create molecular shifting
      and effect the cores choice of material.<br>
      <br>
      [0713] Copper coating for all parts of the inner side of the
      chamber is and could be beneficial. As copper is one of a few
      materials, which does not interact with any of the inert gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0714] This material can have disadvantages if oxygen through gas
      inlets leaks into the chamber and for example interact with the
      Hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0715] This can have different effects at different temperatures
      and compressions in the core. Then creating matters like water and
      so on in the chamber. Which can have undesired effect in the
      system and the operation mode of the whole system.<br>
      <br>
      [0716] When Nickel or/and Boron is used in the steel composition
      without any coating. This can be done for example for partial
      mixture of the center column material. Where some of the neutrons
      and /alpha particles can react with this material. Under some
      controlled condition, where 3 nm deliberate pores are created on
      the steel surface of the material in this section, much like
      volcanic sponge material, the interaction of the neutrons and
      alpha particle with the steel can lead to production of helium.<br>
      <br>
      [0717] The production of Helium through this method can make the
      system a self-sufficient system for some applications where argon
      is irradiated by means of stratum at high temperatures of
      operation, where the helium will act as the scintillation material
      to ionise the hydrogen fuel. The choice of this steel as the
      material for the reactor core is very much dependent on the
      pressure and temperature of the operation of the core<br>
      <br>
      [0718] If this material is used for the core of the reactor and
      behaviour of the hydrogen and helium are closely monitored, and
      confined to a specific pre-determined part of the central column,
      the interaction of neutrons and alpha particles in this type of
      material lead to hydrogen and helium embritllment. This is serious
      and can be dangerous and fatal for the containment and central
      core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0719] The embritllment condition in these reactors (due to large
      quantity of the gases in the cores) due to porosity capability of
      Hydrogen and Helium is always appoint to be consider. This usually
      happens through dislocation of molecules and collection of these
      gases within the molecular structure or any un- noticed pores
      within the lattices of molecules of the material of the
      containment.<br>
      <br>
      [0720] Specifically, these crevasses are dangerous at the point of
      the interface connection by welding or cold screwing of the two
      parts like between the center column and the core, if such
      connection of two parts is considered in the manufacture of the
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0721] This is why, it is more favourable that the core and the
      center column are caste or poured in one process of cast at one
      time, rather than these to be made of different parts and then
      welded together. Any crevasse in the material increases the
      chances of the embritllment.<br>
      <br>
      [0722] The thickness of the inner core for the prototype reactor
      for safety reason is considered to be about 7.5 centimeters, as
      this core due to its size will have large volume, but the
      pressures at full testing operation mode could reach up to sixty
      atmospherics.<br>
      <br>
      [0723] The mass to volume ratio of the core consideration plays
      and important part at the start up condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0724] At the same time the reactor is in vacume condition of
      about 10&lt;-7&gt; Torr.<br>
      <br>
      [0725] It has to be noted that in having several different
      materials in this core of the reactor, these being plasma, gases,
      liquid or even solid, for different mode of operation, that there
      will be a differential rotation in the convective regions of the
      core, where, there will be uniform rotation in the radiative
      region of the elements of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      [0726] The choice of all gases core makes the creation of magnetic
      field and uniform rotation in each layer of gases much easier to
      achieve, where the reactor is in principal, in the caroline core
      will operate under radiative more than convective principals.<br>
      <br>
      [0727] Where rotative convective in a full spherical shell can
      achieve better and a more turbulent parameter regimes in the outer
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0728] The transition zone between differentially rotating
      convection zone and nearly uniform radiative zone known as the
      Tachocline, prevails in the all gas reactor cores, where one gas
      of lighter atomic weight with its own uniform rotation speed come
      in contact with the gas of heavier atomic weight which has its own
      uniform rotational speed, but the two speeds due to their atomic
      weight posses different rotational speeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0729] The zonal shear flow between the two layers of gases, where
      one layer with higher atomic weight rotates slightly slower then
      the gas layer with lower atomic weight, will have effect on the
      current and the creation of the magnetic field forces within the
      caroline core and the outer cores of a system.<br>
      <br>
      [0730] Where in between zonal region s of two different gases,
      small regions of tightly packed vortexes could establish
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      [0731] Which these can lead to creation of separate but minute
      miniature magnetic fields in these vortexes, where very small
      magnetic tight fields with high helicity strength could establish
      them selves in these vortexes.<br>
      <br>
      [0732] Where, if these collectively take over the rector core,
      then double magnetic field will become triple magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0733] In some cases if the third vortex magnetic field are
      allowed to interact inside the caroline core, then the black hole
      condition will appear 1, and the materials in the core will be
      displaced and rector can run out of control, or even shutdown.<br>
      <br>
      [0734] Using this method of vortex magnetic creation will allow
      the study of creation and behaviour of the black hole in the
      galaxies 1, and the way they can be used for certain
      transportation of elements in space.<br>
      <br>
      [0735] The technique of creation of alternating current using the
      physical body of the inner core is an additional fringed benefit
      from the system at the full operation mode 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0736] This is a technique well used in the creation of current in
      the power generators, where the copper wire in rotation within
      magnetic field creates electric current.<br>
      <br>
      [0737] This can be achieved in the same way, where the electric
      current is picked up in the southern hemisphere of the core, and
      then the wires are passed internally to the northern hemisphere of
      the reactor for collection by pickup brushes, or even the current
      picked up in the northern hemisphere could be wounded through
      wires before delivered to the electric brushes out side the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0738] By this method the copper wires within the parameters of
      the inner core body will create further alternative current
      separate on top of the direct current of the cores, through the
      principal of rotation of the wire in the magnetic fields created
      by one core or the two cores of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0739] Therefore the system can create alternative and direct
      current superimposed on top of each other 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0740] By this method, the output from this wiring could be used
      for the running of the whole system like the motor and the gas
      liquid production system, pumps and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The outer core</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0741] This is the second and an important section of the whole
      design of this reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0742] The section immediately superimposed over and encapsulates
      fully the Caroline core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0743] All steps taken in the caroline core to ionise the hydrogen
      to generate heat in the that core is all carried out so the
      elements in this outer core could receive heat internally from the
      caroline core, so by dissipating heat through convection, to the
      outer side of this core boundary, the material in this core could
      create due to the circulation of the charged particle in this
      core, so that current could be created in this core, then by the
      help of the rotational motion of the inner core, magnetic field
      could for this core could be established.<br>
      <br>
      [0744] Through this new method creating a soft magnetic field in
      the outer core, and by being able to extending the strength of
      this field to the plasma core region of the caroline core, this
      plasma could be confined and condensed, so for example fusion in
      this core could be initiated.<br>
      <br>
      [0745] Where the magnetic confinement of the plasma, created by
      the outer core, will be fully spherical that can squeeze the
      plasma in the center of Caroline core to any size diameter that
      needed. It can be seen that, for example, fusion can be achieved
      within the Caroline core of any reactor just for few pennies and
      in several minutes. Which can last for eternity.<br>
      <br>
      [0746] Where, if need be the size of the plasma in the caroline
      core can gradually be increased to any size that needed to be, and
      for the purpose that the fusion plasma was initiated and developed
      in the first place in the core of the reactor, this being for
      energy production, or for material production, or being for long
      rang energy magnetic weapon technology delivery of high magnetic
      force ejection in the invisible rang, for the defence of a craft
      at speed several times faster then speed of sound, where
      conventional weapons, even laser technology are in practical and
      too slow, for high speed motion in deep space travel.<br>
      <br>
      [0747] But at the same time due to over whelming strength of the
      outer core over the inner core, if chosen by the operator of the
      system, the heating of the plasma in the caroline core can be
      speeded up, as the magnetospheric interface of the caroline core
      and the outer core could be moved to be in the plasma region of
      the core. Where the interaction of two fields in conjunction with
      motion of the heated charged plasma will create an additional
      further heating and current in the body of the plasma in the
      center of the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0748] This is the power of this outer core; this is the
      versatility and flexibility of the power of this outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0749] This is the technology which fusion nuclear scientist are
      and have been looking for in the TOKAMAK system, but they have
      never had, and through this technology has become possible for the
      first time and for few euros. This is where the scientist in the
      fusion industry are injecting vast amount of current in the
      magnetic coils around the TOKAMAK cores to confine the plasma,
      where through this outer core of this reactor and this technology
      the same powers could be achieved very simply, the same as it has
      happened in the stars for billions of years<br>
      <br>
      [0750] So the method of the magnetic confinement of plasma 1 and
      creation of fusion plasma 1, production of new material due to
      high temperature operation through fusion 1, high energy plasma
      space weapon technology 1, creation and maintenance of fusion
      reactor 1, magnetic blanketing 1, these are all some of the part
      of this patent application of this new technology, and just
      because of the development of this outer core, there are more to
      be pointed out.<br>
      <br>
      [0751] The reverse of the production of the magnetic field holds
      true for the outer core too. This is where the strength of the
      magnetic filed forces of the Caroline core is more powerful then
      the magnetic field of the outer core. That is when the magnetic
      field force of the system will be super passing the boundary of
      the reactor core, and as there are two magnetic fields in
      operation within the core, these two have to have an interface,
      where this inter face will be outside the boundary of the reactor
      as a whole 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0752] There are several uses for this mode of operation, one is
      that if the magnetic field of the outer core can not match the
      magnetic field of the caroline core, then the magnetic field of
      the caroline core will pass the boundary of the system. Then this
      magnetic field has to interact with the magnetic field outside the
      physical parameters of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0753] If the system is within an atmospheric conditions, like
      earth, then this magnetic filed creates, magnetospheric boundary
      interaction zone of itself, between itself and the magnetic field
      forces of the planet. This is very much like the atmosphere around
      the earth, but in this case the magnetosphere field is created
      around the system following the interaction between the planet and
      the system magnetic fields up on each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0754] Then if the magnetic field of the caroline core is
      strengthen further, through the operation of the ionisation of
      hydrogen, that can react with charge particles of the atmosphere
      which is within, then this will create a glow, due to the
      principal motion of charge particle within the magnetic field,
      very much like florescent tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0755] That is why crafts using this magnetic technology always
      look like a bright light and shine like a silver ball or a silver
      dish. This is light is an outcome of a natural phenomenon which is
      just been explained. Therefore the system is a small scale can
      become a source for natural lighting to be used as a light bulb 1,
      flood light 1, Or natural sun light for green houses 1, where this
      lighting will be as natural as the light and the heat of the sun
      in possession of all its natural nourishment for needed growth 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0756] If then, the power of the Caroline core is further
      increased the interface between the system and the atmosphere
      around it can be pushed further away from the immediate boundary
      of the system, this giving the system a shielding effect 1, where
      the physical body of the system can be keep away from the heat of
      the two magnetic field interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0757] At the same time because the magnetic field from the
      caroline core is always in rotational mode, this will gives the
      system a impenetrable revolving magnetic field effect, or a
      rotating magnetic field shielding 1, This very much like one
      trying to jump into a fast revolving door, penetration is
      impossible.<br>
      <br>
      [0758] The system in this mode due to creation of revolving
      magnetic field of the internal core of the system, will reconnect
      with any wavelength and strength magnetic field which comes in its
      path, therefore the system will absorbed, any radio or other
      magnetic energies waves, through the magnetic reconnection
      principal, which comes in touch with this magnetic field of the
      system, consequently the system in possession of these types of
      rector will become invisible to present radar tracing facilities
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [0759] Thus if this principal is used in craft, first of all the
      craft will be shining, the craft will have no air resistance due
      to the distend magnetosphere it has created with atmospheric
      environment around it 1, so the craft can travel at much higher
      speed in an atmospheric condition, with literally zero air
      resistance, as magnetic shielding created by magnetosphere of the
      craft will not have the same resistance and friction force which
      can be exerted on a similar size solid body, like an aircraft with
      jet engine, the system is invisible to radar, so the magnetic
      field shielding will have satellite effect 1,<br>
      <br>
      [0760] The system will create its own magnetic shielding, and
      through creation of this shielding, the system can create its own
      atmospheric condition 1, within its magnetic shielding boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [0761] That so for example by travelling to let say moon, the
      craft can extend its magnetic filed shielding and create the
      appropriate gravitational field force, then its inhabitants do not
      need space clothing, and can walk and leave under condition of
      earth magnetic field force level, fully protected by magnetic
      field shielding and be protected from outer space debris and from
      all radiation hazards.<br>
      <br>
      [0762] Therefore the system can be used for radiation protection
      in any environment 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0763] If then a double outer core system that can posses magnetic
      field, that can create an outer second magnetosphere on top of the
      first magnetosphere, created between the caroline core and the
      first outer core, with the difference that this seconded
      superimposed magnetosphere will be rotating in the opposite
      direction to the first magnetosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0764] Then due to the principal of two non equal magnetic filed
      forces and which are two in rotation on top of each other in
      opposite direction to each other, under no circumstances the
      system inside these two magnetospheres could be bridged by any
      object which is outside the double superimposed spherical
      magnetospheres 1<br>
      <br>
      [0765] This is a total magnetic protection system, and is useful
      in case of entry in to atmospheric conditions, or when in space
      going through region where there is a environment in the galaxy,
      where there is cloud of small or large meteoroids or space dust,
      that the system becomes impenetrable and fully protected. This is
      the double shield system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0766] This system is useful for submerging in oceans, where the
      depth becomes irrelevant, or entering planet atmosphere that has a
      liquid environment on its outer surface. This is the submarine
      technology of this system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0767] This type of layering has been explain in the paper by the
      author titled SATURN.<br>
      <br>
      [0768] Now the beauties of this patent is a little by little
      becomes apparent, and all of this because of the understanding and
      creation of the second magnetic field in the outer core of a
      simple system.<br>
      <br>
      [0769] The interaction of two magnetic fields inside the reactor
      core, in presence of the charge particles, not only creates heat
      in the core of the reactor, but at the same time the inside of the
      core is always highly bright and in possession of all the sub
      extreme ultraviolet rays, which are beneficial to the inhabitant
      of the users of the system around the reactor 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0770] Therefore this system when used and manufactured in an
      appropriate way, like where the body of the cores is made to be
      transparent 1, the safe rays created inside the core of the
      reactor could be allowed to pass the boundary of the core, not
      only to light the environment around the core, but at the same
      time deliver all types of radiations necessary for natural and
      atmospheric condition for human bodies survival in open space,
      where there are no natural sun lights.<br>
      <br>
      [0771] In reality one will have the full colours of the rainbow at
      all time inside the system. The multi colouring lighting system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0772] Therefore the system can be used for lighting vast areas as
      a lamp, the system can be used for a clean or decontamination
      environment 1, and system can be used for cell growth or plant
      growth when is used for artificial but real sun system with all
      its benefits.<br>
      <br>
      [0773] The flow or circulation of material, being liquid, gas,
      plasma or a mixture of two or more of these elements, in the outer
      core needs to carry not only heat away from the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0774] For this the boundaries or the wall of the outer core, away
      from the inner core, has to be kept at lower or cooler
      temperatures enough on continues bases, that the circulation
      necessary for the convection could be maintain within the outer
      core. This could be achieved very simple by several methods, and
      for this purpose several different materials in the out core could
      be utilised.<br>
      <br>
      [0775] One method is the use of metallic material that reaches the
      condition of molten liquid state at low temperatures. Like
      Mercury, which is hazardous and poisonous, where not only it can
      remove heat but also due to its atomic metallic structure, this
      facilitates the creation of current in this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0776] For this part semi- metallic materials are considered as
      practical solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0777] The new liquid metals are best candidates for this part if
      they could hold their properties within a magnetic field and high
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0778] The best materials for this core are, gases impregnated
      with metallic vapour, like the ones used for uranium and plutonium
      gas centrifuge.<br>
      <br>
      [0779] These need a third chambers cooling system filled with neon
      gas that acts as a coolant. The neon gas is continually pumped
      around the whole containment, and xenon forth-outer containment
      for the absorption of the neutrons lost in the process by the
      heavy gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0780] The neon gas has two functions in this part. One is that
      neon has an excellent coolant property. Neon is forty times better
      than argon as coolant.<br>
      <br>
      [0781] Neon gas has no isotope, therefore no possibility of
      radiation contamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0782] The outer core normally needs only two inlet portholes,
      which could be accommodated next to the central column, or could
      be built as part of the central column channels 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0783] Or this core can have its own independent access with out
      going through the central column 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0784] The other possibility is the independent access and reveres
      feed line through the central column for deep space technology,
      where the hydrogen needs to be feed back to the caroline core 1<br>
      <br>
      [0785] Or where the CO2 gas needs to be treated, then the hydrogen
      ions from the caroline core are feed into the outer core, where
      the hydrogen will pick the oxygen from the gas, making pure water
      1, and will leave pure carbon on the outer side of the inner
      core's surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0786] If this core is made to be in centrifuge condition, then
      the carbon can be heated through the heat from the caroline core,
      that this carbon can be made into one hundred percent pure atoms
      of diamond 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0787] This technique is simple, But the vacume condition and
      pressurisation of the outer core has to be monitored and created
      through gas disposition, so atoms of carbon bind in inline and
      perfect symmetrical manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0788] If this process is controlled, fully, the creation of C 60
      1, is very simply achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0789] This is the CO2 cleanup system 1, is used for plants, where
      this gas needed to be naturalised before matters by products like
      water 1, can be released in to atmosphere, which this gas has been
      the cause of green house effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0790] Portholes in the outer core are there to facilitate the
      feed and withdrawal of gases and elements or any other process
      that elements in this part have to perform to create the outer
      magnetic force filed of the reactor for specific discipline.<br>
      <br>
      [0791] The material for the filling for the prototype's outer core
      is best thought to be a metallic matter like sodium (or potassium
      or calcium or magnesium).<br>
      <br>
      [0792] Sodium is used extensively in advanced gas cooled reactor
      for its cooling properties, and large amount of data's for its
      properties are available.<br>
      <br>
      [0793] Although highly interactive with water and dangerous, in
      this reactor core where it is sealed containment design, at low
      pressures, there are no chances of interaction. Which make sodium
      an ideal material in this core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0794] In warm interstellar medium containing ionised hydrogen,
      sodium mixture is very common. Sodium and potassium are always
      detected in the vicinity of the hydrogen atoms in the warm
      interstellar medium<br>
      <br>
      [0795] Sodium in these parts is the catalyst for initial magnetic
      creation condition for the creation and the maintenance of the
      plasma and then the creation of the second magnetic field in the
      inner core of planets.<br>
      <br>
      [0796] Where sodium will not interact with the ionised hydrogen
      but it will allow it to behave as a charged proton, and due to its
      charge and its motion within the sodium environment, where sodium
      has a metallic characteristics and properties, due to physics
      principal of the motion of charged particle within a metallic
      environment, leads to creation of the current the subsequent
      production of magnetic field in this environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0797] Even though these fields are weak enough not to disturb the
      balance of the system. But they are strong enough to release the
      energy to the sodium for it to be in motion due to a larger
      convection system that the magnetic field and the current in the
      interstellar medium can be initiated and to be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0798] This phenomenon in this reactor is utilised in the outer
      core for the proposes of creation of charged medium in possession
      of convection capability, but without ability to interact or
      absorb the ionised matter as sodium is a stable energy metallic
      matter 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0799] In the interstellar mediums the concentration of ionised
      atomic hydrogen is in the region of 1-10 atoms per centimetre
      cube. At the ratio of 100-1000 ionised hydrogen atoms per
      centimetre cube then if any hydrogen molecules introduced, then
      new parameters will come into play.<br>
      <br>
      [0800] In this reactor using the central column (see the next
      topic) of the caroline core, that facilitated the withdrawal of
      the positively charged plasma from the caroline core, this
      allowing feed of protons from the plasma through special borehole
      directly from the caroline core into the outer core into sodium 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0801] This allows the sodium to warm up in the first instance if
      need be.<br>
      <br>
      [0802] As positive charges of the ionised plasma are introduced in
      to sodium section by this replacement enrichment method, where the
      protons will act as charge particles in the liquid or vapour of
      sodium in the outer core, helping with motion of the charge
      particle for the creation and maintaining of the current in this
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0803] But at the same time this allows the interaction and the
      absorption of an electron from sodium by ionised hydrogen, after
      ion of hydrogen releasing its energy to the sodium atoms, for the
      ionised hydrogen to attract one electron from sodium outer orbit,
      this leading to creation of hydrogen gas in the outer core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0804] Where, this atomic hydrogen gas can be feed back to the
      inner core as the fuel for further ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0805] Thus causing the fundamental replication of the convection
      method, as it is assumed to be creating the current in the outer
      core of the earth through convection.<br>
      <br>
      [0806] Then this current in conjunction with the motion of the
      inner core will lead to the creation of the second magnetic field
      on the outside of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0807] Therefore understanding the method of the replication of
      the second magnetic field force on the outer side of the inner
      core, as it happens in the outer core in the center of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0808] Where it was shown in the previous chapter, how to create
      the magnetic field in the Caroline core, and now it is shown how
      to create magnetic field in the outer core of this reactor,
      totally independent of each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0809] This showing how two magnetic field forces can be created,
      which are both spherical and can be made and controlled
      independently, separated by a physical boundary of the inner core
      in a reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0810] Now it has proven that such a phenomenon in the center of
      the planet can exist, where the center of planet possesses two
      independent, reconnected magnetic fields forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0811] Which the interaction of these two magnetic fields up on
      each other in molecular state leads to creation of double magnetic
      field force effect, which spans the combined strength of these two
      magnetic field forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0812] Where the combined attraction fields forces of these two
      magnetic field at atomic and molecular level, causes the creation
      of the gravitational field forces of the planet or a system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0813] The molecular magnetic field strength of the cores is
      dependent of the materials within these two core of the inner
      cores of each planet, which the volume ratio, density,
      positioning, and speed of the motion of these material within
      their respective position within each core determine the molecular
      magnetic strength of that planet, and by low of atomic mass
      centrifuge principal, due to rotational motion of the planet, in
      determining what elements in its solar system, the planet is going
      to hold on to for it position with the given combined internal
      magnetic field force of its core.<br>
      <br>
      [0814] That is why now it should be clear why the shape and the
      positioning of magnetosphere of planets are important, as now it
      should be recognised that the magnetic field created by the two
      cores of the planet decides the shape and the strength of the
      magnetosphere of the planet, and respectively, the magnetic field
      strength of the two cores of the planet are totally dependent on
      the composition of the materials inside the two core of the
      planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0815] When two magnetic field interact with each other, as much
      as magnetic field force goes out of the system, for the purposes
      of magnetic reconnection, the same has to come into the system to
      close the loop.<br>
      <br>
      [0816] As for planets like earth, what goes out as magnetic field
      force, it shows itself as the magnetosphere of the planet with
      interacting with the suns magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0817] As to close the loop, for magnetic field force which comes
      back to the earth in interacting with the magnetic field of the
      all elements including magnetic field of atoms and the rest in
      possession of their own magnetic field, this shows itself as the
      gravitational force of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0818] Where this closing loop for the pulling strength of the
      planet, as its magnetosphere equivalent, becomes its attraction
      power, or what is called the gravity of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0819] As the same as magnetic field with solid magnet, the
      strength of the pulling of the poles of a magnet are dependent up
      on the possession of the matter from the magnet. Where the
      distance of the attraction and pulling of magnet is inversely
      proportion to the distance of the object from the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0820] This principal holds the same for the molecular magnetic
      field strength of the planets too.<br>
      <br>
      [0821] Therefore as the planet has already filled its magnetic
      field strength of its pulling matters, with materials, which have
      already cover up to its tangible physical surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0822] Therefore any elements, these being gas, liquid, human
      being or what ever, beyond the point of it tangible boundary, the
      planet has enough strength to attract them to by its magnetic
      field, but it can not entrap them. So object on the surface of
      planet is on the last frontier of the maximum strength of this
      attraction power of the planet. Where it is fare enough not to be
      attached to it but near enough that the magnetic field strength of
      the planet can have a hold on to.<br>
      <br>
      [0823] This is what is called the gravitational force field of the
      planet. As the surface of the planet is its last physical magnetic
      frontier of its pulling strength, then from there on every little
      positioning away from its center of the magnetic field counts very
      much.<br>
      <br>
      [0824] If this phenomenon understood, then to move away from a
      position away from the center of the magnetic field of the planet,
      one does not need to push itself away buy burring jet fuel, where
      when the fuel runs out to overcome this magnetic field, one is
      pulled back by the magnetic field force of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0825] Understanding this phenomenon, and being able now to create
      a system that can create its own molecular magnetic field 1,
      therefore it must be understood to be easy to move within these
      kinds of environments without using jet engines and rocket fuel to
      pull away and then be pulled back when the fuel runs out.<br>
      <br>
      [0826] Now that this principal is understood, and the technology
      through the design of this reactor is proven and can easily be
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0827] Therefore all the reactor of the system needs to do, is to
      imitate the magnetic field strength of the planet at it position
      where it is to float in that level, and then add to its magnetic
      fields strength that can be attracted to get closer to the inner
      core 1, or in the other words to the surface of the planet, or
      reduce its magnetic field strength that it can be pushed away by
      the magnetic field of the planet 1, to where the magnetic field is
      as weak as matching the magnetic field of the planet at that
      level.<br>
      <br>
      [0828] Then to go a distance away on the surface of the planet,
      the reactor magnetic strength needs to be altered gradually but
      fast enough that the object will move in time in slight slop up or
      down to cover the small curvature of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0829] For flight on a straight line of motion in these type of
      gravitational reactor within a spherical atmosphere like earth
      needs a little more advance knowledge, which will be explained in
      due course.<br>
      <br>
      [0830] This is one off the most hazardous moves for the whole
      system is, if the system is to fly vertically up, in a straight
      line. This is recopy for destruction of the system, and a foul
      will ever try to attempt to do such stunt, if one could understand
      the principal of magnetic connection of the poles of spherical
      magnet, and secondly the stress which will be put on the system
      due to interaction of the two magnetosphere of two fields of the
      planet which is dimensioning (the planet) and a one which is
      increasing or is very high (the system).<br>
      <br>
      [0831] This is possible, but the system will have near zero
      percent chance of survival. Specially if the system is not
      controlled and the system pushes itself due to rapid motion of the
      system, to come in the region where the system magnetic field, due
      to sudden vertical motion, becomes directly out off the planet
      magnetic field force, and it has to be faced with the full mighty
      power of the magnetic field of the star of the system, like in the
      regions beyond the magnetic interface of the earth with the sun on
      the magnetopause or bow shock region in the open space. This
      action is exactly like jumping off from top of Eiffel tower with
      no parachute.<br>
      <br>
      [0832] The gravitational field force of a planet can be replicated
      within the reactor, which will possess gravitational field force
      which can be controlled, due to the ability to be able to control
      the interaction in between the two independent magnetic fields in
      caroline core and in the outer core independently.<br>
      <br>
      [0833] This is the system in possession of gravitational force
      field, that its strength is unlike planets which is set for their
      lives, due to adjustment and control of its parameters and thought
      operation of the reactor, they can varied, and controllable
      magnetic fields matching the environment which the system operates
      in could be produced in the center of the reactor of the system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0834] So there you have it, your flight without a wing and
      without jet propulsion, and on the sound physical principals.<br>
      <br>
      [0835] Atoms of sodium (Na) are larger, and so more reactive,
      Similarly; atoms of potassium (K) are larger, and so more
      reactive, than atoms of sodium. It follows that elements below
      potassium in the periodic table should be more reactive than
      potassium. Rubidium is more reactive than potassium and caesium is
      even more reactive than rubidium.<br>
      <br>
      [0836] Sodium reacts by losing a single electron. Magnesium reacts
      by losing two electrons. Aluminium reacts by losing three
      electrons. Losing each electron requires some energy to be put in,
      so it is easier for sodium to react than magnesium, and easier for
      magnesium to react than aluminium.<br>
      <br>
      [0837] This method of replacement charges from the inner core
      plasma is one of the corner stones of the second magnetic fields
      creation and control 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0838] Where the outer core could be feed through the inner core
      from pressurised gases like krypton layer to increase the pressure
      in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0839] At the same time allowing the material to be kept under
      control in the outer core. This could be carried up to point and
      pressures, which needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0840] The plasma is feed through a different direction from the
      center core into the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [0841] The outer core could be used for the current production,
      this is made possible due to the fact, that if electric contacts
      are positioned in this section of the core 1, these will pick up
      any loose electrons which come available in this section, due to
      convection and interaction of the plasma which is fed through the
      inner core and the materials in the this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0842] The other method of impregnation, is by gases impregnated
      1, with charged particles could be used, where the gases through
      charges pickup from the rotation of the wires embedded in the body
      of the inner core could supply circulation in the gases of this
      core, that again through motion of charged particle within a
      metallic gas, current could be created in this core, that with
      interaction with the rotation of the inner core, magnetic field of
      the outer core could be created, that the gravitational field
      could be established in the center of the reactor<br>
      <br>
      [0843] In being able to compress the plasma in the core of the
      reactor, by using the magnetic field of the outer core and
      Caroline core, under the right temperatures and pressures, the
      state of the matter in the plasma could be changed 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0844] Where in reality due to compression created, the electron
      of the gas or the invisible energy made available from two
      magnetic fields in presence of gravity in the core within the
      plasma, allows the neutron, electron conversion of proton, without
      the physical appetence of the separation of two components, but
      due to their magnetic field presence and the arability of their
      charges in the vicinity of the plasma, compressed plasma or gas
      will behave as a metallic matter and becomes electrically
      conductive, due to imitation of the electron as to be free, but
      still in the bondage of the proton in the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0845] This how materials change or appear to become metallic and
      conductive, where in their real terms is just normal insulator.
      This is the behaviour of the helium in the center of the Saturn.
      The generation of metallic plasma 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0846] This is the umbilical cord between the reactor core and the
      rest of the ancillary parts of these systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0847] This part of the reactor can be manufactured from any
      single material like iron, steel, composites, plastic, ceramic or
      alloys of any kind silicon resins, any material which can serve
      the purpose of the application of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0848] The material for the central column could be heat treated
      for tensile stress, corrosion treated, cast or be extruded
      depending on the mixture used in the core as the fuel,
      temperatures of the operation and pressures in which is to be
      attained in the core, and the application the system is to be used
      for.<br>
      <br>
      [0849] The central column is preferable to me made of single piece
      or at least single material composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0850] For uniform output from these reactors being magnetic,
      energy and gravity, the center column has to be not more then
      maximum 2-5 percent of the size of diameter of the center core.
      This is sufficient for the filling and evacuating of the gases in
      emergency condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0851] The center core diameter as per use of the system can be
      from under 1 mm to several meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0852] Dimensions of boreholes for any purpose can be from 0.001
      mm to several centimeters.<br>
      <br>
      [0853] Length of the center column measured from the inner face of
      the Caroline core can be from few mm to full diameter right from
      one side of the core to the other side Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0854] In some reactors the central column can be in arc shape,
      and only going from one segment of the Caroline core to the other
      side. This is like monkey bar across the top end or bottom end or
      side of the Caroline core and not the full diameter of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0855] The central column as a whole could made telescopic 1,
      where after delivery of the material to the appropriate layers the
      central column could retract to a predetermine level in the core
      to pickup or deliver some other materials in the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0856] Boreholes could be in-line or off-line, positioned at any
      distance from each other, bored on the surface of the central
      column 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0857] Boreholes could be exposed all the time to all elements of
      the cores. For some applications the core boreholes can be closed
      using gates to isolate the other parts of the system from
      backpressures or sudden surge of pressure in the chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0858] The central column could be in solid form, with boreholes
      in line or off line, but with the inner pipit, where the inner
      pipit can be as in one long grove, or two long groves, or even the
      pipit can be telescopic inside the central column (Fig
      1/1119.8.051 The telescopic and solid on-off line borehole) 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0859] The central column could be fixed with permanent magnets 1,
      covering the full outer circumference of the central column up to
      any height on the tip region of the central column, or at any
      point on the circumference of the central column 1. (Fig
      1/116.8.051 electric and magnetic configuration of the central
      column)<br>
      <br>
      [0860] The position of the magnets has to be north pole next to
      south pole in strip of magnets, or bored, or caste into the
      central column.<br>
      <br>
      [0861] The circumference surface of the side of the central column
      can not be covered by only one polarity magnet. That is all North
      Pole or all South Pole facing magnet looking out into the core of
      the Caroline core of the reactor. The polarity of the magnet has
      to be alternated from on strip to the next. That is South Pole,
      North Pole, and South Pole and so on next to each other 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0862] The bottom magnet in the case of half or two half-column
      system can be in the form of a circle, like a coin at the
      interface of the central column. The other method using magnet in
      this region is inform of strips of magnet on the bottom outer face
      of the central column, again alternating magnetic polarity face
      strips next to each other is needed 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0863] These strips for better soft magnetic field could have
      varying magnetic strength 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0864] The special novel method of placing strong pieces of magnet
      on the tip of the central column will create the soft and weak
      environment in the hydrogen gas layer needed for the initial
      ionisation and current production initially in the hydrogen gas
      layer of the core of the reactor 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0865] This column can to extend to the center of the core. Where
      the ionisation of the hydrogen would be symmetrical and homogenous
      within the center of the core outward.<br>
      <br>
      [0866] The center column can have two distinguish separate
      co-axial channels for feed and extraction in to the center of the
      reactor 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0867] The center channel should have appropriate sizes for the
      purpose the reactor is design for but not exceeding a fifth of the
      total diameter of the center column for uniform magnetic field
      output.<br>
      <br>
      [0868] One of these channels can only be used to feed the
      irradiated Helium, which has been coming from the pressurised
      chamber from outside of the system, if the liquid techniques are
      used for ionisation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0869] The liquid helium in this case will be sucked into the
      center of the core due to natural phenomenon of the pressure
      variation.<br>
      <br>
      [0870] This channel would have no other use. The reason being that
      no material would be able to enter this channel. That could come
      in touch with irradiated material, which might interact and cause
      any side chains of reactions or cause other undesired
      contamination of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0871] The second hole at the bottom is only used in the systems
      where the plasma is needed to be feed to outer core or other
      layers of caroline core to create or initiate a new process in
      these cores<br>
      <br>
      [0872] All other boreholes would be closed at the bottom of the
      column and have no access to the center of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0873] The core would be accessed through boreholes on its side
      along the whole length of the center column. These boreholes are
      made to facilitate the removal or adding of any gases or vapour
      metal, or any other material directly at the point and the
      position in the core where they need to be, without any need to
      contaminate the hydrogen or other gases while the proposed gas is
      to reach its position within the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0874] These boreholes could be individually connected to the main
      feeder pip. That if the volume of a certain gas needs to be
      altered within the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0875] The side of the center column from out side has to be lined
      by strips of copper wire connected to pointes outside the reactor,
      that the electric current from the core at the level of helium or
      Argon gas could be siphoned off. This supply is the output power
      of the rector 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0876] It is paramount that the system as a whole to be connected
      to the earth position according to the international standard set
      for the use of the centrifuge systems. For airborne systems
      appropriate systems as used in aircraft industry is advisable for
      the ground connection of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0877] The half-length central columns are prone to oscillation at
      high speed of the rotation of the inner core. This is important to
      be noted for safety and uniform magnetic field generation of the
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0878] This oscillation could be checked through resonance
      pressure changes at helium gas level porthole, right at the tip of
      the column. That is where the oscillation of the center column
      would be at its maximum.<br>
      <br>
      [0879] In the full center column the warping can happen too. In
      this case the speed of the inner core has to be brought down
      through automatic kick in computer program.<br>
      <br>
      [0880] If the center column shears off, this should not cause any
      danger. The system becomes telescopic. The current output will or
      can go to zero instantly and the whole operation comes to halt. By
      this time safety operation mode will assure shutdown.<br>
      <br>
      [0881] In some design for specific conditions of operation, the
      center column will be saddled (1) with solid or blade in a
      specific gas layer. For these operations, safety of the saddle
      blade will be controlled from outside.<br>
      <br>
      [0882] In specific application saddles will be designed to have
      its own porthole, that can deliver specific matter in the specific
      layer to enhance or create a new effect. Safety for this type of
      column will be insured through remote deferential system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0883] The most practical central column for high temperature
      operation mode like fusion is a fully retractable telescopic
      central column system.<br>
      <br>
      [0884] These types of central column for these mode of operations,
      operated on the bases that, as the interaction between the two
      magnetic field in the central core increases the temperature of
      the material in the region of the interface, which temperatures at
      this magnetospheres of two cores could be high enough, that can
      damage the material composition of the central column, or even in
      extreme cases could lead to softening of the material in the
      central column, or even melting and separation of parts of central
      column.<br>
      <br>
      [0885] Then a fully retractable central column, which can be
      extended at the beginning of the start-up to the center of the
      core, to create the initial conditions and loading of the original
      materials for the start-up and creation of the soft magnetic
      environment by the introduction of the solid magnets at its tip.<br>
      <br>
      [0886] Then the withdrawal of the central column, even as far back
      as to the inner core boundary, during the operation of the
      reactor, as system reaches its stable pre-determined function.<br>
      <br>
      [0887] Then in turn to extend the central column to any point in
      the core that volume of any gas or material layers could by
      changed, or new material to be introduced into the reactor core,
      to achieve certain effects and then for the central column to be
      withdrawn to the boundary condition position, that the central
      column can not be damaged, or it can interfere with magnetic field
      of the cores. This is then the most acceptable type of central
      column for any safe, uniform output and lasting operation system.<br>
      <br>
      [0888] The advantages with fully telescopic column system are very
      clear. One is that this creates homogenous magnetic fields in the
      central column, without any indentation in the fields from the
      absorption of heat and current, or distortion in the magnetic
      field of the system and consequently a uniform gravitational field
      force for the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0889] Secondly, once the rotation of the inner core of the
      reactor is set by the interaction of he two magnetic fields, these
      types of central columns need only boreholes at their tip at one
      level. This saving all sorts of problems with need for several
      boreholes at several levels on the surface of the column.<br>
      <br>
      [0890] The advantage with this type of retractable central column
      is that by being able to insert the column in the core of the
      reactor as the output needed for the performance of the core,
      therefore the central column can be extended to any level to
      withdraw any amount of current, plasma or heat from the core as is
      needed from the operation of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0891] For example if the current needed from the core has to be
      increased or decreased, all that needs to be done is to insert
      more of the electrodes section which fixed on the outer column
      surface of the central column for current pick-up, in the layer of
      the material in the core where the currents can be taped into,
      then when the current demand from the reactor is reduced, the
      central column can be retract to different levels in the same
      martial, where less current could be pick up from the core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0892] Some times during the operation certain materials needed,
      could be, totally withdrawn from the core without disturbing other
      material layer in the core. This is again possible to be done with
      positioning of the telescopic column in that position and
      withdrawal after ward.<br>
      <br>
      [0893] There is a possibility of having a flat central column 1,
      where the porthole is only at the surface on the inner code of the
      Caroline core. In this system currents are picked up directly by
      electric pickup points which are directly fixed on the inner side
      of this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0894] In these systems the material will be injected at high
      speeds and under greater pressures in to the core, where the
      material will be propelled into the center of the core.<br>
      <br>
      These types of operational column are more foreseen for fusion
      conditions, where the reactor has to operate at very high
      temperatures, where the containment will be through the spherical
      magnetic field created by the outer core of the reactor, rather
      then the physical boundary of the inner core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0895] The outer surface of the central column at argon layer
      level of the caroline core, can be coated with stratum radioactive
      material, where at high temperatures around 1000 K, the
      interaction between these two material will lead to creation of
      extreme ultraviolet ray as scintillation needed for the ionisation
      of the hydrogen in the caroline core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0896] Where there are needs for extra heating in the outer core
      without the need for the heating of the plasma in the caroline
      core, them stratum can be coated on the central column exterior
      only in the argon gas layer level 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0897] Then in this level hydrogen could be injected, that gets
      immediately ionised and will release its heat into the argon layer
      1, the extra increase in the current production will be picked up
      as a serge by the copper electron pickups, in this level, and the
      ionised hydrogen due to the centrifuge and the vacume condition of
      the core will return to the plasma region.<br>
      <br>
      [0898] Where the volume of neon gases increased to insure no
      follow of heat into the center core.<br>
      <br>
      [0899] The extra ionised hydrogen nuclease which is charged and
      worm can them be pumped in to the outer core of the reactor, as
      charged particle to interact with the metallic material vapour or
      gases in that core, like sodium, or potassium, the when returning
      to ground state to absorb, a free electron from the outer layers
      of these material to become atomic hydrogen 1. That this can be
      extracted and be feed to the inner core at argon or hydrogen layer
      levels of the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [0900] The system can be controlled through the outer core with
      feed of the safe metallic vapour, rather then injection of
      hydrogen or scintillation and interference with the Caroline core
      gases 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0901] Using this method of feeding the possibility of oxygen
      penetration into the inner core will be eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0902] This method could be used if sudden surge like escaping
      from a region needed for emergence, or the shielding through the
      caroline 1 core become weaker, so directional magnetic field
      production becomes a possibility.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The planarity unit</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0903] In the star systems or planetary systems where there are no
      central column and the materials in the caroline core and the
      outer core are deposited in their final position and internal
      powers for rest of the life of the system, where the composition
      and the volume ratio of all matters within the core will determine
      all the other properties of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0904] The same can be done for systems which need to perform one
      or several functions indefinitely, until the composition of matter
      with the core of the reactor are depleted or can create a second
      function as one is finished.<br>
      <br>
      [0905] That is to say there are no need for intervention in the
      output or the performance of system.<br>
      <br>
      [0906] Therefore there is no need for the existence of the central
      column, once the cores are filled with the predetermined volume
      ratio of materials, and then the core are totally sealed, very
      much like the cores of all planets in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0907] The example of this is for battery production system 1,
      which its life lets say ten years will be predetermined by the
      fuel injected in the cores and then only current at the surface of
      the outer core is picked for the given voltage out put usage.<br>
      <br>
      [0908] On the other hand a system like a satellite which has to
      keep to certain orbit or a traffic light which need to be kept in
      certain position and create electricity let say for twenty years.
      Where the system has to keep a fixed position in the gravitational
      force of the atmosphere and at the same time generate enough
      energy to run a feed constant current for the lighting of the
      bulbs or other functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0909] This system is known as planetary system, where there is no
      intervention in to the cores, once the reactor is sealed for rest
      of it natural life.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The static inner core reactor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0910] This system of the reactor design is one of the most
      advanced types of reactor for any application of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0911] This being for the generation of the current, heat, and
      single magnetic field, double magnetic field , cold and warm
      plasma, and finally the gravitational field force creator system.<br>
      <br>
      [0912] This is a much simpler design, where the inner core of the
      reactor, unlike the rest of other systems, which has been
      disclosed, will be static or stationary.<br>
      <br>
      [0913] Where pumping facilities of the system, of the matters into
      the rector's cores, controls the effect of the motion of matters
      in all cores facilities of the system, of the reactor instead of
      rotation of the inner core, as was done for the centrifuge effect
      , as was created in the other systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0914] In this system the rotation of the heaviest material in the
      vacume chamber, in the outer layer of the material in the core,
      will control the speed of the rotation and motion of the other
      maters in side the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0915] This is to say to replace the hard physical body of the
      inner core by the speed of the rotation of the maters inside the
      core, by the speed of the pumping or passing this last layer
      through a static pump outside the core and feed the material back
      into the core, to create the centrifuge effect in the caroline
      core materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0916] That is to say that all the speeds of the rotation of the
      gases will be controlled by directional pumping of the gases in
      the layers which are needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0917] By controlling the feed or the rate of the creation of the
      ionisation through scintillation, this being by liquid pumping or
      lamping, the rotation of the reactor of the materials in the core
      will be controlled by the injection of the mater through boreholes
      on the central column of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0918] There fore the inner core does not need to be made to
      rotate and can be kept stationary.<br>
      <br>
      [0919] For the creation of the current in the outer core then
      facilities have to be made in the system that the metallic
      materials are made available so that the current production
      through rotation in this core will lead to generation of the
      magnetic filed forces in this core.<br>
      <br>
      [0920] This is a perfect system for space technology and
      multi-layer reactors 1, especially designed for computers which
      will have no tangible physical boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [0921] Where the spherical magnetic fields and current layering,
      will allow for the first time the creation of computers 1 where it
      will work like the human brain in three dimensions 1, where the
      material in layers could be cells, biochemical's matters 1, and
      fields of current created in the center core with position of
      magnetic field and presence of gravity, in between layers of cells
      1, with power supplies in micron electrovolts level 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0922] This the ultimate computer system of the future.<br>
      <br>
      The soft body reactor or partial gap or gate in the inner core and
      /or outer core physical structure, or port hole layering in the
      materials of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0923] This is the reactor system where the physical body of the
      reactor cores, or the materials in the reactor core, are port
      holed by physical means or magnetic port holing, for the materials
      like plasma, liquid material or magnetic plasma, are allowed to be
      ejected out of one cores to the other or for them to be ejected
      out of the core of the reactor all together.<br>
      <br>
      [0924] This is used in the weapon technology for delivery of high
      power energy magnetic plasma for destruction of matter in the core
      or outside of the core in the space for destruction of meteoroids
      and that type of use.<br>
      <br>
      [0925] This could be used for rivet welding and system like
      injection nail machines of today.<br>
      <br>
      [0926] This is the most powerful weapon technology known in the
      universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0927] This is more lethal, if the matter is transferred to dark
      matter and then delivered to the matter, this is a total
      inhalation system by de-magnetising a matter molecular structure,
      then there will be nothing left of matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0928] If used in the side arm technology, this will be a ultimate
      weapon, where there will be nothing to prove that the matter ever
      existed, the only reminiscence of the matter will be its effect on
      its surrounding matter. This is full magnetic disintegration of
      any material or matter in atomic or molecular or their
      combination.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The scintillation unit</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0929] The principal of the scintillation in the universal systems
      has been explained in the previous chapters.<br>
      <br>
      [0930] Now to follow the universal order and to be able to run a
      system the same principals have to be followed in the construction
      and ignition system of the reactor, for it to be able to operate
      on the same principals.<br>
      <br>
      [0931] Scintillation units 1, being in the form of liquid, or
      fluid, microwave lighting, radiation base, or any shape or form,
      that is a system that can initiate the first stage of ionisation
      of any elements that the chain of event in the core of reactor for
      any purpose can start, this unit will be known as the
      scintillation unit of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0932] This scintillation could be by injection of one material in
      the core 1, where its interaction with another material in the
      core can release energy that can ionise one or more elements in
      the core, so the process of energy release from the elements can
      start, or even process of energy absorption to start (for example
      in the creation of dark mater this process is sometimes is needed)
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [0933] For the simplicity and for purpose of the prototype reactor
      the liquid scintillation system using the liquid helium
      interaction with radioactive material is initially chosen.<br>
      <br>
      [0934] The choice of radioactive sources for scintillation depends
      on the intensity of scintillation and the rate of ionisation,
      which is need to be achieved in any cores of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      For this system the following radioactive materials out of a list
      of others can be used, these are strontium, Cs 137, Bi 207 (alpha
      emitter), PO 210 (alpha emitter), Rb+, Sn 113 3 (beta source), Cl
      36(beta source), Am 241(alpha source).<br>
      <br>
      [0935] Potassium K40 could be another candidate for purpose of
      scintillation, where the natural K40 is a beta emitter. At the
      same time, this is the material, which through natural beta decay,
      where this is the main creator of the argon gas in the nature.<br>
      <br>
      [0936] Therefore in case of default in operation the irradiative
      material becomes the source for the argon gas in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0937] The Cs is an intense gamma producer as well as beta
      emitter, when using this source as a radioactive material, a large
      number of gamma rays escape the helium without releasing their
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0938] This source is considered to be more suitable for Neon cold
      gas or liquid even if using Xenon as catalyst in the core as
      scintillation material, or where there is possibility of use of
      mixture of neon and helium cold gas or liquid as the scintillation
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0939] Beta source has inherent characteristic of being
      scintillation medium accompanied by Gamma rays.<br>
      <br>
      [0940] Alpha sources create an excitation in the MeV (eg, PO 210
      5.3 MeV a, Am 241 5.5 MeV, rather then in KeV (Sn 113 364 KeV b,
      Cs 137 514 KeV b, Cl 36 252 KeV b) excitation in beta sources,
      where these materials have an average high-energy sources.<br>
      <br>
      The alpha sources can be used for the scintillation purpose in
      this prototype<br>
      <br>
      [0941] The Sn 113 beta (40 gram per cm2 coating) and a good for
      mono energetic source.<br>
      <br>
      [0942] The intensity of the scintillation carried by the material
      into the core or already injected in the core to create
      scintillation is position dependent of the source within the
      chamber of the scintillation unit or material.<br>
      <br>
      [0943] The pulse of the exposure of 10 ms to 150 ms for the helium
      considered being sufficient. This is at the start up of the core,
      for observation of the behaviour pattern of the gases within the
      core. Then the operation pre discipline method for irradiation and
      feed to be followed as system is to achieve its desired effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0944] It is, possible to use very cold Helium instead of liquid,
      this having a problem that if enough atoms of the helium can be
      excited that could be useful in the rector core the ionisation of
      Hydrogen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0945] Super fluid helium is to be effective for some disciplines
      and effect for the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0946] The constant value of compression of the liquid helium feed
      into the chamber to interact with the irradiating source is
      needed. This insuring the nuisance of the reaction and amount
      number of excited scintillated atoms to be feed into the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0947] The scintillation unit needs to have indium seal or copper
      for the valves at each end of the scintillation unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0948] In case of neutron leakage due to interaction of the
      radioactive matter and the liquid helium, there are several
      materials, which could be for neutron dumping. Where the feed
      pipes at the opening is to be lined with neutron absorbing matter.
      Or use high purity boron oxide B2 O3 as a neutron beam dump.<br>
      <br>
      [0949] Experiment has shown that to ionise helium molecules
      energies are in the order of 24.6 eV are required. Where the
      molecule decay to two ground state helium atoms releasing 16 eV
      (80-nm) photon. Where the lifetime of decay of He II in liquid
      helium is measured to be about 10s (P. Hill).<br>
      <br>
      [0950] Recent developments in creation of EUV for computer
      industries are reporting creation of this energy through argon gas
      itself. These are said to be using argon ions to send coherent EUV
      with energy of 250 eV.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The use of solid magnets in the
        system</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0951] The principal of using solid magnet or liquid magnet in the
      core of the reactor, being placed at the end of the central
      column, this is a totally new concept in production the atomic
      ionisation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0952] The concept behind the use of the magnet on the tip and at
      the edge of the central column is, that, in the universe initial
      atomic ionisation of hydrogen always takes place in a soft
      magnetic environment, these can be seen in ref 1/116.8.051 the
      electric and magnetic configuration of central core.<br>
      <br>
      [0953] In this system the same is replicated by use of alternative
      pole magnet positioning, by place next to each other on the tip of
      1, and on the surface of the top of the central column 1 in the
      core in the center of the reactor, in the hydrogen gas layer, to
      create the same environment, where the central column is in a
      continues rotation, as it is firmly attached to the inner core
      physical body, this will grantee a magnetic environment 1 in the
      hydrogen layer, where it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0954] The placing of solid magnet on different section of the
      central column 1 or injection of liquid magnet direct in different
      layers of materials of all cores of reactor 1 is one of the
      flexibility principal of the operation of these types of reactors<br>
      <br>
      [0955] This simple solution of solid magnetic field environment,
      where the magnetic field is needed for ionisation of hydrogen in
      few centimetre diameter and is effective, this will replace the
      elaborate systems used in TOKAMAK to magnetise a two meter
      hydrogen gas core ready for ionisation, and without any cost and
      use of current to create magnetic environment in core of the
      TOKAMAK core and waist of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The magnetic seal 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0956] The polarity positioning magnetic system for this reactor
      is designed very much to take in to account the expected three
      dimensional expansion of the inner core due to heat, and internal
      pressures of the reactor cores up on each other, and the
      compressions which are created by the injection of matters in to
      each core, and operation of the cores, and its movement due to
      compression of the reactor core, or sudden movement by the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0957] These magnetic seals developed for this system will allow
      movement and expansion in all direction for the inner core, for it
      to be able to move freely when the core is in operation for
      magnetic, energy, or gravitational purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0958] The introduction of solid magnet in these parts of the core
      will not be effected by the passive magnetic field created by the
      reactor itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0959] That is to say, because of the existence of the magnetic
      fields of the earth the strength of man made solid magnets are not
      effected.<br>
      <br>
      [0960] Therefore the same is expected of the solid magnet used in
      this reactor core physical parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0961] Several versions of magnetic positioning and arrangements
      are shown in the diagrams included in this patent, the choice is
      of the users option.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Pump units</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0962] Uses of pumps are much advised for this system.<br>
      <br>
      [0963] There are two types of pumps, which could be needed in this
      type of reactor.<br>
      Gas pumps of different power capacity for circulation of gases in
      the both chambers are one of the important parts of the whole
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0964] Pumps are the backbone of the running and the operation of
      the, multi purpose, multi function reactor systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0965] Gas pumps are used extensively in the connection with the
      helium, argon and neon gases in these reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0966] This is important part of the system as it is the
      controlling apparatus of the whole system power and magnetism
      creation control.<br>
      <br>
      [0967] The flow of the gases determining the outcome effect of the
      whole system for example the variation in the volume of argon gas
      layer controls the power output of the system, being for heat
      generation, electric or power supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0968] The speed of the rotation of the argon gas determines the
      magnetic power of the whole system. Therefore the strength of the
      gravitational forces of the system too, where the speed of pumping
      and even the speed of the rotation of each gas layer can be
      controlled by the use of pumps at each layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0969] The pump or pumping systems for the operation of certain
      systems of the reactor can have facility to increase or reduce the
      speed of the circulation of the feed of the gas if it is needed it
      to be interfered with.<br>
      <br>
      [0970] At the same time in some cases of application, the pumping
      cycle can be equipped with an ionisation-supplying machine needed
      to be able to add or withdrew ions from the gas while is going
      through the process of pumping.<br>
      <br>
      [0971] The powers and sizes of these pumps are all dependent on
      the use of the reactor and the system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0972] For certain applications pump are used for the metal vapour
      injection into the core, these are useful pumping needed for the
      for outer core, when a larger than normal magnetic field
      generation is required from the system, this type of access to
      flow allows generation of current through convection by using
      gases or molten metal or metal vapour, where this is an
      alternative to an ionisation supply from the caroline core, that
      could achieve the same effect for when a sudden serge in the
      system current output is required.<br>
      <br>
      [0973] Note that in these pumps the pumping always has to be on
      lower vacuum and pressure level for withdrawal from the cores, and
      vice versa when feeding in to the chambers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Measurement gauges</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0974] All measurement gauges being for pressure, temperature,
      radiations are situated outside and away from the core of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0975] This being due to the fact that all gases can have their
      own individual porthole and cycling pump, where during the pumping
      cycle an exact conditions of the core could be measured for its
      pressure and contamination at all stages of operation of the
      reactor. That in turn the right pressures of the gas can be
      generated that gases can be feed back into the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0976] Some temperature gauges could be placed on the outer side
      of both chambers purely for material of the core measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0977] As many safety parameters for this simple reactor for
      initial testing can be provided, the reality is that these are not
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0978] The current measurement gauges through argon level can be
      attained after the brushes pick up points.<br>
      <br>
      [0979] All equipments for these measurements are not special and
      can be purchased off the shelf from any supplier to serve the
      function of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0980] For safety reasons all measurement equipment and gauges are
      placed around the reverse tank parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0981] For safety reasons all tanks have to be equipped with
      radiation detector and temperature sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0982] Two consecutive abnormal reading by two instruments in two
      tanks has to trigger shutdown without interference, the emergency
      shutdown safety parameters to come into operation, this is being
      stoppage of the feed of scintillators material, the motor or
      centrifuge safe disengagement and brining the core to rest rapidly
      but safely, shutdown of all the secondary valves, disengagement of
      all electric contacts.<br>
      <br>
      [0983] But not evacuation of any gases under no circumstances,
      unless this has been preprogrammed in the discipline of the
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Motoring system</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0984] This is a normal magnetic centrifuges motor system, where
      the inner core needs to reach a predetermined rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0985] After the creation of magnetic fields in the cores of the
      reactor, if it is programmed in the discipline of the operation of
      the system, then the motor will be disengaged, and the speed of
      the rotation of the inner core will be determined by the
      interaction of the two magnetic fields of the two cores, and in
      some cases by the feed of the gases in certain layers using the
      intervention of the gas pumps.<br>
      <br>
      [0986] Gas pump intervention is a more favourable method, where
      there would not be any special system like clutch system for the
      reengagement of the motor and the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [0987] These motoring systems can be purchased off the shelf, from
      any manufactures, according to the operational output demand from
      the system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The energy balance of the reactor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0988] The energy balances of these types of reactors are not as
      simple as might look in the first instance.<br>
      <br>
      [0989] The energy creation is simple, but the energy leakage and
      dissipation through the deliberate inherent material chosen for
      each specific discipline are and can vary, from deliberate leakage
      totally of energy created by the system, on the other end of its
      spectrum, where the system can absorb heat from its surrounding
      and become a cooling system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0990] The system not only can hold on to the heat it creates, at
      the same time due to the close circuit feed operation will become
      self sufficient but long lasting.<br>
      <br>
      [0991] In planets the lose of heat through their surface creates
      the variation in the central core condition over several billions
      of years facilitating the convection the inner core of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0992] In this reactor as losses can be literally negligible. The
      system can operate at low energy lose temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0993] Even the boundary of the body could be made through the
      right combination of material in the cores, that the body of the
      reactor will be colder then its surrounding boundary, then the
      system not only will not lose energy to its surrounding, it can be
      made to absorb heat in the negative temperature gradient from its
      surrounding, that there are no energy losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0994] The energy balance equation of this reactor is not simple.
      It has several strong variable characteristic, which, while they
      are created, they change the characteristics of other matters of
      the reactor components, that these will effect the characteristic
      of the original input before it can reach its ultimate purpose in
      the reactor operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0995] Energy balance equation for this reactor has / but does not
      obey the Hamiltonian concept.<br>
      <br>
      [0996] This creates a new dilemma in the control and operational
      and energy creation of the whole system, where for example, the
      energy from scintillation of He and catalysis of the argon gas
      will manifest new levels of energy release.<br>
      <br>
      [0997] Then the same electrons and hydrogen ions on their way back
      to their ground state will come in interaction with the magnetic
      magnetosphere fields of two cores, which this creates a new levels
      of energies, which in turn due to the rotation and cooperation of
      the gases within the core, and due to the vacume environment of
      the core in presence of magnetic field of the outer core and the
      inner core within a centrifuge condition of the gases in the
      caroline core, will lead to production of the new currents within
      the core, then in addition due to rotation and compression and
      turbulence within a magnetic environment in presence of magnetic
      field an additional power and current due convection are created
      in the inner core, which all these leads itself to a complete
      magnetic, electric and gravitational production system.<br>
      <br>
      [0998] This is truly a universal system, if one tries to relate
      the large output from the system, compared to the meager energy
      input.<br>
      <br>
      [0999] This being due to the fact that the system will go through
      power production from the initial injection of the Scint-He in to
      the reactor core through some four simultaneous interacting power
      processes, interaction and magnetic field productions at the same
      time in most of cases, once the system reaches its operation mode,
      therefore the only this new concept can be tested for its energy
      balance will be by empirical methods.<br>
      <br>
      [1000] The formula for energy balance of the operation of this
      reactor has several elements in its operational calculation.<br>
      <br>
      [1001] The total energy output balance of the system will have the
      following collective equation of all these factors which happens
      in the cores of the reactor in stages or at the same time,<br>
      <br>
      A : Energy released through ionisation +<br>
      <br>
      B : Energy released through catalyses in Helium layer +<br>
      <br>
      C : Energy released through catalyses in Argon layer+<br>
      <br>
      D : Energy released through interaction of magnetic fields
      interfaces + H* =<br>
      <br>
      E : Energy released through convection of the matters in the inner
      core +<br>
      <br>
      F : Energy released through convection of the matters in the outer
      core +<br>
      <br>
      G : Energy releases through the turbulence and self gravitation of
      the gases in the inner core +<br>
      <br>
      H : Energy release due to proton to proton interaction in the
      inner plasma of the core due to magnetic helicities across the
      core of the reactor.Where the H* is for Hosneh (Hydrogen operating
      in scintillated enhanced habitat) 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1002] Then some of these power productions have parallel in the
      current production in the cores too.<br>
      <br>
      [1003] Where this is noted as Hosneh current H*C 1, where, this is
      the current output of the system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [1004] Where this has an additional output, where through rotation
      of the cores, additional currents are created in the physical
      parameters of the cores. Which these could be significant in the
      certain reactors or operational modes through deliberate
      incorporation of current carrying wires being passed in the
      embodiment of the inner core for the production of the alternating
      current output of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1005] The electrical energy released in the helium catalyst layer
      could be more significant where the mixture of the helium in the
      core has a more substantial volume ratio or is part of the main
      gas mixture of the core mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [1006] In this system, energy can be taped into at levels, which
      the system can generate this being alternating, as well as/or,
      direct current out put.<br>
      <br>
      [1007] These currents can be used with equipment, which are
      designed to operate in micro electron volts 1, and electron volt
      for soft tissue computers 1, electrovolts levels 1, like in the
      world of computers.<br>
      <br>
      [1008] Using these types of power supply the system will not need
      conversion through transformers or cell batteries, as the systems
      energy supply can be taped into directly from the rector 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1009] This opens a totally new concept in the fields of energy
      production and usage.<br>
      <br>
      [1010] This current level production and its methods has been a
      well know concept in the operation of human brain electrical work
      in the chemical, and biological field of science, and space and
      cosmology, but up to now has never been achievable as a power
      supply source.<br>
      <br>
      [1011] When this type of direct electrovolts energies are use in
      their appropriate way, new lighting system and heating at
      molecular level will be open for development 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1012] This is the true application future for these systems
      energy production capability, and not the present currents created
      through electron transfers of batteries or rotational core and
      magnetic field generators.<br>
      <br>
      [1013] This should become apparent that we have endeavoured in the
      production of the ultimate energy supply on the true base of
      universal energy systems, and not the manmade one.<br>
      <br>
      [1014] Compared to systems of present time, where the earth
      resources are used to create energy by burning and combustion,
      potential and other methods, the energy generated in these types
      of reactors will be a new era in the technological natural
      evolution development energy.<br>
      <br>
      [1015] Now truth about the ability of and the strength of this
      system will become apparent in some new ways, this is the
      beginning of new and exciting cycle of human creativity.<br>
      <br>
      [1016] This system is the bases for the energy and gravity system
      that through further developments of these reactors, through its
      technology magnetic energy transmutation of elements in the near
      future are possible 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1017] Where the natural energy of fields and elements do not have
      to fight against the natural elements of the existence, but they
      only have to operate within their natural environment to operate
      and create new conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [1018] That is the way where the speed of light will have no
      relevance in the overall picture of energy creation and
      transportation and elements production 1, where the light itself
      is the visible effect of the energy but not the creator of it.<br>
      <br>
      [1019] That means the light itself is created through dimensions
      of magnetism and is only accepted up to now because of that is
      what can be seen as visible effects of magnetism 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1020] Where in reality the creator of light itself is much more
      powerful then light and has dimensions much faster and powerful
      effect then light.<br>
      <br>
      [1021] The power of magnetism is known in the visible and sound
      levels. Through this system new realisation and control of
      magnetism and speeds of transportation beyond light will show
      their effects and existence in the level of dark matter 1, which
      these will be needed to getting used to.<br>
      <br>
      [1022] In the process of scintillation, protons will be freed in
      the hydrogen ion form as positively charged particles in the
      plasma of the core. These will effect the gases in the Caroline
      core due to their rotation (the proton itself, plus the rotation
      induced by plasma on it) and the energy they release in to the
      plasma. Which, rotation of charge matter (proton) will lead to
      creation and maintaining of the magnetic field in the plasma of
      the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1023] By retraction of plasma from the Caroline core, these
      positively charge particles can be feed into the outer core.
      Where, as they will not be absorbed by for example sodium vapour,
      these will bring in to play the charge particle environment
      necessary to create current and magnetic field in conjunction with
      the material in this section.<br>
      <br>
      [1024] In the core of the earth, it is assumed that due to
      convection of the material in the outer core current is created in
      the core leading to creation of magnetic field of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [1025] In these type of reactor to imitate the convection
      condition of the earth outer core, which is in reality, is the
      need for charge particle to be in motion in a metallic
      environment, the circulation of charged particle in the metallic
      material can be easily achieved, by feed of charge particles from
      the plasma from the caroline core through special borehole, that
      high energy protons is feed as the ingredient for the rotation of
      and heating of the material into the outer core material.<br>
      <br>
      [1026] Charge practical within this environment, where the energy
      of the protons is large enough to allow them to float in the
      matter in this level. But they do not enough energy to cause
      ionisation or photon release. Thus for the choice of the material
      for the outer core. This point has to be taken in to
      consideration. Therefore even inert gases which can satisfy this
      criterion can be used in the outer core. Where the charged
      partials induced in to this core will maintain the magnetic field
      and the current due to the convection of the gases on their own,
      where the gas in this level will become a physical catalyst for
      the creation of magnetic field and not a chemical catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [1027] The proton balance in each core plus the speed of the
      rotation of the plasma will dictate the strength of the magnetic
      field of the inner core.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy delivered through liquid
        helium scintillation to hydrogen</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [1028] The first ionisation energy for helium is slightly less
      than twice the ionisation energy for hydrogen because each
      electron in helium feels the attractive force of two protons,
      instead of one. The first ionisation energy for helium is 2372.3
      KJ/mol.<br>
      <br>
      [1029] Helium as well as all inert gases have a large energy gap
      between the ground state and the first excited state, which this
      is corresponding to transition in the far ultraviolet rays of
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      [1030] The visible lines in the spectrum are due to transitions
      between higher states. This explains why the inert gases are
      transparent, since ordinary visible frequencies are too low to
      excite them when they are in the ground state.<br>
      <br>
      [1031] The helium spectrum in a discharge tube shows strong lines
      at 447.1 nm (blue), 501.6 nm (green), 587.56 nm (yellow) and 667.8
      nm (red). This spread of lines creates a whitish light.<br>
      <br>
      [1032] Neon has a cluster of lines in the red and orange, while
      argon has groups of lines in the blue and in the red.<br>
      <br>
      [1033] These are important factors in the case ionised gases are
      used and certain pre determined volume of gases are to be used in
      the mixture tank before gas mixture are feed into the Caroline
      core. This is to give the precise volume of the gas in the
      mixture. Secondly if precise pure volume of helium is needed to be
      liquefied for the injection in to the scintillation chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1034] Helium obeys the ideal gas law<br>
      <br>
      Where V is the molar volume, R is the molar gas constant.<br>
      <br>
      In finite volume of the atoms and slight attraction between them
      affect the equation of the state between relation of V, T and p.
      The van der Waals equation of state<br>
      <br>
      [1035] Accounts for these effects through the constants a and b,
      differ for each gas.<br>
      <br>
      If P is in atmospheres, V in litre/mole and T in Kelvin, then R=
      0.08217. For helium, a=0.03412 and b=0.02370. The value of b shows
      that the atoms of helium are small (eg for helium atomic radii A*
      is 0.53). The critical temperature of helium is 5.2K, the critical
      pressure is 2.2 psi, and critical density is 0.0693 g/cc. The
      critical temperature is so low that helium is very well a
      permanent gas.<br>
      <br>
      [1036] The liquid helium from the scintillation chamber has to
      have high pressure enough due to its state in the chamber. That it
      can reach the inner core fast enough that does not return to state
      of gaseous before it losses its scintillation property.<br>
      <br>
      [1037] In this process enthalpy is not the object. But purely
      trying to transport enough scintillation material into the inner
      chamber. That hydrogen atoms and molecules could be energised by
      scintillated liquid helium, that they can ionise hydrogen or
      release enough photons that can create heat and current through
      catalysis in the argon level in the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1038] Where in fact EUV emission accounts for over 99% of the
      total scintillation intensity from the liquid helium, this
      translating to a high ionisation flux in the hydrogen in the
      caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1039] Helium is used in several different ways and purposes in
      the cores of the reactor, in liquid form, helium starts as
      scintillators, then it becomes partially catalyst for the energy
      release from ions and electrons from hydrogen ionisation of the
      core, then through its circulation, it can be liquefied to be feed
      back into the core as scintillators again.<br>
      <br>
      [1040] Then it can be used as the carrier of the proton. For it to
      be feed into the outer core chamber for creation of magnetic field
      in that core.<br>
      <br>
      [1041] At the same time due to its catalyses electrons could be
      picked at this level as the current output of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1042] The withdrawal of the helium and use of neon as
      scintillation material, the reduction in speed of rotation to
      increase the maximum chance of ionisation of the hydrogen atoms
      and molecules, when using neon as a scintillators is another a
      possibility.<br>
      <br>
      [1043] Where helium is not used or gradually withdrawn from the
      core in the layer between hydrogen and argon layer, and neon is
      used as scintillation material.<br>
      <br>
      [1044] Neon will go directly to the layer next to argon through
      vacume and centrifuge condition of the core. Then the neon has to
      have the maximum chance to create as much ionisation in the
      hydrogen as possible before leaving this layer of the Caroline
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1045] In these scintillation methods the are high possibilities
      of existence of neutron or strong gamma rays, which are introduced
      into the core through the flow of the scintillation material into
      the reactor, that is why krypton and xenon layer due to their
      capability of being able to capture such occasional releases
      before the walls of the inner core can be contaminated are
      specifically introduced in the core in the initial state of start
      up.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydrogen ionisation energy
        absorption and release</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1046] The energy needed to remove one or more electrons from a
      neutral atom to form a positively charged ion is a physical
      property that influences the chemical behaviour of the atom.<br>
      <br>
      [1047] By definition, the first ionisation energy of an element is
      the energy needed to remove the outermost or highest energy,
      electron from a neutral atom in the gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      [1048] In the Milky Way natural hydrogen gas has typical densities
      of about 1 atom/cm&lt;3&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [1049] In the molecular clouds the comparative density of H2 is in
      access of 1000-molecules/cm&lt;3&gt; at 10K-region temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [1050] Where at densities of about 10^7-10^9 molecules/cm3 at 100K
      star formation process begins. Where the molecular gas is
      estimated to be about 25% then of the mass of the HI gas.<br>
      <br>
      [1051] These data's confirming, that the cycle of heat and current
      starts in an atomic rich region of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [1052] The data again confirms that the initial state of energy
      production for a system is in very low density atomic hydrogen
      region of the galaxies, where one gram of hydrogen only possess 6*
      10^ 23 atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [1053] In choice of low density, low volume ratio, of hydrogen gas
      for the reactor's caroline core, this allows the creation of
      energy system rather than saturation point of star system, as the
      temperatures in the core of the reactor builds up.<br>
      <br>
      [1054] Therefore it is considered and concluded that the hydrogen
      and all gases, for the reactor not to reach, what is to be called
      the state of solid or stagnation, through hydrogen atomic
      saturation, the core has to have low gas volume ratio 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1055] A high volume ratio after a limit of gas density point will
      never function, the system become dead or will become to create
      constituent of solid matter, like carbon in the gas state, within
      the core, which these will absorbed all the latent heat generated
      within the core and core becomes inefficient.<br>
      <br>
      [1056] Therefore all energy releases from the hydrogen layer into
      the plasma is to be considered to be by atomic hydrogen, which it
      can only release energies below extreme ultraviolet range.<br>
      <br>
      [1057] The assumption that it takes about an average of 13 eV to
      ionise an atom of hydrogen, and the ability of the scintillation
      to create number of ionisation, will give the starting point for
      the initial heating and electron saturation of in the caroline
      core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1058] From cosmological data's available, it can be observed that
      a very limited number of atomic hydrogen start the process of heat
      generation, leading to creation of stars and their respective
      systems. Where this process from start to finish takes billions of
      years, within the open spaces in the universe with all the
      probabilities of the maters and functions do not take place, and
      by law of average millions of stars are created every day in the
      galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      [1059] Where in this reactor the same conditions are created,
      under full pre determined control conditions, that nothing can be
      left to chance or probability, therefore the generation of the
      energy system like a sun become more natural, and heat can be
      produced in the universal way, rather then methods high molecular
      saturation systems used in the space technology of today, where
      tons of rocket full is used to lift a few tons of matter.<br>
      <br>
      [1060] Heating and ionisation due to magnetic reconnection by the
      matters in the Caroline core and the magnetic field of the outer
      cores<br>
      <br>
      [1061] Heating of the gases in the center of the core due to
      ionisation of hydrogen atoms is one of the reasons that the core
      temperature is maintained or increased.<br>
      <br>
      [1062] Due to design characteristics of this reactor, the other
      fundamental heating of the core gases will appear due to the
      magnetic reconnection of two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1063] Heating due to this effect will play a significant roll in
      any operational disciplines of these types of reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1064] It is paramount to notice that it's not only the magnetic
      reconnection of the two cores that effect the heating and the
      current production.<br>
      <br>
      [1065] At the same time the magnetic reconnection between the
      atoms and the molecules of the gases with the magnetic fields of
      each core or both cores will have a substantial effect on the
      operation of the reactor too.<br>
      <br>
      [1066] As the magnetic reconnection is at the atomic and molecular
      levels, at the same time this will allow direct energy transfers
      in both direction for the gases to carry each others energy and
      magnetic fields at the same time and concurrently.<br>
      <br>
      [1067] What this means is that the magnetic field of the molecules
      will carry the magnetic field of the atoms and the atoms being at
      weaker strength will collectively carry and allow the magnetic
      field of the molecules to carry them within their confinement of
      the magnetic energy field.<br>
      <br>
      [1068] This effect of magnetic reconnection creates higher
      equilibrium temperatures at lower density. Where heating due to
      magnetic field reconnection can increase significantly at
      low-density gas environment of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1069] In the galactic studies the combine effect of
      photoionization heating and the magnetic reconnection in a
      diffused ionised gas as in the center of the inner core has two
      heating rates, which the combination of the two will lead to
      heating through gas convection and ionisation convection and
      pressurisation of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1070] The amount of energy needed to sustain magnetic field
      depends to a large extent on the magnitude of the toroidal field
      in the core, where this is initially created by the rotation of
      the solid magnet due to rotation of the inner core and the
      rotation of the hydrogen layer and then the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [1071] In the spherical core which can maintain spherical magnetic
      field the toroidal field is considered to be about ten time the
      strength of the poloidal magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [1072] Cosmologist have proven that the dissipation of turbulence,
      in similar condition in the universe as in this reactor due to
      choice of matter, reactions created by the injection of
      scintillation material, which causes the turbulence in the gas
      layers, defiantly playas major role in heating the gases within
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1073] Another source of significant deposit of energy in the gas
      is the coulomb collision by near electrons that are in highly
      magnetised environment of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1074] As the interaction of two magnetic fields take over the
      rotation, then less hydrogen and scintillation material is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [1075] The gas mixture in the inner core has to be changed from
      higher hydrogen content to low percentage mix of hydrogen where
      the volume ratio and the density of hydrogen mixture will be
      determine the strength of the turbulence in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1076] When using high percentage hydrogen then Krypton and neon
      levels have to be raised in their volume ratio too.<br>
      <br>
      [1077] It has to be noticed, that, if plasma feed from the
      caroline core to the outer core, method is used, where using
      sodium this chamber, then the hydrogen which is feed back to the
      caroline core will be warm and atomic.<br>
      <br>
      [1078] Where, this reduces the need for irradiation period for the
      liquid helium in the scintillation chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1079] But there is a feature at 21-cm radio wavelength. Where by
      spins (magnetic field) hydrogen atoms nuclear proton and orbiting
      electron are the creators of radio wavelength energy source. Where
      the electron and proton electric charges interact with each to
      create minute magnetic fields. Up On their interaction creating a
      small energy difference between the state in which after
      excitation.<br>
      <br>
      [1080] This energy can become a significant player, as in the
      cosmic pattern, when the system is on a steady state operation,
      where the heat in the hydrogen levels can build up due to this
      effect in the presence of the existing magnetic field, which are
      all ready operating in the core, without the initiating ionisation
      in the hydrogen level.<br>
      <br>
      [1081] In scintillation system like this, the current for the
      energy will come from the helium and argon gas layer in the
      Caroline core and from the outer core metallic material layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1082] The energy created through magnetospheric effect of the two
      magnetic fields of the Caroline core and outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1083] The magnetic field of each core influences the motion of
      electrons and ions with differing effect, which these in turn are
      responsible for electric current that in turn perturbs the
      interface between the two magnetic fields, leading to the creation
      of heat at the interface of the two fields<br>
      <br>
      [1084] The electron flux created in the caroline core, and any
      other charge particles, in the region of the interface of the two
      magnetic field forces of the two cores, due to the motion of the
      two fields, and its interaction in the with magnetic fields will
      be influenced, and will have direct effect on the heating and
      current production in the interface, or the magnetosphere of the
      two fields.<br>
      <br>
      [1085] The energy release and charge releases in this layer is an
      unknown factor, as never before data's for such interaction in
      real condition has ever been carried out as never a double
      spherical magnetic field interaction in the lab ever been created.<br>
      <br>
      [1086] The closes data's available for these types of interactions
      are through studies done by NASA and Russian space industries
      through the magnetosphere of the earth between the interaction of
      the magnetic field of the earth and the sun in the presence of
      cosmic particles.<br>
      <br>
      [1087] Due to the interaction of these forces and the charge
      particle on a continuous bases, in the core of the reactor, the
      core of reactor will create an effect similar to the northern
      aurora at all time, when and where ever in the core this
      magnetospheric condition between two forces happens to take place,
      in the caroline core or in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1088] Where in these areas a large amount of heat in produced due
      to the charges of particle in the vicinity of the two fields.<br>
      <br>
      [1089] In the case that the magnetic field of the cores be pushed
      beyond the physical boundary of the system, in an atmospheric
      condition, then there will be a magnetospheric condition in
      between the system magnetic fields and the magnetic field of the
      planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1090] Where, this will create heating at the interface of the two
      planets and the system magnetosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [1091] Where at this point not only heating will take place, but
      at the same time, due to the interaction of magnetic fields and
      the charge particles in the atmosphere of the planet, will create
      energy at the visible light frequency, as in the case of the stars
      interaction with magnetic field of their planets, the colour of
      the light at the magnetosphere of the planet and the system will
      depend on the composition of the elements in the atmosphere of the
      planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1092] Where this heating effect of two magnetic fields has to be
      kept away from the physical body of the system, these
      magnetosphere field which is created by strengthening of the
      magnetic field of the system, will push the boundary of the
      interaction of the two magnetic field s away from the system, then
      the expansion in the area between the system and the actual
      magnetosphere of the system will become the magnetic shield of the
      system 1, in the atmosphere of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1093] This technique of pushing the magnetic field out of the
      boundary of the system, and its interaction with the magnetic
      field of the planet, used in a way, that, the magnetosphere field
      of two cores, or magnetosphere field interaction of the system and
      the planet, can be confined to a pin point or a long line, then
      the system can be used in a similar way as the welding torch 1,
      where the heat at the magnetosphere will be hot enough that can
      cause melting of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      [1094] Therefore this can weld any two matter together, even in
      the molecular or atomic level 1, for creation of 113-115 matter in
      periodic table 1 leading to manufacture of elements 1, and
      manufacture of dark matter 1, not in a fusion method but the
      atomic welding level to create new molecules, where there will not
      be a need for huge fusion energies to cross the coulomb barriers
      as has been tried in the fusion reactors.<br>
      <br>
      The measurement of the volume ratio of gases in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1095] The principal in the measurement of the volume of each gas
      in the core are determine by certain factors, the size of the
      core, the composition of materials in the core and the physical
      material that the core is made out off.<br>
      <br>
      [1096] The cores size can be the same, but due variation, be it
      very small, in the volume ratio of elements in the cores, or the
      pressure or temperature, the whole out put of the reactor can
      change profoundly.<br>
      <br>
      [1097] For example for a reactor that has originally designed for
      heating or power generation, where, the core starts with a small
      core of hydrogen, then the volume of the hydrogen layer can be
      increased to a new ratio level, where there is need for lesser of
      helium, for the core to become a total gravitational core.<br>
      <br>
      [1098] The most important principal behind the design of this
      reactor and function of each of its auxiliary systems in
      determining the size of the core and the volume ratio of element
      in each core is, to treat each layer of the elements at its own
      outer bounder, as the outer boundary of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1099] This means, for example, in calculating the power of the
      reactor for energy production, the last layer that will have an
      effect in the power of the reactor is Argon.<br>
      <br>
      [1100] Therefore the outer boundary of the argon is the total size
      of the reactor for power generation.<br>
      <br>
      [1101] Then the outer layers of gases after argon these being like
      krypton and xenon or any other matter in between and after up to
      the physical boundary of the inner core walls, are considered as
      only blanketing for absorbing materials for the heat or radiation
      or neutrons, within the same core.<br>
      <br>
      [1102] Therefore, when the reactor operation is said to have 20
      percent hydrogen for energy production, this means 20% of total
      volume ratio of the spherical boundary of the argon 100% volume,
      is taken by hydrogen, and not 20% of the volume of the whole of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1103] The other factor is the radius of the hydrogen layer in the
      inner core in case of full or half central column, for the purpose
      of uniform fields and energy production, the radius of the inner
      layer, this being hydrogen or helium has to be at least double the
      radius of its central column.<br>
      <br>
      [1104] For example, if the radius of the central column is chosen
      as 2 cm. Then the radius of the inner layer of the H has to be at
      least 4 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [1105] Therefore the measurement of gas layers and energy
      production of the reactor is determined by the size of the central
      column.<br>
      <br>
      [1106] This is a good guideline but there are exceptions to this
      rule for certain applications of these types of reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1107] For the purpose of ease in the calculation for the proto
      type, the radius of the Caroline core is considered to be 50 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [1108] The liquid helium is chosen as the scintillators.<br>
      <br>
      [1109] The strength of the scintillation is considered at alpha
      radiation source.<br>
      <br>
      [1110] All gases are considered to have 99.999% purity.<br>
      <br>
      [1111] The shape of the core under consideration is spherical.<br>
      <br>
      [1112] For calculation of the volume of gases,<br>
      <br>
      [1113] The volume of the sphere is said to be<br>
      <br>
      [1114] The total volume of the Caroline core with diameter of 1m<br>
      <br>
      [1115] Taking the radius of the central column to be 2.5 cm (5% of
      the radius of the core).<br>
      <br>
      [1116] Then doubling this to give the minimum size for the
      hydrogen layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1117] This gives a total diameter of 10 cm for the hydrogen
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1118] The volume of the hydrogen layer<br>
      <br>
      [1119] This determines the minimum possible volume, for near
      enough spherical energy production in the plasma and uniform
      magnetic field in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1120] The balance of the argon reactor core volume is field with,
      Kr, Xe.<br>
      <br>
      [1121] The thickness of theses layers will determine the outcome
      of the core behaviour, and the operation of the outer core, that
      is, for example the application of more Kr will bring to play
      better insulation, and less heat transfer to the outer core and so
      on.<br>
      <br>
      [1122] Where the increasing the volume of the Xe will increase the
      neutron absorption, but allowing more heat to be transferred to
      the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1123] The reason for small amount of Xe is the fact that the
      neutron trap at the scintillation chambers out let and in the
      lining of this chamber. This should eliminate presence of any
      neutron in the chamber. Then the level of Kr can be reduced and
      the balance is transfer to H and Ar levels.<br>
      <br>
      [1124] These variation in the volume of the gases in these layers
      in the beauty of the flexibility and control of these types of
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1125] An ideal gas (perfect gas) is one, which obeys Boyle's law.<br>
      <br>
      Where n is moles of gas, R is the gas constant which is dependent
      on the units of pressure and volume. R = 0.0821 L atm K&lt;-1&gt;
      mol&lt;-1&gt; , pressure is in atmospheres (atm), Volume is in
      liters (L), Temperature in Kelvin (K).<br>
      <br>
      [1126] Where<br>
      <br>
      [1127] It is important to notice that the masses of gasses used in
      these types of reactor are very small.<br>
      <br>
      [1128] But it has to be remembered that during the operation of
      the reactor the pressures and the temperatures will be increased
      by significant levels in presence of turbulence, ionisation and
      magnetic field operating in the core of the reactor. That is when
      the power of this type of reactor operation will manifest itself.<br>
      <br>
      [1129] That is why in the astro physics levels, planets can create
      energy and maintain gravity for billions of years, just with small
      amount of hydrogen in their caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1130] But during all the time the volume of the gases will remain
      more or less unchanged as the inner core parameters are fixed due
      to the design of the core, unless they are changed because of the
      operational demands.<br>
      <br>
      The mathematical calculation of the weight of the gases in the
      Caroline core<br>
      <br>
      [1131] A full mathematical calculation of simultaneous
      interactions, physical condition and changes of properties of all
      elements within the confined of the reactor core will be an
      impossible task.<br>
      <br>
      [1132] But it will be easier if the main parameters which can
      effect the output characteristic of the reactor could be
      considered individually, and then build in all changes step by
      step as new factors are introduced or new effects due to new
      factors start influencing the operation of the elements within the
      core into the mathematical calculation of the system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [1133] The important points that have to be kept under
      consideration at all time are the boundary and characteristics
      changes of the gases or elements within the cores, as these are
      not the same and uniform within across the cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1134] This means, that the a gas layer might have one centimetre
      thickness in north west quarters of the reactor, but at the same
      time the same gas layer might have two centimeters thickness in
      the south east sector of the same core due to influences of the
      scintillation concentration input into the hydrogen gas layer in
      one moment and with next injection of the scintillation into the
      core the thickness reverses completely, which might have slightly
      different characteristic at that point in the reactor core.<br>
      <br>
      [1135] These changes will effect the temperature distribution,
      electron production, thickness of plasma and current production,
      and the strength of the magnetic fields in these regions.<br>
      <br>
      [1136] For these reasons in the present calculations three basic
      criterion are considered and adhered to during the calculations
      volume of gases in the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1137] First, is that the gases will have and keep uniformity of
      their thickness and positioning in each layers across the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1138] Second, is that the current output of the core will be
      constant and without serge in different poles of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1139] Thirdly, the magnetic fields generated by the cores are
      uniform at all times all over the reactor internal and external
      surroundings.<br>
      <br>
      [1140] The most important factor in any calculations of this type
      and with this complexity, is to brings into play the need for
      certain restriction and enforced boundaries conditions in any
      integral calculations, but efforts will be made not to have to
      enforce any of these restricting parameters, as these are new type
      of reactors, and very new feature will be unique and interesting
      to be observed and noted for its overall behaviour and the out put
      of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1141] Important issues which will play important factors in the
      operation of these reactors calculation, which will be in most
      cases far from the reality of the actualities of what is going on
      in the real situation operation of the reactor, is that each gas
      layer in the core will have different temperatures due to the
      blanketing by the immediate layers above or below it, which these
      will put great strain on the theoretical mathematical calculations
      which is to be preformed for the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1142] At the same time as the reactor reaches its full operation
      mode the interaction of the magnetic fields forces of two cores
      will play extremely important factor in the whole interaction of
      all the elements in the core and the ultimate output of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1143] This factor is unknown to any mathematical data, which
      could be considered or has or is available in the world of
      technology or scientific research reports as of today.<br>
      <br>
      [1144] Therefore for this purpose, to take this factor into
      account in the parameter calculation of the reactor, these factors
      are given new integral called the magnetic force integral and
      gravitational integral, which their values in each layer and each
      section and across three dimensional boundaries of cores are
      unknown and needed to be considered and implemented in any future
      calculations.<br>
      <br>
      [1145] This magnetic force or presence of magnetic filed strength
      factor, will play an extremely important part (specially in the
      region of hydrogen up to outer boundary of the argon layer) in the
      output of the current and gravitational forces generated by the
      reactor as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [1146] In these calculations and for the preliminary conditions of
      the operation of the reactor the influence of the earth magnetic
      field force and gravitational forces are initially not considered
      to have effect on the performance of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1147] In the real operational condition of this reactor for
      gravitational performances this factor can not be ignored. As the
      reactor is primarily designed to work within this force field,
      then the operation of the reactor is totally calculated in respect
      to the magnetic and gravitational force field of the earth, not to
      fight to overcome it, but to work along and within it, to create
      lift and descend, for the system which the reactor is operating
      within it.<br>
      <br>
      [1148] Therefore an integral factor for gravity and magnetic field
      with the boundary effective in positive or negative for the
      combination of the two cores magnetic forces fields, which have to
      be considered at all time during the operation of the reactor.
      Which each these will change for each layer of the gas and
      electron flow density during the operation of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1149] In these types of reactors due to the use of inert gases
      unless non gaseous material or vapour metallic material of heaver
      elements are introduced into the core for specific operation,
      delays in the appearance of the electron or magnetic fields of any
      sorts are considered to be negligible and all processes are
      considered to be instantaneous and not with delay factor.<br>
      <br>
      [1150] For fuel loading purposes, the calculation of the volume of
      gases are considered to be in total volume ratio in relation to
      the whole of the volume of each core.<br>
      <br>
      [1151] If overheating of the gases in the outer gas layers are
      noticed the volume ratio of neon layer can be increased to 25
      percent. The increase in neon layer will be compensated by the
      reduction in the argon layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1152] The increase in the neon layer will increase the
      temperature in the plasma layer and this has to be under
      consideration for smooth operation of the core. At the same time
      the choice of strong scintillation material will effect the
      temperature in the argon layer which means the krypton layer has
      to be increased if the heat follow to the outer core to be
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [1153] The neon layer will under high pressures due to turbulence
      and increase in the temperature and magnetic pressures in the core
      will have duel effect.<br>
      <br>
      [1154] Where it will keep the heat in the inner layers but at the
      same time will not allow the follow of heat from the energy
      releases by the ions in the argon layer to be returned to the
      plasma to heat this layer up.<br>
      <br>
      [1155] The choice of the ratio of the volume of the neon layer
      will effect the operational procedure of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1156] Neon is one of the best insulators in a vacume and pressure
      conditions, as with argon and krypton, therefore the volume ratio
      of the variation in this layer thickness will play important part
      in the whole outcome of the capabilities of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1157] For the preliminary start up condition for the reactor
      operation the initial gas volume ratios are important.<br>
      <br>
      [1158] These values are calculated on the bases of the possible
      ionisation and heat absorption of the gases induced into the
      cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1159] The initial test volume of gas ratios are set to one of the
      minimum volume ratio of hydrogen and one of the maximum volume
      ration of hydrogen in the center of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1160] The two preliminary volume ratio percentage of the gases in
      the inner core are considered to be in the following orders<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Hydrogen&nbsp; Helium&nbsp; Neon&nbsp; Argon&nbsp;
      krypton&nbsp; Xenon&nbsp; scintillation Medium&nbsp; source<br>
      <br>
      1&nbsp; 2.4&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 13.6&nbsp; 59&nbsp; 12&nbsp; 8&nbsp;
      LHe&nbsp; Alpha &amp; Beta<br>

      LHe&nbsp; Alpha &amp; Beta<br>
      <br>
      [1161] For calculation of above values refer to calculation
      appendix 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1162] The condition 1 is for testing the ionisation capability
      and temperature control at the start up. Where, the condition 2 is
      for rapid heat, current and magnetic field production.<br>
      <br>
      [1163] The volume of the plasma at the start up is considered to
      be zero. In the operational mode the plasma will be considered as
      the overall volume ratio of the hydrogen layer in the center of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1164] Where the Alpha source usually energy release to the helium
      scintillation medium in the Mev range and the beta energy release
      is in the several hundreds Kev.<br>
      <br>
      [1165] Only a fraction of the pure hydrogen atom are permitted to
      ionise by the injection of the scintillation material, as one
      hundred percent ionisation of the atoms of the hydrogen will lead
      to unstable reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1166] Due to rotation speed of the plasma and high velocities of
      the gas and plasma the maximum allowed value of the ionisation of
      hydrogen atoms are considered to be at 25% of the total atoms of
      this gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1167] Due to other factors like the purity of gases and no
      metallic elements in the core, the maximum allowed volume ratio of
      the hydrogen atoms to be in this region for safe operation is
      considered to be between 3% to 17% of the total hydrogen atoms
      available in the active core.<br>
      <br>
      [1168] The active core is considered to be up to boundary of the
      Argon and the Krypton layer, where there on, it is considered as
      blanketing section of the reactor core.<br>
      <br>
      [1169] For the purpose of calculation in this experimental
      procedure, two sources are to be used, one for alpha source, this
      will be considered to be Po 210 with an energy release of 5.3 Mev
      and one of beta source of Sn 113 with a line of energy of 364 Kev.<br>
      <br>
      [1170] These are considered to be relatively weak sources of
      radiation, where the EUV yield of liquid helium for Sn 113 source
      is considered to be normal.<br>
      <br>
      [1171] Considering starting operation temperature at 20-degree
      centigrade (293 K) at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [1172] The enforced physical pressure operation within the inner
      core at the start of the operation is considered to be at one
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [1173] The vacume condition in the core is at 10&lt;-6&gt;
      -10&lt;-8&gt; Torr.<br>
      <br>
      [1174] The pressures in the reactor core will change due to
      impulse ionisation of hydrogen and induced magnetic field
      pressures from the two cores and their interactions upon each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      [1175] An ideal gas (perfect gas) is one, which obeys Boyle's law.<br>

      [1184] It is important to notice that the masses of gasses used
      are very small.<br>
      <br>
      [1185] But it has to be remembered that during the operation of
      the reactor, pressures and temperatures will be increased by
      significant levels.<br>
      <br>
      [1186] That is when the power of this type of reactor operation
      will manifest itself.<br>
      <br>
      [1187] That is why in the astro physics levels, planets can create
      energy and maintain gravity for billions of years, with small
      amount of hydrogen in their Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1188] All time during the operation of the reactor, the volume of
      the gases will remain more or less unchanged, as the Caroline core
      parameters are the fixed.<br>
      <br>
      [1189] This forcing new operational characteristic from each gas,
      which these will be out off normal characteristic for each gas for
      generating energy as the molecular magnetic field forces will
      exert their powers in the core in a unexpected and new way.<br>
      <br>
      [1190] It is very feasible that during the test operation the
      inner core is allowed to go through some levels of decompression,
      as the pressures of the gases in the inner core, due to ionisation
      heating, magnetic and turbulence increases.<br>
      <br>
      [1191] For safety purposes the cores could or might dictate
      depressurisation procedure, which was not inline with plan
      discipline of the operation.<br>
      <br>
      [1192] Considering in the case of operation of the core, where
      temperatures in the region at 500 degree centigrade are attained
      due to all factors influencing the temperature of gases in the
      inner core, then using the equation 2 for argon layer in the set 1
      gas ratio<br>
      <br>
      [1193] This pressure is totally due to heat due to ionisation, and
      included the ionisation pressures, included considering the
      pressure due to magnetic field of the two cores, including the
      pressures due to rotation and compression of the gases due to
      convection and turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      [1194] For high temperature and pressure discipline reactors,
      different scintillation materials, like neon is used for the core
      which have helium in the center core material instead of the
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [1195] Energise of 13.6 eV can ionise hydrogen, for liquid helium
      to ionise hydrogen atoms it has to transfer this amount of energy
      to hydrogen through EUV.<br>
      <br>
      [1196] Assuming that energy from one ionisation photon from the
      EUV can only lead to one ionisation of hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [1197] Given the high EUV yield of liquid helium of 22000 photons
      per Mev for beta particle from Sn 113 source with line energy of
      364 Kev.<br>
      <br>
      [1198] This gives a starting point for the valuation of energy
      released by ionisation of the hydrogen initiated by the
      scintillation material.<br>
      <br>
      [1199] Taking 80% ionisation yield of hydrogen atoms of the inner
      layer by scintillation material EUV.<br>
      <br>
      [1200] To ionise an atom of helium energies of about 24.6 eV
      (2372.3 KJ/mole) and to ionise a molecule of helium energies of
      about 57.2 eV is required.<br>
      <br>
      [1201] To ionise an atom of Hydrogen energies of about 13.6 eV
      (1312 KJ/mole) is required.<br>
      <br>
      [1202] Taking into account that 1 gram of hydrogen contains
      6*10&lt;23&gt; atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Taking into account that 1.6* 10&lt;-13 Jules&gt; is equal to 1
      Mev.<br>
      <br>
      Taking into account that some of the electrons released by
      hydrogen will be absorbed in the helium layer electron pick up
      points. Thus the ratio of electron reaching the argon layer is not
      the full 100% total electrons released by scintillation material.<br>
      <br>
      [1203] The alternative method of measuring the weight of the gases
      or material, is to consider the vacume, zero atmospheric
      condition, which is more realistic, as in the conditions in the
      galaxy's, as the atmospheric condition is a manmade toll of
      measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [1204] Then the volume ratios matters in each core of any reactor
      will be totally different, and the system will be highly stable
      but extremely electromagnetic and the magnetic energy creation
      will be very powerful system.<br>

      The production and assembly of the prototype--&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [1205]<br>
      <br>
      1. The reactor design and production.<br>
      <br>
      A) The central core;<br>
      <br>
      i) The casting or machining of central core, including the
      attached central column.<br>
      <br>
      ii) The lining and coating of the core against corrosion and
      chemical interaction with hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      iii) The production of the mounting, feeding and the sealing
      mechanism of the centre core on the outer core walls.<br>
      <br>
      B) The outer core;<br>
      <br>
      i) The casting, machining or producing the cores as one piece.<br>
      <br>
      ii) The lining and coating of the core against corrosion and
      chemical interaction with gases or materials used for cooling.<br>
      <br>
      2. The gases input supply.<br>
      <br>
      The gas supplies and appropriates pumps and connection as in the
      diagrams.<br>
      <br>
      3. The motoring system.<br>
      <br>
      This is the normal magnetic or normal motor needed for the
      rotation of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      This could be bought off the shelf.<br>
      <br>
      4. The turbo molecular system for control of the vacume conditions
      of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      This system can be bought off the shelf.<br>
      <br>
      6. The cooling system.<br>
      <br>
      This is the high pressure cooling gas pump to facilitate the
      removal of the heat from whole system's outer core. This is an
      auxiliary system for prototype safety test condition.<br>
      <br>
      7. The control system.<br>
      <br>
      This is combination of the electrical and mechanical system
      control needed to be designed and produced according to the step
      by step discipline operation of the all parts of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1206] This is an important part of the design. Every step from
      start up of the centre core to the maintaining the magnetic forces
      are to be planed a head through this system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation of the reactor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1207] The volume of each gas is pre-determined according to what
      for the system is to be used and for how long.<br>
      <br>
      [1208] The volume ratio of any element used in these types of
      reactor is only dependent on the density of the materials in the
      cores of the rector.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of these types of reactor is based on the principal
      of very low material density, where the properties of atomic
      structure will be enhanced to manifest itself under controlled
      gravitational field and in presence of magnetic field structure
      parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [1209] This method of energy and gravity generation is not known
      to the world of science as of now, in time the strength of the
      this method of energy and gravitation creation will become
      apparent, as scientist will come to realise that the whole
      structure of the all elements start's from atomic structure of the
      element, and what is in that level is inherent in the mother of
      the element, which is atom of the element.<br>
      <br>
      [1210] Therefore, what is not in the structure of the atom can not
      exist in the structure of its larger version of elements, which
      are made of it, in tangible level of the physical material.<br>
      <br>
      [1211] Then why to try to handle a high density molecular or solid
      matter of an element, where all the attribute of the mater can be
      collectively attained in the atomic structure of the material,
      where the density is low and the real power of the atom of the
      material can manifest itself.<br>
      <br>
      [1212] This is the principal that all systems start their lives
      in, at atomic level, then they attain their other physical matters
      and properties structure around them later in their cycle of
      existence, through their original basic original atomic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [1213] Where in the world of continuity, for a mater to exist and
      for it to hold on to its material, the system has to keep its
      essence of its original creation to build on it, which in the case
      of solar systems is the simple atomic structure which allowed it
      to start life, then they hold to this basic material in the
      original atomic level in their inner sanctum, and they build on it
      to become the giant stars and solar system.<br>
      <br>
      [1214] One can not lose its origin of its existence, in any levels
      of the universal order, therefore the origin of the solar systems
      in atomic structure, which is not dense, and that is the principal
      which will be followed in the operation of this reactor, low
      density of the mater in atomic and molecular level, that within a
      soft magnetic field and proportional volume ratio, the system will
      show its potency<br>
      <br>
      [1215] A simple analytical energy requirement of the system will
      dictates the volume of each gas to be feed in to each core.<br>
      <br>
      [1216] To start the system, the valve for the excited liquid
      helium at high pressure is opened, this is to allow the liquid
      helium, or in other method for introducing scintillation to
      interact with hydrogen, which is the caries the EUV necessary for
      ionisation of the Hydrogen to be sucked into the caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1217] The time liquid helium, or any other scintillation
      material, under pressure spends within the pressure chamber in
      presence of any radioactive material, for it to be excited is very
      important.<br>
      <br>
      [1218] This is due to two atomic important factors, one is that
      how much of the molecules of the helium is needed to be excited or
      on other word how much EUV energy is needed in the core of the
      reactor for certain purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [1219] Secondly the life cycle of the EUV is very short; time is
      the essence of the whole injection and amount of energy absorbed
      by helium during the interaction with radioactive sore.<br>
      <br>
      [1220] In other methods of EUV generation, the time of the
      exposure of the hydrogen to release the required ionisation takes
      priority and determines the duration of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [1221] The physical shape of the radioactive source can be made in
      a porous manner. Where the minimum time for the maximum level of
      EUV is needed for the liquid helium to spend in this pressurised
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1222] It has to be noticed that pressure in this reactor is
      created by the combinations of hydrogen and helium heating due to
      ionisation and their return to ground state level. By them losing
      their energy to the argon gas as the catalyst, which in turn this
      lose of energy heats the plasma up, the design of the
      scintillation unit is shown in this diagram for the liquid version
      1/1114.7.051 .<br>
      <br>
      [1223] Secondly the pressurisation is enforced by the outer
      magnetic field to squeeze the plasma in the caroline core too,
      where the magnetic files created in the caroline core will have
      the same pressures on the molecules of the gases in the same core
      at same time too.<br>
      <br>
      [1224] Pressures created in this type of reactor's, will be as in
      more natural and both in molecular and atomic level, which are
      more efficient and have a more profound effect for running of
      system using natural methods of energy and motion.<br>
      <br>
      [1225] Through this system one learns to approach the energy
      production totally in a natural way as it is done in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [1226] Rather then the methods which one has become accustomed
      too, due to earth energy resources, this being to create heat then
      convert it to steam then to cover it to electricity to be able to
      make use of the energy.<br>
      <br>
      [1227] One of the problems in the past with all the fusion
      reactors have been, that the radiation and neutron leakage and
      heating are handled outside the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1228] To solve these problems outside the reactor core becomes
      many times harder as seen in fission and fusion reactors of the
      present time. Some times these become impossible to solve.<br>
      <br>
      [1229] In this reactor all problems are sorted according to
      natural cosmic methods, as in stars and planets have overcome
      these problems over billions of years (by using other elements in
      the universe to attain their positioning and elements and
      characteristic).<br>
      <br>
      [1230] Noble gases are used in these reactors readily, inert gases
      and other elements are added to the core through center column to
      create and maintain certain effects as required from system.<br>
      <br>
      [1231] Therefore all problems should and has to overcome with use
      of different elements inside the core, before neutrons and
      radiation can leak from the boundary of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1232] Then solution like blanketing and concrete containment in
      the outside of the core is not necessary, and this is the beauty
      of this system.<br>
      <br>
      [1233] Where all the problems including nuclear, heating, motion
      and gravity are resolved within the core naturally as it is done
      in the universe, before these reaches to the outer boundary of the
      reactor are naturally handled, let's call this an alternative
      nuclear therapy. Which has worked from the beginning of time in
      the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [1234] The choice of vacuum eliminates the use of high-speed
      operation and rotation of the chamber during the normal operation
      of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1235] This eliminates a continues use of high speed rotation, as
      gases are in vacuum separate according to their atomic weight,
      therefore separation of layers of gases through centrifuge does
      not come in to play.<br>
      <br>
      [1236] High speed of the core only will come to play for rapid
      changes in the gravity (positive or negative direction).<br>
      <br>
      [1237] The rotation of the core at low speeds is necessary for
      creation of the magnetic and current and heat purposes. This
      concept is well documented in the turbulent flow with rotation in
      the vacuum research papers.<br>
      <br>
      [1238] The turbulence in this system is created through the
      hydrogen expansion through heating and ionisation phase, this
      expansion will be as shockwave in the gas.<br>
      <br>
      [1239] These gases in the center chamber are already rotating due
      to the rotation of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1240] At point where normal and continues operation is attained,
      the main compression of the plasma in the inner core will be
      maintained by the action of the sequential feed of irradiated
      helium.<br>
      <br>
      [1241] This will behave as pulse injected turbulence in creating
      energy and heat and brings the last part for the production of
      heat and gravity into play.<br>
      <br>
      [1242] The effect of the layering of the gases will bring into
      play the differential gradient rotational speed, where the
      differential speed of the gases will create the natural effects of
      creating the current and the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [1243] By this stage of operation, the turbulence, compression,
      temperature, speed of the rotation of the gas due to inner core
      and the magnetic field in the core will come to play their part in
      the operation of the this reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1244] Where the speed of the inner core for example at the start
      could be considered to be vary high up to 1000-4500 rpm, this is
      to help with rotation and centrifugal and separating all gas
      molecules into the center of the core, until the interaction
      between magnetic fields from the outer and the caroline core takes
      over the rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [1245] But at the sometime as the vacuum chamber is used in this
      rector core and sequential pumping is in operation for circulation
      of each gas element separately if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [1246] The rotational speed of the core is necessary for the
      creation and maintenance of the electron follow, that the magnetic
      fields in the core of the inner core could be maintained, does not
      require high speed rotation of the core and speed of the core ill
      be reduced to about less than 300 revolution per minute.<br>
      <br>
      [1247] In the future developments, the effect created by this
      rotation of the gases for stability of the core, could be utilised
      to push back to the boundary of interaction of the magnetic fields
      beyond the boundary of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1248] This is another method of the combination of energy, and
      gravity system, which the boundary of the outer core will be used
      for the shielding effect. So the inner core maintenance of the
      magnetic field will cover the content of the craft for constant
      gravitation forces 1 (This will be like the present compression
      system used in jetliner at high altitude. Where the gravity will
      be controlled and created by the caroline core and the outer
      magnetic field through the speed of the rotation of gas flow
      circulation in the reactor of the system 1).<br>
      <br>
      [1249] Later in the high temperature mode, and creation of the
      magnetic field due to convection principals in the outer core,
      will be used for the magnetic field confinement of the plasma in
      the caroline core, and the shielding effect of the whole system,
      will be done by the outer core magnetic field 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1250] This will be operated at very low speed of rotation at
      about 10 &gt; 250 rpm (Note that the speed of the inner core at
      the interface with the outer core of the earth for convection is
      only about 340 Km/h). Magnetic fields created by the convection do
      not need high speed of rotation of their solid containment body 1.
      As the magnetic field created is only for containment of the
      plasma in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1251] Convection magnetism is not and does not behave as solid
      magnet or rotary solid magnet. But they have more influential
      power than their solid counter parts on molecular structural
      levels in creating magnetism, pressures and gravity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Start-up of reactor condition</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1252] Before any start-up, the whole system has to be secured to
      the ground by means of steel belt and riveted mechanise.<br>
      <br>
      [1253] The reason for this is two fold, one the system is
      gravitational system so the first step power of magnetic field are
      unknown, secondly the reactor belt can be looseen later to note
      the effect of gravitational variation during test, where the
      system has to be flexible. All connection to the system has to be
      flexible and extendable, so that the gas feed and electric out put
      cables can allow for movement of the system<br>
      <br>
      Stage one;<br>
      <br>
      Connection of all the gases containers to the core feeder pipe
      line.<br>
      <br>
      Connection of the return reverse tank to the cores.<br>
      <br>
      Connection of the scint - pipe to the inner core center column
      direct.<br>
      <br>
      All valves at close position.<br>
      <br>
      Stage Two;<br>
      <br>
      Normal cleaning up of the inner and outer core through the turbo
      molecular pump.<br>
      <br>
      The desired level of vacuum at about 10&gt;-6 Torr.<br>
      <br>
      The turbo molecular pump has to have separate connections to the
      Caroline core, the outer core and the reverse tanks.<br>
      <br>
      Stage three;<br>
      <br>
      The Caroline core is feed through the feeder pipe in the following
      order;<br>
      <br>
      Ionisations of gases are not necessary in the first run. But if
      desired condition are not achieved different method of ionisation
      of gases are open for testing.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the Xe gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the Kr gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the Ar gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the Ne gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the He gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      Feed of the hydrogen gas by the predetermined volume.<br>
      <br>
      These gases will take their appropriate positions in the core
      according to their atomic weight in the vacuumed centrifuge
      condition of the core.<br>
      <br>
      Stage four;<br>
      <br>
      The motor to start at high speed at about 3000-4000 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      (This allows the cleansing of any impurities through centrifuge in
      the gases due to their atomic weight to be drown out, to in
      between layers of gases, through the use of pump and negative
      vacuumed chamber condition gases impurities if need be can be
      withdrawn from the interlayer of the gases), using the boreholes
      at appropriate levels unwanted gases and other impurities at each
      level is pumped out in to the reveres tank.<br>
      <br>
      This is achieved by opening the reveres tank valve and reducing
      the pressure in the reveres tank.<br>
      <br>
      By allowing any impurities at this stage which reaches the revere
      tank through roughing pump to be disposed of. This method can be
      use in regular interval to clean the cores from any impurities,
      later on replacing any volume of gases that might have been
      siphoned back to the cores.<br>
      <br>
      Stage five;<br>
      <br>
      Open the pressurised liquid helium valve to allow the
      scintillation to take place.<br>
      <br>
      In sequence the outlet valve from the scintillation is opened,
      that predetermined measure of the irradiated liquid helium can be
      sucked into the vacuum Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      Stage six;<br>
      <br>
      To start with, this has to be done in small increments, for not to
      over produce ionise hydrogen, that the temperature increases in
      the core can be controlled and monitored.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly the ionisation will create shockwaves which are not good
      for the other gases and the containment vessel.<br>
      <br>
      Stage seven;<br>
      <br>
      When the magnetic fields take over in the Caroline core. The
      hydrogen ionisation compression will not have such an impact, than
      at the cold start condition.<br>
      <br>
      Stage eight;<br>
      <br>
      To use the electric connection at Argon level to tap energy from
      the reactor direct for energy test out put.<br>
      <br>
      [1254] Possible power output at start up could be in the region of
      10 kw to 100 kw, at full operation powers in 1000 kw plus will be
      normal operation.<br>
      <br>
      [1255] Appropriate meters for the wide range of out put has to be
      accommodated from the outset of the design.<br>
      <br>
      [1256] It is recommended that the prototype reactor to be fixed
      with high temperature and pressure gauges along the length of the
      center column. This is for safety reasons until the full operation
      of the core is completely determined.<br>
      <br>
      [1257] Temperature changes will not only effect the volume of the
      gases, as it is pre- determined confinement.<br>
      <br>
      [1258] The pressure and radiation gauges are recommended on the
      inner core boundary near the xenon porthole.<br>
      <br>
      [1259] Pressure in operation mode more than any other in this
      reactor is magnetic than kinetic.<br>
      <br>
      [1260] There is a need for flow speed gauges specialty in the
      argon level. Pumps can be used in this level to vary the speed of
      the gas. So the magnetic field of the core could be controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [1261] All gauges can be accessed through the central column
      portholes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The principal output measurement
        parameters of the reactor</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1262] The most important principal in the control of values of
      the outputs of the system is controlled by different parameters of
      the feed and the internal cause and effects of the different cores
      or the elements in the cores of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1263] These could be categorised in the following manner.<br>
      <br>
      A) The pressures<br>
      <br>
      1. Pressure due to scintillation feed and the ionisation of the
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      2. Magnetic pressures, due to inner core and outer core magnetic
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      3. Pressures due to the heating generated by the magnetosphere
      interface of the two magnetic fields. Leading to expansion of the
      gases in the inner core central region.<br>
      <br>
      4. Pressures created due to heating of the gases due to
      compression wave from the feed and the rotation of the gas layers.<br>
      <br>
      B) Temperatures<br>
      <br>
      1. Increase in temperature of the plasma due to the catalyses
      effect of the helium, Argon and Xenon gas layers.<br>
      <br>
      2 Temperature increases in the core due to the interface
      interaction of magnetosphere of two fields and the charge particle
      within the core.<br>
      <br>
      3. Temperature increases of the plasma, due to secondary effects
      of the ionisation and the catalyst. This could cause substantial
      heat for the plasma of the system.<br>
      <br>
      4. Temperature increase in the plasma due to compressive,
      rotating, in a magnetic and vacume environment.<br>
      <br>
      [1264] Which overall effect of the above will determine the power
      outputs of the system, creating or assisting in the generation of
      current and magnetic field of the system powers and output, and
      gravitational field forces of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1265] The current output will be a collective outcome of the
      following charges created within and through the systems design.<br>
      <br>
      [1266] Due to electron flow through ionisation of the hydrogen
      atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Due to secondary electron flow after interaction of excited
      electrons with catalytic matters like helium and argon gas layers.<br>
      <br>
      [1267] There are some other miner electric charges created due to
      rotation and vacume condition of the core as well. Which, these
      will make some contribution to the output of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1268] There are electric current produced due to the rotation
      convection of the heated plasma within a vacuum environment of the
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1269] In special designs the alternative current due to cable
      winding of the core has to be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [1270] The measurement of the magnetic and gravitational forces of
      the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1271] These measurements and calibrations of these fields and
      forces create have to be done by empirical method for this system.<br>
      <br>
      [1272] These are unknown forces that never have been created
      within a system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes and safety</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1273] Handling fusion temperatures of operation is not an easy
      task. But the design for them has already been done.<br>
      <br>
      As these reactors at prototype conditions are not expect to reach
      such production of heat for the power reactors, the design for
      fusion reactor will be disclosed in detail in the future.<br>
      <br>
      [1274] The only effect, which can bring this type of reactor to
      some malfunction, is the interaction of the double magnetic field
      effect up on each other.<br>
      <br>
      [1275] Or creation of other magnetic fields due to motion and eddy
      currents, like magnetic files called bobbling between the layers
      of gases due to different speed or compression between different
      layers of the gasses.<br>
      <br>
      [1276] Which this will /and can lead to mine magnetic fields
      within the two principal magnetic fields of the two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1277] Where and if these mine magnetic fields are not controlled
      by continuously varying one of their parameters within the core
      like the speed of rotation or turbulence of the gases, these mine
      magnetic fields can combine together and create new effects and
      out come from the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1278] One of these effects from the interaction of combination of
      these mine magnetic fields can lead to the shutdown of the
      reactor. Where the magnetic field will grow and gather enough
      strength to pull all the matters in the core into one unsent
      magnetic field, that the outer magnetic field would not have
      enough power to over come this runaway condition.<br>
      <br>
      [1279] Where the inner core will absorb all the matter within
      itself and nothing can leak out of the center core not even heat.
      This is exactly how black holes in the universe are created (read
      the paper on creation of black hole released by M T Keshe). This
      is what will be called as black whole condition or Zhubeen State
      of operation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1280] This is how; it is proven that the black hole theory
      condition is a temporary one in the universe. That the black holes
      leak once one of the magnetic forces or parameters around them
      changes its position. If one of the parameters like the speed of
      the rotation is slightly changed this condition could be avoided
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [1281] For the first time man can observe the phenomena of
      creation of a black hole in a close circuit within this reactor
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1282] If this phenomenon is used and understood through the
      operation of this reactor core! Then the derma of the wormhole
      through the operation of this reactor is become reality 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1283] If the interaction of two of these mine magnetic forces
      occurs on the edge of the inner chamber leading to creation of
      bobble, at the physical boundary of the gases and the core walls.
      Then this will, as what is seen on the surface of the sun, as
      interaction of two magnetic fields and the creation of the dark
      spots 1, as on the surface of the sun, which is the same as the
      creation what is called the magnetic surface bobbles in these
      reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [1284] This condition in the cores where neutrons are deliberately
      are allowed to be generated for the desired operational out put,
      could create neutron flux in these regions, where they will be
      gathered in these magnetic voids. Then these magnetic conditions
      must and have to be removed by change in one of the parameters of
      the core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1285] The sudden release of the large amount of neutron by these
      bobbles in the immediate vicinity of the walls of the chamber and
      especially near xenon gas will be recipe for disaster.<br>
      <br>
      [1286] Where xenon poisoning and sudden increase in the
      temperature of the core vessel wall is a highly possible. Then,
      what is known, as Chernovel syndrome will and can repeat itself.<br>
      <br>
      [1287] Due to magnetic fields and compression of the hydrogen atom
      in the core of the reactor, if there are any x-rays produced for
      whatever condition and reason, these will soon interact with
      helium molecules, which in turn will ionise more atoms of hydrogen
      in the gas. As hydrogen will not create x-rays due to its inherent
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [1288] Any radiation created under compression and high-density
      gas will be soon consumed and absorbed in the krypton and xenon
      layer, as they are the blanketing parameters of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1289] High intensity radiations are not expected in this type of
      the reactor at all.<br>
      <br>
      [1290] But if this happens, this will not be expected to cause
      such drastic effects. As presence of the containment plasma due to
      its direction of enforcement of magnetic field force (inward and
      compressive) will effect the behaviour of the loose rays. These
      will be feed back into the plasma and or soften in their strength
      that can not cause harm and be absorbed in the cycle of heat
      production.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shutdown and safety of the
        reactor core</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1291] The operation and safety of this reactor is simple during
      any operational discipline.<br>
      <br>
      [1292] This can be broken down in the following categories.<br>
      <br>
      1. The Extreme Ultraviolet source.<br>
      <br>
      A. Total loses of the irradiated material into the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1293] In this case the system is totally lost. Reactor has to
      safely be disposed off as a contaminated object.<br>
      <br>
      [1294] All valves have to be shutdown automatically at every level
      of operation.<br>
      <br>
      [1295] There should be an overriding system to make sure secondary
      valves seals activate.<br>
      <br>
      That all the core boundaries access through all portholes and
      reveres tanks are sealed in one step. This is done through
      computer program critical condition operation.<br>
      <br>
      [1296] At the first detection of radiation in the core gases in
      the reverse tanks. There should be over riding program that system
      goes to shutdown. Starting with feed valve from the scintillators
      in the first step immediately.<br>
      <br>
      [1297] If the reactor has been in power mode, the temperature of
      the core will/ could cause vapour-irradiated material. In this
      case nuclear reactions between other gases become a high
      possibility, causing chain of radioactive reactions. This is not
      expected in the prototype reactor<br>
      <br>
      [1298] It is important that the heavier gases of the core are
      immediately withdrawn from the inner core first safely. That no
      neutrons are released, by the interaction of the radioactive
      material and molecules of the gases.<br>
      <br>
      [1299] The next step is the immediate feed of liquid CO2 into the
      outer core to cool the reactor boundary to manageable condition.
      This gas has to be able to circulate that the temperature of the
      core is kept at lowest as possible.<br>
      <br>
      [1300] It can not be forgotten that, one is dealing with a very
      small amount of radioactive material in experimental and
      gravitational automotive reactors. So leakage are not so drastic.<br>
      <br>
      [1301] If the leakage is not excessive! Evacuation is not
      necessary. But protection clothing for handling is absolutely
      essential.<br>
      <br>
      [1302] This failure is assumed to be the most common occurrence in
      the automotive use of the system. Where, these types of accidents
      will be common occurrence. Where the core is protected, but if
      liquid scintillation method is used, the EUV source as separate
      source can break lose or the valve malfunctions in the course of
      operation or because of sudden crush or damage to the system due
      to fall from heights is foreseen.<br>
      <br>
      B. Over exposed irradiated scintillated agent, which enters the
      inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1303] This being, helium or Neon liquid gas. This can create
      serge in the pressure, temperature and current flow in the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1304] In the future Xenon will be an option for the
      scintillation. But the technology is at its infancy.<br>
      <br>
      [1305] In this case the core has to be flooded by high pressure
      Neon gases. Neon will and is the best cooling gas. But it absorbs
      heat much easier through, what it receives from argon and itself
      has the capability to slowdown the electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [1306] The usual and the more convenient method of controlling
      such a serge, this will be to build in the system, that one or
      several subsequent injection of scintillation material feed into
      the core is deliberately missed. By this allowing the system to
      calm down.<br>
      <br>
      2 The lose of the inner core<br>
      <br>
      A. The core could be dislodges and shatters or open up in to the
      outer core confinement, because of so many reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [1307] A general approach will take care of extreme conditions and
      the rest of possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      [1308] The core, up on fracture and shattering or dislodge from
      its magnetic bearing or any other methods of rotation creating
      system, the first line of defence in the first instance has to be
      the capability to stop injection feed of the scintillation
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [1309] Its important that the scintillation unit has a safety
      characteristic built in its design, that any sudden changes in the
      vacume temperature or pressure will aborts this feed. That no new
      material is feed into the new environment created due damages of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1310] This system control will be advantageous and usable for all
      failure possibilities of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1311] Considering extreme case of roll-off of the inner core from
      its position, then immediate shattering to pieces penetrating the
      physical boundary of the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      These are the most serious sonorous which can happen<br>
      <br>
      [1312] Possibility of the radioactive contamination;<br>
      <br>
      Possibility of explosion<br>
      <br>
      Possibility of gas leakage<br>
      <br>
      Gas poisoning.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of a third line of defence in the shape of third
      containment vessel is the only solution for and if all these
      accidents happen together or because of each other.<br>
      <br>
      B. Inner core dislodges itself and lands on the bottom of the
      outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1313] The gases of the inner core leaks into the outer core and
      no damage. The system is damaged or has to be repositioned,
      connected and refuelled.<br>
      <br>
      [1314] Leakage from the reverse tank.<br>
      <br>
      [1315] There is a possibility of this due to all sorts of damages
      and tear and wear. This is not important as this component is
      always in vacuum and controlled by reverse valves from the inner
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1316] The maximum damage will be that some atmospheric gases
      leaks into the core. Safety systems put in position in the path of
      this tank can put an immediate stop to this.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Safety aspects and parameters of
        the system.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1317] The safety parameters in this reactor operation are simply
      broken down to the following sections for the operational mode of
      the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1318] Once the reactor is loaded with appropriate volume of the
      gases and the system is sealed to any outside interference. Then
      the system is considered as operational.<br>
      <br>
      [1319] The parameters, which determine the function and operation
      of the reactor then, can be broken down to the following safety
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [1320] The scintillation unit:<br>
      <br>
      One way feed valve to the scintillation unit from the liquid He.
      VS1<br>
      <br>
      Secondary safety valve controlled only by computer VS2. Positioned
      immediately after the VS1.<br>
      <br>
      One way feed valve for the feed to the core. To be installed after
      the scintillation unit VS3.<br>
      <br>
      Secondary safety valve immediately after VS3 Controlled by
      computer VS4.<br>
      <br>
      The reverse tank valves;<br>
      <br>
      [1321] Each reverse tank has its own two duel way valves.<br>
      <br>
      [1322] One valve at the point of interface with borehole of the
      gas RV1He.<br>
      <br>
      Secondary valve at the entrance to the reverse tank RV2He.
      Controlled by computer.<br>
      <br>
      [1323] This follows the same for<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen RV1H, RV2 H<br>
      <br>
      Helium RV1HE, RV2HE<br>
      <br>
      Neon RV1Ne, RV2Ne<br>
      <br>
      Argon RV1Ar, RV2 Ar<br>
      <br>
      Krypton RVIKe, RV2Ke.<br>
      <br>
      Xenon RV1Xe, RV2Xe<br>
      <br>
      [1324] Where hydrogen can be given its own porthole.<br>
      <br>
      [1325] In some scintillation units hydrogen can be ionised prior
      to entry in to the core. Where liquid helium does not need to
      enter the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1326] But He is always considered better to be the feed. This is
      due to the fact that the passage of He Through H will create the
      first step turbulence by gas displacement.<br>
      <br>
      [1327] Some reverse tanks in some particular application of the
      reactor have to feed back to the inner core through separate
      access portholes. These are called the pump portholes. Where
      usually these could be used to speed or divert pressurised gases.
      Which arrived at the reverse tank at higher temperatures, pressure
      or speed back into the core. In some technology use of the core
      the gases can be mixed with some other matters before they are
      feed back into the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1328] Therefore the same valve system is needed for these
      porthole access too.<br>
      <br>
      [1329] These to be noted by for example.<br>
      <br>
      RVP1He, RVP2He for Helium and so on for other gases.<br>
      <br>
      [1330] The rotation of inner core:<br>
      <br>
      [1331] The inner core can only rotate by two means<br>
      <br>
      1. The mechanically delivered rotation by means of;<br>
      <br>
      A. The motor of the centrifuges through magnetic bearing.<br>
      <br>
      B. Through direct connection to an electric motor, where the core
      is fixed at the end of the center pole of the motor.<br>
      <br>
      2. The two magnetic fields interaction on eachn other causes the
      rotation of the inner core, once system is operational and reaches
      it desired effects.<br>
      <br>
      [1332] The speed of the core due to this effect will be constant.
      This is one of the predetermined characteristics of a reactor,
      which is determined through choice of fuel and its volumes, and
      the speed of ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [1333] The speed of the inner core can be interfered if need be,
      to be increased or decreased, by means of the varying the speed of
      the motor.<br>
      <br>
      [1334] The magnetic rotation operation of the core is very much
      like when car is put in neutral gear. Where the engine does not
      engage but the shaft runs for itself at a constant speed.<br>
      <br>
      [1335] Note that the access to this facility of the deferential
      speed interference control of the inner core has a big advantage
      for operation and the output power of the core when sudden serge
      in the magnetic field is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [1336] The principal of increase in the scintillation to increase
      the magnetic field can instead be replaced by increase in speed,
      where this will give pulse increase in the magnetic field of the
      system without use of the pump facility.<br>
      <br>
      [1337] Speed control of the motor and the rotor by means of
      predetermined level. With tolerances for variation in the current
      production and heat production of 2-5% is acceptable.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waste disposal system</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1338] As there are no parts in these reactors to break lose or
      fall off into the cores. There are no needs for a trap to remove
      matters from the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1339] There could be times where the walls of the core needed to
      be cleaned or repaired due to may be inlet particle damage, which
      has been generated during the working process of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1340] These parts can only be accessed through the Xenon
      porthole. At the same time due to centrifuge principals any matter
      enters the chamber will automatically be pushed to walls of the
      core out ward.<br>
      <br>
      [1341] Thus all needs to be done to reach a point is to vacuum
      clean or repair, is to insert a flexible tube, which can stand the
      temperatures and the condition of the operation of the system.
      That necessary component can be remotely passed through to reach
      the destine point in the reactor to carry out the work.<br>
      <br>
      [1342] In these systems one can not pass through the center of the
      core for all the obvious reasons.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [1343] Through the design of this rector, the principal method of
      generation of current, and creation of double magnetic field
      forces leading to manifestation of gravity confirmed.<br>
      For the first time with the new understanding of the inner
      construction of planets, by design of this reactor, is replicated
      and proven.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation appendix 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [1344] The volume of the sphere is calculated to be<br>
      <br>
      [1345] The volume of the plasma at the start up is considered to
      be zero. In the operational mode the plasma will be considered as
      the overall volume ratio of the hydrogen layer in the center of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1346] In these calculations the diameter (D) is used rather than
      radius (r) for the measurement of each gas layer. This being due
      to the fact that the radius of the gas can change in one direction
      in the core, but it is more realistic to estimate that due to
      confined physical parameter of the core, the overall diameter of
      the gases will be the same during the normal operation of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1347] Through ionisation principal of the hydrogen layer for
      effective reaction chain of events in the core the minimum volume
      of the hydrogen in the active core has to be at least of 3% of the
      active section. That is up to Krypton gas layer, where the krypton
      and Xenon are considered as the blanketing material and not
      reactive section of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1348] Where the active section is itself about 80% of the total
      ratio of the inner core volume.<br>
      <br>
      [1349] The volume of the inner core was calculated to be 0.52 m
      &lt;3&gt; . Therefore the volume of the active core will be<br>
      <br>
      [1350] The minimum volume ratio diameter of the hydrogen layer is
      0.1 meter according to the center column 5-centimetre thickness
      ratio. This gives a minimum volume ratio of 5.2 X 10&lt;-4&gt;
      m&lt;3&gt; for hydrogen layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1351] For the start up condition the 3% volume of the active core
      is then is calculated to be<br>
      <br>
      [1352] Therefore 0.01245 m &lt;3 of&gt; hydrogen is required in
      the Caroline core for the start up testing condition. Through the
      same method it is calculated that 0.0208 m of helium and 0.0707 m
      &lt;3&gt; of neon gas needed for the same condition. This gives a
      total volume of 0.31203 m &lt;3 for&gt; the argon gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1353] By method of the reverse calculation the set no 1 in the
      table 1 is extracted. Where the overall gas ration in the inner
      core will be 2.4% for H, 4% for He, 13.6% for neon, 59% for the
      Argon, 12 % for Krypton and 8% for the Xenon.<br>
      <br>
      [1354] For the 17% hydrogen mixture the ratio of the volume of the
      gases changes to set 2 of the same table. In this condition 0.0707
      m &lt;3&gt; of hydrogen, 0.0208 m &lt;3&gt; of helium, 0.0832 m
      &lt;3&gt; of neon and 0.2413 m &lt;3&gt; of argon is considered to
      be safe.<br>
      <br>
      [1355] By reverse calculation this give the volume ratio of 13.4%
      for hydrogen% for helium, 16% for neon and 46.6% for argon, 12%
      for krypton and 8% for xenon in the caroline core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1356] The volume ratios of all gases are / can be changed if a
      desired effect is not attained through certain mixture. This
      allowing, the creation and maintenance different outputs of energy
      and magnetic field force from the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1357] It is important to realise that no gas combination will be
      perfect for all operational modes.<br>
      <br>
      [1358] By trial and error these new combination of interactions
      and conditions will determine the outputs of these types of
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1359] For this reason it is considered that for the test rector
      the boreholes in given intervals be better for the operation of
      the reactor. This being due to the fact that as the volume of
      gases are changed the position of the gases on the central column
      will move. Therefore by taking this option of borehole all
      possibilities of testing can be covered.<br>

      condition, this being used for like production of silicone or for
      the micro chip industries where clean but zero gravity condition

      organ through remote one or more gravity laser beam for the swing
      of the organ in its position.<br>
      <br>
      [1376] Atom creation for human or animal or plant cells, where the
      micro gravitational field in presence of magnetic fields in one or
      more magnetic fields created in the center of the one or more
      cavities will allow magnetic fields above dark magnetic levels to
      manifest themselves and cluster together to create the nucleolus
      of the atom and in use of multi layering, then the electrons are
      allowed to manifest themselves.<br>
      <br>
      [1377] This process can be continued for leading to production of
      molecules, and base material for the D &amp; A, where specific
      energies or magnetic fields are inserted leading to creation of
      the right characteristic of the foundation of the any cell or
      organs or creatures.<br>
      <br>
      [1378] In space refuelling and accessing new material for food or
      oxygen, or parts will easily done, simply by retracting basic
      matters in the cosmos soup and using this method in conjunctions
      with atomic welding methods, all maters on continuous bases can be
      produced or manufactured as demand arises, so there are no need
      for huge inventory to carry, one produces in the core as what it
      is needed at that point of space and time.<br>
      <br>
      [1379] Atomic welding is a simpler way to produce or fuse matter
      together than fusion methods, where large energies are required to
      fuse to atoms together. Where the atomic welding is used to bring
      to near similar atoms or molecules together and only add one
      electron or proton, or an neutron for the two atoms to become one.<br>
      <br>
      [1380] This is in reality the reverse atomic decay or half life
      system method, which world of science has never understood, where
      for example potassium goes through beta decay to become argon,
      where if one add beta in the magnetic and gravitational condition
      one can create potassium from argon.<br>
      <br>
      [1381] This is the secrete of material creation in the universe,
      where the atoms do no start always from hydrogen to go to uranium,
      but they just simple weld into higher element to create heavier
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      [1382] Toys all sorts of material used for floating, belts for
      levitation , where gravity van be reversed, magnetic shield bowls,
      diving suits for submerging in to any liquid or gas in possession
      of gravity and heating elements, three dimensional screen, three
      dimensional communication holographic systems,<br>
      <br>
      [1383] Electrical, this system used for electric power generation
      ,using one or more materials in the cavities, by the use of
      collection of the appropriate charge particles from the right
      electrodes specially positioned in the or on the appropriate
      material layer, The important with this technology of creating
      power is that the positive charges can be utilised as well as the
      negative charges for operation and used within or the outside the
      parameters of the system.<br>
      <br>
      That is to say the protons carry as much energy or most instance
      more than the its electron counter parts, where ever they are
      collected in one or more cavities of the reactor, where this is
      total new break-through power production technology. This where
      little amount of material is needed to create waste amount of
      energy in the center of planet. This is a total utilisation of all
      energies from all parts of an atom even the magnetic dark matter
      and not just the electrons as has been done up to now.<br>
      <br>
      [1384] This if understood will allow energy taping in the
      universal energy levels , where to absorbed energy one does not
      need to consume so much material to created or reach a charge or
      magnetic levels of charge, this the point where the food for human
      digestion will become on magnetic charge level which is pure and
      so like taking serum into a blood to attain nourishment for
      energy, then the natural magnetic charges will be absorbed into
      and by the part of the cells to create the current and absorbed
      energy necessary for the survival of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [1385] Therefore the need for food to be converted to energy
      through organs of the body becomes meaningless, and man can soon
      live and an attain energy for its existence without the need for
      vast amount of consumption of matters or material for organs to
      convert these into energy for human brain. This is will come clear
      in not a short decades.<br>
      <br>
      [1386] Use in the Nano-technology, where the minuet machines
      needed to be energised and controlled, where the packages of
      energy can be made or delivered to the energy cells or the battery
      of the system for it to continue operation, or the use of minuet
      battery system which only creates electrovolts current needed for
      the operation of these micro machines<br>
      <br>
      [1387] Communication system, this the use of the soft body, or
      port of the reactor at least with one cavity, where the high
      energy magnetic wave are released in the spherical domain, or at
      least in one direction, where the magnetic energy will be code in
      the sequence as in the present system but this will be hard to
      decipher in the inter galaxy system, the best method of space
      rapid response communication will be the magnetic plasma of the
      element in the sequential chambers, what this means is that the
      Hydrogen plasma magnetic energy will be A, Helium plasma magnetic
      energy will be B and so forth, according to atomic weight if the
      element, where simultaneous small chamber magnetic charge will be
      released in the magnetic energy field level, then there is no need
      for decoding or losing information in the solar system or galaxy
      media, as each element of the periodic table carries it own
      magnetic energy frequencies in the plasma magnetic state.<br>
      <br>
      [1388] Then the time laps will be insignificant, and the inter
      solar magnetospheric bouncing will be used, like satellite dishes
      of the present time to forward a massage onto the next system or
      craft in the other part of the same system or others.<br>

      systems and materials which some are imbedded in the appendix of

      [1396] In some cases if the third vortex magnetic field are
      allowed to interact inside the caroline core, then the black hole
      condition will appear 1, and<br>
      <br>
      [1397] Using this method of vortex magnetic creation will allow
      the study of creation and behaviour of the black hole in the
      galaxies 1, and the way they can be used for certain
      transportation of elements in space.<br>
      <br>
      [1398] The technique of creation of alternating current using the
      physical body of the inner core is an additional fringed benefit
      from the system at the full operation mode 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1399] Therefore the system can create alternative and direct
      current superimposed on top of each other 1.<br>

      [1401] The shielding<br>
      <br>
      [1402] The double shielding<br>
      <br>
      [1403] There are several uses for this mode of operation, one is
      that if the magnetic field of the outer core can not match the
      magnetic field of the caroline core, then the magnetic field of
      the caroline core will pass the boundary of the system. Then this
      magnetic field has to interact with the magnetic field outside the
      physical parameters of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1404] If the system is within an atmospheric conditions, like
      earth, then this magnetic filed creates, magnetospheric boundary
      interaction zone of itself, between itself and the magnetic field
      forces of the planet. This is very much like the atmosphere around
      the earth, but in this case the magnetosphere field is created
      around the system following the interaction between the planet and
      the system magnetic fields up on each other.<br>
      <br>
      [1405] Then if the magnetic field of the caroline core is
      strengthen further, through the operation of the ionisation of
      hydrogen, that can react with charge particles of the atmosphere
      which is within, then this will create a glow, due to the
      principal motion of charge particle within the magnetic field,
      very much like florescent tube.<br>

      [1408] So the method of the magnetic confinement of plasma 1 and
      creation of fusion plasma 1, production of new material due to
      high temperature operation through fusion 1, high energy plasma
      space weapon technology 1, creation and maintenance of fusion
      reactor 1, magnetic blanketing 1, these are all some of the part
      of this patent application of this new technology, and just
      because of the development of this outer core, there are more to
      be pointed out.<br>
      <br>
      [1409] The reverse of the production of the magnetic field holds
      true for the outer core too. This is where the strength of the
      magnetic filed forces of the Caroline core is more powerful then
      the magnetic field of the outer core. That is when the magnetic
      field force of the system will be super passing the boundary of
      the reactor core, and as there are two magnetic fields in
      operation within the core, these two have to have an interface,
      where this inter face will be outside the boundary of the reactor
      as a whole 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1410] That is why crafts using this magnetic technology always
      look like a bright light and shine like a silver ball or a silver
      dish. This is light is an outcome of a natural phenomenon which is
      just been explained. Therefore the system is a small scale can
      become a source for natural lighting to be used as a light bulb 1,
      flood light 1. Or natural sun light for green houses 1, where this
      lighting will be as natural as the light and the heat of the sun
      in possession of all its natural nourishment for needed growth 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1411] If then, the power of the Caroline core is further
      increased the interface between the system and the atmosphere
      around it can be pushed further away from the immediate boundary
      of the system, this giving the system a shielding effect 1, where
      the physical body of the system can be keep away from the heat of
      the two magnetic field interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [1412] At the same time because the magnetic field from the
      caroline core is always in rotational mode, this will gives the
      system a impenetrable revolving magnetic field effect, or a
      rotating magnetic field shielding 1. This very much like one
      trying to jump into a fast revolving door, penetration is
      impossible.<br>
      <br>
      [1413] The system in this mode due to creation of revolving
      magnetic field of the internal core of the system, will reconnect
      with any wavelength and strength magnetic field which comes in its
      path, therefore the system will absorbed, any radio or other
      magnetic energies waves, through the magnetic reconnection
      principal, which comes in touch with this magnetic field of the
      system, consequently the system in possession of these types of
      rector will become invisible to present radar tracing facilities
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [1414] Thus if this principal is used in craft, first of all the
      craft will be shining, the craft will have no air resistance due
      to the distend magnetosphere it has created with atmospheric
      environment around it 1, so the craft can travel at much higher
      speed in an atmospheric condition, with literally zero air
      resistance, as magnetic shielding created by magnetosphere of the
      craft will not have the same resistance and friction force which
      can be exerted on a similar size solid body, like an aircraft with
      jet engine, the system is invisible to radar, so the magnetic
      field shielding will have satellite effect 1 ,<br>
      <br>
      [1415] The system will create its own magnetic shielding, and
      through creation of this shielding, the system can create its own
      atmospheric condition 1, within its magnetic shielding boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [1416] Therefore the system can be used for radiation protection
      in any environment 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1417] If then a double outer core system that can posses magnetic
      field, that can create an outer second magnetosphere on top of the
      first magnetosphere, created between the caroline core and the
      first outer core, with the difference that this seconded
      superimposed magnetosphere will be rotating in the opposite
      direction to the first magnetosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [1418] Then due to the principal of two non equal magnetic filed
      forces and which are two in rotation on top of each other in
      opposite direction to each other, under no circumstances the
      system inside these two magnetospheres could be bridged by any
      object which is outside the double superimposed spherical
      magnetospheres 1<br>
      <br>
      [1419] This is a total magnetic protection system, and is useful
      in case of entry in to atmospheric conditions, or when in space
      going through region where there is a environment in the galaxy,
      where there is cloud of small or large meteoroids or space dust,
      that the system becomes impenetrable and fully protected. This is
      the double shield system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1420] This system is useful for submerging in oceans, where the
      depth becomes irrelevant, or entering planet atmosphere that has a
      liquid environment on its outer surface. This is the submarine
      technology of this system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1421] The interaction of two magnetic fields inside the reactor
      core, in presence of the charge particles, not only creates heat
      in the core of the reactor, but at the same time the inside of the
      core is always highly bright and in possession of all the sub
      extreme ultraviolet rays, which are beneficial to the inhabitant
      of the users of the system around the reactor 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1422] Therefore this system when used and manufactured in an
      appropriate way, like where the body of the cores is made to be
      transparent 1, the safe rays created inside the core of the
      reactor could be allowed to pass the boundary of the core, not
      only to light the environment around the core, but at the same
      time deliver all types of radiations necessary for natural and
      atmospheric condition for human bodies survival in open space,
      where there are no natural sun lights.<br>
      <br>
      [1423] In reality one will have the full colours of the rainbow at
      all time inside the system. The multi colouring lighting system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1424] Therefore the system can be used for lighting vast areas as
      a lamp, the system can be used for a clean or decontamination
      environment 1, and system can be used for cell growth or plant
      growth when is used for artificial but real sun system with all
      its benefits.<br>
      <br>
      [1425] The other possibility is the independent access and reveres
      feed line through the central column for deep space technology,
      where the hydrogen needs to be feed back to the caroline core 1<br>
      <br>
      [1426] Or where the CO2 gas needs to be treated, then the hydrogen
      ions from the caroline core are feed into the outer core, where
      the hydrogen will pick the oxygen from the gas, making pure water
      1, and will leave pure carbon on the outer side of the inner
      core's surface.<br>
      <br>
      [1427] If this core is made to be in centrifuge condition, then
      the carbon can be heated through the heat from the caroline core,
      that this carbon can be made into one hundred percent pure atoms
      of diamond 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1428] This technique is simple, But the vacume condition and
      pressurisation of the outer core has to be monitored and created
      through gas disposition, so atoms of carbon bind in inline and
      perfect symmetrical manner.<br>
      <br>
      [1429] If this process is controlled, fully, the creation of C 60
      1, is very simply achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [1430] This is the CO2 cleanup system 1, is used for plants, where
      this gas needed to be naturalised before matters by-products like
      water 1, can be released in to atmosphere, which this gas has been
      the cause of green house effect.<br>
      <br>
      [1431] Although highly interactive with water and dangerous, in
      this reactor core where it is sealed containment design, at low
      pressures, there are no chances of interaction. Which make sodium
      an ideal material in this core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1432] This phenomenon in this reactor is utilised in the outer
      core for the proposes of creation of charged medium in possession
      of convection capability, but without ability to interact or
      absorb the ionised matter as sodium is a stable energy metallic
      matter 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1433] In this reactor using the central column (see the next
      topic) of the caroline core, that facilitated the withdrawal of
      the positively charged plasma from the caroline core, this
      allowing feed of protons from the plasma through special borehole
      directly from the caroline core into the outer core into sodium 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1434] This allows the sodium to warm up in the first instance if
      need be.<br>
      <br>
      [1435] As positive charges of the ionised plasma are introduced in
      to sodium section by this replacement enrichment method, where the
      protons will act as charge particles in the liquid or vapour of
      sodium in the outer core, helping with motion of the charge
      particle for the creation and maintaining of the current in this
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1436] But at the same time this allows the interaction and the
      absorption of an electron from sodium by ionised hydrogen, after
      ion of hydrogen releasing its energy to the sodium atoms, for the
      ionised hydrogen to attract one electron from sodium outer orbit,
      this leading to creation of hydrogen gas in the outer core 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1437] Where, this atomic hydrogen gas can be feed back to the
      inner core as the fuel for further ionisation.<br>
      <br>
      [1438] Thus causing the fundamental replication of the convection
      method, as it is assumed to be creating the current in the outer
      core of the earth through convection.<br>
      <br>
      [1439] Then this current in conjunction with the motion of the
      inner core will lead to the creation of the second magnetic field
      on the outside of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1440] This showing how two magnetic field forces can be created,
      which are both spherical and can be made and controlled
      independently, separated by a physical boundary of the inner core
      in a reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1441] Now it has proven that such a phenomenon in the center of
      the planet can exist, where the center of planet possesses two
      independent, reconnected magnetic fields forces.<br>
      <br>
      [1442] Which the interaction of these two magnetic fields up on
      each other in molecular state leads to creation of double magnetic
      field force effect, which spans the combined strength of these two
      magnetic field forces.<br>
      <br>
      [1443] Where the combined attraction fields forces of these two
      magnetic field at atomic and molecular level, causes the creation
      of the gravitational field forces of the planet or a system 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1444] That is why now it should be clear why the shape and the
      positioning of magnetosphere of planets are important, as now it
      should be recognised that the magnetic field created by the two
      cores of the planet decides the shape and the strength of the
      magnetosphere of the planet, and respectively, the magnetic field
      strength of the two cores of the planet are totally dependent on
      the composition of the materials inside the two core of the planet
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [1445] When two magnetic field interact with each other, as much
      as magnetic field force goes out of the system, for the purposes
      of magnetic reconnection, the same has to come into the system to
      close the loop.<br>
      <br>
      [1446] Understanding this phenomenon, and being able now to create
      a system that can create its own molecular magnetic field 1,
      therefore it must be understood to be easy to move within these
      kinds of environments without using jet engines and rocket fuel to
      pull away and then be pulled back when the fuel runs out.<br>
      <br>
      [1447] Therefore all the reactor of the system needs to do, is to
      imitate the magnetic field strength of the planet at it position
      where it is to float in that level, and then add to its magnetic
      fields strength that can be attracted to get closer to the inner
      core 1, or in the other words to the surface of the planet, or
      reduce its magnetic field strength that it can be pushed away by
      the magnetic field of the planet 1, to where the magnetic field is
      as weak as matching the magnetic field of the planet at that
      level.<br>
      <br>
      [1448] Then to go a distance away on the surface of the planet,
      the reactor magnetic strength needs to be altered gradually but
      fast enough that the object will move in time in slight slop up or
      down to cover the small curvature of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1449] The gravitational field force of a planet can be replicated
      within the reactor, which will possess gravitational field force
      which can be controlled, due to the ability to be able to control
      the interaction in between the two independent magnetic fields in
      caroline core and in the outer core independently.<br>
      <br>
      [1450] This is the system in possession of gravitational force
      field, that its strength is unlike planets which is set for their
      lives, due to adjustment and control of its parameters and thought
      operation of the reactor, they can varied, and controllable
      magnetic fields matching the environment which the system operates
      in could be produced in the center of the reactor of the system 1.<br>
      <br>
      This method of replacement charges from the inner core plasma is
      one of the corner stones of the second magnetic fields creation
      and control 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1451] At the same time allowing the material to be kept under
      control in the outer core. This could be carried up to point and
      pressures, which needed.<br>
      <br>
      [1452] The plasma is feed through a different direction from the
      center core into the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1453] The outer core could be used for the current production,
      this is made possible due to the fact, that if electric contacts
      are positioned in this section of the core 1, these will pick up
      any loose electrons which come available in this section, due to
      convection and interaction of the plasma which is fed through the
      inner core and the materials in the this core.<br>
      <br>
      [1454] The other method of impregnation 1, is by gases impregnated
      with charged particles could be used, where the gases through
      charges pickup from the rotation of the wires embedded in the body
      of the inner core could supply circulation in the gases of this
      core, that again through motion of charged particle within a
      metallic gas, current could be created in this core, that with
      interaction with the rotation of the inner core, magnetic field of
      the outer core could be created, that the gravitational field
      could be established in the center of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1455] In being able to compress the plasma in the core of the
      reactor, by using the magnetic field of the outer core and
      Caroline core, under the right temperatures and pressures, the
      state of the matter in the plasma could be changed 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1456] Where in reality due to compression created, the electron
      of the gas or the invisible energy made available from two
      magnetic fields in presence of gravity in the core within the
      plasma, allows the neutron, electron conversion of proton, without
      the physical appetence of the separation of two components, but
      due to their magnetic field presence and the arability of their
      charges in the vicinity of the plasma, compressed plasma or gas
      will behave as a metallic matter and becomes electrically
      conductive, due to imitation of the electron as to be free, but
      still in the bondage of the proton in the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [1457] This how materials change or appear to become metallic and
      conductive, where in their real terms is just normal insulator.
      This is the behaviour of the helium in the center of the Saturn.
      The generation of metallic plasma 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1458] There is a possibility of having a flat central column 1,
      where the porthole is only at the surface on the inner code of the
      Caroline core. In this system currents are picked up directly by
      electric pickup points which are directly fixed on the inner side
      of this core.<br>
      <br>
      [1459] Where there are needs for extra heating in the outer core
      without the need for the heating of the plasma in the caroline
      core, them stratum can be coated on the central column exterior
      only in the argon gas layer level 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1460] The extra ionised hydrogen nuclease which is charged and
      worm can them be pumped in to the outer core of the reactor, as
      charged particle to interact with the metallic material vapour or
      gases in that core, like sodium, or potassium, the when returning
      to ground state to absorb, a free electron from the outer layers
      of these material to become atomic hydrogen 1. That this can be
      extracted and be feed to the inner core at argon or hydrogen layer
      levels of the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1461] The system can be controlled through the outer core with
      feed of the safe metallic vapour, rather then injection of
      hydrogen or scintillation and interference with the Caroline core
      gases 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1462] Using this method of feeding the possibility of oxygen
      penetration into the inner core will be eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      [1463] This method could be used if sudden surge like escaping
      from a region needed for emergence, or the shielding through the
      caroline 1 core become weaker, so directional magnetic field
      production becomes a possibility.<br>
      <br>
      [1464] The example of this is for battery production system 1,
      which its life lets say ten years will be predetermined by the
      fuel injected in the cores and then only current at the surface of
      the outer core is picked for the given voltage out put usage.<br>
      <br>
      [1465] This is a perfect system for space technology and
      multi-layer reactors 1, especially designed for computers which
      will have no tangible physical boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [1466] Where the spherical magnetic fields and current layering,
      will allow for the first time the creation of computers 1 where it
      will work like the human brain in three dimensions 1, where the
      material in layers could be cells, biochemical's matters 1, and
      fields of current created in the center core with position of
      magnetic field and presence of gravity, in between layers of cells
      1, with power supplies in micron electrovolts level 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1467] This scintillation could be by injection of one material in
      the core 1, where its interaction with another material in the
      core can release energy that can ionise one or more elements in
      the core, so the process of energy release from the elements can
      start, or even process of energy absorption to start (for example
      in the creation of dark mater this process is sometimes is needed)
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [1468] The principal of using solid magnet or liquid magnet in the
      core of the reactor, being placed at the end of the central
      column, this is a totally new concept in production the atomic
      ionisation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1469] In this system the same is replicated by use of alternative
      pole magnet positioning, by place next to each other on the tip of
      1 and on the surface of the top of the central column 1 in the
      core in the center of the reactor, in the hydrogen gas layer, to
      create the same environment, where the central column is in a
      continues rotation as it is firmly attached to the inner core
      physical body, this will grantee a magnetic environment 1 in the
      hydrogen layer, where it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [1470] The placing of solid magnet on different section of the
      central column 1 or injection of liquid magnet direct in different
      layers of materials of all cores of reactor 1 is one of the
      flexibility principal of the operation of these types of reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [1471] The total energy output balance of the system will have the
      following collective equation of all these factors which happens
      in the cores of the reactor in stages or at the same time<br>
      <br>
      A : Energy released through ionisation +<br>
      <br>
      B : Energy released throu catalyses in Helium layer +<br>
      <br>
      C : Energy released through catalyses in Argon layer+ D Energy
      released through interaction of magnetic fields interfaces + H* =<br>
      <br>
      E : Energy released through convection of the matters in the inner
      core +<br>
      <br>
      F : Energy released through convection of the matters in the outer
      core +<br>
      <br>
      G : Energy releases through the turbulence and self gravitation of
      the gases in the inner core +<br>
      <br>
      H : Energy release due to proton to proton interaction in the
      inner plasma of the core due to magnetic helicities across the
      core of the reactor<br>
      <br>
      [1472] Where the H* is for Hosneh (Hydrogen operating in
      scintillated enhanced habitat) 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1473] Then some of these power productions have parallel in the
      current production in the cores too.<br>
      <br>
      [1474] Where this is noted as Hosneh current H*C 1 where, this is
      the current output of the system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [1475] These currents can be used with equipment, which are
      designed to operate in micro electron volts 1, and electron volt
      for soft tissue computers 1 electrovolts levels 1 like in the
      world of computers.<br>
      <br>
      [1476] Using these types of power supply the system will not need
      conversion through transformers or cell batteries, as the systems
      energy supply can be taped into directly from the rector 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1477] This opens a totally new concept in the fields of energy
      production and usage.<br>
      <br>
      [1478] This current level production and its methods has been a
      well know concept in the operation of human brain electrical work
      in the chemical, and biological field of science, and space and
      cosmology, but up to now has never been achievable as a power
      supply source.<br>
      <br>
      [1479] When this type of direct electrovolts energies are use in
      their appropriate way, new lighting system and heating at
      molecular level will be open for development 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1480] This is the true application future for these systems
      energy Production capability, and not the present currents created
      through electron transfers of batteries or rotational core and
      magnetic field generators.<br>
      <br>
      [1481] This system is the bases for the energy and gravity system
      that through further developments of these reactors, through its
      technology magnetic energy transmutation of elements in the near
      future are possible 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1482] Where the natural energy of fields and elements do not have
      to fight against the natural elements of the existence, but they
      only have to operate within their natural environment to operate
      and create new conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [1483] That is the way where the speed of light will have no
      relevance in the overall picture of energy creation and
      transportation and elements production 1, where the light itself
      is the visible effect of the energy but not the creator of it.<br>
      <br>
      [1484] The power of magnetism is known in the visible and sound
      levels. Through this system new realisation and control of
      magnetism and speeds of transportation beyond light will show
      their effects and existence in the level of dark matter 1, which
      these will be needed to getting used to.<br>
      <br>
      [1485] Therefore it is considered and concluded that the hydrogen
      and all gases, for the reactor not to reach, what is to be called
      the state of solid or stagnation, through hydrogen atomic
      saturation, the core has to have low gas volume ratio 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1486] Where this heating effect of two magnetic fields has to be
      kept away from the physical body of the system, these
      magnetosphere field which is created by strengthening of the
      magnetic field of the system, will push the boundary of the
      interaction of the two magnetic field s away from the system, then
      the expansion in the area between the system and the actual
      magnetosphere of the system will become the magnetic shield of the
      system l, in the atmosphere of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1487] This technique of pushing the magnetic field out of the
      boundary of the system, and its interaction with the magnetic
      field of the planet, used in a way, that, the magnetosphere field
      of two cores, or magnetosphere field interaction of the system and
      the planet, can be confined to a pin point or a long line, then
      the system can be used in a similar way as the welding torch 1,
      where the heat at the magnetosphere will be hot enough that can
      cause melting of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      [1488] Therefore this can weld any two matter together, even in
      the molecular or atomic level 1, for creation of 113-115 matter in
      periodic table 1 by welding method leading to manufacture of
      elements 1, and manufacture of dark matter 1, not in a fusion
      method but the atomic welding level to create new molecules, where
      there will not be a need for huge fusion energies to cross the
      coulomb barriers as has been tried in the fusion reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [1489] The alternative method of measuring the weight of the gases
      or material, is to consider the vacume, zero atmospheric
      condition, which is more realistic, as in the conditions in the
      galaxy's, as the atmospheric condition is a manmade toll of
      measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [1490] Then the volume ratios matters in each core of any reactor
      will be totally different, and the system will be highly stable
      but extremely electromagnetic and the magnetic energy creation
      will be very powerful system.<br>
      <br>
      [1491] This is another method of the combination of energy, and
      gravity system, which the boundary of the outer core will be used
      for the shielding effect. So the inner core maintenance of the
      magnetic field will cover the content of the craft for constant
      gravitation forces 1 (This will be like the present compression
      system used in jetliner at high altitude. Where the gravity will
      be controlled and created by the caroline core and the outer
      magnetic field through the speed of the rotation of gas flow
      circulation in the reactor of the system 1).<br>
      <br>
      [1492] Later in the high temperature mode, and creation of the
      magnetic field due to convection principals in the outer core,
      will be used for the magnetic field confinement of the plasma in
      the caroline core, and the shielding effect of the whole system,
      will be done by the outer core magnetic field 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1493] Later in the high temperature mode, and creation of the
      magnetic field due to convection principals in the outer core,
      will be used for the magnetic field confinement of the plasma in
      the caroline core, and the shielding effect of the whole system,
      will be done by the outer core magnetic field 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1494] This will be operated at very low speed of rotation at
      about 10 &gt; 250 rpm (Note that the speed of the inner core at
      the interface with the outer core of the earth for convection is
      only about 340 Km/h). Magnetic fields created by the convection do
      not need high speed of rotation of their solid containment body 1.
      As the magnetic field created is only for containment of the
      plasma in the Caroline core.<br>
      <br>
      [1495] Where the inner core will absorb all the matter within
      itself and nothing can leak out of the center core not even heat.
      This is exactly how black holes in the universe are created (read
      the paper on creation of black hole released by M T Keshe). This
      is what will be called as black whole condition or Zhubeen State
      of operation 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1496] This is how; it is proven that the black hole theory
      condition is a temporary one in the universe. That the black holes
      leak once one of the magnetic forces or parameters around them
      changes its position. If one of the parameters like the speed of
      the rotation is slightly changed this condition could be avoided
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [1497] For the first time man can observe the phenomena of
      creation of a black hole in a close circuit within this reactor
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1498] If this phenomenon is used and understood through the
      operation of this reactor core! Then the derma of the wormhole
      through the operation of this reactor is become reality 1.<br>
      <br>
      [1499] If the interaction of two of these mine magnetic forces
      occurs on the edge of the inner chamber leading to creation of
      bobble, at the physical boundary of the gases and the core walls.
      Then this will, as what is seen on the surface of the sun, as
      interaction of two magnetic fields and the creation of the dark
      spots 1, as on the surface of the sun, which is the same as the
      creation what is called the magnetic surface bobbles in these
      reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [1500] Speed of light is mass depended where magnetic force speed
      is essence of life and creation.<br>
      <br>
      [1501] When, magnetic forces slow down enough then they become
      speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      [1502] So the magnetic speed is above the speed of light by
      several hundreds of factors. Where this is the speed on energy and
      not matter.<br>
      <br>
      [1503] Thus Einstein equation of relativity is irrelevant in this
      dimension of the existence.<br>
      <br>
      [1504] It is important to understand that each core creates its
      own magnetosphere in relation to the cores above or below it in a
      multi layer core system. As each core is running its own
      discipline. So interaction of inner EMF of two or three cores on
      top of each other has to be considered. This is like, when a
      system is run for gravity and shielding and multi shielding one in
      clock and one in anti clock direction in case of colonisation.<br>
      <br>
      [1505] This is for the total repellent effect of any meteorites or
      other object for not being able to enter the colony space.<br>
      <br>
      [1506] That is where the inner layer of shielding rejects the
      mater, if the object or the energy package penetrates the first
      layer, the second layer moving in opposite direction of the
      motion, it will automatically ejects the object from the boundary
      of the craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1507] This is a perfect shielding system for entry or exist from
      atmosphere of planets, systems or galaxy's.<br>
      <br>
      further notes and applications about the system;<br>
      <br>
      [1508] The core power generator consists of a metallic inner core
      on which electromagnetic fields are produced by the outer core
      convection motion. Both the field and the inner core are rotated
      together, there being no relative motion between the magnetic
      field and the inner core. A vortex of gases is formed in the
      rotating inner core, due to which electrical charge is produced by
      the free electrons products of ionisation of the hydrogen, which
      interacts with argon of the and creating the necessary free
      electrons in the gas.<br>
      <br>
      [1509] The free electrons are interacted with the magnetic field
      created by the turbulence convective of the inner core and the
      magnetic field of the outer core in the inner core Thus creating
      positive and negative polarities between which output power at
      high current and few volts in the reactor are produced. This
      allowing electrical generators of capacity in tens of kilowatts
      and of sizes comparable with conventional electrical generators.<br>
      <br>
      [1510] The speed of rotation of the inner core at the start runs
      at 2860 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      The core thickness could be out of 120-mm thick steel plate.<br>
      <br>
      The motor needs to be no-load current of 2.6 amperes (1300 watts)
      to rotate 2870 rpm. The choice of the motor is much weight
      dependent of the full inner reactor and the center column.<br>
      <br>
      [1511] Electrons the same as matter contain energy in their
      construction (E=mc&gt;2). Electrons themselves are energy
      packages, where "energy" in physical terms is a state of vacuum in
      rotation. Even at ordinary speed of rotation of electromagnetic
      forces of two cores, the inter atomic space of the inner chamber
      develops velocity fields in the vacuumed chamber that
      qualitatively act like additional charge within the rotating
      system which uses the electron from ionisation and the creates
      free electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [1512] The interaction of the magnetic fields and free electrons
      form polarities creating a substantial current. The law of
      conservation of charge and the law of conservation of energy are
      applicable within the systems confined to gas interactions and the
      inner containment core, which is a dynamic entity that can rotate
      and create charge.<br>
      <br>
      [1513] In an integrated system rotating with the external magnetic
      field from the outer core electromagnetic field are created in the
      center core.<br>
      <br>
      [1514] Energy is produced from gases in vacuum by creating
      continues supply of electron from the hydrogen as
      catalysts/source.<br>
      <br>
      [1515] For certain operational application a telescopic central
      column could be used.<br>
      <br>
      These being like constant long duration operation like to replace
      batteries of present days. Where, the fixed volume of H in the
      center of the core predetermines the life of the core. Which is
      pre-irradiated and energised and self-sufficient sustain condition
      is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [1516] Up on approaching the right temperature in the Argon level.
      The rate of the flow of the of the He scint has to be reduced that
      the enough heat created, as it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      Due to inert gases blanketing. Temperature rise in the core is
      rapid. The right choice of the amount of the different gases above
      Argon level will allow the follow of the heat to the second
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1517] The rise in the temperature of the gas in the second
      chamber, with the right choice of the neon gas in the vacuumed
      above argon level, with feed of aluminium vapour or other metallic
      molecules, the convection and the circulation of the inner core,
      the magnetic field strength in the outer core will increase.<br>
      <br>
      [1518] The increase in this field will and is the most important
      factor in the operation of this reactor as the whole.<br>
      <br>
      [1519] The magnetic flux measurement equipment for this proposes
      has to have the capability to operate at high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [1520] The rate of the feed of S-He is like the action of the
      accelerator in feeding fuel in the petrol engines. So the rate of
      flow and the amount of exposure to the irradiating material will
      determine the ionisation of the H and He in the center core. So
      the rate of the feed of S-He is the control element of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1521] The speed of the rotation of Argon gas will then be the
      controller of the strength of the magnetic field of the inner
      core, where this is used for the gravity and anti- gravity
      operation of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1522] In the operation mode the speed of the inner core physical
      body will controlled by the interaction of the combination of the
      two magnetic field forces of the two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1523] The motor of the reactor and its speed control will be
      determined by these forces. Unless entirely different or serge in
      one other properties from the reactor is needed, for speed control
      for the motor for differential speed condition of operation is
      essential.<br>
      <br>
      [1524] Pumping of gas is the main control of the operation of the
      reactor at any discipline of the operation of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1525] Curvature blades on the inner and outer side of the inner
      core can give more effective output for the rotation of the gases,
      even though that this can create turbulence in the outer layer
      gases of the inner core. This could be positive in the circulation
      of the matter in the outer core giving a better convection rate of
      the flow of the gases or material in the outer core chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [1526] For some applications of the core, where rapid energy is
      needed the gases in the core has to be sufficiently ionised. So
      that free electrons can easily carry current in the gas layers.<br>
      <br>
      Gases in this reactor are like super conducting electromagnet,
      that the system becomes a self-sufficient system.<br>
      <br>
      [1527] It is important to notice that the current in the gases
      will not be turned in to heat unless they become in touch with the
      environment of argon gas, where the current changes into heat
      through the catalysis effect of argon.<br>
      <br>
      [1528] In gaseous condition there are no need for magnetic field
      and magnetic induction or flux density to be considered
      separately. In gaseous condition this is refereed as magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [1529] Forces exerted on the gases in the core are I x B per
      volume. Where I is the current flux from ionisation of the H and
      He. In vacume where there are no gases I = o.<br>
      <br>
      [1530] Gases entrapped in the bobbles are in much denser
      conditions then their outside surrounding. They reason that they
      hold their position is due to the fact that pressure within gas is
      equal to Ix B forces. This being due to electrons captured by the
      bubble. Plus the gas inter pressure from the surrounding fields
      inside the bobble. Thus electric current must be running within
      the bobble.<br>
      <br>
      [1531] When these bobbles lose their strength, by for reason or
      the other, they release gases plus plasma at high speeds, these
      ejected plasma involve masses of plasma, where this plasma was
      held in the bobble by forces of I x B. Then this force of the gas
      up on release becomes the acceleration of the gas (This mass
      release has parallel on the surface of the sun and is called
      Coronal mass injection).<br>
      <br>
      [1532] The sudden release of the content of the bobble in
      conjunction with the surrounding plasma, this cerates a sudden
      surge in the electron flow and sudden increase in the output power
      of the core. If the bobble is in the Inner gas layers. If the
      bobble is on the outer layer, this can cause damage to the inner
      wall of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1533] This method of force creation sudden surge of energy if
      created in conjunction with the inner core super passing the
      boundary of the outer core in the boundary of the craft. The
      sudden surge in magnetic force created this way is the technique
      for pulse magnetic field force creation. This is the one of the
      methods of defence for the craft in motion or in space, where the
      bobble is created in the outer layer, this is like the rings on
      the surface of the sun.<br>
      <br>
      [1534] Where here on has the control of the quantity and direction
      of the release of the plasma or the magnetic field created. This
      is a lethal but effective way to destroy large objects in space,
      without change of the course of direction of the motion of the
      craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1535] The magnetic forces released in this way travel in magnetic
      field speed and not light speed. Which is totally a different
      concept of speed of motion, as in magnetic field there are no
      masses so speed of light dose not come into play.<br>
      <br>
      [1536] This is magnetic speed, which superposes the speed of
      light.<br>
      <br>
      [1537] This is the speed of the dark matter, has no limit and is
      not comprehended by science and technology of today, but this is
      the speed, where and how in this type of reactor creation of atoms
      become possible.<br>
      <br>
      [1538] There is fundamental deference between the speed light and
      magnetic field speed.<br>
      <br>
      [1539] Speed of light is mass depended where magnetic force speed
      is essence of life and creation.<br>
      <br>
      [1540] When, magnetic forces slow down enough then they become
      speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      [1541] So the magnetic speed is above the speed of light by
      several hundreds of factors. Where this is the speed on energy and
      not matter.<br>
      <br>
      [1542] Thus Einstein equation of relativity is irrelevant in this
      dimension of the existence.<br>
      <br>
      [1543] Object receiving such energy. It will never realise its
      receipt until, when the energy entered the body of the object is
      so imminence. That the body of the object becomes the catalyses
      for the slowing down of this magnetic energy that it can not
      contain the surge in the energy received, that its molecules
      disintegrates, long before the craft reaches the object.<br>
      <br>
      [1544] The magnetic energy and speed will become the second nature
      to man of space.<br>
      <br>
      [1545] The appropriate use and control of this energy and its
      creation will allow the man to transmute elements in their
      entirety. Where, the package will be like the car and its content
      man to travel in space without the use of the craft. At the same
      time the use of this energy will allow the creation of any atom
      that man wishes to create without the use of fusion. But rather by
      collection of magnetic energy in an appropriate way to create the
      atoms which it requires.<br>
      <br>
      [1546] The magnetosphere of the outer core and inner core will be
      spherical.<br>
      <br>
      That is a dentations at the center column position, the thinner
      the central column. The more uniform and perfect the spherical
      magnetosphere and no teardrop effect inward or outward around the
      center column into other gases regions.<br>
      <br>
      [1547] The teardrop used in the outer surface. Where the magnetic
      field force on the inner core is increased to pass the EMF of the
      outer core in a certain direction. Then release of and creation of
      the tear- drop and use of surface bobble. The direction of release
      of EMF for defence can control the direction of release of the
      magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      [1548] Then, if, the EMF of the inner core is increased to extend
      to the full outer boundary plus an extra distance away from the
      craft. Then this will create the magnetic shielding effect for
      craft. This condition is needed at all time during airborne
      condition in space or any atmospheric for the protection of the
      craft. Even during the re-entry and exit from a planet. This is
      the shielding effect of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1549] This has to be noted in jet engine system the vapour
      appears at the rear of the engine as exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      [1550] In this system the white light, due to ionisation of the
      charge particles in the atmospheric condition with interaction
      with magnetic field created by cores of the craft. The white light
      like florescent light or silver light will be in the direction of
      the motion in front of the craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1551] Where in reality this shows the direction of the motion of
      the craft to be rather then in jet engine as where the craft has
      been.<br>
      <br>
      [1552] What is important, is that the magnetic field strength of
      all the cores can be controlled through pumps or lower level or
      higher level cooling or temperature circulation. That is without
      the pump allows the gas at one level core to enter different level
      to attain its temperature. So, that the change volume of the gas
      will control the sped of the rotation and the magnetic field
      strength. This is advisable for long term operation. In case of
      pump failure this is an emergency contingence to maintain
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      [1553] For above two methods a multi layer system is needed to be
      operating within the craft. Where the EMF are controlled by the
      circulation of gases in different layers in different cores. Where
      the containment core are totally stationery or in motion. Multi
      layering system is totally possible by use of negative vacume
      system in conjunction with pumping. To run systems mechanically
      inside each other by motors are impossibilities of practicality.<br>
      <br>
      [1554] It is important to understand that each core creates its
      own magnetosphere in relation to the cores above or below it in a
      multi layer core system. As each core is running its own
      discipline. So interaction of inner EMF of two or three cores on
      top of each other has to be considered. This is like, when a
      system is run for gravity and shielding and multi shielding one in
      clock and one in anti clock direction in case of colonisation.<br>
      <br>
      [1555] This is for the total repellent effect of any meteorites or
      other object for not being able to enter the colony space.<br>
      <br>
      [1556] That is where the inner layer of shielding rejects the
      mater, if the object or the energy package penetrates the first
      layer, the second layer moving in opposite direction of the
      motion, it will automatically ejects the object from the boundary
      of the craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1557] These are a perfect shielding system for entry or exist
      from atmosphere of planets, systems or galaxy's.<br>
      <br>
      [1558] In defence technology discipline this multi- layer system
      will make the system totally impregnable even from EMF from
      directed to craft from another craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1559] This system of opposite rotation layer is perfect in
      oceanic or liquid surface planets landing or dives.<br>
      <br>
      [1560] Each core in the multi-layer systems can be treated as
      individual system, like the inner core on their own. That they can
      be ionised by scent-He to generate heat and their own magnetic
      field without the need to receive heat from other layers for the
      EMF to be established. They even could be fully insulated from
      other cores immediately above or below it or on its right or left.
      This is useful for magnetic computer multi layer and
      multi-parallel levels systems. Where the cores are in strips then
      in layers and in layers on top of each other too.<br>
      <br>
      [1561] In these systems the scent-He is feed in one layer and even
      in a specific point in that layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1562] This is the concept of mine floating scent-He sources
      within a layer. The floating sources of scent-He are for localised
      ionisation creation and specific application. This is a good
      method for welding and stick. In weapon technology, this is useful
      for dirctionalising control of the strength of the energy to a
      pointed away from the craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1563] Use of the soft metallic material like liquid metals as
      containment rather then hard solid body. This allows a much easier
      control of the speed of the core levels EMF. This method of
      containment is good as layer of the gaseous metallic boundary is
      placed beyond the argon level. This will create an amazing effect
      like the rings of the Saturn or the ring usually associated with
      giant gas planets.<br>
      <br>
      [1564] Different and independent speeds of rotation of each core
      like core, 1 ST, 2 nd, 3 rd and so on cores. These effects can be
      used individually or in conjunction with each other to increase an
      effect. Like increases in the output power of system or increase
      in the power of shields where all cores will be synchronized to
      defend the craft with maximum shield power. The power of such
      systems can run into several million watts.<br>
      <br>
      [1565] The problem with this type of discipline is the heating of
      the core due to the saturation interaction of scent-He with H and
      He. This is called the scent-He heating effect.<br>
      <br>
      This effect can influence the wave of thermal heating due to
      gravity will have direct effect on the temperature produced within
      gas layers of all reactors (this is the MHD effect). This wave
      heating theory has to be taken into account into consideration for
      large size cores. Especially for multiplayer core specifically in
      the outer cores outer layers.<br>
      <br>
      [1566] Where, the two magnetic forces meet inside the inner core
      of the reactor. The condition of the magnetosphere inside the core
      is created.<br>
      <br>
      [1567] By dumping large amount of ionised particles by injecting
      deliberate serge or as of normal condition of the operation of the
      reactor. In this region of magnetosphere these particles collide
      with gas molecules of the inner core in the region and create
      light or heat in the chamber. This is very much the principal of
      the aurora of the North Pole.<br>
      <br>
      [1568] If, the interaction of these two fields are/ or could be
      stretched cross any object like a house and spacecraft. One needs
      only to produce a bubble, which has or contains charged particles.
      Therefore the area of the bubble is then would be under the
      influence of the magnetosphere or one of the two magnets. Thus
      light energy could be created to light the room or an area. This
      will be light without wire. Or how planets or galaxy's attain
      their bright lights. That is the interaction of magnetic fields,
      which interact with each other in presence of charged particles.<br>
      <br>
      [1569] This effect, of the light due to interaction of the
      magnetic force and charge particles. This is the only reason whey
      craft or objects equipped with this system will be always shining
      in the sky. Where the magnetic field created by the interaction of
      center core or outer core magnetic field. These will create
      magnetic atmosphere around the craft.<br>
      <br>
      [1570] Where in atmospheric conditions! Where there are ionised
      particles are within the atmospheric gases. These will interact
      and create visible light around the craft. In these conditions the
      generated magnetic field of the craft will interact at the same
      time with magnetic field of the planet too.<br>
      <br>
      [1571] Therefore at the head of the boundary of the effectiveness
      of this light, there will be heat due to magnetospheric condition
      created. This magnetic field at the same time will determine by
      the strength of the two fields of the planet and the craft. This
      is exactly like the edge of the interaction planets and their
      stronger field of their stars. The beauty of this system of motion
      is that. The system does not have a vapour trail as in jet
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      [1572] The brightness around the craft is only light , and
      secondly opposite to the jet system, the light is always created
      ahead of in the direction of motion.<br>
      <br>
      [1573] Therefore the real position of the craft in this light is
      some where near the opposite end of the direction of the notion of
      the craft. The advantage of this method of creating magnetic
      magnetosphere ahead and around the craft. Is, that, due to effect
      of magnetosphere and usage of the charge particles ahead and
      around the craft to create light. The craft will never come around
      to be in touch with atmosphere of the planet.<br>
      <br>
      [1574] Therefore the atmospheric condition will have no impact on
      the craft itself. Therefore craft will for example never heats up.<br>
      <br>
      [1575] Secondly the interface of the interaction of the forces of
      the craft and the planet will take place some distance away from
      the craft, at boundary of the magnetosphere of the planet and the
      craft. If now one increases the magnetic forces of the craft and
      as it is the characteristics of the body in position of the
      internal magnetic field that they always rotate in their access.
      There for the craft outer shell will always rotate.<br>
      <br>
      [1576] This has several advantages. One of them is that the
      magnetic filed of the craft due to its condition of its creation.
      This magnetic field will rotate around the body of the craft, the
      same as the magnetic field of the earth, but at the same time this
      rotation of the fields in creates the atmosphere around the earth,
      which will not allow penetration of space debris into earth
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [1577] Therefore this rotating magnetic will become like a shield
      around the craft, the shielding effect of this new system.<br>
      <br>
      [1578] When the effect of magnetosphere of the internal core is
      enhanced. Where the two inter faces of the magnetic fields are
      brought to the near center of the inner core. The drastic heat
      increase at the interface of the two magnetic fields is brought to
      be in hydrogen layer. Then the fusion temperature for any element
      will be come possible.<br>
      <br>
      [1579] That is when the core becomes a fusion reactor. Where, the
      hydrogen will feed the supply of energy in combination with feed
      of two nearest materials to fuse in the hydrogen gas mix.<br>
      <br>
      [1580] In conjunction with the feed of the scintillation material,
      the temperatures needed for the fusion is created.<br>
      <br>
      [1581] What is needed for the jump or the fusing of the element is
      the extra neutron. There for now if the neutron which are created
      in the fusion section in conjunction with the ionisation of He.
      These have moved to the Xe layer and captured in that layer. By
      this time the porthole at Xe layer is opened through the bridge
      channel specifically built in the center telescopic column. Then
      feeding these neutron through to the outside boundary of the
      fusion zone. Where these neutrons will be jets purples into the
      argon gas in a projected line that they are pulled into the
      center.<br>
      <br>
      [1582] These neutrons will become the bridge factor for the fusing
      of two atoms to a new atom, which was desired.<br>
      <br>
      [1583] It is crucial that the atoms to fuse do not necessary need
      to be of the same. That is to say to create the element 113, 114
      or 115. Which, these are all double magnetic or 114 which is the
      perfect double magnet. That is to say, that these are both
      gravitational and magnetism at the same time. That is when these
      elements are created through this process of two Iron atoms by
      fusing.<br>
      <br>
      [1584] This element will be feed to the gravitational systems for
      space travel. Where there are no fuels are used. Where foe the
      motion the soup mixture of the 113-115. In a three 120-degree
      equidistance centrally apart will be used to create the matching
      magnetic or gravitational pull of the destined planet or system or
      galaxy. Then the object will be attracted or repelled towards that
      desired destination.<br>
      <br>
      [1585] In this case increase in 113 or 115 will be the determining
      factor. Where, the 114 will be the controlling factor.<br>
      <br>
      [1586] Therefore by retracting the boundary of the interface of
      the two magnetic forces. In creating the magnetospheric condition
      the fusion is achievable in a small space in the reactor core.
      Where in multi layer core system. This fusion production could be
      allocated through design to a specific location of the reactor
      core. Where, for example this location continuously has the
      capability to produce fresh material from space hydrogen or other
      mates. Fresh elements like air for birthing and oxygen for the
      water supply and so forth.<br>
      Where there will be no need for carrying large amount of air and
      water supply. That can limit the time and duration of space
      travel.<br>
      <br>
      [1587] The heat from these spots through porthole controls of
      speed, thickness and feed of the argon and neon layers could be
      controlled to manageable temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [1588] It is important to notice that the Fusion core does not
      necessarily needs to be in the center core. But it can be
      accommodated in one of the outer core layers of the multi
      layer-stacking reactor. The core, which is specifically designed
      for the interaction of the other entire core to achieve fusion in
      a constant and fusion layer. Rather then in a spherical bowl in
      the center of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1589] In this system it has to be noted that the hydrogen is a
      catalyst to transfer the energy of the scintillation from the
      irradiated He through to the Ar gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1590] Where the argon itself become the catalyse to slow the
      electron of the ionised He to ground state by transferring their
      energy into heat. Therefore this is the principle of double
      catalysis. This effect occurs frequently in the cosmos creation of
      planets and systems. In a larger scale in the creation of galaxies
      too.<br>
      <br>
      [1591] The principal working of this reactor in based on the
      following patterns.<br>
      <br>
      If any of these factor ever were missing from the set the creation
      of a system or operation of the reactor will change
      characteristic. Even if one off them being varied slightly the
      same will happen to the output of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1592] In some reactors the catalyst will be solid or vapour of
      like potassium or sodium vapour in argon layer is use as a
      mixture. This piped in to the core through the pump hole. Then it
      is for example collected in the xenon porthole, or the argon will
      be the last layer. These are use where high energy through
      enthalpy for raped heating from hydrogen is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [1593] During the operation of the core the atoms of He gas can
      and will become catalyst in the process of and because of their
      position within the reactor. He catalysts effect can release about
      54 eV in the plasma for each reaction with H.<br>
      <br>
      [1594] By feeding of protons from the plasma through special
      borehole directly from the inner core into the outer core sodium
      for example. The positive charges are introduced in to this
      section by replacement enrichment method. Where the protons will
      act as charge particles in the liquid or vapour of any matter in
      the outer core. In turn helping with motion of the charge particle
      for the creation and maintaining the magnetic field and current in
      the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1595] This method of replacement charges from the inner core
      plasma is one of the corner stones of the second magnetic fields
      creation and control.<br>
      <br>
      [1596] The proton enrichment of the outer core from the inner core
      is the favourable system for the space flight, where the helium,
      neon, xenon or Rn are used as scintillators, where the reaction
      will create neutron and gamma rays, where the protons are created
      in the neon layer rather then in the hydrogen layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1597] In these reactors the energy of the scintillation is very
      high. So the scintillation process will be in reveres order. That
      is where the scintillation material will ionise a few atoms of
      hydrogen and Helium. But it releases most of its energy in the
      argon layer interaction in the presence of the magnetosphere
      interaction of the two cores, or where the argon itself is the
      scintillation bath of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1598] This is one on of the most powerful methods of creating
      high temperature plasma with large number of the available
      neutrons needed for the creation of the 113-115 elements for the
      space travel. Where the neutrons are feed through to the three
      vertical gravitational cores in the craft in to the iron vapour
      atomic mixture to create the double magnetic molecule of the iron.
      This is the fuel of the space technology for the long space flight
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [1599] It is important to remember in the start up condition that
      the outer core starts in a vacume condition equal to the vacume
      level as the inner core. After the creation of magnetic field in
      the inner core the vacume condition of the outer core can be
      reduced to normal atmospheric condition. Where the material in
      this section will operate in different dimensions and convection
      and inter action and introduction of proton and other matters and
      gases will have the normal rotation characteristics and separation
      level.<br>
      <br>
      [1600] Of course this reduction in the vacume level is optional
      and dependent up on the pre determined discipline operation of the
      reactor. The feed of plasma from the inner core to the outer core
      is very simple as the pressure of the plasma in the inner core is
      much higher then outer core pressure and natural laws of physics
      will pushes the plasma into the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1601] In the construction of the outer core there are some
      fundamental physical changes can be made. Where the copper cables
      from the Southern Hemisphere of the core is passed within the
      material of the inner core. Or they are embedded in the outer side
      of the inner core. With this method of concealing these cables in
      the process of the rotation of the inner core due to motoring of
      it, or during a interaction of the two magnetic forces on each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      [1602] These cables or wires, while are carrying charges from the
      operation of the gases inside the inner core, they themselves
      become involved in generating electric power due to rotation of
      the inner core within a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [1603] At the same time as they are carrying current they produce
      magnetic field within the body of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1604] The current produced through this method are enough to run
      the feed and cooling system necessary for the liquid helium
      process, plus the running of the full operation during the stand
      by position of the whole system. Therefore the core dose not need
      to be feed with large amount of scintillation to create current
      for keeping the system on stand by.<br>
      <br>
      [1605] In the operation of space reactor, once the concept of
      energy and gravitational force creation of the reactor is fully
      understood and deployed. It will be very easy for the operators of
      the reactor to create a multi layer system without a need for
      pilling on top of each other hard physical bodies of the inner
      cores one layer to top of the other.<br>
      <br>
      [1606] In these systems what can be done to create a multi layer
      system, which are not tangible. But behave as tangible physical
      boundary. That is due to high temperatures and pressures which
      this reactors are operating under. The vapour of let say iron and
      nickel or other materials which they composition will create the
      desired effect for that part of the reactor. These materials are
      feed in the right position and right atomic weight mixture. That
      due to pressures and the temperatures of the heat generated in the
      center of the inner core. These layers will behave like hard
      boundary.<br>
      <br>
      [1607] Thus the next layer of gas mixture to achieve a new
      dimension from the reactor could by introduced in the boundary of
      the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1608] This technology will be use full in the operations where
      the interaction of each layer with its neighbouring layer and in
      its overall effect in the core is fully understood.<br>
      <br>
      [1609] The multi layering of this sort is the foundation of the
      design and the operation of the non- tangible computers of the
      future. While the computer physical body will be embedded within
      plasma containment rather then a physical tangible system.<br>
      <br>
      [1610] These they of reactor are prefect system for transmutation
      of element, which they do with no need for a physical containment.
      These are being like crafts and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [1611] In these permutations of reactor the physical body of a man
      can be transported to another dimension through magnetic plasma,
      which can not inter act with its surrounding.<br>
      <br>
      [1612] The speed of transmutation is so rapid that the final
      destination for the matter has to preprogrammed in the design of
      the carrier plasma creation control system.<br>
      <br>
      [1613] Through this method of development of multi layer reactor
      speed of light and the weight of the matter are e-relevant. In
      these systems of plasma containment the transfer of matter is so
      fast, that the matter will behave as dark matter or invisible to
      any system. Until the internal operation o the system reduces its
      plasma configuration that the plasma will come detectable or
      visible to a naked eye.<br>
      <br>
      [1614] This system is and can be achievable only when the whole
      and the real concept of the creation and control of dark matter in
      the magnetic field dimension of existence of force are full
      understood. The dark matter is a full working atomic element in
      the universe. The only for its absence of appearance to a naked
      eye or present system is the lack of understanding of the its
      energy level in absence of strong enough magnetic field for the
      matter to manifest itself to a system.<br>
      <br>
      [1615] When through development of the cold reactor technology of
      this system, one can create the matching atomic structure in a
      reactor. Then the rest of matters in the universe and their
      operation and existence will be come like the visible matter in
      the naked eye.<br>
      <br>
      [1616] To put it correctly, that is to say that dark matter can be
      detected in their own energy levels of existence if and when
      understand this level of atomic structure and their operation
      within the universal order of matters achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [1617] The material for the outer core is best thought to be a
      metallic matter like sodium (or potassium or calcium or
      magnesium). This material is used extensively in advanced gas
      cooled reactor for it cooling properties.<br>
      <br>
      [1618] Although highly interactive with water and dangerous, where
      in this reactor core where it is sealed containment at low
      pressures, which make it ideal as the material in this core. This
      material can be directly used for cooling if need be.<br>
      <br>
      [1619] Where, the material is sucked out of the core. Going
      through heat exchangers as in advanced metal cooled nuclear
      reactors feed through heat exchangers and then feed back to the
      outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1620] It is important that these withdrawals are done
      homogenously, that they can not effect the electric convection
      cycle of the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1621] Sodium reacts by losing a single electron. Magnesium reacts
      by losing two electrons. Aluminium reacts by losing three
      electrons. Losing each electron requires some energy to be put in,
      so it is easier for sodium to react than magnesium, and easier for
      magnesium to react than aluminium.<br>
      <br>
      [1622] Atoms of sodium (Na) are larger, and so more reactive, than
      atoms of lithium (Li). Similarly, atoms of potassium (K) are
      larger, and so more reactive, than atoms of sodium. It follows
      that elements below potassium in the periodic table should be more
      reactive than potassium. Rubidium is more reactive than potassium
      and caesium is even more reactive than rubidium.<br>
      <br>
      [1623] In warm interstellar medium containing ionised hydrogen and
      sodium mixture are very common. The Sodium is the catalyst for
      initial magnetic creation condition for the creation and the
      maintenance of the plasma and then the creation of the second
      magnetic field in the inner core. Where sodium will not interact
      with the ionised hydrogen but it will allow it to behave as a
      charged proton due to its charge to create the magnetic field and
      the subsequent current production weak enough not to disturb the
      balance of the system. But strong enough to release the energy to
      the sodium for it to be in motion due to a larger convection
      system that the magnetic field and the current in the interstellar
      medium to be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [1624] This phenomenon in this reactor is utilised for the
      proposes of creation of charged medium in possession of convection
      capability but without ability to inter act or absorb the ionised
      matter as sodium is a stable energy metallic matter.<br>
      <br>
      [1625] In the interstellar mediums the concentration of ionised
      atomic hydrogen is in the region of 1-10 atoms per centimetre
      cube. At the ration of 100-1000 ionised hydrogen atoms per
      centimetre cube then if any hydrogen molecules introduced or
      created in this region the creation of new material are likely and
      can be produced. These materials being Carbon monoxide,
      formaldehyde, ammonia and various alcohols.<br>
      <br>
      [1626] Which these are the essence of the creation of all organic
      maters and essential to existence of life in any form or shape,
      and can be recreated in the outer cooler parts of the outer core
      of these types of double magnetic core in possession of the
      gravitational field forces essential for creation of the cycle of
      the organic matters.<br>
      <br>
      [1627] By feeding of protons from the plasma through special
      borehole directly from the inner core into the outer core into
      sodium for example. The positive charges are introduced in to this
      section by replacement enrichment method. Where the protons will
      act as charge particles in the liquid or vapour of any matter in
      the outer core. In turn helping with motion of the charge particle
      for the creation and maintaining the magnetic field and current in
      the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1628] This method of replacement charges from the inner core
      plasma is one of the corner stones of the second magnetic fields
      creation and control.<br>
      <br>
      [1629] One important factor in the design of these types of
      reactors is that it has to be recognised that the effect of the
      Extreme Ultraviolet is only come to play when there is a vacuum
      condition within the reactor core. This is the phenomenon, which
      can not be over looked.<br>
      <br>
      [1630] The main factor of the creation of ionisation and unusual
      outcomes from the catalyses effect of for example argon with
      ionised hydrogen can and is only made possible in the total vacume
      condition. Therefore as better vacume conditions are created and
      maintained during the operation of the reactor in the cores, the
      better results from the EUV (which is introduced into the core by
      scintillation material) interaction with hydrogen can be achieved.
      The vacume condition in conjunction with magnetic field become
      catalysis for the long duration power production of these types of
      reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [1631] Heating of the gases in the center of the core, due to
      ionisation of hydrogen atoms is one of the reasons that the core
      temperature is maintained or increased.<br>
      <br>
      [1632] Due to design characteristics of this reactor, the other
      fundamental heating of the core gases will appear due to the
      magnetic reconnection of two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1633] Heating due to this effect will play a significant roll in
      any operational disciplines of these types of reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1634] It is paramount to notice that it's not only the magnetic
      reconnection of the two cores, which effect the heating and the
      current production.<br>
      <br>
      [1635] At the same time the magnetic reconnection between the
      atoms and the molecules of the gases with the magnetic fields of
      each core or both cores will have a substantial effect on the
      operation of the reactor too.<br>
      <br>
      [1636] As the magnetic reconnection is at the atomic and molecular
      level at the same time, this will allow direct energy transfers in
      both direction for the gases to carry each others energy and
      magnetic fields at the same time and concurrently.<br>
      <br>
      [1637] What this means is that the magnetic field of the molecules
      will carry the magnetic field of the atoms and the atoms being at
      weaker strength will collectively carry and allow the magnetic
      field of the molecules to carry them within their confinement of
      the magnetic energy field.<br>
      <br>
      [1638] What this means is that in reality the physical tangible
      body of a mater is not needed to carry an atoms or molecules of an
      object. But if the magnetic reconnection between the carrier and
      the carried is established there are no need for the hard physical
      contaminant vessel to carry one atom or atoms and even collections
      of molecules and even an object.<br>
      <br>
      [1639] If, the two magnetic fields of the carrier and the carried
      could be reconnected that they behave as one. Which is the
      strongest filed and then disconnect at given point and place where
      they need to separate. This allows the creation of magnetic plasma
      transportation without the need for the physical contaminate.<br>
      <br>
      [1640] The creation of such plasma in possession of magnetic
      field, which can reconnect with any element, is very simple. For
      it is the plasma that needs to carry changes which due to
      turbulence and matching magnetic field of its proton and electron
      can create the powerful enough magnetic fields that can behave as
      the magnetic vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [1641] Or within the reactor plasma conditions are created that
      the physical body of the rector is independent of the plasma but
      it uses the magnetic powers of the plasma to become and act as the
      solid boundary for the plasma. Where the plasma can be sent from
      on point to another through universal magnetic reconnection field
      strength and upon arrival at the destined point the outer plasma
      reconnection with universal magnetic reconnections are
      disconnected and the physical core of the reactor become the
      container of the plasma and its content once again.<br>
      <br>
      [1642] This type of transmutation of element will have that
      advantage that the element in the plasma reconnection environment
      will be independent of any gravitational file forces which might
      be on the path of it motion.<br>
      <br>
      [1643] What this means is that the body in the plasma will not be
      effected by the universal gravitational forces while the plasma is
      motion as the plasma only reconnects at molecules an atomic level
      which are independent and can not be effected by the weaker
      universal orders of magnetic fields or gravitational forces.<br>
      <br>
      [1644] By feeding of protons from the plasma through special
      borehole directly from the inner core into the outer core into
      sodium for example. The positive charges are introduced in to this
      section by replacement enrichment method.<br>
      <br>
      [1645] Where the protons will act as charge particles in the
      liquid or vapour of any matter in the outer core. In turn helping
      with motion of the charge particle for the creation and
      maintaining the magnetic field and current in the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1646] This method of replacement charges from the inner core
      plasma is one of the corner stones of the second magnetic fields
      creation and control.<br>
      <br>
      [1647] Where the proton from the plasma in entering the outer core
      will take after motion and reduction and by losing its energy to
      the sodium, it will reconnect with the loose and available
      electron of the sodium. Itself becoming the atomic hydrogen, which
      is then gathers on the outer boundary of the outer core which then
      can be feed back into the inner core as the fuel, leaving a heavy
      metallic isotope of sodium, which through its motion in the outer
      core this will lead further to the magnetic field strength of the
      outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1648] There is a possibility of proton replacement and lining
      with the proton into electron and neutron. Where electron will
      take the place of the lost electron of the sodium and leaves a
      neutron, which can lead to further complication.<br>
      <br>
      [1649] Where the neutron and will link up with the atomic hydrogen
      creating Deuterium. This can be feed back into inner core of the
      reactor at high temperatures in presence of strong magnetic fields
      created by two cores.<br>
      <br>
      [1650] This leading to creation of the illusive fusion chain of
      reaction if need be. Which makes the system totally self
      sufficient<br>
      This type of sodium heating in conjunction with atomic hydrogen
      has been extensively observed and its effect been noted in the
      spiral warm ionised medium or diffused ionised gas in the
      interstellar medium. But never has been possible to replicate it
      with in a system.<br>
      <br>
      [1651] Computer simulations have predicted the role that sodium or
      magnesium can play in first stage of heating and fusion creation
      of stars. But to this moment the principal role of the sodium has
      never been explained. Through the design of this reactor and
      specific choice of maters fusion through this method is possible.<br>
      <br>
      [1652] Where the temperature dependence of the fusion to cross the
      coulomb barrier up to now considered being essential, for creation
      and maintenance of fusion has overcome.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore fusion of atoms of any matter with its own species or
      its own isotope becomes totally a routine matter, then the present
      difficulties of creating fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [1653] Using second chamber for ionisation and then creation of
      fusion through metallic atomic gaseous and feed of plasma will be
      the normal operation for the production of Fusion State at low
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [1654] This the ultimate method of creation of the double magnet
      iron molecules of 113-115. Which is necessary as the catalyst for
      gravity and antigravity needed for space travel without use of
      fuel and just operating with in the gravitational and magnetic
      field forces of galaxies, stars systems and interplanetary
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [1655] Where higher and fast heating of the core, like in fusion
      condition. Then the choice of the material for irradiation of the
      liquid helium or neon changes altogether. Where, this irradiating
      source should be of the type, which can create maximum and
      strongest extreme ultraviolet to maximise the amount, Hydrogen
      that could be rapidly ionised. That rapidly high temperatures of
      the plasma could be attained in the core through H. In this case
      the choice of the cores gasses changes again. Where maximum amount
      of H and He will be in the core initially, with equal layer of
      argon as catalyst for release of energy for rapid heating of the
      plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [1656] In this reactor then neon as thermal, krypton as radiation
      absorber and large amount of xenon as neutron absorber in the
      chamber is a good option. But when fusion temperatures are
      attained then the mixture could gradually be changed so the core
      could become a total fusing chamber. So the fusion starts in the
      center and then its volume of plasma is allowed to grow under
      controlled condition, to the maximum limit of safety of the
      operation of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [1657] It has to be noted that fusion is a dream for energy
      production. But it will be used in the future only for material
      production and not energy production.<br>
      <br>
      [1658] One does not need to create vast amount of heat to create
      energy for turbines to work. Or tap into the direct current from
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1659] The same effects could be achieved with manageable and
      practical temperatures of the plasmas of below 1000 C deg. .<br>
      <br>
      [1660] But hear the system how to reach fusion is shown for the
      ones who are intoxicated with this dream.<br>
      <br>
      [1661] Once 1000 k region temperatures of plasma in the reactor
      are achieved. If, strontium vapour is injected into the plasma!
      This has proven to lead to creation of EUV in conjunction with
      presence of the hydrogen and argon gas.<br>
      <br>
      [1662] This effect can be used to circulate the strontium in the
      chamber once the entail heating for energy production of about 700
      C deg. in the center core plasma is achieved. Where there would be
      no need for the further continues injection of irradiated He
      through center column.<br>
      <br>
      [1663] Strontium in the presence of Argon gas and availability of
      hydrogen atoms or molecules behaves as catalyses, which will lead
      to the creation of EUV needed for the ionisation of Hydrogen. Once
      the other hydrogen atoms, which have given up their energy to
      argon, gas. On the way back to the hydrogen region of the core due
      to vacuum principal and centrifuge at this point of the operation.
      Once hydrogen atoms reach the ground level. Hydrogen is re ionised
      to create further heat.<br>
      <br>
      [1664] This method of ionisation by EUV and energy sustention is
      favourable for long distance space travel or power generation with
      a long term operational capability and large current output out
      put. Where large amount of energy for large craft for heating,
      shielding and other usage are needed on long term. Where He does
      not to be needed as EUV source. Unless, He is used as the
      extinguishing or cooling material in the reactor core under high
      magnetic pressures condition<br>
      <br>
      [1665] Some answers to questions, which has resin during the
      preliminary design stages of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1666] Please note that in the following pages not only answers to
      the questions raised are replied to, but also at the same time new
      features and especially new techniques for the future developments
      of other usage of the reactor applications are explained. These
      intellectual rights are under the protection of the agreement
      signed between two parties.<br>
      <br>
      [1667] These questions are and have to be answered in appropriate
      order and for the purpose of the applications.<br>
      <br>
      [1668] It has to pointed that the reactor technology paper
      reference NO 1/2716719.5.05167 is an overall design for deferent
      applications of the reactor system as is submitted for patent.<br>
      <br>
      Thus covers more information then the scope of the energy and
      gravitational experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1669] In relation to preliminary development of energy and
      gravitational experimental reactor some of the questions raised in
      the above reference are not applicable.<br>
      <br>
      1. This is in centrifuge condition.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the above paragraphs of this page are stated that in this
      reactor one is considering vacuum condition. This statement is
      made in context of this knowledge and in centrifuge and vacume
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      3. 99.5% - 99.9% for all gases used in the core.<br>
      <br>
      4 Yes.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of the experimental reactor each gas layer will
      have its own reveres tank. Where, the level of the pump can be
      adjusted for each tank in relation to the inner core vacume level.
      In the experimental reactor for the energy, the reverse tank is
      connected through a reversible valve between the inner core and
      the reverse tank.<br>
      <br>
      Where, the valve will operate as the separator for the core and
      the reveres thank at the same time. Depending up on the vacume
      condition of the cores.<br>
      <br>
      The reveres tank has a separate valve for venting if necessary to
      release or add gases to the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      In the experimental reactor, one single connection to work for
      evacuating and feeding the gas into and from its own reveres tank.
      For example to measure temperature or remove some gases to change
      the operation mode of the core. Then, if necessary, to increase
      the volume of the same gas in the inner core. The connection for
      venting can be used for adding predetermined amount of gas in to
      reveres tank if need be. Then sealing the venting valve. Then
      opening the duel valve to allow the additional gas to be sucked
      into the inner chamber. The same as it was done when loading the
      core originally.<br>
      <br>
      5 In case of cylindrical core, without turbulence this assumption
      is correct.<br>
      <br>
      In the spherical core this does not hold. As gases are staked on
      top of each other than one gas along the full length of the center
      column as in the cylindrical core gas centrifuge systems. So each
      gas has and maintains its own pressure in its own level and space
      in the core encapsulated by the heavier element above it.<br>
      <br>
      The closest borehole to the center of the core, is at He level and
      a distance from the center. Therefore it maintains its own
      individual pressure level.<br>
      <br>
      One can not find a cylindrical planet's in the universe. So the
      core has to be spherical.<br>
      <br>
      6. In the documents about notes of the reactor. The implication of
      the existence and operation of circulation pump for change of the
      speed of gases in each layer to achieve enhancing or dimensioning
      certain properties of the reactor is well explained. This pumping
      is done through a separate channel. The same as the boreholes on
      the other side of the central column.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to notice in the condition where the pumping of
      the gas is carried out. The borehole will take the position of the
      inlet for the gas at any level and the parallel hole in the same
      level will be the out let for the gas. The speed of the pumping is
      one of the main attractions of this reactor for other purpose of
      the creating different effect from the core.<br>
      <br>
      The speed of electron as charge particles in a magnetic core
      created due to turbulence in heated plasma which is in rotation
      creates magnetic field. This phenomenon is well documented in
      regard to the inner operation of the Sun magnetic field research
      papers.<br>
      7 In the experimental reactor, any cooling are advised to be done
      by use of gas cooling system.<br>
      <br>
      In any case in the gravitational production system mode, is not
      envisaged that there should be any electron heating in the outer
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [1670] The heat will and should be due to convection heating of
      the outer core gases or material of the choice. In this case gas
      cooling like CO2 should be a more efficient method of removal of
      the heat.<br>
      <br>
      [1671] The heating of the gas has to be handled inside the outer
      core outer boundaries by use of appropriate gases as insulation
      and/or for cooling. Gases like neon and krypton will provide this
      adequately for normal operation of the reactor. Bearing in mind
      that creation of the magnetic field in the outer core in gaseous
      condition is not high temperature operation dependent.<br>
      <br>
      1 Shape Of the core has to be spherical.<br>
      <br>
      2 The experimental core size of 50 or 25 cm radius has to be
      functional.<br>
      <br>
      This is a practical size to start with. Where any variation in the
      gases volumes can be accommodated.<br>
      <br>
      3 In the reactor technology paper different materials for the
      cores are suggested to cover all aspects of the uses of the core
      for patent purposes.<br>
      <br>
      For the experimental core the advisable core material could be
      ferrite with, nickel cadmium mixture at about 2.5 inches thick.
      This is a good magnetic material. Which can enhance the magnetic
      field effect of the outer core. Thinner core configurations are
      more desirable if safety for the experimental reactor allows.<br>
      <br>
      4 The core dose not need to be magnetic for the start up
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field necessary for the start up for the experimental
      reactor and in most cases is and has to be at the hydrogen region.<br>
      That is why the position of the magnet is clearly indicated in the
      ref 1/111.6.051 on the tip of the central column and only in the
      Hydrogen region.<br>
      <br>
      This section can be extended into the He region too.<br>
      <br>
      5 Material inertness of the core can only be of a major concern in
      the certain extreme operational modes.<br>
      <br>
      For the experimental reactor due to shortness of the duration of
      testing this should not be of grate problem.<br>
      <br>
      Copper coating for the inner core if seen necessary should be
      adequate. The thickness of the coating less then 1-mm is
      considered to be over the safe side.<br>
      <br>
      6 The diamond coating is for special use of the core.<br>
      <br>
      This is advisable for example in the fusion, space-shielding mode
      of operation of reactors.<br>
      <br>
      In the experimental mode this is not deemed to be necessary.<br>
      <br>
      8 The shock wave of the scintillation due to rotation and the
      magnetic field operation from the inner core will never reach the
      boundaries of the core during the operation.<br>
      <br>
      For safety reasons the 2.5-inch thickness for the inner core was
      adopted. This core in reality has to be very light. In the
      experimental reactor core, for safety reasons due to unknown
      factors! Which might effect the pressure and temperature and the
      vacume conditions. <br>
      Which might occur within the inner core during test run such a
      thick material is considered.<br>
      <br>
      [1672] This might and should be revised prior to the final
      production. Up on all safety aspects of the core and its operation
      are determined and satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      1 This has to be put in context of the choice of material for the
      outer core. Where the circulation of the matter impregnated with
      free electrons or metallic molecules will create the magnetic
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      This phenomenon has been defined by scientific world up to now to
      be the creator of the magnetic field force of the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      2 There are certain constrains in the development of this magnetic
      force. One is the principle of the speed of the cooling on the
      outer boundary of the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      The second constrain which plays a crucial and important part in
      the control of the magnetic field strength of the outer core. This
      is considered to be the speed of the rotation of the convection
      gas region, due to the speed of the rotation of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      3 Using a variable control system for the speed of the rotation of
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      The system starts as a centrifuge system.<br>
      <br>
      In operation mode when the system is heated and the magnetic
      fields of the inner core and outer core interact.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the speed of the core will be determined by the parameters
      in control of these fields and not the operation of the centrifuge
      system. The gas separation and infusion will go through a
      resettlement phase after a short while. Then the system will
      settle down to its normal operational mode of speed.<br>
      <br>
      This speed could be and should able to be interfered with if the
      output characteristic operational mode needs to be changed.<br>
      <br>
      This, for example, when the system is on standby or fixed
      operation and it needs to be taken into full operation.<br>
      <br>
      So, with the appropriate injection of scintillation material and
      appropriated increase in the speed of the motor. The required
      condition is to be reached and the function of the rotation of the
      core is then left to the induced parameters. Which is to maintain
      the mode of operation.<br>
      <br>
      4 This does not apply to the experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      This is for rector needed for fast operation and high temperature
      modes. Where irradiated material of the choice can create or
      release gamma rays in the core. Or, other radiation effects. Which
      dislodge neutrons from the nucleus of the He. These neutrons need
      to be captured by Xenon.<br>
      <br>
      [1673] In experimental reactor this condition is literally
      unforeseen. Due to the choice of the material as the irradiator
      source. Which can only create scintillation in the maximum extreme
      ultraviolet region of the spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      [1674] Copper is considered to be one of the best materials, which
      does not interact with most of gases specially the inert gases. So
      the choice of copper as the coating gives the advantage that the
      Xenon or any other gases in the core during operation will not be
      able to come in touch with ferrite composition or any other
      martial of the inner core. Which this might create other reactions
      in the core. Or even might effect the performance of the magnetic
      field of the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      [1675] In certain operational mode and not in the experimental
      reactor. Where, the oxygen can enter the chamber through
      impurities of the gases. Oxygen will react with the hydrogen at
      certain temperatures. Which can lead to creation of condensation
      on the inner side of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      [1676] This is a remote possibility but it has to be considered as
      a risk factor in those operations. Where the speed of the core is
      not at centrifuge speeds. But, at gravitational speed, where
      droplets can form at low temperature of operation! Where the
      temperature of the core is not high enough to evaporate the water
      droplets in to the steam. Then water droplets become a problem.
      This will be considered in the medical use aspects of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1677] Where low temperature operation is dominate characteristic
      of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1678] For experimental reactor range of temperatures operation,
      this is not considered to be important.<br>
      <br>
      1 The function of the this core is to create the condition to
      absorb heat from the inner core then using its constituent
      material through convection to create the magnetic field force for
      the containment and magnetic pressurisation of the plasma in the
      inner core. This method of creation of magnetic field is well
      known in relation to the behaviour of the inner and outer core of
      the earth.<br>
      <br>
      2 The shape of the outer core has to be Spherical. This is due to
      the fact to create a homogeneous magnetic field in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      3 Due to the volume to size ration. The outer core could be from
      15-25 centimetre. It has to be remembered that the ratio between
      the size of this core and the scintillation needed in the inner
      core.<br>
      <br>
      That is to say if to create a larger diameter the convection cycle
      will never be completed. So to create and maintain magnetic field
      with bigger diameters will create problems for the operation of
      the reactor. Even though using metallic gases as the material.
      Where increased amount of ionisation in the chamber has to be
      deployed to achieve the same result.<br>
      <br>
      4 Material for the experimental reactor for this part it preferred
      to be gases like argon gas. Impregnated with electrons or gaseous
      metallic material. Where convection at low temperatures with loose
      electrons and due to rotation of the inner core can create the
      current and the magnetic field necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Or consequently low temperature melting liquid metals like lead
      could be used directly in this part. Where lead at low temperature
      will melt and by losing its heat through convection to the outer
      bounder of this core will create the same effect of creation of
      the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The first type of option is more practical for control and
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      5 This dose not need to be magnetic but has to have the
      characteristic to create molecular magnetic condition.<br>
      <br>
      6 Inert gases with ability not to absorbed electrons are the best
      for this part. These are like neon gases and upwards. Argon dose
      not absorb electrons but as catalyst reduces their energy and
      presenting it as heat in the core. If presented with ground state
      electrons will carry them as floating object. Where there are no
      other molecules to absorb them.<br>
      <br>
      7 Coating for this part of the reactor could be copper for the
      experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      8 Thickness of this core is totally determined by two factors.<br>
      <br>
      One is the amount of heat necessary to be allowed to be collected
      on the outer side of the core if need be.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly the thickness of the core walls can stand the sudden
      dislocation and sudden interaction of the loss of balance of the
      core. Than, the consequence of the heat by the full inner cores
      operation or shrapnel from the shattering of the inner core. These
      parameters are well calculated by the manufactures of centrifuge
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      As this is the outer containment of the core. The thickness will
      or can be as thick as five inches if safety to be the major issue.<br>
      <br>
      9 Pressure in this chamber is and can be atmospheric. There is no
      scintillation in the outer core for the experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      10 Outer boundary temperatures of the core are to be at room
      temperature. This can be achieved by use of appropriate cooling
      internally in the core. Secondly by the control of amount of heat
      that reaches the outer core from the inner core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      11 There are no constrains on the function and the operation of
      the core of this experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      1 The central column is to function as a feed and control and
      collector of current.<br>
      <br>
      In the experimental reactor the central column head will be placed
      on its tip a strong magnet. This is only on the Hydrogen level.
      The shape of the magnet is the same as the rest of the central
      column but with sides cut into it. This is a deliberate ploy to
      create the North and South Pole effect.<br>
      <br>
      For safety aspects the magnet is preferably to be long. That could
      be screwed at above He level in the experimental reactor to the
      main central column. This is to avoid any embritllment in the two
      lower levels of the gases, due to unseen gaps in the interfaces of
      the two parts.<br>
      <br>
      2 The shape of the central column is long and cylindrical.
      Positioned in the center of the core.<br>
      <br>
      It has one central column hole. Which can carry the ionised gas
      into the center of the core. This is good enough for the
      experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      In the more advanced system. The ionised hydrogen will be feed
      directly into the reactor core, rather than the feed of the
      scintillation material. In these system only the volume of
      hydrogen needs to be kept constant in the core.<br>
      <br>
      3- 4 It has to be remembered that passing the initial loading
      condition of the core. The central column has only the function of
      control and feed.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of gases for this usage is so small that a few
      millimeter boreholes for all purposes of experimental reactor will
      be more then sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      The thinner the central column the more uniform the magnetic field
      distribution of the reactor core.<br>
      <br>
      But at the same time it has to be noted that the central column in
      the experimental reactor if it is made too thin. This will swing
      loosely in the center of the core. So that the central column has
      to be thick enough, that it does not swing in the center at
      centrifuge condition and high-speed rotation.<br>
      <br>
      In the design of advance reactors for the creation of rapid surge
      in energy or magnetic field and in multi layer system the central
      column are designed and have to be made to go from one pole to the
      other pole of the core. Right through the center of the core.<br>
      <br>
      This type of full center column has more advantages then
      half-hanging column. One of these being that magnet shape and
      positioning in the core can be moved to different levels of the
      core in some instances.<br>
      <br>
      The other advantage with full-length central column is the
      possibility of the being able to pump and withdraw gases in a more
      homogenous manner in both hemispheres of the core of the reactor.
      This is done through boreholes in both hemispheres at the same
      time from the same gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      The full-length central column allows the possibility of more
      access holes in to the core. For manipulation of the speeds of
      different gas layers for different outcome effects to be attained
      from the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Full-length central columns are not suitable for fusion condition
      reactor. Where in these reactors a telescopic central column will
      be the only solutions at high temperature operation condition.
      Where, solid materials can not stand high temperature operation.<br>
      <br>
      Where the scintillation material will be injected or propelled in
      to the center of the core at the near boundary conditions. These
      are explained in some of the note- papers regarding different mode
      of operation of different types of the reactors.<br>
      <br>
      5 The coaxial is in relation to overall center column center hole
      and boreholes. In total overall view of the central column all the
      holes have to be in central position compared to the central axes
      of the column.<br>
      <br>
      6 The condition for scintillation is pressurised liquid He. When
      the valve of this chamber is opened. The vacuum condition of the
      core will suck the material into itself according to natural laws
      of physics.<br>
      <br>
      7 Outer channels are all boreholes and connected to their own
      individual reveres tank for the experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      8 There are standard laid out for the use of centrifuge systems,
      that, they have to be earthed properly before operation and
      connection to any other components. This is a safety aspect. This
      is a separate issue then electric connection of the reactor as a
      power supply.<br>
      <br>
      For electrical connection of the reactor;<br>
      <br>
      For safety and practicality purposes! The most practical method of
      taping into the argon level is through electric boreholes. These
      are boreholes, which are made through central column.<br>
      <br>
      That is why the width of the central column was considered to be
      up to 5% of the radius of the core. This is specifically designed
      for power production condition in mind.<br>
      <br>
      Where, the appropriately insulated wires are passed through the
      borehole. At one end connected to the pick up brushes to the
      outside. <br>
      <br>
      At the same time connected to pick up point in the argon level in
      the inner core ref 1/2115.6.051 and 1/2215.6.052.<br>
      <br>
      In the power production systems! By using full central column.
      This will allow more points to be made in the argon level in both
      hemisphere of the core.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to note that the half-central column systems are
      useful for the experimental and medical use primarily.<br>
      <br>
      In space technology reactors half column system is good for the
      elliptical configuration shielding. Where spherical shielding due
      to direction of motion in the atmospheric condition is not
      desirable.<br>
      <br>
      9 It is to be noted that due to rotation of the central column. At
      the same time due to presence of the magnetic fields in the core
      environment, there are some currents to be induced in the copper
      wire by them crossing magnetic fields. But this is not considered
      to be so important. But could not be neglected either.<br>
      <br>
      10 Ceramic materials are considered to be good enough for the
      purpose of insulation.<br>
      <br>
      1 Central column coating is the same as the rest of the core.<br>
      <br>
      2 The same as the core.<br>
      <br>
      3 No pressure difference than the core. The boreholes are open at
      the point of gasses in the core.<br>
      <br>
      4 Temperature of the central column is considered to be the same
      as the core at every level of its length.<br>
      <br>
      5 These are discussed in above points.<br>
      <br>
      6 The central column is one piece and part of the inner core. So
      it rotates at the same speed as the inner core. The magnet on the
      tip of the column can be made through design to be one piece
      material as the central column that has been magnetised.<br>
      <br>
      1 Pressure measurement during operational mode is quite important.
      These were being created due to the injection of the scintillation
      material to the center of the core. At the same time magnetic
      field forces exerted by the outer and inner magnetic field force
      will play an important part in the pressure created and has to be
      measurement in the core.<br>
      <br>
      The most appropriate method of pressure measurement is considered
      to be. The comparison of the pressure variation with each other of
      the different borehole gases. This means to compare the variation
      of the changes in for example Argon level with the pressures of
      preceding readings in the neon or Krypton level. Or in such a
      sequence or similar to this method. Then compare the level of the
      changes with the preceding data. Or do the same with the same gas
      level.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure measurement is done in the reverse tank environment
      area. Where the balancing pressure in the tank minus the
      pre-opening of the valve will give the pressure reading in the
      given gas level. It has to be reminded that the individual reverse
      tanks in the experimental reactor are fairly small in size.<br>
      <br>
      2 Location of all measurement instruments are away from the core
      and in the reveres tank region.<br>
      <br>
      3 Type and the range of these to be considered at the point of
      production of the core and the operation constrains and safety
      limitation of the core.<br>
      <br>
      4 Accuracy and tolerances for the gauges are to be define up on
      final decision of the discipline of testing and operation mode.<br>
      <br>
      1 Embritllment is not considered in the experimental reactor to be
      of concern. As there are no crakes or welds in contact with
      hydrogen or helium gases layers.<br>
      <br>
      2 There are no possibility of radiation leakage in the
      experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The only possible irradiation is if material from the
      scintillators radioactive compartment reaches the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      Even in this case, as long as and until the vents in the reveres
      tanks are not open to vent the tank. There are no possibilities of
      contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Even if the radioactive material reaches the inner core. Due to
      its weight, this material will sink to the bottom of the core and
      will seat there. At this point the reactor is a totally lost and
      has to be disregarded.<br>
      <br>
      Radiation detectors have to be in place at the valve before the
      entry of the scintillation material released into the core.<br>
      In the experimental reactor radiation measurement can be done
      through the flow of the gases as they enter the reveres tank for
      any radiation contamination which might be occurring in the core.<br>
      <br>
      3 - 4 There is absolutely no possible chance of radiation leakage
      during normal operation.<br>
      <br>
      The most remote possibility is that the scintillation system
      leaks. Then the inner core dislodges itself. Then the inner core
      is cut off at the central column. Then /or the inner core
      shatters. Then these shrapnel's penetrate through the outer core
      causing leakage.<br>
      <br>
      Then at this point a critical failure accident sequence has taken
      place. Which even then in the experimental case the reactor is
      lost. The amount of the radiation contamination will be equal to
      the amount of the radioactive material in the scintillation
      system. Which is insignificant in mass. But at the same time can
      not cause a large-scale unmanageable radiation accident. Therefore
      any radiation leakage precaution to be taken. Has to be how one
      can handle the total irradiation material source if things go
      totally drastically wrong.<br>
      <br>
      5 There are no possibility of excessive temperature at the outer
      core boundaries. The temperature at the outer core can only be
      generated through the operation of the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      If! There is a sudden surge in temperature of the outer core.
      Which is measured constantly at the outer boundary of the outer
      core. Through normal temperature measuring gauges.<br>
      <br>
      The simple solution for this condition, and/ or any other runaway
      case of the operation is to, built-in the system safety parameters
      and first step for any emergency aborting operation of the
      reactor. This has to the total shutdown of the feed of
      scintillation He into the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      6 Explosion in the experimental condition can be a possibility.
      But due to vacuum in the chambers implosion is a more possibility.
      But safety monitors for shutdown is always in operation.<br>
      <br>
      Lose of the core due to explosion due to pressure and temperatures
      serge in the experimental reactor with built-in shutdown
      parameters is absolutely zero.<br>
      <br>
      The safety barrier is the body of the outer core and the outer
      core in copulating compartment of the whole reactor. BUT NEVER SAY
      NEVER!<br>
      <br>
      7 lose of reactor will most probably will be as usual by the
      malfunction of the valve in the scintillation department.<br>
      <br>
      Or due to computer program control malfunction or error in the
      feed and pumping of the gases of the core of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      8 Outer core breakage is possible due to loss or shrapnel from
      shattering or off balancing of the inner core at the start up.<br>
      <br>
      [1679] It will be interesting to connect the inner core through a
      shaft to an electric motor attached to the bottom of the inner
      core. Then do the testing of the start up condition for inner core
      operation only. Where there are full control of the operation and
      rotation in open environment. Then after collecting all the data
      planting the inner core in the outer core (as originally devised)
      position of a centrifuge condition. By this method all irradiation
      tests and heating could be clearly define and tested.<br>
      <br>
      [1680] Then the second phase would be to place the same core in
      the vacume and centrifuges of the outer core to evaluate the two
      magnetic fields of the outer and the inner core effect. Then the
      consequent double magnetic phenomena and additional current
      production could be observed.<br>
      <br>
      1 In the experimental reactor there is no possibilities of neutron
      release. Therefore there could not be Xenon poisoning.<br>
      <br>
      This happens only if highly radioactive is chosen as the material
      for the scintillation source.<br>
      <br>
      Such material is not to be use in this reactor and so it is
      impossible to have such effect.<br>
      <br>
      Xenon poisoning is the possibility only in the fusion condition
      and especially for the production of 113-115 material. Where, the
      extra neutron is used for the catalyses for the jump to double
      magnet molecular state. This case is absolutely irrelevant in
      experimental reactor for energy and gravity production.<br>
      <br>
      2 Hazardous vapour will only be if mercury is used in the outer
      core as the material for the condition of convection. If mercury
      is not used there are no vapour hazards.<br>
      <br>
      3 This is part of defence technology operation mode of specific
      condition that if this happens in experimental reactor will only
      be capturing electrons within the bobble.<br>
      <br>
      4 With the choice of a thick wall for the inner core. High enough
      margins are allowed to operate within the reactor operation safety
      mode before having to be alerted.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure and temperature margin of higher magnitude can be
      expected with full control of the feed of the scintillated He into
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      1 pre-determined volume of gas according to the operation
      discipline adapted prior to the test for specific condition.<br>
      Gas pressure at atmospheric level should be adequate.<br>
      <br>
      2 This applies for line too. In the experimental rector the valves
      of the reveres tanks of all gases could be left open, that the
      whole system could be cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      4 Due to vacuum and centrifuge, particles will separate according
      to their atomic weight.<br>
      <br>
      This method of clearing is procedure for very pure condition of
      operation for small or highly homogenises magnetic core
      conditions. <br>
      <br>
      Where absolute purity of gases are paramount for correct magnetic
      energy fields (like in system for cancer cells). Where three
      boreholes for each layer of gas is made in the center column. This
      to cover the top, the middle and the bottom of the gas layer.
      Where, impurities can be taken out from in between layers of
      different gas.<br>
      <br>
      In the experimental reactor as we use 99.5-99.9% purity gases.
      There is no need for such a cleaning procedure. Where, the single
      borehole in the experimental reactor for one layer of gas is
      replaced instead of three boreholes.<br>
      <br>
      5 Scintillation of the He takes place in high-pressure chamber. Up
      on opening of the valve to the main core. Under natural laws of
      physic the material will flow from high to low pressure region. So
      the scintillated He will be sucked into the inner core which is in
      vacuum condition and lower pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [1681] The amount and duration of scintillated He in the chamber
      in contact with radioactive material is all predetermined. One of
      the factors determine the amount of He is very much dependent on
      the performance required from the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1682] In the smooth operation of the reactor condition the feed
      should be in regular measures and intervals. So, that the
      ionisation level is kept constant within the reactor core. At the
      same time the regular pulse feed creates the turbulence necessary
      for the production of inner magnetic core.<br>
      <br>
      [1683] A porthole in the central column, that has been
      specifically positioned to be at the argon gas level of the core.
      In the normal condition of operation of the core, the speed of the
      rotation of the argon gas due to its ability to capture and
      maintain a level of electron determines the magnitude of the
      current from and in this gas. As the gases are in state of
      rotation and turbulence in the core. Which is under its own
      pressure due to ionisation of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [1684] This turbulent flow of electrons within the gas will create
      its own magnetic field, very much like the rotation of argon to be
      the rotor in the current, creating its own independent field.<br>
      <br>
      [1685] One of the most important characteristics in the design of
      this reactor are its porthole access to each gas layer according
      to the specific demeaned from the core to attain certain effect
      and function for the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1686] It will be come apparent during the course of the
      development that the pump porthole system is the fundamental
      control toll in operation of these reactors. Where each gas at its
      own level could be independently be reduced in its volume, speed
      and/or feed of certain materials.<br>
      <br>
      [1687] For the system to achieve a particular effect. These
      portholes are connected to the reverse tank. Where in this tank
      all is needed can be done to the gases and for it to be feed back
      into the core through the pump porthole (see refs 1/2110.6.051,
      1/1114.6.051, 1/2210.6.052). In some instances for specific
      designs, gases are withdrawn from one layer and deliberately the
      same gas is feed back through reverse tank bridge connection at
      and into different gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      [1688] This is done so that the motion of the gas through other
      regions which attain certain properties to cause new effect in the
      other gas layer. This principal of technology of this system is
      and can be used for shutting down reactors which loose their
      control. Very much like fire extinguisher in the large operation
      mode of the core. Or when extra neutrons are needed in fusion of
      heavy elements. Where, gases at Xenon are feed back into the
      hydrogen level of the chamber. That loosee neutron in this level
      could be absorbed for the creation of new material. This is done
      in TOKAMAK rector in the blanketing section outside the core where
      neutrons are captured to achieve a new material for the further
      use in the core operation. In this system all these external
      systems of the past are handled inside the core.<br>
      <br>
      [1689] So it is important to learn to operate within a safe and
      controlled and sealed environment of the core to achieve all
      properties and effect. Than rather as up to now create waste and
      problems and then try to rectify them outside the core. As has
      been done in the nuclear industry up to now.<br>
      <br>
      [1690] If need be this is the function of the inner core motor. To
      regulate as well as increase to decrease the speed of the rotation
      of the inner core. The speed of the core and its control has
      direct effect on the creation of magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      [1691] Thank you for you enlightening questions and hope they are
      adequately answered and some more detailed design parameters are
      disclosed for better understanding.<br>
      <br>
      [1692] It is important to notice that in the design of the core
      page 6 of the above reference.<br>
      <br>
      Three important pieces are missing. Which have not been discussed
      in the design of the reactor up to date. But are essential in the
      operation and especially in the experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      1. The need for extra reverse tank for the inner core. This is for
      possibility of the using extra matters in the inner core. This
      could be atomic or molecular metallic matter.<br>
      <br>
      2. The need of the connection of two reveres tanks for the outer
      core, one for the gas of the outer core. Second tank for the
      possibility of the molecular or atomic matter for the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      3. Boreholes in the outer core access column as in the inner core.<br>
      <br>
      The tanks access to the outer core and the 2 extra tanks for
      metallic or other matter injection to the outer core.<br>
      <br>
      The basic energy production is of plasma type.<br>
      <br>
      The fusion is not in consideration even in the foreseeable future
      for the/ and in the design of this experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      This configuration is possible (a stationary central column).<br>
      <br>
      Special magnetic seals for this configuration has been design.
      Which has been pointed out before in the meetings of the past. If
      using stationary central column, then the use of the full central
      column with portholes for each layer gas in both north and south
      hemisphere of the reactor becomes absolutely a must. This is to
      attain a uniform magnetic field and ionisation of the gases. The
      rotation of the central column is the necessary for the full and
      uniform distribution of the all the parameters of the core working
      needs and outputs of the system.<br>
      <br>
      The rotation of the central column has/and should have directed
      effect on the distribution of the LHe and pumping of the gases.<br>
      <br>
      The inner core and the central column are the moving parts in the
      experimental reactor. The outer core is totally fixed and not
      movable.<br>
      In the design of the inner core and the outer core Ref
      1/119.6.051. This is clearly indicated, for superimposed center
      column to access both reveres tanks for a mix gas outer core outer
      core system. Or separate access porthole for single feed system..<br>
      <br>
      11. These fines are foreseen for the multi layer cores. Where the
      inner side of the core of the outer core becomes the inner core of
      the outer third core. This is where the metallic molten matters
      are used in the middle core.<br>
      <br>
      In cases of the gases the groves are not used. As these will
      create disturbance in the gas flow streams.<br>
      <br>
      12. This method of creation of magnetic fields through heated
      matter which losses its heat through convection. This principal in
      well documented in the magnetic field production of the outer core
      of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      In this case due to lower temperatures of the operation the
      introduction of metallic molecules are an alternative method to
      achieve the same.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic field in these cases is controlled by creating the
      rotation of the inner core in the currents created by the outer
      core. Then the current production of the outer core in the
      Caroline core through convection and vice versa. These magnetic
      forces do not to be so strong. They have to be strong enough to be
      able to reach the magnetic field of the inner core. That the
      gravitational forces due to the interaction of these two fields
      could be established.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic fields in the molecular levels do not have the same
      meaning as the solid state magnet. These are needed to be in
      existence that their overall effect will be so fundamental in the
      control and operation of the reactor. But their effect has been
      clearly been observed by astro and cosmologist over decayed.<br>
      <br>
      13. The choice of the matter is dependent on the final decision
      pending on the operation control and material choice of the other
      parts of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      If decided to operate at high temperatures and turbine conditions
      the metallic is beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      For small experimental reactors impregnated Argon gas is more
      favourable.<br>
      <br>
      The use for different gases in the outer core can be done in the
      two or three layer of the gases. Where the multi layer core
      systems are in use. Where the outer core, itself, it is the inner
      core to the outer or the third core. That is when the outer core
      will be rotating like or as in the centrifuge to its outer or the
      third core. In these reactors each core can and is capable of
      receiving scint-He directly to that core too.<br>
      Neon gas pumping is for medical reactors where low body
      temperatures but high magnetic fields are to be achieved. This
      does not apply to the experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The pumping in-line or opposite to rotation direction. This is for
      specific conditions and not experimental reactor.<br>
      <br>
      This is used in the first stage of fast heating system. Where
      maximum turbulence is required with creation of localised
      temperature gradient as prim object and creation of bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      14. This is apparelled research paper only for the energy
      production in a fixed vacume object. In this paper as the object
      has been to create plasma using methods, which has already been
      tried and been known to lead to plasma creation and current
      production.<br>
      <br>
      The principal difference in the technology of the system which is
      under consideration, the systems which is under consideration
      through are simply some fifty years ahead of their time.<br>
      <br>
      [1693] The reason for this is that in this reactor, not only is
      the technology used for energy production but due to its
      deliberate design. It becomes a gravity system like planets.<br>
      <br>
      [1694] This will be proven to be more natural and practical rotary
      system. The fundamental difference as the title of the reactor
      paper reads Energy and gravitational reactor. One can not achieve
      gravity without creating energy. Secondly NO SYSTEM at this moment
      of time has even come close to understand the principal of the
      creation of gravity. Let alone trying to replicate it. As it is
      done in the system under consideration.<br>
      <br>
      [1695] The beauty of you referring to this is that, it shows that
      all assumptions in the design and energy production by M T Keshe
      are on correct bases. These papers show an independent
      confirmation to the correctness of the method of heating and power
      production of the system design in the past thirty years by MT
      Keshe. This gives strength to the point for rapid development of
      the reactor as a gravity system. Even different approach to and
      for creation of the EUV is used through deliberate choice in this
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [1696] But please note, uses of microwaves for creation of EUV,
      this has been considered some while ago for the system. For the
      purpose of creating soft turbulence within the hydrogen region,
      helium is needed for the creation of strong magnetic field due to
      rotation and compression. This was not considered to be
      appropriate for overall patent application in the technology
      paper.<br>
      <br>
      [1697] It has been said OSRAM part of SIEMENS of Germany is
      already working on a more advance system of microwave EUV system
      production lamps.<br>
      <br>
      [1698] These are considered to be good for medical version of
      reactor application.<br>
      <br>
      [1699] It is important to notice that within 2005 and 2006. There
      are some several hundreds of research and patent papers are
      expected to be released in to the commercial world about EUV and
      Argon, Xenon as catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      [1700] These are the outcome of a massive 10+ billion dollars
      investment by American government and Japanese companies in
      computer chip production. Which started during the late presidency
      of Clinton. For creation of EUV system for the microchips
      industry.<br>
      <br>
      [1701] The report is one of the first of these research papers
      spines off. Where the powers and EUV of the system is considered
      to be used for this technology. Which is to be used in lithography
      technique for new computers technology.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A plasma
      reactor for the creation of energy is disclosed, which comprises
      of several technical means (wall, seal, ort/gate, outcome), and
      which contains materials from which at least one sub-quantity
      being radioactive and/or being able to be transformed in a
      radioactive isotope during the internal process, other materials
      from which at least one sub-quantity being an inert gas and/or
      being able to be transformed in an inert gas or in inert gas
      vapour during the internal process, other materials from which at
      least one sub-quantity being a atomic or molecular metallic
      material and/or being able to be transformed in a atomic or
      molecular metallic material, in metallic gas or in metallic vapour
      during the internal process, and other materials from which at
      least one sub-quantity is hydrogen and/or being able to be
      transformed in a atomic or molecular hydrogen, during the internal
      process, and where upon the sealing of said chamber said
      materials, a controllable interaction process - called the initial
      dynamic process - of repositioning the plasmatic magnetic energy
      fields of the introduced elements starts, where a number of the
      dynamic actions between them lead to the creation of new plasmatic
      magnetic energy fields, like in atomic, plasmatic and molecular
      level, and where the interaction between at least two of them
      simultaneously lead to the fragmentation of existing plasmatic
      energy fields. This leads to creation of current and energy from
      the reactor, and where from these fragmentations can be collected
      useful energy output. These self-sustaining reactors can be build
      in in many objects and machines.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A new method,
      process and technology is described how introduced materials can
      self-generate plasmatic conditions, plasma and plasmatic magnetic
      energy fields in presence of ionization conditions and at room
      temperature and normal atmospheric conditions. This initial plasma
      condition - including the generation of voltage and current - can
      be enhanced by adding motion means. Then more turbulence,
      rotation, compressive and heating of a gaseous matter is created
      in a reactor by at least one central rotative magnetic field with
      the purpose of creating plasmatic conditions leading to the
      creation various magnetic fields where at least the interaction of
      two magnetic field would lead to the creation of at least one
      gravitational force phenomena. In a reactor-embodiment a chain of
      energetic events is created via a rotative magnetic initiation of
      a basic ionization of a gas (i.e. hydrogen) which then triggers a
      controllable chain of energy transfers (Scintillation) to the next
      following layer(s) of introduced gasses (i.e. He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe),
      of ail other introduced elements of the periodic table (i.e. Li,
      Be, K, Ca, Ti,... Pt, etc.) and/or their introduced molecule
      combinations (i.e. a vapor). A central colums has magnetic means
      to start the process. Various concepts, applications and products
      are disclosed, such as space travel and atomic welding.<br>
