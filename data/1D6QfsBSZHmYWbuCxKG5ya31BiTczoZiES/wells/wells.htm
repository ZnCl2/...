      <p>The extremes of weather that have become more commonplace in
        recent years can be blamed in part on the US government’s HAARP
        program with its huge atmosphere-tweaking stations in Alaska,
        Greenland, and Norway. Perhaps there is also a secret program
        that abuses Dr Wilhelm Reich’s famous "Cloudbuster" technology.
        Only the Shadow Government knows what evil lurks within the
        hearts of its minions. There is, however, yet another low-tech
        method in the public domain that has been discovered to exert an
        extremely powerful force upon atmospheric physics in as-yet
        unexplained ways. </p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, David Wells developed a modified Newman
        Motor that allegedly produced profound effects upon the weather,
        his health, and fauna and flora. The Newman Motor is
        controversial enough without adding claims of weather control
        and biology effects to the topic, but I can personally attest to
        its power over weather since I had the opportunity to test one
        of Wells’ machines for a few months in 1998. I also have
        experimented with Dr Wilhelm Reich’s "Cloudbuster" (with
        enhancements: double helix coil, Leyden jar electrostatic
        charge, &amp;c) to my satisfaction. Therefore I can assure you
        that this puissance is penultimately dangerous, and thus a
        must-have item in the arsenal of every self-disrespecting
        megalomaniac, whether neo-imperialist American or
        post-imperialist foreign heathen. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It is entirely possible that terrorists of the American
        government ilk or foreign nationalists with
        anti-Christian/anti-imperialist persuasions already are
        experimenting with this new Pandora's Box. Meanwhile, it
        behooves the scientific community to determine the validity of
        these claims and develop methods of detecting the "stuff" the
        machine produces. </p>
      <p>The Newman Motor is well-documented. His website is
        josephnewman.com. His South African Patent Application is
        available at rexresearch.com/newman/newman.htm. For a fair
        warning with many links, visit phact.org/e/skeptic/newman.htm. </p>
      <p>The Wells' machine that I had used is shown in the accompanying
        photo: </p>

      <p>David Wells wrote the following report on his discovery. The
        first page of my copy is missing, so this version begins on page
        two: </p>
      <p>"Clouds would appear straight between the machine and the sun.
        It appeared that the machine was doing something to the sky. To
        my knowledge we have nothing that does this. The effect was weak
        and the weather could overpower the machine and close the hole
        on some days. </p>
      <p>"One day I was observing the cloud formation above the shop and
        I noticed lines in the clouds that were lined up with the rotor.
        I moved the machine a few degrees and the lines shifted to the
        new direction. </p>
      <p>"A few days later it was very calm and partly cloudy. The
        clouds were moving slowly eastward. I turned the machine 90
        degrees and then clouds shifted direction to the north. They
        could be made to travel in any direction by rotating the
        machine. This proved it. The machine was definitely affecting
        the sky. </p>
      <p>"I began to watch the weather to see if I could see the hole in
        the sky on the satellite image. On some days it was very
        obvious. </p>
      <p>"I blew a nice big hole in the sky one day and called the local
        weather station to see if they could see it. They came right
        down to see the machine. Kevin Skarupa said it was very
        interesting. I decided not to release anything public about it
        at that time. I wanted more time to study what was happening. </p>
      <p>"Thus began a long series of tests to determine the effects of
        the device on the weather. The original idea of getting free
        energy was abandoned. In fact the machine was reset to use the
        maximum possible power from the battery as it was found that
        this mode has the greatest effect on the weather. </p>
      <p><b>The Hailstorm</b> </p>
      <p>"Due to lack of time, the machine was idle for much of 1995. It
        wound up under the bench during the spring of 1996. On May 18,
        1996 a violent hail storm hit our town. My roof was punched full
        of holes, windows were smashed and the vehicles hammered full of
        dents. This made me mad. We had had a very wet spring and my
        badly leaking roof was now worse than ever. I decided that if
        this thing could stop rain, now was a good time to put it to the
        test. </p>
      <p>"I started the motor and let it run. We got only about a
        quarter of an inch of rain until July 4. I was getting worried.
        Large cracks were forming in the ground near town. The local
        crop was nearing drought condition. I decided to look for the
        setting that would enhance rain. </p>
      <p>"Thus began a series of tests in all different directions. I
        thought the machine was only in control of a small area near the
        machine. During the multi-directional tests, I noticed that
        whenever I would switch the machine to a new direction, a large
        change would take place on the satellite radar image in areas
        that were 6 or 7 hundred miles away. It was apparent that the
        machine had a greater range than I thought. </p>
      <p><b>Fran</b> </p>
      <p>"Hurricane Fran appeared on its way to the east coast. To test
        the range, I directed the machine at the storm at about midnight
        the day before it hit land. The storm was predicted to intensify
        as it crossed the gulf stream and make landfall at 135 to 145
        miles per hour... It came to land at about 110 mph. It also
        drifted north a little bit. I think the machine altered the
        storm. </p>
      <p><b>Number Two Machine</b> </p>
      <p>"After Fran, I decided to build a larger machine. The machine
        was tested and no visible effects were noted when it was put
        into operation. No hole in the clouds, nothing. It appeared to
        be an ordinary electric motor. </p>
      <p>"Close examination revealed the problem. The polarity of the
        magnet was wrong. Also the coil had been installed wound the
        opposite way. I tore the whole thing down and put it together
        right and it worked. It was much ore powerful than the number
        one machine. </p>
      <p><b>Isidor</b> </p>
      <p>"Hurricane Isidor was following Fran on what looked like the
        same track. I directed both machines at the storm. I suspected
        the machine was making a weak gravity force sideways to that of
        the earth and this was what was affecting the weather. The cloud
        steering experiment had revealed the directions of the force. If
        this were true, I should be able to stop the advance of the
        storm and push it back out to sea. </p>
      <p>"Something totally unexpected happened. Isidor promptly turned
        north and traveled up to cold water and shut down. The local
        weather channel quit showing it after it went about 600 miles to
        the north. </p>
      <p>"The move to the right of the gravity direction puzzled me for
        a while. The reason is simple when you look at it right. The
        storm is not a whole thing. It is made of individual droplets of
        water caught in a rotating mass of air. The droplets fall from
        one side of the storm to the other and pick up speed. The return
        trip is against the force so they don’t make it back to where
        they started. Thus the storm moves to the left. This applies to
        all low pressure systems. Their tracks can be controlled
        predictably with this knowledge. The winds and other things have
        a larger effect on the storm than this does. It is not total
        control. It only makes a little bit of difference, but sometimes
        a little bit is all it takes to prevent disaster. Ironically,
        this makes the average hurricane the easiest storm to maneuver
        because they are often out in the open with nothing pushing them
        around. </p>
      <p><b>Lilly</b> </p>
      <p>"I discovered hurricane Lilly on Monday morning. It had already
        crossed Cuba and was apparently heading for Georgia. This would
        be the ultimate test. I called Kevin Skarupa and told him I was
        going to turn the storm and drive it eastward out to sea. The
        machine was set and the storm promptly headed east out to sea.
        Two days later they announced that Lilly was out to sea. Two
        weeks later I heard about it again. It had traveled all the way
        across the ocean and hit England. This was reported to be the
        only time a gulf storm had ever crossed the ocean. I definitely
        needed better information. The day-to-day experiments on the
        local level were obviously creating problems very far away... I
        later installed a satellite dish at the office so I now have
        full time information unless I am traveling. </p>
      <p><b>Marcose</b> </p>
      <p>"Hurricane Marcose appeared in the gulf. I contacted the
        weather channel for advice. I told them I had a gravity
        generator that could maneuver the storm. None of the weathermen
        would talk to me. I left messages on the voice mail, but no one
        returned my calls. They finally told the gal that answered the
        phone to tell me I was nuts and don’t bother calling back. That
        left me to decide what to do with the storm. </p>
      <p>"A look at the globe indicated that it would be dangerous to
        move the storm. I decided to pin it down and hold it right there
        until it blew itself out. It moved very little during a
        seven-day blow. Finally the speed dropped off and I ran it north
        and out of there. The storm wanted to move north in the worst
        way. By this time I had machine number three on line and was
        able to put enough power on the thing to keep it in place. This
        event took place late in the season and the southward gravity
        was pulling very cold air down into the country. Frost was
        threatening to destroy our crop. </p>
      <p><b>Frost &amp; Blizzard Control</b> </p>
      <p>"A strategy developed to prevent the frost. Eastward running
        clears the sky. Northward running brings up clouds. By setting
        the machine to the east during the day, the cloud cover could be
        removed and the sun would heat the area. Turning to the north
        about sundown would cloud up the sky enough to reduce the
        radiational cooling and prevent the frost to a certain extent.
        It seemed to work and we got our crop. The extensive southward
        run caused a very cold November. December came and I directed
        the machine to enhance the northward movement of air masses and
        December was warmer than November. </p>
      <p>"[When the machine was shut down in late December,] the
        pineapple express proceeded to dump enormous rain on the west
        coast causing severe flooding... </p>
      <p>"I used the machine to divert several blizzards out of my area
        last winter [1996]." </p>
      <p><b>Spring 1997</b> </p>
      <p>"The machine was shut down on January 28, 1997, and I began
        building machine # 4; I was trying to boost the power... On May
        3, I started it up and ran it for about an hour... The power of
        the new machine was unbelievable. The force was kicking all of
        the moisture out of the string of lows into the Bermuda high. A
        huge curved storm was set up on the NW rim of the high and raced
        eastward at 70 mph. The whole string of storms was diverted into
        the ocean within 24 hours... </p>
      <p>"The new machine has proven to have range clear to Japan. This
        spring I used all 4 machines to cut off a low-pressure system in
        the Pacific Ocean. Once pulled out of the jetstream, the low was
        easily controlled. I parked the thing west of Seattle for about
        30 days. This had the effect of producing a relatively dry
        spring... This was one of my more successful maneuvers. </p>
      <p><b>Machine # 5</b> </p>
      <p>"Because of the intense power of the new machine, I can’t get
        too close to it for any length of time without getting a
        ‘sunburn’. It’s like a stove; get too close and you get burned.
      </p>
      <p>"I decided to build a small machine for general purpose work. I
        decided to send it to Ohio for testing. My uncle owns a CB
        antenna factory in Toledo. He has very high tech equipment in
        his lab, and he agreed to try to measure the stuff coming out of
        the machine... He said there is nothing coming out of the
        device.." This doesn’t mean that nothing is coming out of the
        machine; it just means we don’t have the equipment to detect it.
      </p>
      <p><b>El Nino</b> </p>
      <p>"In 1997 I determined that storms could be pushed back into the
        inter-tropical convergence zone and shut down. I had decided to
        test my new machine on Andreas. I pointed it southwest and
        cranked up the power. Andreas slowed to a stop and turned around
        and headed southwest. I wanted to shove it across the equator
        into the southern hemisphere, but it broke up and dissolved with
        800 miles to go. Apparently they have difficulty existing near
        the equator. </p>
      <p>"It stands to reason that hurricanes cool the oceans. Stop a
        few from happening and you will get hot oceans, of course. Thus
        it is possible to control the temperature of the oceans. </p>
      <p><b>Ericka</b> </p>
      <p>"Hurrican Ericka was formed during an attempt to stop the frost
        in northern Minnesota. The Green Bay machine was directed to the
        north the night it developed. I was afraid this would happen. We
        stopped the frost and got a hurricane. Westward pressure is
        being maintained at this time and should minimize the
        development of more storms. </p>
      <p>"After the development, the question was whether to turn the
        machine eastward and drive the storm northward to cold water and
        kill it or to maintain the westward push and continue the
        suppression of others. To turn the machine would likely develop
        a storm in the Bay of Campeche. It was decided to hold the
        course and make minor adjustments to minimize damage. By
        lowering the power and slight adjustments to the angle, the
        storm was caused to miss the islands. If tropical depression
        status could have been maintained, I would have run it right
        over the islands in hope of shutting it down. It wasn’t going to
        shut down so I drifted it to the north. Something very
        interesting developed as it reached the islands: it moved onto a
        vortex. The pattern of four distinct vortexes was clearly
        visible... I don’t think the storm track can be changed from
        this point on. Once they arrive on the vortex, steering is
        impossible. </p>
      <p><b>Danny</b> </p>
      <p>"Danny formed on a vortex. This is how I know they can’t be
        moved once they get on the vortex. They can be affected to a
        certain extent by shoving the precipitation to one side of the
        storm... It was no accident that Danny’s heavy rain kept out
        over the water as it made landfall... </p>
      <p><b>The Zones</b> </p>
      <p>"In January of 1997 I noticed stationary radar images during
        storms. At first it would appear as a dot that hid not move with
        the passing storm. The dots were arranged in a diamond-shaped
        pattern. You will be able to pick out many such zones if you
        review the past years’ weather. The precision of the locations
        is too geometrical to be natural. Some form of resonance is
        causing them. I believe they are involved in weather control.
        The machine is able to change the zones over a very large area,
        possibly the whole world. The cause of these areas involves this
        new force or energy that is made by my device. These zones are
        capable of generating very intense storms that just seem to sit
        there and dump rain. They can also cause intense tornados. I
        think they are the very cause of tornados. If a tornado watch is
        issued, I have found that directing the machine generally
        eastward, and shifting the direction about 15 degrees every 20
        minutes until the watch is over will result in no tornados
        hitting the ground. Doppler radar will detect tornados but they
        won’t make it to the ground. South Texas and Florida seem to be
        out of range for the process to be effective. </p>
      <p><b>Rain-Making</b> </p>
      <p>"I went to Arizona during the first week of August. On the way
        down I stopped at the severe storm prediction lab in Norman OK.
        I demonstrated the machine to Dr James Kepple. </p>
      <p>"The demonstration began at 9 a.m. I asked what he would like
        to see. He asked if the machine could make clouds and cool the
        place down. He said the day was going to be hot and clear. I
        asked what the dew point was; 69 was the answer. I told him I
        could make clouds, probably even rain. </p>
      <p>"I started the machine and set it for maximum rain. One hour
        later not much was happening and he chased me out. Said he had
        some important work to do. I told him to watch the sky. This
        stuff takes a little while sometimes. I told him the clouds
        would roll in and that they would be arranged in a diamond
        pattern like rows of corn. </p>
      <p>"Six hours later it began to rain. I videotaped the
        diamond-shaped cloud formation. The temperature dropped. </p>
      <p>"Dr Kepple sent me a letter 2 weeks later indicating nothing
        happened that couldn’t be explained meteorologically. He said
        the machine was too small to affect the weather. He must be a
        real expert on this device. In one hour the machine produced
        exactly what he ordered which contradicted his own forecast. </p>
      <p>"Dr Kepple failed to recognize one thing about the machine. If
        the desired weather event is impossible due to the present
        conditions, it won’t happen. All the machine did that day was
        make a very unlikely event take place. You can’t make rain out
        of a dry sky. You can, however, certainly cause more rain to
        fall from a damp one. </p>
      <p><b>Vortex</b> </p>
      <p>"I left Norman and went on to Sedona AZ. It was here the answer
        to the puzzle was found. I checked into a campground in Sedona
        and went to the rear of the truck to set up the camper. I
        noticed huge quantities of ‘stuff’ (I am going to call the
        radiation ‘stuff’ because I don’t know what it is yet) coming
        out of the machine. The power level was so high that you could
        feel it 10 feet from the machine. The machine wasn’t even
        running. The power was at least 1000 times the Marble Rock
        level. </p>
      <p>"We went into town to shop for souvenirs.. I bought a "vortex"
        map of the Sedona area, which is famous for its telluric energy.
        The vortexes are located on a diamond-shaped pattern around the
        area. I took the machine to the airport mesa vortex and ran a
        few tests... </p>
      <p>"The sky was completely covered by clouds except for a small
        hole directly above the vortex area. I set up the machine and
        set it to clear the sky. Huge quantities of stuff rolled out of
        the machine... The sky cleared off to a diameter of about 60
        miles in 10 minutes. I videotaped the event." </p>
      <p><b>Indians</b> </p>
      <p>"The clerk at the souvenir shop said the Indians found these
        places long ago. They called it holy ground.. They would go to
        these places for healing and restoration if they were sick. The
        Sedona people claim the area has natural healing powers. </p>
      <p>"A tour of Indian dwelling ruins confirmed the ancient ones had
        indeed located vortexes. The machine’s output went sky high at
        the museum on the south rim of the Grand Canyon. An Indian kiva
        was located there... </p>
      <p>"At the town of Aztec neat the Four Corners is another ruin.
        This one has the kiva fully restored. The machine’s output was
        ‘sky high’ when we pulled in to see the ruin... We toured the
        place for one hour and it started to rain. </p>
      <p>"We left the ruin and went to Aztec 3 or 4 miles away...
        Looking toward the ruin, I saw a single cloud directly above the
        structure and 15 smaller clouds in a circle around the place.
        Could this building be an ancient weather machine? </p>
      <p>"One thing is for certain. These spots make the same stuff my
        machine makes. That means it’s natural, and not some ‘death
        ray’. </p>
      <p>"Scientists have gone to these places and tried to measure the
        stuff. It doesn’t show up on the instruments available. Because
        they can’t measure it, some claim it doesn’t exist." </p>
      <p><b>Health Effects</b> </p>
      <p>"Shortly after I began working on this thing, I developed a
        curious rash. I thought I had chicken pox or shingles or
        something. The doctor could not find a cause. I told him about
        the motor. He said it couldn’t cause anything like that. He gave
        me pills and a cream that didn’t work. After about two months
        the rash disappeared on its own. The machine was shoved under
        the bench and shut down at this time. I think when I shut down
        the machine, the rash cleared up. </p>
      <p>"When I restarted the machine on May 18, 1997 the rash
        reappeared, only on a different part of the body. The original
        rash was on my chest and arms. The new condition was attacking
        my right leg. </p>
      <p>"I went back to the doctor and got more pills and creams that
        didn’t work. The doctor couldn’t find a cause. Oddly, in spite
        of the affliction, I felt great. At 52 years age, I was working
        18 hour days with no fatigue. A rush job in the shop and we put
        in a couple of 36 hour days to get the thing out of there. It
        seemed that if the machine was pointed to the east, it created a
        condition of total insomnia which enable you to work for a very
        long time without fatigue. </p>
      <p>"The rash on my right leg did not subside during the summer and
        fall of 1996. On December 18, 1996, I decided to shut down the
        machine to see if the machine might be the cause. Sure enough,
        it began to clear up. </p>
      <p>"The machine was restarted on January 6, 1997. The rash
        reappeared. I had not welded anything for some time. About
        January 10, a guy came to the shop with a thing to weld. I took
        the wire welder and made a weld about 12 inches long. As I
        watched, the backs of both hands broke out into a red rash and
        blisters formed. The process took minutes. </p>
      <p>"Now I knew the cause. My right leg was affected because the
        welder power cable hands near my right leg when I weld. The
        heavy pulsating magnetic field around the cable triggers the
        reaction. The reaction in my hands was about to reveal the cure.
      </p>
      <p>"My hands seemed hot. I measured the temperature of my hands
        and sure enough, the thermometer registered an astonishing 107
        degrees. A few inches away, my arm was 98.6. What was happening
        here? </p>
      <p>"About three days later I picked up a plastic refrigerator
        magnet to read what was on it. As I read the magnet, I could
        feel energy hitting me in the face. This energy is the same that
        comes out of the machine. As I held the magnet, my hands cooled
        right down. In minutes the redness was gone. Wow! </p>
      <p>"Apparently what was happening in some atom in my body gets
        triggered into an above-ground state by a pulsating magnetic
        field such as you find in a welder or battery charger. It
        becomes a stove and burns the area around it. The affliction is
        not a rash at all. It’s a low-grade burn. </p>
      <p>"I put a magnet in my pocket and the leg and hands completely
        healed in a few days. The steady magnetic field around the small
        pocket magnet evidently returns the atom to ground state and
        stops the reaction. </p>
      <p>"The reaction is not a bad thing. It is what reverses aging.
        The affected leg was in bad condition when the process started.
        It is now my best leg. The skin looks good, the scars are gone.
        The leg is much stronger. </p>
      <p>"I have had ‘white finger’ (a condition that causes the fingers
        to turn white when exposed to cold weather) most of my life. The
        hands seem normal now since the reaction. </p>
      <p>"Along about the first of June, 1996, I looked in the mirror
        one morning and noticed that my hair was beginning to grow back.
        It seemed as if I was getting younger. This continued since and
        I will have all of my hair back in about another year at the
        rate it is growing. </p>
      <p>"Several Scars from very old injuries melted away. I have had
        several small injuries during this experiment that have healed
        very rapidly, leaving no scars. The condition of my skin has
        greatly improved. I think the machine can reverse aging. Time
        will tell. </p>
      <p>"I have been nearsighted all my life. For the past year I have
        noticed my vision improving. At the rate it is improving, I may
        not need glasses much longer. </p>
      <p><b>The Bugs</b> </p>
      <p>"An effect on flying insects has been noted. When the machine
        is operated to the east, all flying insects land and sit, except
        the mosquito. </p>
      <p>"Turn the machine to any other direction, and the bugs take off
        and fly. If flies are held down for 3 or 4 days, they die. We
        have very few flies in town. The effect is evident for about 10
        miles. When I leave town at night, I travel about 10 miles
        before bugs begin to hit the windshield of the car. </p>
      <p><b>Jelly Water</b> </p>
      <p>"An oddity concerning water has been noted. When the machine
        has been running for a few days, standing water doesn’t stir
        normally. You can drag a stick through it and stuff floating in
        the water barely moves. The normal swirls and eddies are
        reduced. I have no idea what is happening here... A pond of
        jelly water was found at one of the Indian kiva sites we
        visited. </p>
      <p><b>Strange Cooling</b> </p>
      <p>"On several occasions, objects in refrigerators have frozen
        solid following a shutdown of the machine. My brand new
        refrigerator will freeze all of the pop and beer. The bar across
        the street is also affected. The coffee cream comes to the table
        frozen after a shutdown of the machine. I have no idea what is
        causing this. It seems consistent with shutdown of the machine.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Trees</b> </p>
      <p>"The trees around town are all growing toward the machine as if
        it were the sun. This concludes the noted side effects... </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
      <p>"I hope you find this report of interest. I am not providing
        details as to the workings and construction of the device... To
        patent the device would only reveal the means to everyone.
        Terrorists could use it as a weapon. The inability to detect the
        device is a problem. It could be buried in the ground and ruin
        the weather for years. We would be powerless to locate and shut
        off the machine... </p>
      <p>"I think a network of these machines should be put in place
        that is run by a company of experts who decide what we want. The
        cost of the operation should be paid for by the government. The
        damage caused by a single hurricane that is not stopped will
        cost many times the cost of this project. The machines are
        simple and cheap. They will be the smallest part of the cost." </p>

      <p>In 1994 David Wells saw a presentation by Joseph Newman
        demonstrating a motor that allegedly put out more power than it
        consumed. Wells went home and built a machine, noting that it
        nearly ran without any energy input, taking 90 days to run the
        batteries down. </p>
      <p>His shop was twelve miles from his home, and as he drove back
        and forth, he began to notice that when the sky was clouded over
        there was a curious hole in the cloud cover over the vicinity of
        the machine. He then noted that the effect would reverse if he
        changed the position of the machine -- it would draw clouds in
        and even rain. </p>
      <p>He began tinkering with the machine, modifying it and its
        position, and observing effects on the weather. He also build a
        dozen or so other machines which various people have been
        operating in sundry places around the U.S. The effect can be
        very long-range. </p>
      <p>In the ensuing years, Wells says that "thousands" of weather
        modifications have been made by the various machines. He says
        the cause-effect relationships has become fairly well
        established. <br>
        Wells does not give out the plans for how to build these
        devices, but to give you an idea of their simplicity, the parts
        for the machines cost less than $200, and can be built and
        assembled in an afternoon. The machine operates on a 12-volt
        battery, drawing just a few milli-amps. </p>
      <p><i>Verification </i>: --- In addition to the several people
        who operate these machines, New Energy Congress member, Robert
        Nelson of RexResearch.com observed one such machine in operation
        and attests to the reproducible cause-effect relationship
        between the machine operation and the weather. "I can personally
        attest to its power over weather since I had the opportunity to
        test one of Wells' machines for a few months in 1998." [1] (<i>http://www.rexresearch.com/wells/wells.htm</i>)
      </p>
      <dl>
        <i>Objective</i> : --- Mr. Wells is hoping to establish a
        national network of largely automated machines with a control
        central where severe weather could be abated, and some weather
        engineering could be organized. Ramifications : --- Some of
        these new technologies may end up having unexpected secondary
        effects that go unobserved by the experimenter, but which impact
        life around them.

          (13 Mb; mp3) - On Dec. 24, 2007, Sterling D. Allan conducted a
          55-minute interview with David Wells as part of the Free
          Energy Now&nbsp; (<i>http://freeenergynow.net</i>)&nbsp; radio
          series.</p>
      </dl>
      <i>How it Works</i>: The device appears to work similar to the
      cloudbuster technology. It appears to involve a 20-mile
      wavelength. The wavelengths set up interference patterns with the
      earth's natural wavelengths. The peaks and valleys of those
      interference patterns determine what kind of weather appears.
      <p><i>Applications</i>: Steer tropical storms and hurricanes away
        from populated centers; Prevent tornado formation; Stop
        droughts; Put out forest fires; Turn Nebraska into a
        agricultural giant; Sunny weather for social events </p>
      <p><i>Anomalies</i>:&nbsp; The machine appears to effect the speed
        of light, as shown by the movement of a laser beam on the wall,
        and the displacement of GPS readings. </p>
      <p>A new force is described that can allegedly be felt by around
        40% of people who try it, involving being able to feel a bead of
        heat-like sensation between a lit candle and Sedona Arizona; can
        be felt as far as 20-40 feet away from the flame. This same
        sensation can be felt between the machine and Sedona. </p>
      <p>One time, during peak tornado season, Wells was able to prevent
        tornados for a week in "Tornado Alley". This anomie was reported
        on Coast to Coast as "strange weather", not knowing the <br>
        'rest of the story.' </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><b><i>HISTORY</i></b>&nbsp;
          -&nbsp; I discovered the effect in 1994. I was studying Joe
          Newman's motor to see if there was anything to the over unity
          claims. Joe had his motor on display at the fair grounds and
          we went to see it. My thought was you can't do what he
          claimed. After talking to his helper while Joe rambled on in
          front of the crowd, I learned that a window fan had apparently
          run for 5 years on an 8 volt battery. I decided to study the
          motor. Joe's motor had 350 lbs of copper wire in the coil. I
          did not have very much copper so I decided to build a small
          motor and let it run as freely aspossible to see if the thing
          could break even or make some energy. I got the thing going
          and it did run real cheap. <br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I had difficulty telling what was going in
        and what was coming out of the motor. I had a scope, but
        couldn't make sense of what was happening. I had trouble with
        the commutator, too much drag, so I fixed it up with auto
        breaker points with a roller on the cam. Then I split the
        circuit by adding the full wave bridge rectifier and the second
        battery. The results were amazing. The circuit completely
        eliminated the spark in the points. You couldn't see the spark
        in the dark. The power battery would discharge and the load
        battery would charge up. Switching batteries would keep the
        motor running for a long time. I could measure the power in and
        compare to the power out because the circuits were separated. It
        was running very close to unity, so close that errors in
        measurements could go either way. I decided to take two fresh 5
        amp hour moped batteries and hook it up and let it run until it
        stopped. If it ran the batteries down, it was not over unity. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The machine was placed on the north wall of
        the shop and started running. Pretty soon a cold weather snap
        came ( I'm sure the motor caused the cold snap ) in and it was
        20 below zero. My shop was freezing cold and too big to heat. I
        decided to put in a small office room to work in that could be
        heated. While the remodeling job took place, the machine got
        moved to the west wall and pointed east. It remained there for
        the rest of the test. It was this stroke of luck that let me
        discover the effect. When the machine is pointed east, it pokes
        a hole in the cloud cover and brings out the sun. The hole will
        follow the sun across the sky all day long. No other direction
        of operation creates anything visible that a person would
        observe while operating the motor. Also, I would not have
        noticed the effect if it were not for the fact that I lived 12
        miles from the shop and saw what was happening as I went to and
        from work every day.<br>
        <br>
        Thus began a long series of tests to see what the thing was
        capable of. It will amaze you if you have the patience to run
        the experiments. It is such a slow moving show that you will be
        the only one that realizes what has happened. Clearing off
        clouds doesn't take very long, and doesn't really accomplish
        much. This is the fastest action the machine will produce. When
        you get your machine, look for the setting that clears the
        clouds. This is the direction that stops rain. Point it the
        other way to make rain. All of the test work has been done with
        4 basic directions. If the rotor was a wheel and was rolling
        down the road, this is what we call the direction it is running.
        We say " running east", or "running west" to describe what we
        are doing. Different areas require different settings to make
        things happen. In my area, running east stops rain. In New
        Mexico, running east makes rain. So when a machine arrives in a
        new area, the operator must learn what setting produce the rain
        or shine. There is a very good program called "ripple tank" on
        Google that explains wave interference. You should get familiar
        with waves to understand what you are doing. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This program is great for experimenting and
        testing, but you will be affecting somewhere 1000s of miles away
        and will have a hard time telling what you are
        doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal">The machine is
        fairly simple and any construction seems to work (as long as the
        polarities are kept right). <br>
