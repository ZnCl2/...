        <b>WO2015057502</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An optimized system creates potable water from water vapor in the
      atmosphere, or purifies salt water or contaminated water. The
      system employs a condenser having multiple metal condensation
      surfaces. These condensation surfaces are cooled by coolant
      passing through conduits attached to the condensation surfaces.
      The coolant is cooled by a cooling unit. Power is supplied to the
      cooling unit by solar photovoltaic panels, or wind turbines, or
      the electric grid. The system can be mobile or fixed and can
      produce potable water at remote locations. The system may employ
      an evaporator which evaporates non-potable water into an air
      stream. The evaporator includes a solar or gas heater which
      increases the temperature of the air. Metals may be extracted from
      the salt water.; If sewage is used, solid organic waste may be
      processed into combustible gas which is burned by an engine
      running a generator to power that system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to apparatus
      designed to harvest moisture and purify non-potable water, and
      more particularly, to harvest moisture and purify non-potable
      water to produce potable water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Increasing population requires more clean water. Urban
      population growth will increase demand for household water, and
      the need for clean, potable water will increase. Conventional
      water supplies will run short because of increased demand and
      local overuse of natural water supplies.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Large amounts of potable water are currently being used by
      industries which release chemicals into the water that make the
      water unfit for drinking. One industry use which uses large
      amounts of water is hydraulic tracking. Much of the tracking
      solutions are not purified, further reducing the clean water
      supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Some non-operational industries, such as the coal mining
      industry have ceased operations in certain areas. Since some of
      them went bankrupt, they have left abandoned mines which now
      release large amounts of mine drainage into waterways.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Similarly, sometimes wastewater, water contaminated with
      microorganisms, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers make large amounts
      of water unfit for drinking.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Another source of non-potable water is salt water, such as
      seawater or brackish water.<br>
      <br>
      Salt water can be desalinated to create fresh water by
      conventional methods; however these are not practical in certain
      regions. The best known methods for desalinization are a) vacuum
      evaporation by boiling, b) distillation or c) reverse osmosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Unfortunately, boiling and distillation requires
      significant energy to operate efficiently and the resultant cost
      of treated water puts this technology out of reach for the
      majority in need. Desalination plants exist in rich nations such
      as the United States and Saudi Arabia but are not feasible
      everywhere due to the costs. The lack of capital in developing
      nations makes large desalination plants with high-volume
      production impractical.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another method of desalinating salt water is by using
      reverse osmosis. Desalinating by reverse osmosis requires placing
      water under high pressure and forcing the water through porous
      membranes. The pores are sized to allow water molecules through
      but do not pass charged ions, such as salt ions. Reverse osmosis
      requires equipment to raise the water pressure to high levels,
      again requiring significant energy. Reverse osmosis also only
      results in a small volume of clean water being produced.
      Therefore, while it is not very economical or efficient to use
      reverse osmosis for desalination, it is the most widely used
      method for desalination, despite its high costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Even if one were to use one of these methods, they
      typically are done in stationary plants and the clean water would
      have to be transported to where it is needed. Producing potable
      water near its place of use removes the requirement for
      transporting the water to where it is needed. Therefore,
      pipelines, canals or tanker trucks are not required.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Production of high-quality water at or near its place of
      use is superior to transporting drinking water, which requires
      substantial consumption of energy for delivery and if bottled,
      container waste disposal.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Another source of water is moisture in the air. Current
      technology exists that utilizes fans, pumps, and refrigeration
      units to extract water vapor from the air; however, it is
      dependent on electricity or fossil fuels to power the devices.
      These technologies are not suitable for much of the world's
      population where artificial power sources are not readily
      available.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] There currently is a global need for cost-effective,
      simple, efficient, stationary and mobile systems for producing
      potable water where it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the present invention takes the form of an
      apparatus capable of harvesting atmospheric water. The apparatus
      includes a harvester comprised of a thin sheet of material
      connected to a cooling source. As the surface of the thin sheet is
      cooled, evaporated water condenses and precipitates on to the thin
      sheet. The precipitated water is then collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Another embodiment of the present invention may take the
      form of a desalinization apparatus. In this embodiment, seawater
      or other brine may be loaded into a basin and evaporated. The
      process of evaporation separates fresh water from the minerals.
      The evaporated water may then be brought in proximity to the thin
      sheet, thereby condensing and collecting the fresh water.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Still another embodiment of the present invention may take
      the form of a wastewater treatment apparatus. In this embodiment,
      municipal or industrial wastewaters may be loaded into one or more
      process vessels. The wastewater may then be evaporated, with fresh
      water condensing on the thin sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] An embodiment of the current invention may be described as
      a system for producing potable water having a fan for creating an
      air stream of ambient air and a condenser within the air stream
      having a number of conduits adapted to carry a liquid coolant. The
      liquid coolant reduces the temperature of the condenser and
      surrounding air below the dew point of the ambient air, causing
      moisture in the ambient air to condense on the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A cooling device that runs on electric power is coupled to
      the conduits and is adapted to lower the temperature of the liquid
      coolant below a dew point of the ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A solar photovoltaic array creates electric power to power
      the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A plurality of sensors is adapted to measure physical
      parameters of the system and provide their measurements to a
      control unit coupled to the sensors. The control unit is also
      coupled to the fan, the cooling device and the photovoltaic array
      and can read information from the sensors and adjust elements of
      the system accordingly to optimize operation of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The current invention may also be embodied as a system for
      producing potable water from non-potable water having an
      evaporator with a chamber for receiving, containing and heating a
      stream of air, a second chamber for receiving non-potable water
      having an air passageway in contact with the non-potable water and
      an airflow exit, at least one passageway fluidically connecting
      the first chamber to the second chamber allowing the heated stream
      of air to pass from the first chamber through the second chamber
      and out of the airflow exit, thereby increasing the amount of
      water vapor in the air stream leaving the airflow exit. The system
      also includes a condenser fluidically coupled to the airflow exit
      of the evaporator adapted to receive the moist airstream, a number
      of condensation surfaces cooled by a coolant to a temperature
      below the dew point, causing the moist airstream to condense the
      water vapor in the air stream into potable liquid water. At least
      one cooling unit is adapted to cool the coolant to a temperature
      below the dew point of the moist air. A plurality of sensors
      measure physical parameters of the system. A control unit is
      coupled to the sensors, the fan, the cooling device and the
      photovoltaic array. The control unit reads information from the
      sensors and adjusts elements of the system accordingly to optimize
      operation of the system. The system is powered by a solar
      photovoltaic array adapted to create electric power. There also
      may be a windmill driving an electric generator acting to power
      the system. Battery storage may be employed to store electricity
      for later use. In alternative embodiments, the system also employs
      at least one pressure sensor adapted to measure pressure within
      the conduit; and the control unit is coupled to the pressure
      sensors and fan for interactively measuring the pressure within
      the vessel to adjust the fan operation to optimize condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The system may also employ a number of temperature sensors
      adapted to measure temperature at various locations within the
      conduit, and a heating device in the evaporator. The control unit
      is coupled to at least one of the temperature sensors and the
      heating device for interactively measuring the temperature within
      the vessel to adjust the heater operation to optimize evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The current invention may also be embodied as a system for
      creating potable water from non-potable water employing an
      evaporator section employing a plurality of evaporators, with each
      evaporator having an input for receiving input air and an output
      for exhausting air. Each evaporator is adapted to evaporate
      non-potable water into an input air stream received at its input
      and to create a moist air stream at its output. The evaporators
      are connected in series such that the output of one is coupled to
      the input of the next. The system also employs at least one
      humidity sensor near the input of each evaporator capable of
      determining the relative humidity, a bypass conduit which bypasses
      at least one evaporator, at least one bypass valve adapted to
      divert the moist air stream to the bypass conduit when activated,
      a control unit coupled to the humidity sensors and at least one
      bypass valve, adapted to sense when the humidity of the moist air
      stream exceeds a predetermined level and to activate at least one
      bypass valve causing the moist air stream to bypass at least one
      evaporator, and a condenser for receiving the moist air stream and
      condensing potable water from the moist air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The current invention may also be embodied as a system for
      creating potable water from non-potable water having an evaporator
      for receiving the non-potable water and evaporating it into a
      moist air stream flowing in a direction, a condenser section
      employing a plurality of condensers, each positioned behind a
      previous one within the direction of the moist stream such that
      the air stream must flow past a first condenser to reach a next
      condenser, wherein the condensers receive a liquid coolant to
      reduce their temperature below the dew point of the moist air; at
      least one humidity sensor between the condensers, for measuring
      the relative humidity, a bypass conduit which bypasses at least
      one condenser; at least one bypass valve adapted to divert the
      moist air stream to the bypass conduit when activated, a control
      unit coupled to the humidity sensors coupled to the sensors and
      the at least one bypass valve, adapted to sense when the humidity
      of the moist air stream drops below a predetermined level and to
      activate at least one bypass valve causing the moist air stream to
      bypass at least one condenser.<br>

      <br>
      [0042] The conventional methods of distillation and reverse
      osmosis are not feasible in the third world countries where the
      water is needed the most. The device and process proposed in this
      application use neither of these methods. It is an evaporative
      method that uses the natural process of evaporation of a liquid
      into air.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The proposed process is the opposite of conventional
      evaporation devices wherein the water is heated to move the water
      molecules from the liquid phase to the vapor phase. In this
      device, the air is heated so that the water-carrying capacity of
      the air increases over the water- carrying capacity available at
      lower temperatures. This alone does not produce high rate
      evaporation, as the air at the water/air interface becomes rapidly
      saturated with water vapor and the rate of evaporation decreases
      significantly and rapidly. To effect high rate evaporation of the
      water volume, the saturated air at the water/air boundary must be
      removed and replaced with moisture-deficient air. A fan or blower
      may be used to effect this movement from the evaporator unit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Constrained Optimization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] The system of the current application is optimized to
      produce high rate production of potable water for the least cost
      that is compatible with existing resources. Since the water is
      intended to be potable, there must be less than a predetermined
      acceptable level of contaminants. The evaporator and the condenser
      are each optimized for the least cost to produce the required
      amount of potable water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Evaporator Optimization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] To optimize the evaporator, one would like to increase the
      surface area interaction between the water and the air. On way to
      do this is by creating a microclimate near the water. A
      microclimate is a local atmospheric zone where the climate differs
      from the surrounding area. Thereby by at least partially enclosing
      a volume near the water's surface, humidity near the water surface
      creates a microclimate. The airflow then carries humid air from
      this microclimate away. One would also try to increase the air
      flow rate to increase the amount of potable water produced.
      Therefore, bubbling the air through the non-potable water would
      increase surface area interaction; however, at higher flow rates
      this causes droplets to become entrained in the air stream,
      contaminating it, making the water non-potable.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Therefore, it was found that running a laminar air stream
      over the non-potable water would cause the water to evaporate into
      the air stream at high volumetric flow rates. If the air stream
      has laminar flow, few droplets become entrained in the air steam,
      even at higher air velocities. This allows more throughput of the
      water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] It was also determined that a large surface area having
      laminar air stream rather than a turbulent air stream passing over
      the surface of the non-potable water achieved very good results.
      It was also determined that only the air adjacent the water
      surface received water vapor. Therefore, the height of the air
      flow chamber was minimized to maximize air relative humidity, and
      keep the flow laminar.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Condenser Optimization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] It was determined that using metal sheeting with common
      metal piping material that was either cast or fabricated was the
      most cost-effective way to make condensers while achieving
      acceptable heat transfer efficiency. Again, creating a local
      microclimate around the condenser surface creates cooled air which
      interacts with the moist humid air, causing precipitation even
      before the moist air touches the condenser surfaces. The
      efficiency of this design was measured for various temperatures.
      The square footage required to condense the water vapor provided
      by the evaporator was then determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] To convert the water from the vapor phase back to the
      liquid phase a condenser must be used to create microclimate where
      the temperature surrounding the condenser unit is lowered to a
      point below the dew point of the air wherein upon contact with the
      microclimate, the water will condense through precipitation. The
      now moisture-deficient air is directed back to the evaporator
      unit. The salts or contaminants present in the original water
      source remain behind in the concentrate left in the evaporator and
      the precipitated water is potable and ready for human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] The embodiments of this application may be classified into
      three categories, such as those that:<br>
      <br>
      1) directly remove moisture from the atmosphere, referred to as a
      'water harvesting system',<br>
      <br>
      2) desalinate salt water, referred to as a 'desalination system',
      and<br>
      <br>
      3) purify contaminated water, or non-potable water in the
      environment, such as from a river stream, settling pond, lake, or
      other body of water, referred to as a 'water purification system'.<br>
      <br>
      1) Water Harvesting System [0051] The water harvesting device
      designed for atmospheric operation condenses water directed to the
      unit from the atmosphere where it precipitates as it contacts the
      micro-climate modifications surrounding the condensation panels.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] While there will be some condensation of the moisture as it
      comes in contact with the panels, the majority of the condensation
      will occur in the zone of cooled air surrounding the panel surface
      where the dew point of the air mass is reduced in relation to the
      dew point of the air carrying the moisture effecting rapid
      condensation of the water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with
      reference to Figures 1-7. However, those skilled in the art will
      readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with
      respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the
      invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Figure 1 is a block diagram of a water harvester apparatus
      100 for extracting moisture from the atmosphere. The apparatus 100
      is comprised, in part, of a condenser 200 connected to a coolant
      device 105, which may be a water chiller or any device which cools
      a circulating fluid capable of transferring heat referred to as a
      coolant. The coolant device 105 receives and cools the coolant
      passing through condenser 200. In preferred embodiments of the
      present invention, a fan 101 is included to direct ambient
      moisture laden air 3 through the condenser 200. It also may
      include a cooling tower 107 that couples with the coolant device
      105 to absorb the heat extracted by the coolant device 105 and
      dissipate the heat through the cooling tower 107.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Preferred embodiments also include a power source that may
      take the form of a storage battery 113 fed by a solar photovoltaic
      array 109 and/or wind turbine system 111. The power source is used
      to operate the coolant device 105, and is able to do so where
      power is unavailable.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In an alternative embodiment, the condenser 200 may be
      enclosed in a containment vessel 115 having an air flow valve at
      an air exit, where the dry air 7 exits the system. By using the
      fan 101 to force air into the containment vessel 115, a slightly
      higher air pressure is created. Since air releases moisture as
      pressure decreases, this further increases the amount of potable
      water 5 created. The air flow valve 225 is adjustable so that the
      amount of flow and the pressure may be adjusted to optimize the
      potable water 5 created. Optionally, a control unit may monitor
      the pressure inside of the containment vessel 115, and operate the
      air flow valve 225 to interactively optimize the water harvester
      system 100. [0057] Figure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the
      condenser 200 of Figure 1. The condenser 200 may be mounted to a
      base using mounting supports 230. It may also include a plurality
      of panels 210 arranged above each other. The panels 210 in one
      embodiment are covered with thin metal sheets each referred to as
      a collection surface 211. The panels 210 are preferably
      manufactured of thin-gage stainless steel and have varying
      dimensions dependent on the water volume and condensation rate
      desired. In certain embodiments, the sheet dimensions are
      approximately 8 feet wide x 6 feet high with an overall height of
      12 feet.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A coolant at a low temperature enters the inlet 221 of the
      distribution piping 220. The coolant flows through the
      distribution piping 220 and through the panels 210 to the
      distribution piping 220 on the opposite side of the panels 210 and
      out of the outlet 223. The purpose is to cool the collection
      surfaces 211 below the dew point to cause condensation of moisture
      in the air impacting the collection surfaces 211 and the cooled
      air volume (microclimate) surrounding the collection surfaces. The
      moisture that condenses is pure, potable water and falls into an
      optional collection basin 250 which collects it.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In a preferred embodiment, the panels 210 include an
      integrated series of stainless steel tubes, referred to as
      intermediate tubes, passing through them.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Figure 3 is another preferred embodiment of the condenser
      shown as condenser structure 300, which may be used in place of
      condenser 200. It may be mounted to a base with mounting supports
      330. This embodiment has several panels 310 behind each other with
      respect to the direction of air flow. Low temperature coolant
      enters the distribution piping 320 at inlet 321.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] This embodiment also includes an integrated series of
      stainless steel tubes referred to as intermediate pipes 315 that
      abut the water harvest collection surfaces 311. Coolant enters
      distribution pipes 320 at inlet pipe 321 then passes through a
      lower common pipe 313 and a cross pipe which feeds the other
      panels 310. The coolant then flows through the lower common pipe
      313 then upward through the intermediate pipes 315 to collect in
      the upper common pipes 317. This cools the water harvest
      collection surfaces 31 land attendant microclimate below the dew
      point of the ambient air in the air flowing past the condenser
      structure 300. Distribution pipes 320 have a discontinuity 325
      which prevents the coolant from bypassing panel 310.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Cooling the water harvest collection surfaces 31 land
      microclimate causes the humid air in the air stream passing the
      surface of the thin sheet to cool as well, thereby condensing the
      moisture therein. As the moisture carrying capacity of the air
      volume is exceeded, water condenses both on the water harvest
      collection surfaces 31 land within the microclimate volume and
      drops into an optional collection basin 350 resulting in potable
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] It is preferred that the conduits carrying coolant and the
      panels are not exactly horizontal, but slightly inclined. This
      allows condensation to run to a common lowest point and drip into
      a collection basin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Desalination System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] The current system may also be embodied as one that
      efficiently desalinates salt water, including brackish water,
      saline hydraulic fracturing water used in "fracking", and
      seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The design of the system to treat salt water is twofold: 1)
      the first portion of the method is to create a precisely designed
      environment, causing a large amount of water vapor to be
      evaporated into a volume of air, and, 2) creating an environment
      and condensation chamber conducive to rapid condensation of the
      evaporated moisture from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Figure 4 shows an embodiment of a desalination system. Salt
      water, such as seawater, is received at a salt water intake 402.
      The salt water received is passed through a heat exchanger 403
      coupled to a coolant device 405. The cold seawater extracts heat
      from a hot side of a coolant device 405. The coolant device 405
      may be a refrigeration unit or a heat pump. These typically pump
      heat out of one area and release it to another area. In this case,
      the coolant device 405 is pumping heat out of the coolant running
      through the condenser 200. The heat is then passed through the
      heat exchanger 403 to preheat the salt water entering the
      evaporator 500. While the additional heat allows for faster
      evaporation of the salt water, it is optional and not necessary
      for the operation of the system. Typically, the evaporator 500 is
      heated by the sun; however, an infrared heater 425, or other type
      of heater may be used at night, or when the sky is overcast.
      Moisture depleted dry air 11 also enters the evaporator 500. The
      moisture depleted dry air 1 1 receives water vapor as it
      evaporates to result in moist air 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The evaporator 500 also releases the salt water concentrate
      13 which is what remains after much of the water is removed. This
      salt water concentrate may have dissolved minerals, and heavy
      metals. These may be gold, silver and other valuable substances. A
      resource recovery device 419 receives the salt water concentrate
      and processes it to increase the concentration of the brine and
      allow concentration of dissolved metals to low grade ore levels
      for the recovery of metals. This process is used to extract and
      recover metals 423 and other substances. What remains is salt
      solution 421 which is returned to the water source, or is
      processed for industrial or commercial uses.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The moist air 9 is then brought into proximity of the
      condenser 200 or 300 as indicated in Figure 1 above and performs
      the same functions to result in potable water 5 being produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The coolant device 405 functions in much of the same manner
      as coolant device 105 of Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The coolant device 405 is optionally powered by solar
      photovoltaic array 409, wind turbine 411 and battery storage 413,
      similar to elements of the same names in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Figure 5 is a side elevational diagram of one embodiment of
      an evaporator 500 of<br>
      <br>
      Figures 4, 6, and 7 according to the present invention. Please
      note that going forward, salt water, sewage water, polluted water,
      water contaminated with chemicals, and other non-potable water may
      be collectively be referred to as "non-potable water".<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The evaporator 500 is designed to evaporate the largest
      amount of into the air without suspending non-potable water 23
      droplets in the air stream 25. Since this system is optimized to
      create large amounts of potable water, it must use a high air flow
      rate that does not kick up water droplets.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Moisture depleted dry air 11 enters a heating chamber 501
      from a return air distribution plenum 539. The heating chamber 501
      may be a greenhouse-like structure or other structure designed to
      collect the energy from the sun. An air baffle 503 arranged
      vertically creates an air flow channel 525 which is separated from
      the air heating chamber 501 by the air baffle 503.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] A straightening plenum 509 is positioned at the end of the
      air flow channel 525 to redirect the downward air stream to a
      horizontal air stream 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A separation deck 506 is a horizontal separator which
      creates a top of an evaporation chamber 507. The water surface 21
      in the evaporation chamber 507 creates the floor. The evaporation
      chamber 507 is designed to allow an air stream with a significant
      amount of volumetric flow to pass between the separation deck 506
      and the water surface 21 of non-potable water 23 with little or no
      turbulence. It is intended to have laminar airflow. The air flow
      along the surface of the non-potable water 23 in the evaporation
      chamber 507 allows a substantial amount of water molecules to be
      released from the surface and jump into the vapor phase. As
      indicated above, the width, length and shape are designed to have
      substantial laminar air stream. The laminar air flow reduces the
      amount of non-potable water 23 being swept up by the air stream as
      suspended water droplets, reducing the potential for contamination
      for the purified water. The closed evaporation chamber 507 creates
      a micro climate of high humidity which is highest at the air water
      boundary. This boundary layer air absorbs moisture to have a high
      relative humidity. Once the relative humidity is high, the air
      absorbs little additional moisture. Therefore, this boundary layer
      must be constantly replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] There are water inlets 511 underneath the water in the
      evaporation chamber 507. The non-potable water 23 enters here to
      replace the water that has evaporated.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A fan 401 draws the moist air 9 out of the evaporator 500,
      thereby causing a slight reduction of the air pressure. If the air
      flow valve 523 is partially closed, the air pressure is further
      reduced. Reduced air pressure facilitates evaporation of water
      into the flowing air.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In an alternative embodiment of the described system, the
      evaporation chamber 507 includes elongated vanes 541 along the air
      stream direction which facilitate laminar air stream. The vanes
      541 run parallel to the length of the evaporation chamber 507
      which minimize turbulence and increase laminar flow of the air
      stream 25 along the length of the vanes 541. These vanes may run
      for any length of the evaporator chamber 507.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In order to minimize the amount of liquid droplets from
      becoming swept up into the air stream 25 and becoming entrained in
      the airstream and contaminating the air stream 25, a barrier is to
      be used. This barrier may be a screen 543 as shown in Figure 5.
      Water droplets get caught in the screen and accumulate. When
      enough accumulate, they drop back into the non-potable water 23 in
      the bottom of the evaporation chamber 507. This screen 543 may run
      only the length of a portion which exhibits substantial turbulence
      or increased air flow velocity, or it may extend the entire length
      of the evaporation chamber 507.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] There may be sensors 827 throughout the evaporator 500
      which measure any physical parameter, such as temperature,
      relative humidity, air velocity, air turbulence, etc. These can be
      monitored by a control unit (825 of Figure 8) which then makes
      decisions based upon the input received, makes decisions and
      actuated elements of the system to optimize the operation of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In an alternative embodiment of the described system, the
      evaporation chamber 507 includes a narrowed portion followed by an
      enlarged portion, thereby causing an area of reduced air pressure,
      allowing for greater evaporation into the airstream.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3) Water Purification System </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0082] Another embodiment of the system described in this
      application purifies contaminated water. This contaminated water
      may be hydraulic fracturing brines which include other chemical
      contaminants besides the dissolved salts, abandoned mine water
      discharges, industrial wastewater, municipal wastewater, waters
      containing pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, or other chemicals, and
      water containing microorganisms, such as giardia and
      Cryptosporidium spores.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Referring now to Figure 6, an alternative embodiment of the
      present invention comprises a waste water system 600 capable of
      producing fresh water from wastewater such as having sewage with
      human waste. The elements function similarly to their counterparts
      in the desalination system 400 of Figure 4. Wastewater is received
      at the wastewater intake 602 and is preheated by heat exchanger
      603. A fan 601 draws moist air 9 from the evaporator 500 and
      passes it over a condenser 200 causing potable water 5 to be
      collected. Condenser 200 is cooled by a coolant cooled by a
      coolant device 605. The evaporator 500 receives wastewater with
      organic solid matter, such as human feces. There will also be
      dissolved organic material. The dissolved and solid organic
      material of the wastewater may be referred to as biochemical
      oxygen demand (BOD) material. In this embodiment, special material
      handling equipment should be used to extract solid materials and
      concentrated BOD material, referred to as concentrated wastewater
      15 from the wastewater before it is evaporated. The concentrated
      wastewater 15 is provided to an anaerobic reactor 615. This will
      be used to create methane and other combustible gases. The water
      vapor in the collected gases is removed by a gas dryer 617 using
      conventional equipment and methods. The dried gas is now available
      to be used as fuel for a gas-fired engine 619. The gas-fired
      engine 619 drives a generator 621 to create electric power that is
      provided to battery storage 613.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In an alternative embodiment, the power is provided
      directly to the coolant device 605 and to any other piece of
      equipment requiring electric power, such as pumps and fans.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The gas from the gas dryer 617 is also provided to a
      gas-fired heater 625. This heats the air in the evaporator 500
      that is used to absorb the water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Figure 7 discloses a water purification system 700 for
      non-potable water other than salt water. This may include natural
      bodies of water such as lakes, streams and ponds. Non-potable
      water 23 is received at the water intake 702 and is preheated by
      heat exchanger 703. A fan 701 draws moist air 9 from the
      evaporator 500 and passes it over a condenser 200 causing potable
      water 5 to be collected. Condenser 200 is cooled by a coolant
      cooled by a coolant device 605. This functions the same as the
      salt water system 400 of Figure 4, except that it does not include
      the elements for resource recovery 419 and an element to hold the
      recovered metals 423 since this water typically has little
      valuable metals to recover. It also does not include an element to
      collect the salt solution 421. These elements are replaced by a
      sludge handling element 723. This takes the sludge from the
      evaporator 500 and disposes it.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Figure 8 shows an alternative embodiment of the system
      which may be implemented into the systems of Figures 4, 6 and 7.
      Block 827 represents elements of these previous figures that are
      not shown in Figure 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Wastewater is received at the water intake 802 and is
      preheated by heat exchanger 803. A fan 801 draws moist air 9 from
      the evaporator 500 and passes it over a condenser 200 causing
      potable water 5 to be collected. Condenser 200 is cooled by a
      coolant cooled by a coolant device 805.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In this embodiment, a plurality of sensors 827 are located
      within the air stream to measure at least one of air temperature,
      air humidity, air flow rate, turbulence and other physical
      parameters. These sensors 827 may be located in or after the
      evaporator, in or after the condenser 200 or on either side of the
      air flow valves 225 and 523. These connect to the control unit
      825. Control unit 825 reads all necessary input from the sensors
      and makes determinations on how the system is running and what
      adjustments must be made to achieve the desired results.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Control unit 825 is connected to fan 801 and can read its
      current status. This may include the current it is receiving, its
      speed, the load, its past operation parameters values over time
      which can be paired with other information pertaining to the same
      time. The control unit can start, stop, adjust the speed and
      otherwise operate the fan.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Control unit 825 is connected to a coolant device 805. It
      can read any pertinent information from the coolant device 805 and
      also record this information along with its time of acquisition.
      The control unit can start, stop, adjust the speed, output and
      otherwise operate the coolant device 805. Control unit 825 is
      connected to all elements of the system and monitors them as well
      as actuates them to optimize the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In an alternative embodiment based upon Figure 8, there may
      be more than one fan, located at the inlet and/or outlet of the
      evaporator 500, or the vessel 240 or anywhere within the
      evaporator 500, the vessel 240 or other conduits of the system.
      Each fan may be interactively and independently controlled by the
      control unit 825 to adjust the air flow rate entering the
      evaporator 500/vessel 240, exiting the evaporator 500/vessel 240
      and any airflow within the evaporator 500/vessel 240. The varying
      air flow velocities can adjust local air pressures and be used to
      optimize the operation of the evaporator 500/vessel 240.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Also, the air flow valves 523 of the evaporator 500 and 225
      of the vessel 240 may be interactively and independently
      controlled by the control unit 825 in combination with the fans to
      adjust the air flow and pressures in various parts of the system
      to optimize its operation. In an additional embodiment, there may
      also be an air flow valve on an outlet of the evaporator(s) 500
      and on an inlet of the vessel(s) 240. These may also be
      independently and interactively controlled by the control unit 825
      along with other air flow control devices and fans to optimize the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Figure 9 shows an alternative embodiment of a portion of
      the system relating to the evaporator which may be merged into the
      systems of Figures 4, 6, 7 and 8. This evaporator section 900 can
      be used to replace the evaporator 500 of the previously described
      embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Depending upon the air flow rate, and the efficiency and
      size of the condensers, it may be more efficient to employ several
      evaporators 500. These evaporators 500 are connected here with
      connection conduits 933 which allow air flow to pass from an air
      flow outlet 525 of one evaporator 500 to a bypass valve 929. The
      bypass valve 929 may direct the air flow into an inlet of another
      evaporator 500 or to a bypass conduit, bypassing the remaining
      evaporators 500. There are sensors 827 which measure physical
      parameters such as temperature, relative humidity or other
      physical parameters. In this embodiment, they are at least
      measuring relative humidity. The output of the sensors 827 is
      provided to the control unit 825. The control unit 825 can then
      make determinations regarding the evaporators 500. For example, if
      the humidity sensed by sensor 827 after the first evaporator is
      70% relative humidity, it is determined that the humidity should
      be increased. Therefore the control unit 825 will leave bypass
      valve 929 open allowing the air stream to pass to the second
      evaporator 500. A sensor 827 after the second evaporator 500,
      determines that the relative humidity is at 95% and determines
      that passing it through another evaporator will use more energy
      but will not produce significant additional amount of potable
      water. Therefore, control unit 825 decides to operate the bypass
      valve 929 between the second and third evaporators 500 causing the
      air stream to be redirected through a connection conduit 933. The
      air stream then bypasses the last evaporator 500 since no further
      evaporation is required for this air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Figure 10 shows an alternative embodiment of a portion of
      the system relating to the condenser which may be merged into the
      systems of Figures 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Depending upon the air flow rate, and the efficiency and
      size of the evaporator 500, it may be more efficient to employ
      several condensers 201, 202, 203. These condensers 201, 202, 203
      have sensors 827 associated with them that provide information to
      the control unit 825. The control unit 825 can then make
      determinations regarding the condensers 201, 202, 203. For
      example, if the humidity sensed by sensor 827 after the first
      condenser 201 is not below a predetermined humidity level, it is
      determined that the humidity should be decreased and pass through
      a next condenser 202. Therefore the control unit 825 will leave
      the first bypass valve 1029 open allowing the air stream to pass
      to the second condenser 202. A sensor 827 after the second
      condenser 202 then determines that the relative humidity is below
      the predetermined humidity level. If it is decided that passing
      the air stream through another condenser 203 does not add much
      benefit, then control unit 825 operates the bypass valve 1029
      between the second condenser 202 and the third condenser203
      causing the air stream to be redirected through a connection
      conduit 1033. The air stream then bypasses the last condenser 200
      since no further condensation is required for this air stream. In
      this manner, the control unit can adjust various parameters of the
      system, such as adjusting air flow rate. It can adjust the number
      of evaporators that the air stream will pass through, the number
      of condensers it will pass through, the temperature of the
      coolant, the pressure in the evaporator 500 and the pressure
      surrounding the condensers 201, 202, 203. By adjusting these
      parameters, the system can optimize the collection of moisture
      from the atmosphere, the amount of potable water purified from
      salt water, waste water or other contaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Figure 11 shows a schematic plan view of an embodiment of
      the system according to the present invention employing the
      multiple condensers 200. Figure 12 shows a schematic elevational
      view of an embodiment of Figure 11. This embodiment will be
      described with respect to Figures 11 and 12. In this embodiment,
      an evaporator 1100, similar to that of Figure 5, receives incoming
      air into a heating chamber 1102 which may be an area enclosed by a
      greenhouse-like structure 1121. Heating chamber 1102 may also be a
      chamber heated by solar light focused by lenses or by mirrors
      reflecting light. The air inside this heating chamber 1102 is
      heated and is then drawn as an air stream 25 downward into a
      passageway 1241 between an outer wall 1243 of the evaporator 1100
      and a baffle 1103 by a fan 1101. The air stream 25 then passes
      over the surface 21 of non-potable water 23 causing evaporation of
      water vapor into the air stream 25 to create moist air 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Air stream 25 then passes through a separating convolution
      1245 which causes droplets to hit the walls of the separating
      convolution 1245 and drop the water droplets of non-potable water
      which are swept into the air stream 25 as it passes over the
      non-potable water 23.<br>
      <br>
      [00100] The resulting air is now moist air 9 carrying a
      significant amount of water vapor. This moist air 9 is then passed
      over a plurality of condensers each similar to condensers 200 and
      300 of Figure 3. Each of these condensers 200, 300 is cooled with
      a coolant 1135.<br>
      <br>
      [00101] A coolant device 1105 receives and cools the coolant 1135
      and passes this coolant 1135 through the condensers 200, 300. The
      coolant 1135 should be of a temperature which is below the dew
      point of the moist air 9. As the air passes over the condensers
      200, 300, the water vapor in the air condenses and is collected as
      potable water 5. The condensers 200, 300 may be housed within a
      greenhouse-like structure 1123.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] For clarity, sensors for temperature, pressure, humidity,
      air velocity and other physical parameters, a connected control
      unit and connections between the sensors, control unit and other
      elements including the fan 1101 and coolant device 1105 are not
      shown here for clarity, but exist in at least one of these
      embodiments. Also, the solar voltaic array, wind turbines and
      battery storage are not shown in this figure, but are assumed to
      be in the functional embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [00103] Figure 13 shows a schematic plan view of an embodiment of
      the system according to the present invention employing the
      multiple condensers of Figure 10. In this embodiment, the
      evaporator 1100 and the fan 1101 function in the same manner as
      described in connection with Figures 11 and 12. However, this
      embodiment passes the moist air 9 by the condensers until the
      humidity level drops to a predetermined level then is directed by
      a bypass valve 1029 to a bypass conduit, bypassing the remaining
      condensers. This reduces the amount of air pressure drop and
      reduces the fan horsepower required.<br>
      <br>
      [00104] Figure 13 shows condensers 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206,
      207 and 208 having their coolant lines connected in series. The
      coolant from coolant device 1105 first passes through condenser
      208 then through condenser 207, then through condenser 206 ... and
      then through condenser 201 and back to the coolant device 1105.<br>
      <br>
      [00105] Due to this arrangement, the coldest condenser is
      condenser 208 and the warmest one is condenser 201 with the others
      having successively warmer temperatures moving from condenser 208
      to condenser 201. Temperature sensors measure the coolant
      temperature as well as the air temperature between the condensers
      which is sent to a control unit. The control unit operates the
      elements of the systems and for example, would cause the coolant
      unit to reduce the coolant temperature so that the coolant at each
      condenser is below the dew point of the surrounding air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [00106] The moist air 9 enters and passes by condenser 201, then
      202, then 203 ... then through 208. The moist air 9 loses moisture
      and cools as it moves past condenser 201, 202 ... then 208. This
      then is a countercurrent thermal arrangement which maximizes
      condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [00107] Driving airflow past the condensers requires power. At
      times, the amount of vapor that can be extracted does not warrant
      the energy required to extract it. Therefore, in this embodiment,
      there are humidity (and other) sensors between the condensers.
      When the humidity drops below a certain predetermined level, a
      bypass valve, such as that shown in Figure 10 may be activated to
      cause the air stream 25 to be directed into a bypass conduit 1031
      and bypass at least one of the condensers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHOD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00108] Figures 14, 15 and 16 together are a flowchart
      illustrating the functioning of an embodiment of the current
      invention being a method of efficiently creating potable water
      from non-potable water. The process starts at 1401. In step 1403
      one or more evaporators are provided. One evaporator would be
      similar to the embodiment of Figures 4, 6 and 7, and multiple
      evaporators would be similar to the embodiment of Figure 9.<br>
      <br>
      [00109] These evaporators have a larger surface area than depth to
      maximize the surface area to mass ratio, as illustrated in Figure
      11. They also have an air flow passageway from the heating chamber
      through the evaporation chamber and out an air flow exit as shown
      in Figures 5 and 12. Optionally, as indicated later, additional
      heating device and additional heating may be provided to the
      heating chamber 501 of the evaporators 500, to increase
      evaporation of non- potable water 23.<br>
      <br>
      [00110] In step 1405, the non-potable water is provided to the
      evaporation chamber from below. In step 1407, a physical parameter
      of at least one of the heating chamber, the evaporation chamber
      and the air flow exit are monitored by appropriate sensors. These
      physical parameters may be temperature, air pressure, relative
      humidity and air stream velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [00111] In step 1409, the control unit controls the air flow
      device, which may be a fan or blower that is positioned at or near
      the air flow exit. The control device reads the monitored
      temperatures, pressures, relative humidity and air steam velocity
      and creates an air stream having a velocity causing it to reduce
      the air pressure in the evaporator drawing an air stream from the
      heating chamber through the evaporation chamber and out of the air
      flow exit evaporating water vapor into the air stream. The air
      flow device also directs the air stream from the air flow exit
      past condensers. The condensers have at least one surface held a
      temperature below the dew point of the air stream. The control
      unit calculates the dew point based upon the air stream
      temperature and relative humidity.<br>
      <br>
      [00112] In the embodiments having multiple evaporators, in step
      1411, the relative humidity exiting a condenser is monitored. If
      it is less than a predetermined relative humidity, the air stream
      is routed through another evaporator. The process is repeated
      either until the relative humidity exceeds the predetermined
      level, or there are no additional evaporators to further process
      the air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [00113] In still another embodiment, the air stream exiting the
      evaporator does not exceed the required water content; the control
      unit may slow the air flow rate, or activate additional heaters
      which heat the air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [00114] In step 1413, a contaminant sensor is provided in the air
      flow exit that can measure at least one contaminant in the air
      stream and provide the measurements to the control unit. In step
      1415, the control unit determines if the amount of contaminants is
      below a safe acceptable level. If so, the processing continues at
      step 1417, if not, process continues at "A" of Figure 16.<br>
      <br>
      [00115] If the contaminants are above the acceptable level, in
      step 1601, optionally, an alarm, notification, or corrective
      message is provided to a user. Also, optionally, in step 1603, the
      air stream will be directed to a direction other than to the
      condenser, stopping the contaminated air stream from condensing
      into the potable water.<br>
      <br>
      [00116] Also, optionally, in step 1605, the control unit can slow
      the velocity of the air stream, preventing more contaminants from
      being swept up into the air stream. After step 1605, processing
      continues at "B" of Figure 14. [00117] In step 1417 the operation
      of air flow device may be adjusted to adjust the air pressure in
      the evaporator. In still another embodiment, there is an air flow
      valve at the air flow exit of the evaporator. This can be adjusted
      to also increase or decrease the air pressure within the
      evaporator. This is under the control of the control unit.<br>
      <br>
      [00118] In step 1419, at least one condenser is provided in the
      air stream. In step 1421, optionally a vessel may be provided
      which encloses the one or more condensers. This vessel has an air
      flow inlet and an air flow outlet. It may optionally have an air
      flow valve on the air flow outlet which may be adjusted by the
      control unit. Processing continues at "C" of Figure 15.<br>
      <br>
      [00119] Therefore, in step 1501, when the control unit partially
      closes the air flow valve, the air pressure within the vessel
      increases, and similarly, when the control unit partially opens
      the air flow valve, the air pressure in the vessel reduces.<br>
      <br>
      [00120] In step 1503 the air stream is directed to the condenser
      and the potable water is collected in step 1505. If there is an
      embodiment having more than one condenser, then the humidity is
      measured in step 1507. In step 1509, if the measured humidity is
      below a predetermined humidity level, processing ends at step
      1511. If the measured humidity is greater than a predetermined
      level, then the air stream is directed through a next condenser,
      if one exists. This process continues until either there are no
      more condensers to use or the measured humidity of the air stream
      exiting the condenser is below the predetermined level. This
      architecture causes the moisture to be continually run through
      condensers to extract water vapor which was not extracted by the
      previous condensers. This allows for an adjustable amount of
      condensation capacity to adjust for changes in ambient
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [00121] Please note that the embodiment of Figure 1 may be varied
      to employ multiple condensers such as those shown in Figure 10. In
      this embodiment, the adjustable condenser capacity will adjust for
      the differences in the ambient air temperature and relative
      humidity.<br>
      <br>
      [00122] Similarly, the use of multiple evaporators in various
      embodiments shown allows for the interactive adjustment to adjust
      to changing sunlight and temperature conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IMPLEMENTATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00123] The amount of water evaporated from a body of water in
      contact with circulating air can be calculated with the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      E = k A (xs- x) where:<br>
      E = amount of evaporated water (kg/h)<br>
      k = (25 + 19 v) = evaporation coefficient (kg/m&lt;2&gt;h)<br>
      v = velocity of air above the water surface (m/s)<br>
      A = water surface area (m&lt;2&gt;)<br>
      xs= humidity ratio in saturated air at the same temperature as the
      water surface (kg/kg)<br>
      x = humidity ratio in the air (kg/kg)<br>
      <br>
      [00124] It was therefore determined that by using a 60m by 60m
      evaporator, the water surface area is 3600 sq. meters at a
      temperature of 140 Degrees F. (60 deg. C), and an air flow
      velocity of 3.5 miles per hour (1.56 m./sec), the saturated
      humidity ratio xs would be 0.421 kg/kg. The humidity ratio x would
      be 0.0285 kg/kg. In an air volume of 5400 m3, there would be
      14,469,250 kg. of water evaporated each hour. If the air velocity
      were increased to 5 mph (2.235 m/sec), this amount of water
      evaporated would then jump to 17,837,710 kg. each hour.<br>
      <br>
      [00125] To detail the effects of air velocity and temperature on
      units designed to attain a potable water volume of 5.0 million
      gallons per day (MGD), assuming an evaporator efficiency of 60%
      and operating at 60 deg. C. and assuming condensers with a 60%&gt;
      water vapor removal efficiency, below is the water removal by
      stages for a 2-stage and a 3-stage condenser section:<br>
      <br>
      [00126] 2-stage condenser section (at 60 deg. C)<br>
      Input Output<br>
      Stage 1 2.16 1.29<br>
      Stage 2 1.29 0.78<br>
      Total 2.07<br>
      2,070,000<br>
      <br>
      3-stage condenser section (at 60 deg. C)<br>

      Stage 1 2.16 1.29<br>

      Stage 3 0.78 0.47<br>
      Total 2.54<br>
      2,536,804<br>
      <br>
      Now assuming an evaporator efficiency of 60%&gt; and at 80 deg. C.
      and assuming condensers with a 60% water vapor removal efficiency,
      below is the water removal by stages for a 2-stage stage condenser
      section:<br>
      <br>
      2-stage condenser section (at 80 deg. C)<br>
      Input Output<br>
      Stage 1 5.24 3.14<br>
      Stage 2 3.14 1.89<br>
      Total 5.03<br>
      5,029,233<br>
      <br>
      It is apparent that a 2-stage unit operating at 60 deg. C does not
      provide enough flow; using two 3 -stage units will provide the
      desired flow. Now to compare this unit to the 2-stage unit
      operating at 80 deg. C; while twice the water is produced so that
      only a single 2-stage unit is required to attain the desired 5 MGD
      output, the operating air temperature cannot be naturally attained
      and will need continuous additional energy inputs to attain the
      higher operating air temperature. If energy costs are the limiting
      factor in system design, the more efficient and sustainable method
      to attain the five million gallons per day is to use two 3 -stage
      units operating at 60 deg. C rather than one 2-stage unit
      operating at 80 deg. C. However, if the higher energy costs can be
      absorbed into the cost of the produced water, the lower capital
      costs of the single 2- stage unit becomes the preferred selection.<br>

      Disclosed is a water collector and, specifically, to a water
      collector having a fine line pattern comprising a base substrate,
      and a micro-channel in the form of a groove consisting of a line
      pattern in the surface of the base substrate, and capable of
      collecting water by collecting moisture in the air. According to
      the present invention, groove walls on both sides of the
      micro-channel have hydrophobic properties for mobility of a water
      drop, and at least one between the groove bottom side of the
      micro-channel and the upper lateral side of a channel wall forming
      a groove wall of the micro-channel has hydrophilic properties for
      condensation of water. The present invention has an effect of
      continuously condensing water in the surface of a water collector
      by ensuring smooth movement of a water drop due to geometrical
      characteristics, thereby the water collecting amount can be
      significantly increased.<br>

      A method and a system are provided for producing water from
      atmospheric air by contacting the air with an aqueous hygroscopic
      material in a contacting chamber and allowing a portion of the
      water from the air to be adsorbed into the aqueous hygroscopic
      stream. The adsorbed water is then subsequently separated from the
      hygroscopic material to provide a clean water stream and a
      reconstituted hygroscopic stream.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates to atmospheric moisture harvesting
      and improvements in the efficiency of condensing water from air
      and in apparatus relating thereto. More particularly, the
      invention provides improved energy efficient extraction of water
      from air, particularly in outdoor settings and over a range of
      relative humidity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Atmospheric water harvesting is intended to produce water
      in the general vicinity of its place of use. Producing potable
      water near its place of use removes the requirement for either
      temporary or fixed water delivery systems such as pipelines and
      canals or temporary delivery systems such as bulk motorized water
      tankers. Production of high-quality water at or near its place of
      use is superior to transporting bottled drinking water, which
      requires substantial consumption of energy for delivery and waste
      disposal. Water harvesters are also superior environmentally
      because water bottle disposal is not an issue; water bottles are
      reused in conjunction with water harvesting. In addition, the
      water produced from suitably designed and operated water
      harvesters is pure and suitable and safe for drinking with very
      little treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Water harvesting has not generally been regarded as a
      replacement for conventional piped water supplies because of its
      relatively higher cost and lower volumes. In present water
      systems, there is an effective “waste” of public high quality
      water that is used for low-quality uses, such as flushing toilets
      and watering lawns.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Conventional water supplies are running short because of
      increased demand and local overuse of natural water supplies. In
      addition, the cost of conventional water supplies is increasing
      significantly. One of the drivers of increased water cost is the
      incorporation of desalinated water, which is relatively expensive
      to produce using current technologies, in the basic supply.
      Perceptions about the quality of public water supply has led to
      bottled water being used increasingly as a regular personal
      drinking water source, even though it is much more expensive than
      public water supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In atmospheric water harvesting, condensation of water is
      achieved by providing and maintaining a chilled surface upon which
      water from moist air condenses. This is well known as a byproduct
      of chilling air, as in air conditioning systems in which chilling
      the air is the objective or in air dehumidification systems in
      which the objective is to achieve relative dryness of the exhaust
      air. However, water produced as a byproduct in these systems is
      more expensive to produce than that which is produced in a water
      harvester apparatus that is optimized for energy efficient water
      production by not overcooling air or water. In addition, byproduct
      water quality is generally not suitable for drinking, and can be
      dangerous, without additional treatment that is not provided for
      by an apparatus that does not have water production as a primary
      objective.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Water harvesting apparatus that has been specifically
      designed to produce water from air already exists (but without the
      efficiency and sophistication of this invention) which allows the
      production of water of the same or superior quality as bottled
      water but without the delivery or environmental waste issues and
      in quantities that are suitable for personal or family use on a
      regular and extended basis. Water harvesting provides high quality
      potable water without the continued cost of producing bottles
      directly in proportion to the quantity of water delivered, at a
      lower cost than bottled water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The present invention provides improved apparatus and
      methods for condensing water from air. These improvements involve,
      but are not limited to, an improved water condenser, improved
      condenser airflow control, a variable speed air impeller, forced
      air or conductive cooling of all heat-producing parts of the
      system, new intake air controls, and provision for
      system-controlled on/off switching for the compressor. The
      apparatus is robustly designed and constructed, is resistant to
      common handling vibration and shock, and is meant to be moved by
      hand locally although it may also be fixed. The apparatus is
      intended for use either outdoors or indoors in a semi-autonomous
      mode, and where air quality is generally good. Water is pumped
      from a removable collection tank underneath the evaporator into
      which water has flowed by gravity, either directly or through a
      water treatment system to the user. Although the water exiting the
      water harvester has the character of distilled water and is very
      pure, for prolonged drinking of this water alone, some of the
      produced water should be remineralized.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment 100 of an atmospheric water
      harvester (AWH) according to the invention. The apparatus for
      drawing in and exhausting air and refrigeration causes water vapor
      to be condensed into liquid water within an enclosed apparatus so
      that it can be collected. The apparatus 100 may be placed
      out-of-doors, where it is surrounded by moist air. Ambient air 102
      is drawn into the AWH 100 under suction and expelled under
      pressure. This AWH 100 includes an airflow system having an intake
      105; an air filter 110; and air passages 116, 120 upstream from an
      impeller or fan 125. The impeller/fan 125 is responsible for
      drawing air into and forcing it through the apparatus 100 and into
      an exhaust chamber 135, from which the air exits through vents 138
      (venting air is indicated by dashed-stem arrows) in the external
      vented wall 137 of the high-pressure exhaust chamber 135. The
      refrigeration system in general includes an evaporator (cooling
      member) 140 in which liquid refrigerant is allowed to vaporize,
      thereby causing the evaporator 140 to become cold and cooling the
      air passing across it so as to condense water from the air; and a
      compressor 150, in which the refrigerant gas from the evaporator
      140 is compressed into a liquid by the combination of higher
      pressure and cooling of the refrigerant by air forced through a
      condenser 145.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Ambient air 102 is drawn in through the filter assembly
      110, which may include more than one filter or type of filter,
      into the pre-evaporator air passage 116. Water is condensed from
      the air on the evaporator/heat exchanger 140 as the air is pulled
      through it. Condensation on the evaporator is the key process of
      atmospheric water harvesting. The condensation process is made as
      efficient as possible by using a high-thermal-transfer heat
      exchanger for the evaporator, for instance, a narrow-bore PF&lt;2
      &gt;heat exchanger manufactured by the Modine Manufacturing
      Company. In order to prevent aluminum or other metals from the
      evaporator from being dissolved in condensing water, a coating is
      applied to the evaporator 140. The coating also may have
      antibacterial properties. Among, but not limited to, examples of
      this type of coating are a silver ion-containing epoxy available
      from Burke Industrial Coatings and another (Alcoat 5000 or
      similar) available from Circle-Prosco that also offers corrosion
      protection and may assist shedding of water from the condensing
      surface of the evaporator 140.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Regarding the compressor 150, a fixed or a variable speed
      compressor may be used. In one configuration of an AWH according
      to the invention, a fixed speed compressor, which is the simplest
      type and is most commonly used in refrigeration apparatus, is
      used. Such compressors are cycled on and off to minimize their
      running time. They are commonly operated along with a
      temperature-sensing device 155 that measures and controls the
      system superheat, which is the difference between the temperature
      of the gas entering the compressor 150 and the evaporation
      temperature of the liquid refrigerant within the evaporator 140.
      This device 155 (e.g., a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV or
      TEV), amongst other types of electronic and mechanical devices) is
      located between the condenser 145 and the evaporator 140. It
      controls temperature in the evaporator 140, in which vaporization
      of the refrigerant is directly related to cooling potential, by
      metering the flow of fluid refrigerant through the system. In an
      alternate configuration, a variable speed compressor 150 is used,
      which runs almost continuously but only as fast as necessary to
      maintain the desired pressure differential between the evaporator
      140 and the condenser 145. A temperature-sensing device 155 that
      measures and controls the system superheat may be used with this
      sort of variable-speed compressor as well. In either of these
      configurations, a cut-off switch (not shown here), which is
      operated by sensors that detect freeze-up on the evaporator, turns
      off the compressor to allow ice to melt before restarting.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the AWH embodiment 100 shown in FIG. 1, the evaporator
      140 is in a vertical orientation, as shown in FIG. 2a. Water
      (black, single stem arrows) 158 formed on the upper evaporator
      surfaces flows down over the subjacent evaporator surfaces, which
      has the effect of amalgamating the water into rivulets as well as
      droplets as it flows from the evaporator 140 to the subjacent
      water collector 163. Because rivulets are more coherent water
      masses with higher mass to surface area ratios, they are less
      liable to lose water to the airstream moving at about a 90 degree
      angle across the flowing condensed water. Additionally, the water
      passing from the evaporator 140 to the water collection tank 163
      may be only very slightly affected by air flow, which does not
      impinge toward the water collection tank 163.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] With an alternate orientation of the evaporator as shown in
      FIG. 2b, water is removed from a horizontally oriented evaporator
      (also labeled 140) by forced air moving in the same direction as
      the condensed water separating from the evaporator 140. Water
      droplets 146 flow directly downward (single-stem black arrows)
      under the combined influence of gravity and forced air into the
      water collection tank 163. Water is more rapidly removed following
      condensation, which may have the result of reducing overcooling of
      already condensed water and allowing better heat transfer than in
      the case of coalescing water flowing over the evaporator. This is
      because water on the evaporator 140 acts as an insulator against
      heat transfer between the evaporator surface and the moist air
      114. This horizontal orientation minimizes run-off of amalgamated
      or rivulet/coalesced water on the evaporator surface in favor of
      keeping most of the water in the form of droplets until it leaves
      the evaporator. However, droplets 146 have to cross the exhaust
      air path 118 and may be entrained in the air. Angled evaporators
      (not illustrated) would have attributes intermediate between
      upright or vertical and horizontal evaporators.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Water that has condensed on the evaporator 140 flows
      downward by gravity into a water collection region tank 163
      beneath the evaporator and then into a removable water collection
      tank (not shown) that is from five to ten gallons or greater in
      capacity. Multiple tanks allow users to carry water from the water
      harvester. Alternatively, water may be pumped from the collection
      tank by a pump 167, located in the body of the AWH, through an
      industry-standard replaceable water filter 170 that is located in
      a compartment 175 that is isolated from the airflow passages
      within the apparatus. Treated water 190 that has passed through
      the water treatment system 170 remains under pressure after
      passing through the filter and exits from ports (not shown) at
      either or both the top and sides of the apparatus 100. (A
      straight-through water filter body without a filter may be used to
      produce water that is to be used for industrial purposes or that
      is otherwise not required to be treated to drinking water
      standards.)<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Air exiting from the evaporator on which water has
      condensed then passes into an air passage 120 under suction caused
      by the fan/impeller 125. The air from the fan/impeller 125 then
      passes through a downstream air passage 130 and through the vaned
      condenser 145, where the air cools the compressed refrigerant that
      is being pumped to the condenser 145 from the compressor 150.
      After heat exchange warms it, the exhaust air passes into an
      exhaust chamber 135 from which it is exhausted through louvers in
      the walls of the AWH 100, the approximate locations of which are
      shown by arrows.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In a suitable configuration of the AWH 100, the impeller or
      fan 125 is capable of running at variable speed, which is
      controlled by varying electrical current or voltage. This allows
      the impeller or fan to force air through the apparatus at
      different velocities to optimize water production on the
      evaporator with respect to the electrical energy consumed. A
      variable speed impeller or fan allows the airflow over the
      evaporator to be varied, optimizing water production by, for
      instance, increasing fan speed for high humidity air or preventing
      or remediating unintended freeze-up where slower airflow could
      otherwise allow the air to reach a dew point below freezing.
      (Slowly moving air can be cooled to lower temperatures and has a
      greater likelihood of reaching dew points below freezing,
      regardless of the original air temperature.) Alternatively, the
      fan or impeller may be fixed speed, which may be less efficient
      under a wide range of input air temperature and humidity
      conditions but less expensive to implement and not significantly
      more expensive to operate under consistently humid conditions such
      as may be found on tropical, low-lying, smaller islands.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Sealed electronic controls and computer systems that
      control the refrigeration and airflow system for all embodiments
      of this invention are integrated in a control pad (not shown) that
      is located in the top cover of the water harvester for easy
      operation. In order to prevent overheating of the electronic
      control pad, the bottom surface of the electronic control pad is a
      conduction heat exchanger that is exposed to the cold airflow
      stream upstream and/or downstream from the condenser. Thus, heat
      that may be produced within the pad or by heating of the pad
      externally by heat exchange with ambient air or heating by the sun
      may be removed and the pad kept within operating temperature
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In the embodiment 100, the compressor 150 is located within
      the exhaust air chamber 135. Where a compressor is used that is
      designed to be cooled internally, for instance using refrigerant
      discharge inside the compressor, there is no need for other
      cooling of the compressor. With that type of compressor, it is
      possible to insulate it with noise-absorbing material for quieter
      operation. The air within this chamber is slightly over-pressured
      with respect to ambient air outside the apparatus, which allows
      for distribution of air within the chamber 135 in the direction of
      sidewall vents. Air vents that form a large proportion of the side
      of the enclosure are located generally in the exterior sidewall
      137 of the exhaust chamber 135 (exhaust air shown by black arrows
      but actual vents may be widespread in the wall) in order to allow
      air to vent from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Two further embodiments 200, 300 will be described with
      reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, in which there are
      slight variations in the handling of air within the AWH following
      extraction of water from it. In these embodiments 200, 300 (as
      well as in another embodiment 400, as described below), similar
      system components are similarly numbered, but increased to the
      corresponding hundreds series to “match” the embodiment number
      200, 300, 400. Unless otherwise described, the similarly numbered
      components are the same as or generally similar to those described
      above and may have similar attributes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Where an AWH must be operated in very hot ambient
      temperatures, or where a compressor that requires external cooling
      is used, forced-air cooling may be provided by controlling airflow
      in two general manners. These are shown in FIG. 3, in which an
      embodiment 200 uses existing exhaust for cooling of the compressor
      250, and in FIG. 4, in which an embodiment 300 uses a supplemental
      supply of ambient air for cooling the compressor 350. FIG. 3 shows
      airflow around the compressor 250 from the central part of the
      exhaust chamber 235 created by locating louvered sidewall vents
      295 “downstream” from the compressor 250. This configuration
      forces air to pass the compressor 250 in exiting from the exhaust
      chamber 235. In the alternate embodiment 300 shown in FIG. 4, an
      internal partition 311 isolates the compressor 350 from the
      exhaust chamber 335. In this configuration, vents 313 in the outer
      hull of the AWH 300 allow air to be pulled in by suction into the
      air passage 320 upstream from the impeller 325.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The three embodiments 100, 200, 300 that have been
      described above will work best in high relative humidity (RH)
      conditions. In general, where RH is high, particularly where
      temperature is also high and relatively large amounts of water are
      dissolved in the air, condensation on the evaporator takes place
      by reducing the temperature of the humid air to the point where
      condensation initiates. Where intake air is at a high humidity,
      for instance in excess of 85% RH, water will begin to condense
      with relatively little energy consumed by chilling. The sensible
      heat of the humid air (which is the term applied to heat
      associated with temperature change) must be removed to lower the
      temperature of the air slightly and bring the air to 100% RH
      locally, at which point condensation is initiated. As condensation
      proceeds, the latent heat (which is that required to cause the
      water vapor to condense to liquid water) is removed by heat
      exchange on the evaporator. Following the initiation of
      condensation, both sensible heat and latent heat are removed from
      the air being processed in the AWH as the air temperature is
      further reduced slightly and water is condensed and extracted.
      When RH is low, on the other hand, it is beneficial to be able to
      remove sensible heat before the air reaches the evaporator so that
      the cooling potential of the evaporator continues to remove a
      minimum of sensible heat and a maximum of latent heat, which has
      the effect of maintaining the energy efficiency of water
      production. (High humidity ambient air requires very little
      additional cooling to initiate condensation.) The delivery of air
      to the evaporator at approximately 90-99% RH, which is the general
      range for humid ambient air, is the primary objective for the most
      economic water production through condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A variable pre-cooling embodiment 400 of an AWH, which is
      configured to operate well under low as well as high ambient RH
      conditions and preferably at RH points in between, is illustrated
      in FIGS. 5 and 6. Most notably in comparison to the embodiments
      100, 200, 300 described above, the embodiment 400 includes a
      variable flow geometry thermal economizer section 417 located
      upstream of the impeller 425 and its inlet air passageway 420. The
      thermal economizer section 417 is suitably housed within a forward
      extension of the AWH housing and includes an air-to-air heat
      exchanger 456 located between the evaporator 440 (i.e., downstream
      from the evaporator) and the impeller 425 (i.e., upstream of the
      impeller). Preferably, the heat exchanger 456 is directly
      connected to the evaporator 440 and the impeller entry air
      passageway 420, or is connected via ducting to those components,
      such that air does not seep out from between the evaporator and
      the heat exchanger or from between the heat exchanger and the
      impeller. A preferred air-to-air heat exchanger 456 is fabricated
      from thin-walled tubes (e.g., as available from Cesarroni
      Technologies); from thin-walled corrugated plastic plate (e.g., as
      available from Innergy Tech, AB Segerfroejd, or Greenbox); or from
      corrugated metal plate (e.g., as available from Xetex and Des
      Champs Technology). In general, such air-to-air heat exchangers
      include two sets (at least) of interleaved flow passageways that
      are typically arranged perpendicularly to each other. In the AWH
      embodiment 400, the heat exchanger 456 is arranged with 1) a first
      set of heat transfer flow passageways (not illustrated
      specifically) oriented longitudinally, i.e., generally aligned
      with the main or overall direction of flow through the AWH 400;
      and 2) a second set of heat transfer flow passageways (not
      illustrated specifically) that are oriented transverse to the
      first set of heat transfer flow passageways, i.e., laterally as in
      the embodiment 400 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 or vertically.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Upstream of the heat exchanger 456, the air intake of the
      AWH 400, i.e., the entrance to the thermal economizer section 417,
      is configured to regulate the amount (if any) of air that flows
      through the second, transverse set of heat exchanger flow
      passageways. To that extent, a motorized sliding panel 446,
      mounted in a support or frame 433, is provided near the entrance
      to the thermal economizer section 417, and an airway partition 438
      extends from a lateral mid-location—suitably but not necessarily
      the center—of the panel support or frame 433 to an end of the
      evaporator 440. Suitably, the panel 446 extends vertically from
      the top to the bottom of the thermal economizer section entrance;
      laterally, assuming the airway partition 438 abuts the frame 433
      at the lateral center of the AWH 400, the panel 446 is slightly
      wider than half the width of the thermal economizer section
      entrance.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] With this arrangement of the AWH intake, when the panel 446
      is all the way to one side of the entrance to the thermal
      economizer section 417 (i.e., to one side of the airway partition
      433) as shown in FIG. 5, a first inlet aperture 402 is formed on
      the opposite side of the airway partition 433. When the apparatus
      400 is in this operational configuration, air enters the thermal
      economizer section 417 through the first inlet aperture 402 and
      flows through the transverse (e.g., lateral) set of air
      passageways through the air-to-air heat exchanger 456. The air
      then turns and flows through the evaporator 440, which
      cools/chills the air to condense moisture out of it, before the
      air flows through the longitudinal set of air passageways through
      the heat exchanger 456 and on to the impeller. Because the air
      flowing through the longitudinal set of heat exchanger air
      passageways has been cooled by the evaporator 440, it will absorb
      sensible heat from the air flowing through the transverse set of
      heat exchanger air passageways, thus pre-cooling the incoming air
      before it reaches the evaporator 440. This allows a greater
      percentage of the evaporator work to be directed to removing
      latent heat from the incoming air and thus improves water
      production efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] On the other hand, as noted above, it is relatively easy to
      condense moisture from ambient air that has high RH. Therefore, it
      becomes less important or beneficial to pre-cool the air before it
      passes across the evaporator 440. In this case, the panel 446 may
      be moved all the way across the entrance to the thermal economizer
      section 417, to the opposite side of the airway partition 433,
      which opens up a second inlet aperture 403 (i.e., a bypass inlet)
      as shown in FIG. 6. When the apparatus 400 is in this operational
      configuration, air enters the thermal economizer section 417
      through the second inlet aperture 403 and flows immediately over
      evaporator 440, then down to the fan/impeller 425 through the
      longitudinal set of heat exchanger air passageways, without first
      having flowed through the transverse set of heat exchanger air
      passageways for pre-cooling. This improves operational efficiency
      in terms of amount of water produced per unit of electricity
      consumed. In particular, air density increases with humidity, and
      resistance to flow (i.e., frictional drag) increases with air
      density. Therefore, by shortening the overall airflow distance,
      and in particular by bypassing the portion of the flow course
      passing through the transverse set of heat exchanger airflow
      passageways, airflow drag is reduced. This, in turn, reduces
      operational load on the fan or impeller 425 and hence the cost to
      drive the fan or impeller for a given volumetric flow rate of air
      through the AWH 400. Alternatively, for a given amount of
      electricity consumed, the fan or impeller can be run faster
      (assuming it has that capability), which allows more water to be
      produced in a given period of time and at a given operating cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In practice, the panel 446 may be positioned at various
      points between the two endpoints shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Depending
      on the position of the panel 446, the relative sizes of the first
      and second inlet apertures 402, 403 will vary, which regulates the
      amount of air flowing through the transverse set of heat exchanger
      airflow passageways and hence how much pre-cooling of the incoming
      air is provided. Suitably, the position of the panel 446, and
      hence the relative sizes of the inlet apertures 402, 403, is
      controlled automatically by a computer controller (not shown),
      which receives information on ambient conditions from on-board
      temperature and humidity sensors (not shown). Using pre-programmed
      maps or lookup tables, and/or using sensors that measure internal
      humidity levels at the evaporator so as to provide feedback-based
      control, the controller adjusts the position of the panel 446 such
      that the intake air is cooled to the point that 90% to 99% RH air
      is passing across the evaporator and/or until, at some point, the
      pre-cooling potential is at a maximum. From that point to lower
      temperatures and RH, an increasing amount of sensible heat has to
      be removed from the incoming air by the evaporator 440, which
      means that increasing electricity must be used to produce
      relatively smaller amounts of water. With such an automatic
      configuration of the AWH, the speed of the fan/impeller 425 may
      also be adjusted automatically (assuming it has variable speed
      capability).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In a simpler implementation, automatic control over the
      position of the panel 446, and hence the sizes of the intake
      apertures 402, 403, may be omitted. In that case, it may be
      preferable for the AWH 400 to be configured with springs, cams,
      detents, etc. (not shown) such that the panel 446 stably assumes
      only the position shown in FIG. 5 or the position shown in FIG. 6,
      but not positions in between. The user would then manually move
      the panel to one side or the other depending on humidity existing
      generally at the time the AWH is being operated.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Furthermore, in the embodiment 400 of an AWH illustrated in
      FIGS. 5 and 6, the sizes of the two air intake apertures 402 and
      403 are directly linked to each other and always vary inversely to
      each other as the position of the panel 446 changes. For finer
      control and optimization of efficiency (water produced per unit of
      electricity, water produced per unit of time, or water produced
      per volumetric unit of airflow), on the other hand, it may be
      desirable for the sizes of the air intake apertures to be
      independently controllable (preferably by computer). To that end,
      the air intake apertures may be formed as separate, louvered
      openings 402', 403', as illustrated in FIG. 7, sphincter openings,
      etc. (A variable speed fan/impeller is particularly suitable for
      use with such an embodiment to fine-tune operation of the AWH as
      much as possible.)<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Alternatively, instead of controlling the amount of airflow
      through each of the inlets 402', 403' by varying the size of their
      openings, it is possible to regulate the relative amounts of
      airflow by controlling the speed of the air flowing through each
      opening. To that end, a variable speed fan or impeller 472, 473
      can be provided in association with each opening 402', 403', as
      shown in FIG. 8. Such variable speed fans or impellers could be
      provided in addition to the variable speed fan or impeller 425 or,
      alternatively, instead of the fan or impeller 425.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Various attributes of the embodiments 100, 200, 300 of
      AWH's described above (e.g., variable speed refrigeration
      compressor) may be incorporated into the embodiment 400 of an AWH
      as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Reverting to more general discussion applicable to any of
      the embodiments disclosed herein, unwanted mixing between intake
      and exhaust air has the potential to reduce the humidity of the
      intake air, which would have the effect of increasing energy use
      and decreasing water production. The intake and exhaust are
      located on generally opposite sides of the apparatus to separate
      them as much as possible without using intake or exhaust pipe
      extensions. In still air, exhaust will generally tend to be
      propelled away from the apparatus while intake air will be drawn
      from the ambient air at the other end. Where a water harvester is
      operated outdoors, changing wind direction and velocity may be
      anticipated. Shift of wind direction will have an impact upon the
      potential for mixing intake and exhaust air, particularly when the
      wind is blowing from the exhaust end and toward the intake end of
      the water harvester. Optimum conditions for minimum mixing of
      intake and exhaust air occur when the wind is blowing generally on
      the intake and away from the exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A manual switch may be provided on the control panel (not
      shown) to initiate a timed cycle in which the air system operates
      but the condenser system is turned off. This allows air to be
      passed through the unit without water being condensed from the
      air. This provides for drying of the internal air courses and
      their surfaces (including the evaporator and condenser). At the
      initiation of the cleaning/drying cycle, dilute chlorine spray
      from a hand-pump rechargeable container is sprayed into the intake
      air stream in sufficient quantities so that all internal air
      passages, including the main condenser and water collection area,
      are sufficiently exposed to allow for effective sterilization of
      the system. The unit continues to run, which has the effect of
      drying the internal surfaces and leaving the unit dry. If it is to
      be operated again in a relatively short time or if it is to be
      stored in a dry, climate-controlled location, packing in an
      air-tight container may not be necessary. Where the unit may be
      off for more than a short time, it should be packed in a sealed
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Provision may be made for quick-fitting a backup hand pump
      so that water may be filter-treated or removed from the water
      harvester under pressure if the pump 167 fails. It is also
      possible to recover the water directly from the removable water
      tank by removing it and pouring the water out manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The apparatus is wheeled and has handles suitable for
      pulling or lifting, even on ground that is not flat or smooth. It
      is designed and fabricated to be robust and to be operated out of
      doors without regard for weather conditions. All embodiments of
      the water harvester are weather-proofed, with sealed electronics,
      louvered intakes, screening as part of the filter assembly 110
      (all embodiments) and on intakes and exhausts. The apparatus is
      suitable for placement by hand, without mechanized lifting or
      towing equipment. It can be left in one location over a period of
      time and can be manually brought under cover for protection in
      advance of major storms and redeployed manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The foregoing disclosure is only intended to be exemplary
      of the methods and apparatus of the present invention. Departures
      from and modifications to the disclosed embodiments may occur to
      those having skill in the art. For example, while an air-to-air
      heat exchanger as disclosed and described may be preferred, other
      forms of heat exchangers such as heat pipes, a fluid loop
      recirculation system, or an inverse vapor compression
      refrigeration system running in tandem with the “primary”
      refrigeration section may be implemented. Furthermore, the
      evaporator of a vapor compression-based refrigeration system is
      but one type of cooling device that may be used to cool the
      incoming air. Other cooling devices such as thermoelectric cooling
      devices could also be used. The scope of the invention is set

      </div>
      <br>
      An atmospheric water harvester includes a cooling member over
      which humid air flows to condense moisture from the atmosphere.
      The cooling member may be the evaporator of a conventional, gas
      vapor-based refrigeration circuit. If a gas vapor-based
      refrigeration circuit is used, the compressor of the circuit may
      be variable speed. A fan or impeller used to move air through the
      system may also be variable speed. Preferred embodiments are
      reconfigurable between at least two operational configurations
      such that to varying degrees the incoming air may be pre-cooled,
      before it passes over the cooling member, by heat exchange with
      colder air that has already flowed over the cooling member.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The invention relates to atmospheric moisture harvesting
      and improvements in the efficiency of condensing water from air
      and in apparatus relating thereto. More particularly, the
      invention provides improved energy efficient extraction of water
      from air, particularly in outdoor settings and over a range of
      relative humidity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Atmospheric water harvesting is intended to produce water
      in the general vicinity of its place of use. Producing potable
      water near its place of use removes the requirement for either
      temporary or fixed water delivery systems such as pipelines and
      canals or temporary delivery systems such as bulk motorized water
      tankers. Production of high-quality water at or near its place of
      use is superior to transporting bottled drinking water, which
      requires substantial consumption of energy for delivery and waste
      disposal. Water harvesters are also superior environmentally
      because water bottle disposal is not an issue; water bottles are
      reused in conjunction with water harvesting. In addition, the
      water produced from suitably designed and operated water
      harvesters is pure and suitable and safe for drinking with very
      little treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Water harvesting has not generally been regarded as a
      replacement for conventional piped water supplies because of its
      relatively higher cost and lower volumes. In present water
      systems, there is an effective “waste” of public high quality
      water that is used for low-quality uses, such as flushing toilets
      and watering lawns.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Conventional water supplies are running short because of
      increased demand and local overuse of natural water supplies. In
      addition, the cost of conventional water supplies is increasing
      significantly. One of the drivers of increased water cost is the
      incorporation of desalinated water, which is relatively expensive
      to produce using current technologies, in the basic supply.
      Perceptions about the quality of public water supply has led to
      bottled water being used increasingly as a regular personal
      drinking water source, even though it is much more expensive than
      public water supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In atmospheric water harvesting, condensation of water is
      achieved by providing and maintaining a chilled surface upon which
      water from moist air condenses. This is well known as a byproduct
      of chilling air, as in air conditioning systems in which chilling
      the air is the objective or in air dehumidification systems in
      which the objective is to achieve relative dryness of the exhaust
      air. However, water produced as a byproduct in these systems is
      more expensive to produce than that which is produced in a water
      harvester apparatus that is optimized for energy efficient water
      production by not overcooling air or water. In addition, byproduct
      water quality is generally not suitable for drinking, and can be
      dangerous, without additional treatment that is not provided for
      by an apparatus that does not have water production as a primary
      objective.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Water harvesting apparatus that has been specifically
      designed to produce water from air already exists (but without the
      efficiency and sophistication of this invention) which allows the
      production of water of the same or superior quality as bottled
      water but without the delivery or environmental waste issues and
      in quantities that are suitable for personal or family use on a
      regular and extended basis. Water harvesting provides high quality
      potable water without the continued cost of producing bottles
      directly in proportion to the quantity of water delivered, at a
      lower cost than bottled water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The present invention provides improved apparatus and
      methods for condensing water from air. These improvements involve,
      but are not limited to, an improved water condenser, improved
      condenser airflow control, a variable speed air impeller, forced
      air or conductive cooling of all heat-producing parts of the
      system, new intake air controls, and provision for
      system-controlled on/off switching for the compressor. The
      apparatus is robustly designed and constructed, is resistant to
      common handling vibration and shock, and is meant to be moved by
      hand locally although it may also be fixed. The apparatus is
      intended for use either outdoors or indoors in a semi-autonomous
      mode, and where air quality is generally good. Water is pumped
      from a removable collection tank underneath the evaporator into
      which water has flowed by gravity, either directly or through a
      water treatment system to the user. Although the water exiting the
      water harvester has the character of distilled water and is very
      pure, for prolonged drinking of this water alone, some of the
      produced water should be remineralized.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Preferred embodiments are reconfigurable between at least
      two operational configurations such that to varying degrees
      incoming air may be pre-cooled, before it passes over a cooling
      member, by heat exchange with colder air that has already flowed
      over the cooling member.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0021] FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment 100 of an atmospheric
      water harvester (AWH) according to the invention. The apparatus
      for drawing in and exhausting air and refrigeration causes water
      vapor to be condensed into liquid water within an enclosed
      apparatus so that it can be collected. The apparatus 100 may be
      placed out-of-doors, where it is surrounded by moist air. Ambient
      air 102 is drawn into the AWH 100 under suction and expelled under
      pressure. This AWH 100 includes an airflow system having an intake
      105; an air filter 110; and air passages 116, 120 upstream from an
      impeller or fan 125. The impeller/fan 125 is responsible for
      drawing air into and forcing it through the apparatus 100 and into
      an exhaust chamber 135, from which the air exits through vents 138
      (venting air is indicated by dashed-stem arrows) in the external
      vented wall 137 of the high-pressure exhaust chamber 135. The
      refrigeration system in general includes an evaporator (cooling
      member) 140 in which liquid refrigerant is allowed to vaporize,
      thereby causing the evaporator 140 to become cold and cooling the
      air passing across it so as to condense water from the air; and a
      compressor 150, in which the refrigerant gas from the evaporator
      140 is compressed into a liquid by the combination of higher
      pressure and cooling of the refrigerant by air forced through a
      condenser 145.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Ambient air 102 is drawn in through the filter assembly
      110, which may include more than one filter or type of filter,
      into the pre-evaporator air passage 116. Water is condensed from
      the air on the evaporator/heat exchanger 140 as the air is pulled
      through it. Condensation on the evaporator is the key process of
      atmospheric water harvesting. The condensation process is made as
      efficient as possible by using a high-thermal-transfer heat
      exchanger for the evaporator, for instance, a narrow-bore PF&lt;2
      &gt;heat exchanger manufactured by the Modine Manufacturing
      Company. In order to prevent aluminum or other metals from the
      evaporator from being dissolved in condensing water, a coating is
      applied to the evaporator 140. The coating also may have
      antibacterial properties. Among, but not limited to, examples of
      this type of coating are a silver ion-containing epoxy available
      from Burke Industrial Coatings and another (Alcoat 5000 or
      similar) available from Circle-Prosco that also offers corrosion
      protection and may assist shedding of water from the condensing
      surface of the evaporator 140.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Regarding the compressor 150, a fixed or a variable speed
      compressor may be used. In one configuration of an AWH according
      to the invention, a fixed speed compressor, which is the simplest
      type and is most commonly used in refrigeration apparatus, is
      used. Such compressors are cycled on and off to minimize their
      running time. They are commonly operated along with a
      temperature-sensing device 155 that measures and controls the
      system superheat, which is the difference between the temperature
      of the gas entering the compressor 150 and the evaporation
      temperature of the liquid refrigerant within the evaporator 140.
      This device 155 (e.g., a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV or
      TEV), amongst other types of electronic and mechanical devices) is
      located between the condenser 145 and the evaporator 140. It
      controls temperature in the evaporator 140, in which vaporization
      of the refrigerant is directly related to cooling potential, by
      metering the flow of fluid refrigerant through the system. In an
      alternate configuration, a variable speed compressor 150 is used,
      which runs almost continuously but only as fast as necessary to
      maintain the desired pressure differential between the evaporator
      140 and the condenser 145. A temperature-sensing device 155 that
      measures and controls the system superheat may be used with this
      sort of variable-speed compressor as well. In either of these
      configurations, a cut-off switch (not shown here), which is
      operated by sensors that detect freeze-up on the evaporator, turns
      off the compressor to allow ice to melt before restarting.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In the AWH embodiment 100 shown in FIG. 1, the evaporator
      140 is in a vertical orientation, as shown in FIG. 2a. Water
      (black, single stem arrows) 158 formed on the upper evaporator
      surfaces flows down over the subjacent evaporator surfaces, which
      has the effect of amalgamating the water into rivulets as well as
      droplets as it flows from the evaporator 140 to the subjacent
      water collector 163. Because rivulets are more coherent water
      masses with higher mass to surface area ratios, they are less
      liable to lose water to the airstream moving at about a 90 degree
      angle across the flowing condensed water. Additionally, the water
      passing from the evaporator 140 to the water collection tank 163
      may be only very slightly affected by air flow, which does not
      impinge toward the water collection tank 163.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] With an alternate orientation of the evaporator as shown in
      FIG. 2b, water is removed from a horizontally oriented evaporator
      (also labeled 140) by forced air moving in the same direction as
      the condensed water separating from the evaporator 140. Water
      droplets 146 flow directly downward (single-stem black arrows)
      under the combined influence of gravity and forced air into the
      water collection tank 163. Water is more rapidly removed following
      condensation, which may have the result of reducing overcooling of
      already condensed water and allowing better heat transfer than in
      the case of coalescing water flowing over the evaporator. This is
      because water on the evaporator 140 acts as an insulator against
      heat transfer between the evaporator surface and the moist air
      114. This horizontal orientation minimizes run-off of amalgamated
      or rivulet/coalesced water on the evaporator surface in favor of
      keeping most of the water in the form of droplets until it leaves
      the evaporator. However, droplets 146 have to cross the exhaust
      air path 118 and may be entrained in the air. Angled evaporators
      (not illustrated) would have attributes intermediate between
      upright or vertical and horizontal evaporators.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Water that has condensed on the evaporator 140 flows
      downward by gravity into a water collection region tank 163
      beneath the evaporator and then into a removable water collection
      tank (not shown) that is from five to ten gallons or greater in
      capacity. Multiple tanks allow users to carry water from the water
      harvester. Alternatively, water may be pumped from the collection
      tank by a pump 167, located in the body of the AWH, through an
      industry-standard replaceable water filter 170 that is located in
      a compartment 175 that is isolated from the airflow passages
      within the apparatus. Treated water 190 that has passed through
      the water treatment system 170 remains under pressure after
      passing through the filter and exits from ports (not shown) at
      either or both the top and sides of the apparatus 100. (A
      straight-through water filter body without a filter may be used to
      produce water that is to be used for industrial purposes or that
      is otherwise not required to be treated to drinking water
      standards.)<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Air exiting from the evaporator on which water has
      condensed then passes into an air passage 120 under suction caused
      by the fan/impeller 125. The air from the fan/impeller 125 then
      passes through a downstream air passage 130 and through the vaned
      condenser 145, where the air cools the compressed refrigerant that
      is being pumped to the condensor 145 from the compressor 150.
      After heat exchange warms it, the exhaust air passes into an
      exhaust chamber 135 from which it is exhausted through louvers in
      the walls of the AWH 100, the approximate locations of which are
      shown by arrows.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In a suitable configuration of the AWH 100, the impeller or
      fan 125 is capable of running at variable speed, which is
      controlled by varying electrical current or voltage. This allows
      the impeller or fan to force air though the apparatus at different
      velocities to optimize water production on the evaporator with
      respect to the electrical energy consumed. A variable speed
      impeller or fan allows the airflow over the evaporator to be
      varied, optimizing water production by, for instance, increasing
      fan speed for high humidity air or preventing or remediating
      unintended freeze-up where slower airflow could otherwise allow
      the air to reach a dew point below freezing. (Slowly moving air
      can be cooled to lower temperatures and has a greater likelihood
      of reaching dew points below freezing, regardless of the original
      air temperature.) Alternatively, the fan or impeller may be fixed
      speed, which may be less efficient under a wide range of input air
      temperature and humidity conditions but less expensive to
      implement and not significantly more expensive to operate under
      consistently humid conditions such as may be found on tropical,
      low-lying, smaller islands.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Sealed electronic controls and computer systems that
      control the refrigeration and airflow system for all embodiments
      of this invention are integrated in a control pad (not shown) that
      is located in the top cover of the water harvester for easy
      operation. In order to prevent overheating of the electronic
      control pad, the bottom surface of the electronic control pad is a
      conduction heat exchanger that is exposed to the cold airflow
      stream upstream and/or downstream from the condenser. Thus, heat
      that may be produced within the pad or by heating of the pad
      externally by heat exchange with ambient air or heating by the sun
      may be removed and the pad kept within operating temperature
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In the embodiment 100, the compressor 150 is located within
      the exhaust air chamber 135. Where a compressor is used that is
      designed to be cooled internally, for instance using refrigerant
      discharge inside the compressor, there is no need for other
      cooling of the compressor. With that type of compressor, it is
      possible to insulate it with noise-absorbing material for quieter
      operation. The air within this chamber is slightly over-pressured
      with respect to ambient air outside the apparatus, which allows
      for distribution of air within the chamber 135 in the direction of
      sidewall vents. Air vents that form a large proportion of the side
      of the enclosure are located generally in the exterior sidewall
      137 of the exhaust chamber 135 (exhaust air shown by black arrows
      but actual vents may be widespread in the wall) in order to allow
      air to vent from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Two further embodiments 200, 300 will be described with
      reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, in which there are
      slight variations in the handling of air within the AWH following
      extraction of water from it. In these embodiments 200, 300 (as
      well as in another embodiment 400, as described below), similar
      system components are similarly numbered, but increased to the
      corresponding hundreds series to “match” the embodiment number
      200, 300, 400. Unless otherwise described, the similarly numbered
      components are the same as or generally similar to those described
      above and may have similar attributes.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Where an AWH must be operated in very hot ambient
      temperatures, or where a compressor that requires external cooling
      is used, forced-air cooling may be provided by controlling airflow
      in two general manners. These are shown in FIG. 3, in which an
      embodiment 200 uses existing exhaust for cooling of the compressor
      250, and in FIG. 4, in which an embodiment 300 uses a supplemental
      supply of ambient air for cooling the compressor 350. FIG. 3 shows
      airflow around the compressor 250 from the central part of the
      exhaust chamber 235 created by locating louvered sidewall vents
      295 “downstream” from the compressor 250. This configuration
      forces air to pass the compressor 250 in exiting from the exhaust
      chamber 235. In the alternate embodiment 300 shown in FIG. 4, an
      internal partition 311 isolates the compressor 350 from the
      exhaust chamber 335. In this configuration, vents 313 in the outer
      hull of the AWH 300 allow air to be pulled in by suction into the
      air passage 320 upstream from the impeller 325.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The three embodiments 100, 200, 300 that have been
      described above will work best in high relative humidity (RH)
      conditions. In general, where RH is high, particularly where
      temperature is also high and relatively large amounts of water are
      dissolved in the air, condensation on the evaporator takes place
      by reducing the temperature of the humid air to the point where
      condensation initiates. Where intake air is at a high humidity,
      for instance in excess of 85% RH, water will begin to condense
      with relatively little energy consumed by chilling. The sensible
      heat of the humid air (which is the term applied to heat
      associated with temperature change) must be removed to lower the
      temperature of the air slightly and bring the air to 100% RH
      locally, at which point condensation is initiated. As condensation
      proceeds, the latent heat (which is that required to cause the
      water vapor to condense to liquid water) is removed by heat
      exchange on the evaporator. Following the initiation of
      condensation, both sensible heat and latent heat are removed from
      the air being processed in the AWH as the air temperature is
      further reduced slightly and water is condensed and extracted.
      When RH is low, on the other hand, it is beneficial to be able to
      remove sensible heat before the air reaches the evaporator so that
      the cooling potential of the evaporator continues to remove a
      minimum of sensible heat and a maximum of latent heat, which has
      the effect of maintaining the energy efficiency of water
      production. (High humidity ambient air requires very little
      additional cooling to initiate condensation.) The delivery of air
      to the evaporator at approximately 90-99% RH, which is the general
      range for humid ambient air, is the primary objective for the most
      economic water production through condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A variable pre-cooling embodiment 400 of an AWH, which is
      configured to operate well under low as well as high ambient RH
      conditions and preferably at RH points in between, is illustrated
      in FIGS. 5 and 6. Most notably in comparison to the embodiments
      100, 200, 300 described above, the embodiment 400 includes a
      variable flow geometry thermal economizer section 417 located
      upstream of the impeller 425 and its inlet air passageway 420. The
      thermal economizer section 417 is suitably housed within a forward
      extension of the AWH housing and includes an air-to-air heat
      exchanger 456 located between the evaporator 440 (i.e., downstream
      from the evaporator) and the impeller 425 (i.e., upstream of the
      impeller). Preferably, the heat exchanger 456 is directly
      connected to the evaporator 440 and the impeller entry air
      passageway 420, or is connected via ducting to those components,
      such that air does not seep out from between the evaporator and
      the heat exchanger or from between the heat exchanger and the
      impeller. A preferred air-to-air heat exchanger 456 is fabricated
      from thin-walled tubes (e.g., as available from Cesarroni
      Technologies); from thin-walled corrugated plastic plate (e.g., as
      available from Innergy Tech, AB Segerfroejd, or Greenbox); or from
      corrugated metal plate (e.g., as available from Xetex and Des
      Champs Technology). In general, such air-to-air heat exchangers
      include two sets (at least) of interleaved flow passageways that
      are typically arranged perpendicularly to each other. In the AWH
      embodiment 400, the heat exchanger 456 is arranged with 1) a first
      set of heat transfer flow passageways (not illustrated
      specifically) oriented longitudinally, i.e., generally aligned
      with the main or overall direction of flow through the AWH 400;
      and 2) a second set of heat transfer flow passageways (not
      illustrated specifically) that are oriented transverse to the
      first set of heat transfer flow passageways, i.e., laterally as in
      the embodiment 400 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 or vertically.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Upstream of the heat exchanger 456, the air intake of the
      AWH 400, i.e., the entrance to the thermal economizer section 417,
      is configured to regulate the amount (if any) of air that flows
      through the second, transverse set of heat exchanger flow
      passageways. To that extent, a motorized sliding panel 446,
      mounted in a support or frame 433, is provided near the entrance
      to the thermal economizer section 417, and an airway partition 438
      extends from a lateral mid-location—suitably but not necessarily
      the center—of the panel support or frame 433 to an end of the
      evaporator 440. Suitably, the panel 446 extends vertically from
      the top to the bottom of the thermal economizer section entrance;
      laterally, assuming the airway partition 438 abuts the frame 433
      at the lateral center of the AWH 400, the panel 446 is slightly
      wider than half the width of the thermal economizer section
      entrance.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] With this arrangement of the AWH intake, when the panel 446
      is all the way to one side of the entrance to the thermal
      economizer section 417 (i.e., to one side of the airway partition
      433) as shown in FIG. 5, a first inlet aperture 402 is formed on
      the opposite side of the airway partition 433. When the apparatus
      400 is in this operational configuration, which provides a maximum
      amount of pre-cooling, air enters the thermal economizer section
      417 through the first inlet aperture 402 and flows through the
      transverse (e.g., lateral) set of air passageways through the
      air-to-air heat exchanger 456. The air then turns and flows
      through the evaporator 440, which cools/chills the air to condense
      moisture out of it, before the air flows through the longitudinal
      set of air passageways through the heat exchanger 456 and on to
      the impeller. Because the air flowing through the longitudinal set
      of heat exchanger air passageways has been cooled by the
      evaporator 440, it will absorb sensible heat from the air flowing
      through the transverse set of heat exchanger air passageways, thus
      pre-cooling the incoming air before it reaches the evaporator 440.
      This allows a greater percentage of the evaporator work to be
      directed to removing latent heat from the incoming air and thus
      improves water production efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] On the other hand, as noted above, it is relatively easy to
      condense moisture from ambient air that has high RH. Therefore, it
      becomes less important or beneficial to pre-cool the air before it
      passes across the evaporator 440. In this case, the panel 446 may
      be moved, for example, all the way across the entrance to the
      thermal economizer section 417 to the opposite side of the airway
      partition 433, which opens up a second inlet aperture 403 (i.e., a
      bypass inlet) as shown in FIG. 6. When the apparatus 400 is in
      this operational configuration, which provides a minimum amount of
      pre-cooling (for example, no pre-cooling at all) to the net
      airflow flowing through the airflow passageway before it flows
      across the evaporator 440, air enters the thermal economizer
      section 417 through the second inlet aperture 403 and flows
      immediately over evaporator 440, then down to the fan/impeller 425
      through the longitudinal set of heat exchanger air passageways,
      without first having flowed through the transverse set of heat
      exchanger air passageways for pre-cooling. This improves
      operational efficiency in terms of amount of water produced per
      unit of electricity consumed. In particular, air density increases
      with humidity, and resistance to flow (i.e., frictional drag)
      increases with air density. Therefore, by shortening the overall
      airflow distance, and in particular by bypassing the portion of
      the flow course passing through the transverse set of heat
      exchanger airflow passageways, airflow drag is reduced. This, in
      turn, reduces operational load on the fan or impeller 425 and
      hence the cost to drive the fan or impeller for a given volumetric
      flow rate of air through the AWH 400. Alternatively, for a given
      amount of electricity consumed, the fan or impeller can be run
      faster (assuming it has that capability), which allows more water
      to be produced in a given period of time and at a given operating
      cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In practice, the panel 446 may be positioned at one or more
      points between the two endpoints shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, which
      provides for at least one, and suitably a plurality, of
      intermediate pre-cooling operational configurations between the
      maximum pre-cooling operational configuration and the minimum
      pre-cooling operational configuration. Depending on the position
      of the panel 446, the relative sizes of the first and second inlet
      apertures 402, 403 will vary, which regulates the amount of air
      flowing through the transverse set of heat exchanger airflow
      passageways and hence how much pre-cooling of the incoming air is
      provided. Suitably, the position of the panel 446, and hence the
      relative sizes of the inlet apertures 402, 403, is controlled
      automatically by a computer controller (not shown), which receives
      information on ambient conditions from on-board temperature and
      humidity sensors (not shown). Using pre-programmed maps or lookup
      tables, and/or using sensors that measure internal humidity levels
      at the evaporator so as to provide feedback-based control, the
      controller adjusts the position of the panel 446 such that the
      intake air is cooled to the point that 90% to 99% RH air is
      passing across the evaporator and/or until, at some point, the
      pre-cooling potential is at a maximum. From that point to lower
      temperatures and RH, an increasing amount of sensible heat has to
      be removed from the incoming air by the evaporator 440, which
      means that increasing electricity must be used to produce
      relatively smaller amounts of water. With such an automatic
      configuration of the AWH, the speed of the fan/impeller 425 may
      also be adjusted automatically (assuming it has variable speed
      capability).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In a simpler implementation, automatic control over the
      position of the panel 446, and hence the sizes of the intake
      apertures 402, 403, may be omitted. In that case, it may be
      preferable for the AWH 400 to be configured with springs, cams,
      detents, etc. (not shown) such that the panel 446 stably assumes
      only the position corresponding to the maximum pre-cooling
      operational configuration (e.g., the position shown in FIG. 5) or
      the position corresponding to the minimum pre-cooling operational
      configuration (e.g., the position shown in FIG. 6), but not
      positions in between, thus giving the AWH 400 just two operational
      configurations in practice. The user would then manually move the
      panel to one side or the other depending on humidity existing
      generally at the time the AWH is being operated.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Furthermore, in the embodiment 400 of an AWH illustrated in
      FIGS. 5 and 6, the sizes of the two air intake apertures 402 and
      403 are directly linked to each other and always vary inversely to
      each other as the position of the panel 446 changes. For finer
      control and optimization of efficiency (water produced per unit of
      electricity, water produced per unit of time, or water produced
      per volumetric unit of airflow), on the other hand, it may be
      desirable for the sizes of the air intake apertures to be
      independently controllable (preferably by computer). To that end,
      the air intake apertures may be formed by flow-restricting devices
      such as separate, louvered openings 402', 403', as illustrated in
      FIG. 7, sphincter openings, etc. (A variable speed fan/impeller is
      particularly suitable for use with such an embodiment to fine-tune
      operation of the AWH as much as possible.) In this case, one or
      more intermediate pre-cooling configurations of the AWH can be
      obtained via intermediate sizes for either or both of the air
      intake apertures.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Alternatively, instead of controlling the amount of airflow
      through each of the inlets 402', 403' by varying the size of their
      openings, it is possible to regulate the relative amounts of
      airflow by controlling the speed of the air flowing through each
      opening. To that end, a variable speed fan or impeller 472, 473
      can be provided in association with each opening 402', 403', as
      shown in FIG. 8. In that case, the different operational
      configurations of the AWH would correspond to the different speeds
      of the fans, with maximum speed of one fan and minimum speed of
      the other fan defining one operational configuration limit value
      for the overall AWH (i.e., a maximum pre-cooling configuration);
      minimum speed of the one fan and maximum speed of the other fan
      defining another operational configuration limit value (i.e., a
      minimum pre-cooling configuration); and intermediate fan speed
      settings for either or both of the fans defining a theoretically
      infinite number of potential intermediate pre-cooling operational
      configurations of the AWH. Such variable speed fans or impellers
      could be provided in addition to the variable speed fan or
      impeller 425 or, alternatively, instead of the fan or impeller
      425.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Various attributes of the embodiments 100, 200, 300 of
      AWH's described above (e.g., variable speed refrigeration
      compressor) may be incorporated into the embodiment 400 of an AWH
      as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In the embodiment 400 of an AWH described above, the
      various operational configurations of the apparatus are determined
      by the relative configurations of the airflow passageways in the
      device, as defined by the position of the panel 446 and/or by the
      size of the inlet openings. (In the embodiment 400, the size of
      the inlet openings is defined by the position of the panel 446 as
      shown in FIGS. 5 and 6; in the other referenced AWH configurations
      (e.g., inlets having louvers or other types of flow restrictors),
      on the other hand, the size of the inlet openings is independent.)
      Alternatively, the different operational configurations of the AWH
      may be defined by different operating speeds of inlet fans. In
      each of these embodiments, the operational configuration of the
      AWH is defined by attributes of the AWH that affect the relative
      amounts of air flowing through the two sets of passageways in the
      air-to-air heat exchanger, and hence the amount of pre-cooling
      that is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As an alternative to that approach to controlling the
      amount of pre-cooling that is achieved, it is possible, by using
      the appropriate type of heat-exchanger, to control the pre-cooling
      by varying the position of the heat exchanger itself. This
      illustrated in the embodiments 500 and 600 shown in FIGS. 9-10 and
      11-12, respectively, in which heat pipes are exemplarily used as
      the heat exchangers. (Heat pipes are preferred due to their
      relatively simple construction and due to the fact that they are
      completely passive, stand-alone devices in that they require no
      other apparatus (e.g., compressors, circulation pumps, etc.) or
      electrical input to work.)<br>
      <br>
      [0045] (Heat pipes are fairly simple and efficient devices that
      can be used to transfer heat from one region to another.
      Essentially, a heat pipe consists of a sealed, partially evacuated
      tube made from heat-conducting material (e.g., metal) that has a
      small amount of a working refrigerant fluid contained inside of
      it. (The particular working fluid is selected depending on the
      temperatures of the environment in which the heat pipe will be
      used.) One end of the tube is disposed in the region where cooling
      is required (i.e., where heat needs to be removed), and the other
      end of the tube is disposed in the region where heat is to be
      discharged. In the region to be cooled, the working fluid will be
      in liquid form. As the working fluid absorbs heat from the region
      to be cooled, it boils or vaporizes, and a vapor pressure
      differential causes the vaporized fluid to move toward the
      opposite end of the heat pipe. At that opposite end of the heat
      pipe, heat is discharged from the working fluid, e.g., by dumping
      the heat into a heat sink, blowing cooling air across the end of
      the heat pipe, etc., which causes the working fluid to condense
      back into liquid form. In its simplest form, the heat pipe is
      empty except for the working fluid; in that case, the condensed
      working fluid may flow back to the heat-absorbing region due to
      gravity. In other forms, the heat pipe includes wicking material
      of some sort, and the condensed working fluid flows back to the
      heat-absorbing region due to capillary action.)<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In the AWH embodiment 500 illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10, a
      fixed-configuration airflow passageway 520 extends through the AWH
      from inlet 502 to outlet 504. The airflow passageway 520 is
      configured such that at least a segment of a downstream portion of
      the airflow passageway 520 is in proximity to at least a segment
      of an upstream portion of the airflow passageway. For example, as
      illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10, the airflow passageway 520 may have
      a U-shape, in which case approximately half of the airflow
      passageway 520 (i.e., the portion to the left of the dividing wall
      521 as shown in the figures) lies in proximity to the other
      approximate half of the airflow passageway 520 (i.e., the portion
      to the right of the diving wall 521 as shown in the figures).
      Evaporator (cooling member) 540 is located within the airflow
      passageway 520 and suitably extends all the way across it, as
      illustrated, so that all air flowing through the airflow
      passageway 520 must flow across/through it. (No other components
      of the refrigeration system in the embodiment 500 are illustrated,
      but they may be configured and located as per any of the
      embodiments described above.) One or more fans/impellers may be
      located at any suitable location to propel air through the airflow
      passageway 520. For example, fans 572, 573 may be provided at the
      inlet 502 and the outlet 504, respectively. The fan(s) may be
      single speed or variable speed depending on the desired
      sophistication of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Furthermore, as noted above, the AWH embodiment 500
      illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10 uses heat pipes as the heat
      exchanger. In the embodiment 500, the heat exchanger 556 consists
      of an array of parallel, generally straight-tube configuration
      heat pipes. The heat exchanger 556 is repositionably mounted
      (e.g., by means of a pivot 557) so that it can be moved between a
      first position as shown in FIG. 9 and a second position as shown
      in FIG. 10, which two positions of the heat exchanger 556 define
      two operational configurations of the AWH embodiment 500. The
      first heat exchanger position (FIG. 9) is used when maximum
      pre-cooling of the incoming air is desired or required; the second
      heat exchanger position (FIG. 10), on the other hand, is used when
      minimum (e.g., no) pre-cooling of the incoming air is required or
      desired. As shown in FIG. 9, when the heat exchanger 556 is in the
      first position, one portion of it 559 (i.e., the portion having
      the heat-absorbing portions of the constituent heat pipes) extends
      into, and suitably all the way across, the portion of the airflow
      passageway 520 that is located upstream of the evaporator 540, and
      another portion 561 of the heat exchanger 556 (i.e., the portion
      having the heat-discharging portions of the constituent heat
      pipes) extends into, and suitably all the way across, the portion
      of the airflow passageway 520 that is located downstream of the
      evaporator 540.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Thus, when the heat exchanger 556 is in the first position
      (and, accordingly, the AWH 500 is in its first, maximum
      pre-cooling operational configuration), relatively warm incoming
      air will pass over or across the heat-absorbing portion 559 of the
      heat exchanger 556, thereby causing the working fluid inside the
      heat exchanger heat pipes to vaporize; that vaporization removes
      heat from the incoming air and hence pre-cools it before it passes
      across the evaporator 540. Furthermore, as it passes across the
      evaporator 540, the air being treated will be cooled even further
      as moisture condenses out of it. The cooled air then continues to
      flow downstream from the evaporator 540 and passes over or across
      the heat discharge portion 561 of the heat exchanger 556. The
      cooled air absorbs heat from the heat discharge portion 561, thus
      allowing the working fluid inside the heat pipes to condense back
      into a liquid, and carries the absorbed heat away with it as it
      exits the AWH 500 via outlet 504.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] On the other hand, when pre-cooling of the incoming air is
      needed or desired to a lesser extent (e.g., if it is not needed or
      desired at all), the heat exchanger 556 is moved (e.g., pivoted)
      from the first position shown in FIG. 9 to the second position
      shown in FIG. 10 such that the AWH 500 is converted to its second,
      minimum pre-cooling operational configuration. (This may be
      accomplished either manually or automatically under computer
      control.) When it is in the second position, the heat exchanger
      556 will reside essentially within either the downstream portion
      of the airflow passageway 520 relative to the evaporator 540 (as
      shown in FIG. 10) or the upstream portion of the airflow
      passageway 520 relative to the evaporator 540 (not shown). (The
      precise position of residence is less important than the fact that
      the heat exchanger should be so positioned/located as to have
      minimal impact on airflow, especially downstream from the
      evaporator 540.) Accordingly, the heat exchanger 556 will not
      extend between upstream and downstream portions of the airflow
      passageway; no heat transfer will take place from the former to
      the latter via the heat exchanger 556; and no pre-cooling will
      occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Another reconfigurable, generally similar embodiment 600 of
      an AWH is illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12. In this embodiment, the
      fixed-configuration airflow passageway 620 is suitably straight
      and extends from inlet 602 at one end to outlet 604 at the
      opposite end. Evaporator (cooling member) 640 is located within
      the airflow passageway 620 and suitably extends all the way across
      it, as illustrated, so that all air flowing through the airflow
      passageway 620 must flow across/through it. (No other components
      of the refrigeration system in the embodiment 600 are illustrated,
      but they may be configured and located as per any of the
      embodiments described above.) One or more fans/impellers may be
      located at any suitable location to propel air through the airflow
      passageway 620. For example, fans 672, 673 may be provided near
      the inlet 602 and the outlet 604, respectively. The fan(s) may be
      single speed or variable speed depending on the desired
      sophistication of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In the AWH embodiment 500 described above, the heat
      exchanger 556 is straight and the airflow passageway 520 is curved
      (e.g., U-shaped) so that when the heat exchanger 556 is in the
      first position it can extend between upstream and downstream
      portions of the airflow passageway 520 relative to the evaporator
      540. Conversely, in the AWH embodiment 600, the airflow passageway
      620 is essentially straight and the heat exchanger 656 is curved
      (e.g., U-shaped or C-shaped) so that part of it can be disposed
      upstream of the evaporator 640 and part of it can be disposed
      downstream of the evaporator 640 simultaneously. Thus, in the AWH
      600, the heat exchanger 656—again exemplarily constructed using
      heat pipes—has a heat-absorbing portion 659 and a heat discharge
      portion 661 that are connected by means of bridge portion 663.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The first heat exchanger position (FIG. 11) is used when
      pre-cooling of the incoming air is desired or required; the second
      heat exchanger position (FIG. 12), on the other hand, is used when
      less (e.g., no) pre-cooling of the incoming air is required or
      desired. As shown in FIG. 11, when the heat exchanger 656 is in
      the first position, one portion of it 659 (i.e., the portion
      having the heat-absorbing portions of the constituent heat pipes)
      extends into, and suitably all the way across, the portion of the
      airflow passageway 620 that is located upstream of the evaporator
      640, and another portion 661 of the heat exchanger 656 (i.e., the
      portion having the heat-discharging portions of the constituent
      heat pipes) extends into, and suitably all the way across, the
      portion of the airflow passageway 620 that is located downstream
      of the evaporator 640.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Thus, when the heat exchanger 656 is in the first position
      (and, accordingly, the AWH 600 is in its first, maximum
      pre-cooling operational configuration), relatively warm incoming
      air will pass over or across the heat-absorbing portion 659 of the
      heat exchanger 656, thereby causing the working fluid inside the
      heat exchanger heat pipes to vaporize; that vaporization removes
      heat from the incoming air and hence pre-cools it before it passes
      across the evaporator 640. Furthermore, as it passes across the
      evaporator 640, the air being treated will be cooled even further
      as moisture condenses out of it. The cooled air then continues to
      flow downstream from the evaporator 640 and passes over or across
      the heat discharge portion 661 of the heat exchanger 656. The
      cooled air absorbs heat from the heat discharge portion 661, thus
      allowing the working fluid inside the heat pipes to condense back
      into a liquid, and carries the absorbed heat away with it as it
      exits the AWH 600 via outlet 604.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] On the other hand, when less (e.g., no) pre-cooling of the
      incoming air is needed or desired, the heat exchanger 656 is moved
      translationally (e.g., slid) from the first position shown in FIG.
      11 to the second position shown in FIG. 12 such that the AWH 600
      is converted to its second, minimum pre-cooling operational
      configuration. (This may be accomplished either manually or
      automatically under computer control.) When it is in the second
      position, either or both (as illustrated) of the heat-absorbing
      and the heat-discharging portions of the heat exchanger 656 will
      reside entirely outside of the airflow passageway 620 and will
      offer no impediment to smooth airflow. Accordingly, the heat
      exchanger 656 will not extend between upstream and downstream
      portions of the airflow passageway; no heat transfer will take
      place from the former to the latter via the heat exchanger 656;
      and no pre-cooling will occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Reverting to more general discussion applicable to any of
      the embodiments disclosed herein, unwanted mixing between intake
      and exhaust air has the potential to reduce the humidity of the
      intake air, which would have the effect of increasing energy use
      and decreasing water production. The intake and exhaust are
      located on generally opposite sides of the apparatus to separate
      them as much as possible without using intake or exhaust pipe
      extensions. In still air, exhaust will generally tend to be
      propelled away from the apparatus while intake air will be drawn
      from the ambient air at the other end. Where a water harvester is
      operated outdoors, changing wind direction and velocity may be
      anticipated. Shift of wind direction will have an impact upon the
      potential for mixing intake and exhaust air, particularly when the
      wind is blowing from the exhaust end and toward the intake end of
      the water harvester. Optimum conditions for minimum mixing of
      intake and exhaust air occur when the wind is blowing generally on
      the intake and away from the exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A manual switch may be provided on the control panel (not
      shown) to initiate a timed cycle in which the air system operates
      but the condenser system is turned off. This allows air to be
      passed through the unit without water being condensed from the
      air. This provides for drying of the internal air courses and
      their surfaces (including the evaporator and condenser). At the
      initiation of the cleaning/drying cycle, dilute chlorine spray
      from a hand-pump rechargeable container is sprayed into the intake
      air stream in sufficient quantities so that all internal air
      passages, including the main condenser and water collection area,
      are sufficiently exposed to allow for effective sterilization of
      the system. The unit continues to run, which has the effect of
      drying the internal surfaces and leaving the unit dry. If it is to
      be operated again in a relatively short time or if it is to be
      stored in a dry, climate-controlled location, packing in an
      air-tight container may not be necessary. Where the unit may be
      off for more than a short time, it should be packed in a sealed
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Provision may be made for quick-fitting a backup hand pump
      so that water may be filter-treated or removed from the water
      harvester under pressure if the pump 167 fails. It is also
      possible to recover the water directly from the removable water
      tank by removing it and pouring the water out manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The apparatus may be wheeled and has handles suitable for
      pulling or lifting, even on ground that is not flat or smooth, or
      it may be operated essentially fixed in place (as on a pedistal or
      platform, with no provision for hand moving. It is designed and
      fabricated to be robust and to be operated out of doors without
      regard for weather conditions. All embodiments of the water
      harvester are weather-proofed, with sealed electronics, louvered
      intakes, screening as part of the filter assembly 110 (all
      embodiments) and on intakes and exhausts. The apparatus is
      suitable for placement by hand, without mechanized lifting or
      towing equipment. It can be left in one location over a period of
      time and can be manually brought under cover for protection in
      advance of major storms and redeployed manually.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Furthermore, when a water harvester operates in very hot
      ambient conditions, the heat load on the refrigeration system as a
      whole may become very large—especially when it is performing a
      large amount of work. In that case, the ability to keep the
      refrigerant within an optimal range of operating temperatures may
      be exceeded at high heat loads if, as in the embodiments described
      above, there is essentially just a single stream of air passing
      through the AWH, with the air that passes over the evaporator
      being the same air and the only air that subsequently passes over
      the condenser to cool it. Therefore, to accommodate operation in
      hotter environments, any of the embodiments of an AWH illustrated
      herein and described above may be configured with a so-called
      “split condenser” refrigeration system. Such refrigeration systems
      are generally known and include multiple condensers (e.g., two),
      with additional, separate forced-air system(s) being provided to
      remove heat from the additional condenser(s) beyond the “primary”
      condenser. This supplements the cooling of the condenser by
      removing additional heat from the refrigerant stream and enhances
      total system heat rejection. The bias in the system toward greater
      heat rejection also helps to ensure that liquid refrigerant within
      the refrigeration system does not spontaneously begin to vaporize
      in an unintended manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 13 illustrates a split condenser refrigeration system
      that could be implemented in any of the AWH embodiments described
      above, with the condensers X45a and X45b arranged in parallel.
      (“X” is used as the first character of the reference numerals to
      indicate that the components could be as used in any of the AWH
      embodiments.) The refrigeration system includes the “primary”
      condensing unit X45a that operates directly with the water
      condensation system X15 (consisting of an evaporator and possibly
      other heat exchangers) and a compressor X50 (which may be
      implemented as more than one compressor operating in tandem). An
      impeller or fan X25 drives air through the primary system.
      (Open-stemmed arrows show airflow through the system and solid
      arrowheads on the refrigerant circulating system show flow
      direction.) Additional system heat rejection is achieved via
      “secondary” condensing unit X45b connected in parallel with the
      primary condensing unit X45a. In a parallel system, it possible to
      turn the secondary system on and off, which has the effect of
      reducing demand on the compressor, by opening or closing the
      upstream valve X88 (upstream with respect to the secondary
      condensing unit X45b) and the downstream valve X90, which valves
      link the secondary system to the primary recirculation
      refrigeration system. A separate fan X92 drives a supplemental
      airstream X94 across the secondary condensing unit X45b. Being
      able to close off the additional heat rejection capability is
      desirable in conditions of low system load (e.g., lower
      temperature and higher humidity) and to prevent unwanted
      refrigerant migration when portions of the system are turning on
      and off while operating in a low-demand mode. There are also
      technical improvements to system performance that can be achieved
      by bypassing the secondary condenser X45b during low load, though
      it adds system control complexity.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 14 illustrates a split condenser refrigeration system
      that could be implemented in any of the AWH embodiments described
      above, with the condensers X45a and X45b arranged in series. The
      primary condenser X45a, the water condensation system X15, the fan
      or impeller X25, and the airflow for the primary system are the
      same as in FIG. 13. The overall recirculation refrigeration
      system, however, consists of just a single loop that runs from the
      compressor X50 through first one condenser X45b and then the other
      condenser X45a. FIG. 14 shows the compressed refrigerant being
      passed first through the additional heat-rejecting condenser X45b
      and then through the primary condenser X45a. Although the order in
      which the refrigerant fluid passes through the two condensers
      could be reversed, our experience is that greater system
      performance is achieved by removing heat from the vicinity of the
      primary refrigeration system. There may also be a subcooler (not
      shown) associated with the primary condenser that ensures the
      refrigerant is liquid when it reaches the metering device that
      controls input of the refrigerant into the evaporator. Serial
      operation also requires fewer sensors, valves, and a simpler
      control system.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The foregoing disclosure is only intended to be exemplary
      of the methods and apparatus of the present invention. Departures
      from and modifications to the disclosed embodiments may occur to
      those having skill in the art. For example, while an air-to-air
      heat exchanger or heat pipes as disclosed and described may be
      preferred, other forms of heat exchangers such as a fluid loop
      recirculation system or an inverse vapor compression refrigeration
      system running in tandem with the “primary” refrigeration section
      may be implemented. Furthermore, the evaporator of a vapor
      compression-based refrigeration system is but one type of cooling
      device that may be used to cool the incoming air. Other cooling
      devices such as thermoelectric cooling devices could also be used.

      The invention relates to atmospheric moisture harvesting. In
      particular, the invention capitalizes on the recognition that the
      air outside of a building usually has higher relative humidity
      than the air inside of the building. Therefore, the present
      invention relocates and/or modifies the configuration of an
      atmospheric moisture harvester such that more-moisture- laden,
      higher-relative-humidity outdoor air flows over the cooled water
      condensation surface of the atmospheric moisture harvester as the
      source for water to be delivered and consumed safely inside a
      dwelling or building. This increases the efficiency of atmospheric
      moisture harvesting and, at the same time, maintains the ability
      to access water obtained by the atmospheric moisture harvester
      from inside the building, thereby fostering ease of use.<br>

      [0002] The invention relates to atmospheric moisture harvesting,
      i.e., extracting water from the air for human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Atmospheric moisture harvesting to obtain drinking water is
      known. In this process, air containing water vapor is passed over
      a cooled or chilled surface, and moisture contained within the air
      condenses on that surface. The condensed water is then collected
      and, typically after some form of treatment to kill germs (e.g.,
      ultraviolet irradiation, exposure to ozone, etc.), it is suitable
      for human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] To the best of my knowledge, where atmospheric moisture
      harvesters have been used to obtain drinking water, the
      conventional practice has been to install them and use them
      indoors or to produce water outdoors and deliver it there also.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The present invention capitalizes on the recognition that
      the air outside of a building usually has higher relative humidity
      than the air inside the building. This is due to the fact that
      buildings are usually climate-controlled, e.g., air-conditioned,
      which reduces the relative humidity of the air inside of them.
      Therefore, the present invention relocates and/or modifies the
      geometric layout or configuration of an atmospheric moisture
      harvester such that more-moisture-laden, higher-relative-humidity
      outdoor air flows over the cooled water condensation surface of
      the atmospheric moisture harvester as the source for water to be
      consumed. This increases the efficiency of atmospheric moisture
      harvesting. At the same time, the present invention maintains the
      ability to access the water obtained by the atmospheric moisture
      harvester from inside the building, thereby fostering ease of use.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Thus, according to the invention, an arrangement for
      atmospheric moisture harvesting has a building with an interior
      and an exterior and an atmospheric moisture harvester with a
      condensing surface over which air can flow; an air inlet; an air
      outlet; and a water outlet. The atmospheric moisture harvester's
      air inlet is in communication with the building's exterior such
      that outside air can flow over the condensing surface, and the
      atmospheric moisture harvester's water outlet is in communication
      with the building's interior such that water obtained from the
      outside air by means of the atmospheric moisture harvester can be
      accessed from inside the building.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment 100 of an atmospheric
      moisture harvesting arrangement according to the invention. In
      this embodiment 100, an atmospheric moisture harvester 102 is
      located entirely outside of a building, the interior of which is
      labeled as 104, the exterior of which is labeled as 106, and an
      exterior wall of which is labeled as 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The atmospheric moisture harvester 102 suitably is
      configured according to any of the embodiments of atmospheric
      moisture harvesters disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No.
      12/418,077 filed May 11, 2009 and entitled “Atmospheric Water
      Harvesters with Variable Pre-Cooling” (either with or without
      pre-cooling of the air before the air passes over the condensing
      surface), the entire contents of which are incorporated by
      reference. Alternatively, the atmospheric moisture harvester 102
      may be configured with pre-cooling that is not variable. As
      illustrated by the double-stemmed arrows, outdoor air enters the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 102 through an inlet 110; the air
      is cooled as it passes over a condensing surface 112, which causes
      moisture in the air to condense into liquid form; and the air
      exits the atmospheric moisture harvester through an outlet 114.
      Assuming the atmospheric moisture harvester 102 is constructed in
      accordance with the embodiments disclosed in the above-referenced
      co-pending application, or as a generally similar device that has
      non-variable pre-cooling, the condensing surface 112 will be the
      surface of an evaporator in a vapor compression cycle-based
      refrigeration circuit. As illustrated by the dashed line 116, the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 102 is suitably powered by
      electricity from the building's electrical system. Additionally,
      controls for the atmospheric moisture harvester 102 are suitably
      located inside the building, and control signals are also
      represented by the dashed line 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] As further illustrated in FIG. 1, liquid water that is
      obtained from the outside air by means of the atmospheric moisture
      harvester 102 exits the atmospheric moisture harvester 102 via
      water outlet 117 and passes into the interior 104 of the building
      via a conduit 118, e.g., a pipe. The water may be pumped from the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 102 into the building;
      alternatively, depending on the relative vertical positioning of
      the components in the arrangement 100, the water may simply flow
      into the building due to gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In the embodiment 100 illustrated in FIG. 1, it is
      anticipated that the atmospheric moisture harvester 102 may be
      sized to produce on the order of about 20 gallons of water per day
      for an average family home. Therefore, a water treatment/reservoir
      unit 120 is located inside the building to store that water, and
      the water treatment/reservoir unit 120 receives the water flowing
      from the atmospheric moisture harvester 102. The water
      treatment/reservoir unit 120 may include one or more means such as
      a UV-based bacteriostat, an ozone generator, a chlorinator, etc.,
      by means of which germs that may have entered the water can be
      neutralized. Additionally or alternatively, the water
      treatment/reservoir unit 120 may include various water filtration
      devices to remove particulate matter from the water, or that/those
      filtration device(s) may be provided directly in the atmospheric
      moisture harvester 102. (To obtain economies of scale, two or more
      atmospheric moisture harvesters 102 can be run in parallel, with a
      single, common air intake/air filtering mechanism serving all
      atmospheric moisture harvesters 102 in the group and all
      atmospheric moisture harvesters 102 in the group delivering water
      to a single, common water treatment/reservoir unit 120.)<br>
      <br>
      [0016] When it is needed, water is withdrawn from the water
      treatment/reservoir unit 120, e.g., via a tap or spigot 122.
      Depending on the relative vertical positioning of the water inlet
      to and water outlet from the water treatment/reservoir unit 120
      and/or whether there is pressurization in the system, the water
      may need to be pumped out of the water treatment/reservoir unit
      120 or, alternatively, it may flow out of the water
      treatment/reservoir unit 120 due to gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A second embodiment 200 of an atmospheric moisture
      harvesting arrangement according to the invention, which
      arrangement 200 is similar to the arrangement 100 illustrated in
      FIG. 1, is illustrated in FIG. 2. The embodiment 200 is generally
      identical to the embodiment 100, with the only difference being
      that the water treatment/reservoir unit 220 is located outside of
      the building instead of inside the building. Thus, the water
      outlet 217 from the atmospheric moisture harvester 202 is in
      indirect communication with the interior 204 of the building
      (e.g., via the water treatment/reservoir unit 220), in contrast to
      being in direct communication with the interior of the building as
      in the first embodiment 100. The two embodiments are otherwise
      identical, and the same reference numerals are used to identify
      the same components but are increased by 100 to a 200 “series” of
      reference numerals.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A third embodiment 300 of an atmospheric moisture
      harvesting arrangement according to the invention is illustrated
      in FIG. 3. In this embodiment 300, components that are essentially
      the same as those illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 and described above
      have correspondingly similar reference numerals, but in the 300
      “series” of reference numerals. In the third embodiment 300, the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 302 extends through the wall 308 of
      the building. One portion, which houses the condensing surface
      312, is located outside of the building so that outside air can
      flow easily across the condensing surface 312 as illustrated by
      the double-stemmed arrows, and the other portion, which has the
      water outlet 317, is located inside the building. The atmospheric
      moisture harvester 302 may be mounted in a window in a manner
      similar to that in which a window-unit air conditioner is mounted,
      or it may be mounted in some other opening in the wall 308 that is
      specifically configured to accommodate the atmospheric moisture
      harvester 302.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In this third embodiment 300, the atmospheric moisture
      harvester 302 is significantly smaller than the atmospheric
      moisture harvesters 102 and 202 employed in the first and second
      embodiments 100 and 200, respectively. Thus, the atmospheric
      moisture harvester 302 is foreseen as producing on the order of
      about five to ten gallons of water per day, and that amount of
      water can be stored in a reservoir (not shown) that is in the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 302, per se. Germicidal means and
      filtration means (not shown) are also housed within the
      atmospheric moisture harvester. Furthermore, depending on the
      vertical positioning of the water outlet 317 and the tap or spigot
      322, water may be pumped out of the reservoir or it may flow out
      of the reservoir due to gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Finally with respect to this third embodiment 300, although
      the atmospheric moisture harvester 302 is powered by electricity
      from the building's electrical system as in the above-described
      embodiments and as indicated by the dashed line 316, because the
      portion of the atmospheric moisture harvester 302 with the water
      outlet 317 is located inside the building and is therefore easily
      accessible, a control panel 324 may be provided directly on the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 302. Therefore, the dashed line 316
      represents the flow of electricity to the atmospheric moisture
      harvester 302 but not the flow of control signals to or from the
      atmospheric moisture harvester.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Finally, a fourth embodiment 400 of an atmospheric moisture
      harvesting arrangement according to the invention is illustrated
      in FIG. 4. The fourth embodiment 400 is substantially similar to
      the third embodiment 300. Unlike the third embodiment 300,
      however, in the fourth embodiment 400, the atmospheric moisture
      harvester 402 is located entirely inside the building, which might
      be desired in order to limit access and/or possible damage to the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 402 or to reduce weatherproofing
      requirements. Therefore, to facilitate such an arrangement, an
      inlet duct 426 is provided to convey air from outside of the
      building to the inlet 410 in the atmospheric moisture harvester
      402, and an outlet duct 428 is provided to convey the air from the
      outlet 414 in the atmospheric moisture harvester 402 back to the
      exterior of the building once that air has passed over the
      condensing surface 412. (In FIG. 4, the inlet and outlet ducts 426
      and 428 are external to the atmospheric moisture harvester 402; it
      is possible, of course, for the ducting to be provided inside the
      atmospheric moisture harvester 402 as a component thereof.)
      Otherwise, the fourth embodiment 400 of an atmospheric moisture
      harvesting arrangement is essentially the same as the third
      embodiment 300.<br>

      <br>
      The atmospheric water harvester (2) shown in FIG. (1) comprises a
      centrally located flue in the form of a tower 4 and a surrounding
      heating enclosure (6) for collecting incident solar energy to heat
      air which enters its periphery (8). With heating of the air in the
      heating enclosure (6), an updraught is created within tower (4) as
      the air from the heating enclosure (6) returns to the atmosphere
      from the open end of the tower A base structure (10) housing a
      plurality of wind turbines is provided around the base of the
      tower. As the heated air flows from the heating enclosure (6) into
      the tower it is harnessed to rotate the wind turbines. Each wind
      turbine (20) is provided with associated water collection
      apparatus (94) comprising a refrigeration system for cooling
      condensation surfaces to, or below, the dew point of the air to
      effect the condensation of water from the air onto condensation
      surfaces of the water collection apparatus for collection. The
      refrigeration system comprises a compressor (46) for compressing a
      refrigerant vapour for the cooling of the condensation surfaces
      and which is driven by the wind turbine (20).<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates broadly to condensing
      moisture from the atmosphere to provide a source of water and more
      particularly, to an atmospheric water harvester that utilises
      solar energy to drive production of the water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Changing climate patterns and global population increases
      means that water shortage is a significant issue. Methods and
      equipment to reduce water usage and produce drinking water are
      therefore being considered by organisations and governments
      throughout the world.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One of the problems with many of the currently available
      water production alternatives is that they require electrical
      energy to power drinking water generating equipment. This is
      particularly true with conventional water desalination plants
      employing reverse-osmosis technology. These alternatives have two
      main drawbacks, namely they generate pollution including
      greenhouse gases and are expensive to operate.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Over the last 15 to 20 years environmentally friendly solar
      tower power stations have been proposed for generating electricity
      from solar energy as an alternative to fossil fuel and nuclear
      power stations. These typically comprise a central tower structure
      surrounded by a heating enclosure for heating atmospheric air
      employing radiant solar energy. The heating enclosure opens into
      the lower region of the tower. Air that enters the heating
      enclosure is heated by the solar energy and the tower is of a
      height such that the temperature differential created between the
      heated air in the heating enclosure and the atmosphere at the top
      of the tower is sufficient to create an updraft within the tower
      as the heated air returns to the atmosphere. Electricity is
      generated by harnessing the updraft to drive one or more wind
      turbines. Solar tower power stations of this type can potentially
      be utilised to generate 200 MW of electric power or more depending
      on the dimensions of the heating enclosure and tower, and the
      intensity of available solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] In a first aspect of the present invention there is
      provided an atmospheric water harvester, comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0006] a heating enclosure adapted to receive air from the
      atmosphere and be heated by solar energy to effect heating of the
      air;<br>
      <br>
      [0007] a flue for return of the air from the heating enclosure to
      the atmosphere, the flue opening to the atmosphere at a sufficient
      height relative to the heating enclosure to create a draught
      within the flue;<br>
      <br>
      [0008] at least one wind turbine arranged to be driven by the air
      returning to the atmosphere via the flue from the heating
      enclosure; and<br>
      <br>
      [0009] at least one water collection apparatus comprising at least
      one condensation surface, and a refrigeration system for cooling
      the condensation surface to, or below, a dew point of the air to
      effect the condensation of airborne moisture onto the condensation
      surface for collection, the refrigeration system including a
      compressor for compressing refrigerant vapour and a condensor for
      condensing the compressed refrigerant vapour into liquid
      refrigerant, and the wind turbine being arranged to drive the
      compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Typically, the condensation surface is arranged for contact
      with the air heated in the heating enclosure as the air returns to
      the atmosphere via the flue, the airborne moisture being condensed
      from the heated air. Alternatively, the condensation surface may
      be arranged for contact with further air from the atmosphere other
      than the air heated within the heating enclosure, the airborne
      moisture being condensed from the further air.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Typically also, the wind turbine is coupled to the
      compressor for driving the compressor. Preferably, the wind
      turbine incorporates a gear box that couples an output shaft of
      the wind turbine to the compressor. However, any other suitable
      coupling for mechanically coupling the wind turbine to the
      compressor for operation thereof may be utilised. In another
      embodiment, the wind turbine is coupled to an electric generator
      for generating electricity to power operation of the compressor.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Preferably, the water collection apparatus further
      comprises water collection means for collecting water condensed
      onto the condensation surface from the airborne moisture.
      Typically, the water is collected from the condensation surface by
      the water collection means by gravity. Preferably, the water
      collection means comprises a holding reservoir that receives the
      water from the condensation surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Preferably, the refrigeration system further comprises an
      evaporator for evaporation of the liquid refrigerant into
      refrigerant vapour to effect the cooling of the condensation
      surface. Most preferably, the condensation surface is a surface of
      the evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a particularly preferred embodiment, the condensor is
      arranged for contact with air flowing from the condensation
      surface for cooling of the condensor to facilitate the condensing
      of the compressed refrigerant vapour into the liquid refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Preferably, the atmospheric water harvester also comprises
      air flow control means for controlling flow rate of the air
      flowing into contact with the condensation surface to enhance the
      efficiency of the condensation of the airborne moisture onto the
      condensation surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Preferably, the air flow control means incorporates at
      least one adjustable air inlet operable to allow the air to flow
      to the condensor by-passing contact with the condensation surface
      such that the flow rate of the air flowing into contact with the
      condensor is adjusted compared to the flow rate of the air flowing
      into contact with the condensation surface. This allows increased
      air flow to the condensor to cool the condensor for condensing of
      the compressed refrigerant vapour, substantially without
      increasing the flow rate of the air to the condensation surface
      and thereby adversely affecting condensation of water from the air
      onto the condensation surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Preferably, the heating enclosure will comprise a plurality
      of radially directed heating chambers disposed around the tower
      and which open to a base region of the flue, each heating chamber
      being respectively provided with one or more air inlets for entry
      of the air from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Typically, the, or each, wind turbine is arranged in a
      central region of the heating enclosure in which the flue is
      disposed. The wind turbine(s) generally incorporate blades
      rotatable about a turbine rotation axis. The turbine rotation axis
      may be vertical, horizontal or inclined at an oblique angle,
      respectively. In one or more embodiments, a wind turbine may be
      arranged within a lower region of the flue. Alternatively, the
      atmospheric water harvester may comprise a plurality of wind
      turbines, the wind turbines being radially orientated with respect
      to the central region of the heating enclosure and
      circumferentially spaced apart from each other. In a particularly
      preferred embodiment, each wind turbine is arranged to be driven
      by air flowing from a corresponding one of the heating chambers,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The flue may comprise a shaft, pipe, chimney, tower or
      other structure through which the air heated in the heating
      enclosure returns to the atmosphere. The flue may be substantially
      vertical or extend upwardly from the heating enclosure at an
      oblique angle. In a particularly preferred embodiment the flue
      will comprise a tower.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a preferred embodiment the at least one water collection
      apparatus is disclosed at a position within the heating enclosure
      at which the average velocity the air returning to the atmosphere,
      whilst in use, is within a range of between 2.0 m/s and 3.5 m/s.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another preferred embodiment the at least one water
      collection apparatus is disclosed at a position within the heating
      enclosure at which the average temperature of the air returning to
      the atmosphere, whilst in use, is substantially equal to, or no
      more than 5[deg.] C. greater than, an ambient temperature of air
      at a periphery of the heating enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The wind turbine may be mechanically coupled to the
      compressor by means of a rotatably mounted drive shaft extending
      from the turbine to the compressor. Alternatively, the turbine may
      be electrically coupled to the compressor by means of an
      electrical generator driven by the wind turbine so as to generate
      electricity that is conducted via conductors extending between the
      turbine to the compressor. In another embodiment the refrigeration
      system is disposed adjacent the wind turbine such that, in use,
      the refrigeration system is driven by the turbine to produce
      chilled gases that are communicated along at least one thermally
      insulated pipe from the refrigeration system to the condensation
      surface.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE
        INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] The atmospheric water harvester 2 shown in FIG. 1 comprises
      a centrally located flue in the form of a tower 4 and a
      surrounding heating enclosure 6 for collecting incident solar
      energy to heat air which enters its periphery 8. With heating of
      the air in the heating enclosure 6, an updraught is created within
      tower 4 as the air from the heating enclosure 6 returns to the
      atmosphere from the open end of the tower. A base structure 10
      housing a plurality of wind turbines is provided around the base
      of the tower. As the heated air flows from the heating enclosure 6
      into the tower it is harnessed to rotate the wind turbines. As
      will be described further below, each wind turbine is provided
      with associated water collection apparatus comprising a
      refrigeration system for cooling condensation surfaces to, or
      below, the dew point of the air to effect the condensation of
      water from the air onto condensation surface(s) of the water
      collection apparatus for collection. The refrigeration system
      comprises a compressor for compressing a refrigerant vapour for
      the cooling of the condensation surfaces and which is driven by
      the wind turbine. A plan view of atmospheric water harvester 2 is
      shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As shown in FIG. 3, the tower 4 is buttressed about its
      base by reinforced concrete and is supported by reinforced
      concrete foundations 14. The tower itself is fabricated from steel
      plate. The heating enclosure 6 has a canopy 16 held aloft by
      internal supporting walls. The canopy may be formed from any
      suitable material that permits ingress of solar energy into the
      interior of the heating enclosure. To enhance retention of heat
      within the enclosure, the internal walls supporting the canopy may
      be lined with corrugated zinc coated sheet metal. The heating
      enclosure thereby acts as a "greenhouse" for heating of the air to
      generate the updraught through the tower 4 to drive the wind
      turbines.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the heating enclosure 6
      is divided into radial heating chambers 18 that fan outwardly from
      around the base 16 of the tower. Each heating chamber 18 houses a
      wind turbine 20 and opens into the tower 4 at one end and to the
      atmosphere via opposite respective openings defined in the
      periphery 8 of the heating enclosure 6. The heating chambers act
      to funnel air heated by the incident solar energy through
      respective confusor 22 regions thereof to each turbine. To
      minimise turbulent air flow resulting from passage of the air
      through the blades of the turbines, each heating chamber 18 is
      further provided with a diffusor region 24, the cross-sectional
      area of which increases with distance from the corresponding wind
      turbine 20 into the base of the tower. To minimise drag and
      turbulence, an arcuate exhaust passageway 26 is provided through
      the concrete buttress 12 for feeding the heated air from each
      heating chamber into the tower 4, respectively. The heating
      chambers 18 may be provided with heater beds to assist heating of
      the air, that are operable in times of low solar energy input or
      for night operation when solar energy is not available. The heater
      beds will typically comprise a plurality of heaters spaced apart
      along the length of each heating chamber. The heaters may be
      electric or gas fired and be automatically operated by a central
      monitoring system in response to decreases in air temperature
      detected by temperature sensors located within the heating
      chambers and/or the tower. Remotely controlled shutters can also
      be provided that are operable to partially or fully close the air
      inlet opening and corresponding exhaust passageway 26 of each
      heating chamber to enable the air to be heated to the necessary
      temperature prior to entering the tower 4. In this way, the flow
      of air from the heating chambers into the tower can be controlled
      to maintain the updraught through the tower and maximise
      efficiency of the atmospheric water harvester 2. That is, in times
      of lower solar energy availability, different ones of the turbines
      can be operated by controlling the flow of air through selected
      one(s) of the heating chambers 18 while others are closed to allow
      the air to reach a sufficient temperature, to maximise the
      production of water from the atmosphere for the prevailing
      atmospheric conditions and available solar energy. Controlling the
      updraught through the tower is particularly desirable in
      embodiments where a wind turbine is arranged within the lower
      throat region of the tower, as exemplified in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A solar tower power station with a solar heating enclosure
      of the type described above with discrete heating chambers
      radiating outwardly from a central tower as outlined above is, for
      instance, described in U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      10/341,559. That disclosure also exemplifies the structural detail
      of the heating enclosure and its contents are herein incorporated
      in their entirety. In some embodiments, the tower 4 may comprise a
      constricted region in which the wind turbine is arranged. The
      constriction within the tower provides a venturi type effect in
      which the air flowing up the tower is accelerated through the
      constriction. An arrangement of this type is for instance
      described in International Patent Application No. PCT/CA01/00885.
      As also described in International Patent Application No.
      PCT/EP2004/010091, the tower may be reinforced by one or more
      spoked reinforcement structures, each comprising wire cable spokes
      that are tensed between an outer pressure ring of the tower and an
      inner anchoring hub disposed in a transverse cross-sectional plane
      of the tower, respectively. However, it will be understood by
      persons skilled in the art that any suitable known such solar
      tower and heating enclosure arrangements may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Typically, the tower of an atmospheric water harvester 2
      embodied by the present invention will be of a height to create an
      updraught sufficient to drive the wind turbine(s) 20 of the water
      harvester. Typically, the tower will have a height of at least 200
      meters, more preferably a height of 400 meters or 500 meters and
      most preferably, a height of 800 meters or 1,000 meters or more.
      The diameter of the tower will normally be at least 50 meters, 75
      meters or 100 meters or more. Most preferably, the tower will have
      a diameter of about 130 meters or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The heating enclosure 6 will typically have a canopy area
      of at least about 1,000 hectares, more preferably at least about
      2,000 hectares and most preferably, a canopy area of at least
      about 4,000 hectares. The canopy 16 of the heating enclosure may,
      for instance, be provided by glass, polycarbonate sheeting,
      plastic film or a combination of the foregoing. Generally, the
      heating enclosure will be circular in form with a diameter of at
      least about 1,000 meters, more preferably at least about 2,000
      meters or 3,000 meters and most preferably, a diameter of about
      3,500 meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the output shaft 28 of
      the wind turbine 20 is rotatably supported within the tower 4 as
      indicated by the numeral 30 such that the blades 32 of the wind
      turbine are mounted in the throat of the tower for being rotated
      about turbine axis 34 with flow of the air from the surrounding
      heating enclosure 6 into the tower 4, as indicated by the arrows.
      In some embodiments the wind turbine further comprises a housing
      36 in which the refrigeration system of the water collection
      apparatus is housed for condensing water from the air from the
      heating enclosure which enters the housing through air inlet 38
      from the heating enclosure 6 before exiting the housing through
      air outlet 40 to the tower.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Rather than a single centrally located wind turbine, the
      embodiment of the atmospheric water harvester shown in FIG. 5 is
      provided with a plurality of wind turbines driven by heated air
      passing from corresponding respective heating chambers 18. While
      only two wind turbines are shown in FIG. 5, an atmospheric water
      harvester of this type will normally have a plurality of wind
      turbines equidistantly spaced circumferentially around the base of
      the tower for being driven by the passage of the heated air
      flowing from respective heating chambers into the tower. The
      housing 36 of each turbine houses a refrigeration system as
      described above for condensing water from the passing air. In a
      particularly preferred embodiment, thirty-six wind turbines are
      arranged around the tower, one wind turbine to each heating
      chamber, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The condensing of the water from the heated air will now be
      described with reference to FIGS. 6 to 12. Turning firstly to FIG.
      6, the refrigeration system of the water collection apparatus
      disposed within housing 36 of a wind turbine 20 comprises an
      evaporator 42, a condenser 44 and a compressor 46. As can be seen,
      the compressor is coupled to the output shaft 28 of the wind
      turbine by a gear box 48. However, as will be readily apparent to
      persons skilled in the art, any suitable coupling for transferring
      rotational kinetic energy of the output shaft 28 to the compressor
      46 may be used. For example, rather than a gear box, hydraulic
      couplings, including hydrostatic couplings, may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The evaporator 42 is provided with a plurality of spaced
      apart fins through which the air from the heating enclosure flows
      and which provide condensation surfaces for the condensation of
      water from the air upon the condensation surfaces being cooled to,
      or below, the dew point of the air by the refrigeration system.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In order to assist in the optimisation of operational
      efficiency, the interior of the housing 36 is divided into
      separate compartments to which the air entering the housing is
      directed by air flow control means. More particularly, heated air
      from the heating enclosure 6 flowing into the housing 36 through
      air inlet 38 initially enters air intake chamber 50 from where it
      flows to evaporator 42 through compressor chamber 54 housing
      compressor 46. The flow of air from the air intake chamber 50 to
      the compressor chamber 54 is regulated by dampers of the air
      control means in the form of air intake valves 52. From the
      compressor chamber 54, the air flows into contact with the
      condensation surfaces of the evaporator 42 prior to entering
      condensor chamber 56 in which the condensor 44 is located. As the
      air contacts the condensation surfaces of the evaporator, heat is
      drawn from the air and water condenses on the condensation
      surfaces from where it flows under gravity into water collection
      means in the form of a funnel 58 which directs the water to a
      holding reservoir comprising a tank. From the tank, the water is
      pumped to an external storage reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The cooled air from the evaporator 42 then flows into
      contact with the condenser 44, drawing off heat from the
      condensor. This in turn cools refrigerant vapour within the
      condenser, facilitating the condensing of the refrigerant vapour
      into liquid refrigerant. The warmed dry air flowing from the
      condensor then exits the housing 36 of the wind turbine and flows
      into the tower 4 of the atmospheric water harvester. A hinged
      by-pass damper 60 of the air control means regulates the flow of
      air from the air intake chamber 50 into the condensor chamber 56
      as will be further described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The air flowing through the housing 36 therefore serves two
      primary functions, namely providing a source of moisture which
      condenses onto the condensation surfaces of the evaporator for
      collection and secondly, to cool the condensor 44 for condensation
      of the refrigerant vapour of the refrigeration system into liquid
      refrigerant for effecting cooling of the evaporator upon being
      allowed to subsequently expand. The passage of the air through the
      compressor chamber also serves to cool the compressor 46 and its
      coupling to the output shaft of the wind turbine.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A wind turbine 20 typically requires a wind speed of at
      least about 6-7 m/s before it will rotate. Generally, a wind speed
      of at least about 2.0 m/s through the housing 36 of the wind
      turbine is required to create turbulent air flow therethrough for
      efficient condensation of water from the air and cooling of
      respective components of the refrigeration system. Water can,
      therefore, be effectively condensed from the air whenever there is
      sufficient wind generated by the flow of heated air from the
      heating enclosure 6 into the tower 4 to rotate the wind turbine.
      However, the flow of air through the evaporator 42 should be
      limited to about 3.5 m/s and preferably about 2.5 m/s to allow
      sufficient contact of the air with the condensation surfaces of
      the evaporator for condensation of the water. Accordingly, the air
      intake valves 54 and by-pass damper 60 are generally operated to
      limit air flow through the housing to this speed. Typically, the
      air will pass through a filter 62 prior to entering the evaporator
      as indicated in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Rather than the compressor 46 being mechanically driven by
      rotation of the output shaft 28 of the wind turbine, embodiments
      may be provided in which the output shaft rotates an alternator 66
      that generates electric power for driving the compressor 46.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A yet further wind turbine that may be employed in an
      atmospheric water harvester embodied by the present invention is
      shown in FIG. 9. This wind turbine is provided with a rotor 64
      having wind vanes rather than blades as does the wind turbine of
      FIG. 6. This wind turbine also differs from that shown in FIG. 6
      in that the air entering the housing of the wind turbine is less
      affected by the rotation of the rotor 64 and primarily arises from
      the natural flow of air passing from the heating enclosure 6 into
      the tower 4. In contrast, the exhaust air from the wind turbine
      shown in FIG. 6 is directed into the air inlet 38 of that wind
      turbine and so is substantially more turbulent. Air flow through
      the housing of the wind turbine of FIG. 9 is shown in FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The refrigeration system may be either a single pressure or
      dual pressure system, and provides sub-cooled liquid refrigerant
      to the evaporator for evaporation therewithin to effect the
      cooling of the condensation surfaces of the evaporator for
      condensation of the water from the passing air. The resulting
      heated refrigerant vapour is drawn from the evaporator 42 and
      passed to the condensor 44 for condensation to liquid refrigerant
      as described above. To enhance thermal efficiency, heat is drawn
      from the compressed liquid refrigerant by the cool condensed water
      collected from the evaporator via a heat exchanger 72 as shown in
      FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] More specifically, as shown more clearly in FIG. 11, the
      heated refrigerant vapour is drawn through suction loop 68 from
      the lower region of the evaporator 42 to the compressor 46. The
      suction loop 68 traps and holds any liquid refrigerant which might
      pass from the evaporator, thereby preventing the liquid
      refrigerant from entering and potentially damaging the compressor.
      The refrigerant vapour is compressed and thereby heated in the
      compressor, prior to being discharged through hot gas loop 70 to
      the top of the condenser 44. The hot gas loop 70 traps any liquid
      refrigerant draining back from the condensor to the compressor 46.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Air flowing to the condenser 44 from the evaporator cools
      the high pressure hot refrigerant vapour in the condenser such
      that the refrigerant vapour condenses. The condensed liquid
      refrigerant is then cooled by the condensed water passing through
      heat exchanger 72. The cooled liquid refrigerant subsequently
      drains from the bottom of the condenser 44 into reservoir 74,
      prior to passing from the reservoir through a filter 76 which
      removes any contaminants and moisture from the liquid refrigerant.
      From the filter 76, the refrigerant travels along conduit 78,
      incorporating a sight glass 80 which allows a visual check for the
      presence of any moisture or bubbles in the liquid refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The conduit 78 then feeds the now dry, cooled liquid
      refrigerant to a thermostatic expansion valve 82. As the liquid
      refrigerant passes through the valve, the pressure of the liquid
      refrigerant decreases. The resulting low pressure cold liquid
      refrigerant with some flash gas is fed from the expansion valve 82
      into the evaporator 42 where the liquid refrigerant evaporates
      back into refrigerant vapour, drawing in heat from the
      condensation surfaces of the evaporator. The cooled condensation
      surfaces in turn draw heat from the air flowing into contact with
      the condensation surfaces effecting cooling of the air and
      condensation of the moisture therefrom onto the condensation
      surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As described above, for efficient operation the flow rate
      of the air is adjusted by the air control means to optimise
      condensation of water per unit volume of the ambient air flowing
      through the evaporator 42, and to maintain sufficient air flow to
      the condenser for heat transfer from the condenser to the air for
      achieving the condensing of the refrigerant vapour in the
      condenser. As will be understood, the refrigeration system is
      operated to cool the condensation surfaces of the evaporator
      without freezing the condensed water.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] For any given prevailing atmospheric conditions, there is a
      specific humidity value measured in grams of water vapour per
      kilogram of the air. For example, a specific humidity of between
      4.5 and 6 grams of moisture per kilogram of air correlates to a
      dry bulb temperature of between 1[deg.] C. and 6.5[deg.] C. In
      use, the water collection apparatus is operated to condense water
      from the ambient air entering the housing 36of a wind turbine such
      that the specific humidity of the air flowing from the evaporator
      to the condensor is reduced to a specific humidity correlating
      with a selected reference dry bulb temperature. The selected dry
      bulb temperature will typically be in the above temperature range
      and usually, will be in a range of from about 3.5[deg.] C. to
      about 5.5[deg.] C. and preferably, will be about 5[deg.] C. or
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Turning now to FIG. 12, a temperature sensor 84 is provided
      for measuring the dry bulb temperature of the air passing from the
      evaporator 42 to the condensor 44. This temperature is compared by
      an automatic operation control system 86 with the selected
      reference dry bulb temperature which has been manually set in the
      control module. If the dry bulb temperature measured by the
      temperature sensor 84 increases above the set reference dry bulb
      temperature, the operation control system operates actuator 88
      such that air intake 54 partially closes, thereby decreasing air
      flow through the evaporator 42. This in turn lowers the dry bulb
      temperature of the air leaving the evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As the flow rate of the air leaving the evaporator is
      decreased, the amount of cooled air from the evaporator available
      for cooling the condensor 44 also decreases. This results in a
      rise in the pressure of the refrigerant vapour in the condensor
      above the optimum pressure for the fixed refrigeration capacity of
      the refrigeration system. The pressure of the refrigerant vapour
      in the condensor is measured by a pressure sensor 90. In response
      to the increased pressure measured by the pressure sensor, the
      operation control system 86 operates actuator 92 to open. This
      increases the flow rate of air flowing to the condensor while
      simultaneously substantially maintaining the flow rate of the air
      A to the evaporator. The increased flow rate of air to the
      condensor removes heat from the condensor such that the pressure
      of the refrigerant vapour in the condensor reduces to the optimum
      pressure for condensation of the compressed refrigerant vapour.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The operation control system 86 continues to monitor the
      dry bulb temperature of the air leaving the evaporator 42 and the
      pressure of the refrigerant vapour in the condensor 44 is
      respectively measured by temperature sensor 84 and pressure sensor
      90. If the dry bulb temperature sensed by the temperature sensor
      decreases below the set reference dry bulb temperature, the
      operation control system 86 operates to increase the speed of air
      flowing through the evaporator and decreases the flow of air
      by-passing the evaporator through by-pass damper 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The monitoring is repeated at regular intervals to ensure
      optimum efficiency of the apparatus and thereby, maximum
      condensation of water from the air. The provision of such timing
      circuits is well within the scope of persons skilled in the art.
      For different latitudes or atmospheric conditions, the reference
      dry bulb temperatures set in the controller 86 may be adjusted.
      The operation control system may comprise a central computerised
      control system that monitors the operation of each of the water
      collection apparatus, or control modules each of which monitors
      the operation of water collection apparatus associated with at
      least one wind turbine 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The level of water collected in the holding tank from the
      condensation surfaces of the evaporator is monitored by float
      switches or other suitable water level sensing arrangements.
      Suitable such systems are for instance described in International
      Patent Application No PCT/AU2004/001754, the contents of which are
      also expressly incorporated herein in their entirety. When
      sufficient water accumulates in the holding tank, it is pumped
      from the holding tank to an external storage reservoir which may
      be in the form of an open dam or a larger tank from where the
      water can be pumped to consumers.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] While the water will normally be condensed from the heated
      air flowing to the tower from the heating enclosure 6 as shown in
      the accompanying figures, other embodiments may be provided
      wherein air is ducted to the water collection apparatus associated
      with the wind turbine(s) through conduits from exterior of the
      heating enclosure without being heated within the heating
      enclosure with the air that flows from the heating enclosure to
      the tower. Similarly, the exhaust air from the water collection
      apparatus may be returned to the atmosphere via return conduits or
      otherwise be expelled into the tower for return to the atmosphere.
      In such embodiments, the air may be drawn through the inlet
      conduits by fans arranged within the housing(s) of the wind
      turbine(s) or by rotors arranged within the housings that are
      coupled or otherwise driven by the wind turbine(s) or the draught
      within the heating chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14 the water
      collection apparatuses 94 are remote from the wind turbines. More
      particularly, the water collection apparatuses 94 are disclosed at
      positions within the heating enclosure 6 at which the average
      velocity of the air returning to the atmosphere, whilst in use, is
      within a range of between approximately 2.0 m/s and 3.5 m/s. In
      contrast, the wind turbines 20 are generally disposed at positions
      of maximum average air speed velocity so as to maximise their
      power output. The average air velocity profile that arises within
      the heating enclosure due to the escaping of air from the tower 4
      generally increases from a minimum at or near the periphery 8,
      through to a maximum at or near the tower 4. An example of such an
      average air velocity profile is illustrated in the graph of FIG.
      15. From this graph it can be seen that each of the water
      collection apparatuses 94 in this preferred embodiment are
      disposed at a radial distance from the outer periphery 8 of
      between approximately 11% and 21% of the total radius of the
      heating enclosure 6 so as to ensure that the average air velocity
      to which the water collection apparatuses 94 are exposed is within
      the optimum range of between approximately 2.0 m/s and 3.5 m/s. It
      will be appreciated, however, that alternative embodiments may
      have differing average air velocity profiles to that shown in FIG.
      15. Hence, the optimum positioning of the water collection
      apparatuses 94 within such alternative embodiments should be
      determined with reference to the average air velocity profile that
      is applicable to the particular embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] If it is desired to minimise the amount of refrigerating
      effort required to cool the air to at or below the dew point, it
      is generally preferable to minimise the temperature of the air
      incident upon the condensation surfaces. Hence, in some
      embodiments (not illustrated) the water collection apparatuses are
      positioned within the heating enclosure with this in mind. A
      typical air temperature profile generally increases from a minimum
      air temperature at or near the periphery of the heating enclosure,
      through to a maximum air temperature at or near the tower 4. It
      therefore follows that positioning the water collection
      apparatuses at or proximate to the periphery of the heating
      enclosure is optimum if it is desired to reduce the incident air
      temperature. In this way it is possible to ensure that the average
      temperature of the air that is incident upon the condensing
      surface is no more than approximately 15[deg.] C. or 110[deg.] C.
      or preferably 5[deg.] C. greater than, or substantially equal to,
      the ambient temperature of the air that enters at the periphery of
      the heating enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The embodiments described in the preceding two paragraphs
      entail a physical separation of the wind turbines 20 from the
      condensation surfaces of the water collection apparatuses 94. In
      the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14, the wind turbines
      20 are mechanically coupled to the water collection apparatuses 94
      by means of rotatably mounted elongate drive shafts 96 extending
      from each wind turbine 20 to a respective refrigeration system 98
      associated with a respective water collection apparatus 94. In an
      alternative embodiment the wind turbines are electrically coupled
      to the compressors of the water collection apparatuses by means of
      an electrical generator driven by the wind turbine so as to
      generate electricity that is conducted via conductors extending
      between the turbine to drive the compressor. In yet another
      alternative embodiment, the refrigeration system is disposed
      adjacent the wind turbine such that, in use, the refrigeration
      system is driven by the wind turbine to produce chilled gases that
      are communicated along thermally insulated pipes that extend from
      the refrigeration system to the condensation surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Preferred forms of solar atmospheric water harvesters
      embodied by the present invention therefore provide at least one
      of a number of advantages including:<br>
      <br>
      the utilisation of solar energy as a power source for the
      production of water;<br>
      the air leaving the water collection apparatuses is dehumidified
      as compared to the air entering the heating enclosure, thereby
      assisting to lessen corrosion problems within the heating chamber
      and tower;<br>
      the avoidance of air pollution associated with coal or other fuel
      fired power stations; and<br>
      the production of large quantities of replenishable potable water.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that
      numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the
      invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing
      from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described.
      Accordingly, the specific embodiments illustrated are preferred
      and not limiting. For example, rather than a flue comprising an
      upright tower as shown in the accompanying figures, an embodiment
      may be provided in which the flue is in the form of a heat outlet
      pipe which follows the upward slope of a hill or mountainside, the
      pipe being supported at regular intervals along its length up the
      hill or mountainside by mounts to which the pipe is secured by
      brackets. The pipe may also be formed from a material transparent
      to at least some solar energy or, for instance, have a transparent
      side facing the sun, for facilitating further heating of the air
      within the pipe by incident solar energy as the air flows upwardly
      within the pipe. As will be understood, the heating enclosure 6
      may also be situated on the side of a hill or inclined ground to
      maximise exposure of the canopy 16 of the enclosure to incident
      solar energy. Alternatively, or as well, the canopy may have a
      number of inclined surfaces, each being disposed to maximise the
      surface area of the heating enclosure exposed to the incident
      solar energy at different times during the day, respectively. For
      instance, an eastern side of the canopy may be inclined to face
      the rising sun during morning hours while a western side of the
      canopy has an opposite inclination so as to face the sun in the
      latter part of the afternoon.<br>

      <br>
      An atmospheric water harvester extracts water from high relative
      humidity air. The temperature of the surface of a condensation
      member is lowered in the presence of moist air to promote
      condensation of water vapor on its surface, and the water so
      obtained by condensation is collected. The atmospheric water
      harvester includes a photovoltaic member that generates
      electricity to power the refrigeration of the condensation member.
      At least as much electrical power is produced as is used to
      condense the water vapor so that no additional sources of
      electrical power are required. Each atmospheric water harvester
      (or array of harvesters) is rapidly installed and then operated in
      an unattended state for considerable periods of time. Arrays of
      autonomous atmospheric water harvesters can be installed as
      free-standing units or as roofs on either new or existing
      buildings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] In general, the invention relates to "harvesting" water
      from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Provision of water is a problem where rainfall is scarce,
      strongly seasonal, or where there are relatively small catchment
      areas and little natural local water storage. This is particularly
      true for remote locations such as oceanic islands and for coastal
      areas where the fresh water table is relatively shallow or not
      well developed because of subsurface geological conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] On oceanic islands, for example on Bermuda in the central
      Atlantic Ocean, water is provided mainly by rain catchment on most
      buildings, including virtually all private homes. Water is stored
      locally in cisterns into which the run-off flows directly. Because
      the water is derived from rainwater run-off from roofs, there is
      often both biological and sediment contamination. When rainfall is
      sparse, the collection of water is insufficient for demands and
      where populations are high, water rationing is common. Low
      rainfall also increases the level of pollution. In addition, where
      roofs are of such a size that not enough water can be captured
      directly from run-off for local use, for instance from roofs of
      factories on Saipan in the western Pacific, water must be provided
      from another source.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Similarly, the capture of rainwater and pumping of shallow
      wells for human use, including industrial purposes, in localities
      where there is a very thin fresh water groundwater layer on top of
      a saline-saturated substrate substantially degrades the
      environment on many of these islands and related localities.
      Capture of rainwater prevents it from recharging fragile
      groundwater systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Water companies in most of the United States plan water
      requirements based on an average water use for an individual in an
      urban environment of about 100 gallons per day. Where water
      supplies are restricted, such as in most of the Caribbean Islands
      for instance, 50 gallons per day represents average per capita
      total water use. In arid areas or where water infrastructure is
      poor, average per capita consumption (for all purposes) is
      commonly below 10 gallons per day, even when water supplies are
      normal. Natural water resources often do not meet local demands
      now, and population growth is increasing. Thus, new sources of
      fresh water for human consumption are required now.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In addition, relatively smaller amounts of high quality
      potable water are required from time to time where natural or
      man-made disasters render water and electrical infrastructure
      unusable, or in remote locations where distributed water supplies
      are required and no water infrastructure exists.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] One source of fresh water that has not previously been
      drawn upon in any known significant manner is the atmosphere,
      especially in those areas near warm seawater where the atmosphere
      contains significant volumes of water vapor. In these areas, the
      amounts of water in the atmosphere that can be recovered is
      related to both the initial relative humidity and the temperature
      to which this warm, moisture-laden air can be cooled so that water
      condenses. Where relative humidity is high, considerable amounts
      of water are held in the air.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Table 1 shows two examples of the amount of water contained
      in warm air at about sea level, which examples are typical of most
      tropical and sub-tropical regions near large bodies of water.
      Where the temperature of the fully saturated air is higher, more
      water is present as vapor, and where colder temperatures can be
      reached during the condensation phase, more water may be
      recovered.<br>

      [0010] Water content and production potential for 80% and 100%
      relative humidity. More cooling is required to produce water from
      air in which the relative humidity is less than 100%. The amount
      of water condensed listed in columns 3 and 4 relates only to
      condensed water vapor removed when the humid air temperature is
      lowered to the indicated levels. Remaining air is saturated with
      water vapor at the temperature to which the air has been cooled.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention provides a new method and apparatus
      for obtaining high quality water, of distilled water character and
      in which virtually no dissolved solids are present, by using a
      light-weight, self-contained, passive system for harvesting
      atmospheric moisture when relative humidity is high. In locations
      where there is high relative humidity throughout the diurnal
      cycle, water may be condensed and collected according to the
      invention both during the day as well as at night, whenever
      relative humidity is high enough. Even in locations where the air
      tends to have low relative humidity during the heat of the day,
      the relative humidity usually rises during the night and will
      often be at near 100% humidity for long periods of the diurnal
      cycle. This condition prevails even in most semi-arid and arid
      regions. At these times of high relative humidity, water may be
      collected according to the invention using autonomous atmospheric
      water harvesters.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Apparatus according to the invention, referred to as an
      "autonomous atmospheric water harvester," includes two main parts,
      namely 1) one or more water vapor condensation and collection
      members each having a surface upon which water is condensed and
      collected, and 2) an energy-gathering member such as a
      photovoltaic panel that produces electricity to power
      condensation-driving refrigeration. Additionally, the apparatus
      includes a frame to secure the photovoltaic member and the one or
      more condensation members firmly in place. An air passage is
      formed between the energy-gathering member (photovoltaic member)
      and the condensation member, and additional air passages are
      formed between condensation members where there are more than one
      condensation member.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] High relative humidity air passes through the air passage
      or passages, where it is cooled. Water vapor from the chilled air,
      which becomes supersaturated with moisture, thus condenses onto
      the condensation member. The condensed water flows under the force
      of gravity off the condensation member and is collected in a
      separate container.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Electricity used to power the cooling (i.e., refrigeration)
      necessary to condense the water vapor is produced by the apparatus
      itself, which can operate in a stand-alone, essentially unattended
      mode for long periods of time. Where it is needed or desired to
      store electrical energy, batteries or fuel cells are used for each
      autonomous atmospheric water harvester or group of harvesters.
      Moreover, surplus electrical energy produced during sunlight hours
      (i.e., electrical energy in excess of that required for cooling
      and condensation) may be added into an existing electrical grid,
      from which grid electricity later may be drawn when no electricity
      is being produced by the water harvesters. Where no electrical
      grid exists to absorb large quantities of electrical energy, local
      energy storage systems or methods for storing the excess
      electricity in the form of potential energy, e.g., pumping water
      into towers or up-hill reservoirs (hydroelectric pump storage),
      may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The purpose of the water harvester is not to dramatically
      reduce the temperature of the air passing through the apparatus
      (as in an air conditioning unit) or to primarily dry the air (as
      in an air dehumidifier), but to only chill the air sufficiently to
      condense the required amounts of water from relatively humid air.
      The air exiting the water harvester may be only slightly chilled
      and may still contain considerable moisture. Thus, the water
      harvester constitutes a third, and new type of apparatus for the
      treatment of air, which is designed to achieve the objective of
      condensing water from air.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE
        INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] Preferably, an autonomous atmospheric water harvester
      according to the invention condenses atmospheric water vapor to
      yield liquid water while producing at least sufficient electrical
      power for its own operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, an autonomous
      atmospheric water harvester 100 according to the invention has a
      rigid, panel-type photovoltaic member 110, a panel-type
      condensation member 115, and a frame or support member 118 on each
      side (nearside shown in phantom for clarity) that hold the members
      securely in place with respect to each other and that give the
      entire autonomous atmospheric water harvester a box-section
      configuration having substantial physical strength. The side frame
      members are also used to affix multiple autonomous atmospheric
      water harvesters together and/or to supports.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The panel-type members of the harvester are illustrated in
      FIG. 1 as flat for diagrammatic simplicity. It should be
      understood, however, that a variety of surface configurations may
      be used to facilitate the condensation, collection, and removal of
      the harvested water. The water produced by condensation should be
      essentially pure and suitable for potable use after relatively
      little treatment, e.g., light chlorination. Because the product
      water is essentially distilled water, it will be necessary or
      desirable to add salts or mix a certain proportion of seawater
      with it so that the water is suitable for continuous human or
      animal consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Where a water- and weather-proof abutting connection is
      required between two or more water harvesters, a cap-type sealer
      strip 144, which has inert and long-lived properties similar to
      silicone rubber, may be fitted over the edges of the frame member
      118 which extend above the photovoltaic member 110 so that
      adjacent harvesters may be joined together in side-to-side
      fashion. The sealer strip may be held in place by friction, with
      glue, or some other means such as bolts or snap-clips. Other means
      of sealing adjoining panels, such as adhesive or O-ring sealing,
      may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The ends 122, 124 of each autonomous atmospheric water
      harvester 100 are open so that an air passage 120 is formed
      through the harvester assembly. Moist air from the ambient air
      mass surrounding the autonomous atmospheric water harvester flows
      or is caused to flow across exposed, refrigerated apparatus or the
      refrigerated face of the condensation member 115. As the moist air
      flows through the harvester, i.e., across the condensation member
      115, water vapor condenses out of it and accumulates on the
      surface of the condensation member 115. Therefore, materials such
      as metals that maintain electric charge are used within the air
      passage to retard the establishment and growth of microorganisms,
      so long as no hazardous material residue is added to the product
      condensed water.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The ends of the air passage 120 are preferably screened to
      keep larger animals, e.g., birds and bats which could roost in the
      air passage, out of the air passage 120. The screens are removable
      so that they can be removed for periodic cleaning of the air
      passage.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Water harvesters are arranged in a tilted position so that
      water that condenses or gathers on the condensing surface flows,
      under the influence of gravity, to the lower end 124 of the
      harvester. At the lower end 124, water is collected by a catch
      trough or physical barrier 126 that causes the water to flow
      laterally along the panel such that it can be transported away
      from the condensation member by a pipe 138.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Electrical energy to power the requisite cooling is
      generated by the photovoltaic member 110, which is the uppermost
      part of the autonomous atmospheric water harvester 100. In
      addition to water obtained via condensation and collection of
      atmospheric moisture, water is also obtained from rainwater
      run-off. A catch-trough 128 is located at the lower end of the
      photovoltaic member 110 to catch rainwater as it flows down along
      the surface of the photovoltaic member 110, and rainwater caught
      by the barrier 128 is removed to storage through piping 134.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The amount of rainwater run-off obtained or captured using
      the atmospheric water harvester 110 will be at least as large as
      that obtained from any roof of the same size as the harvester, and
      this water, which is likely to be polluted with material washed
      from the roof, can be used for all non-potable purposes or treated
      to potable quality water standards. This run-off water is kept
      separate from the water collected by the condensation member 115
      because the rainwater may be polluted with matter such as dust,
      pollen, and bird excreta that falls onto the surface of the member
      110. The photovoltaic member 110 shelters the condensation member
      115 from matter falling from or generally settling out of the air,
      thereby helping to preserve the quality of the water produced by
      condensation of water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Insulation 112 is affixed to the back of the photovoltaic
      member 110 so that as the photovoltaic member 110 warms due to its
      direct exposure to sunlight, it is substantially prevented from
      warming air in the airway 120, which would otherwise make the
      condensation member less efficient when water is being produced by
      condensation during the day. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
      there is only a single condensation member 115. In this
      embodiment, the condensation member 115 may also have a layer of
      insulation on its exterior (i.e., lower) surface to help isolate
      the cooling region from unwanted heat that would decrease overall
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Although only one condensation member 115 and one air
      passage 120 are shown in FIG. 1, more than one condensation member
      may be provided, which would form more than one air passage. Thus,
      in another embodiment 100' as shown, for example FIG. 2, the
      addition of a second condensation member 125 that forms a second
      airway 130 increases the water production capability of the
      harvester 100'. In addition, where a condensation member (e.g.,
      condensation member 115 in FIG. 2) has air passages on both sides,
      both sides of the condensation member may have cooling surfaces or
      coils (illustrated in more detail below) on which water is
      condensed. Water condensing on coils located along the lower
      surface of the condensation member 115 will drip onto the
      condensation member below it, from which it is collected. Thus,
      the more air passages and condensation members an autonomous
      atmospheric water harvester has, the greater the potential for
      water production. Thus, assuming electric power, the ambient
      humidity of the moist air, and the structure carrying the
      harvester or group of harvesters is adequate, increased water
      production can be achieved by producing water from more than one
      condensation and water collection surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The number of cooling members and air passages-for
      instance, the number of harvesters to be joined along a common air
      passage axis, thereby forming a longer, compound airway, or the
      number of harvesters to be joined side-by-side-and the required
      airflow that will yield optimal water harvesting for particular
      installations is a function of the area to be covered and the
      local atmospheric conditions. In circumstances where a maximum
      amount of water condensation is required, as many condensation
      members and air passages as is desirable and practical may be
      employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] A presently preferred system for cooling the condensation
      member 115 is conventional refrigeration. Conventional
      refrigeration devices operate using a vapor- or a vapor-liquid
      cycle to absorb heat from one region and disperse it in another
      region. In such systems, a refrigerant is compressed, thereby
      generating heat that is dispersed in air remote from the area in
      which refrigeration is required. The compressed refrigerant is
      then circulated through pipes or other conduits to the area where
      cooling is required, where pressure within the refrigeration
      system conduits is reduced. The refrigerant expands and vaporizes,
      cooling as it does so. The cooled refrigerant is then circulated
      through the region in which cooling is desired. This cooled
      refrigerant is warmed via heat exchange with the region, and the
      region is cooled.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In an autonomous atmospheric water harvester, the area in
      which chilling is required is the area within the air passage or
      air passages 120, 130, at the surface of each condensation member
      or immediately adjacent to it, so that the water vapor in the
      moist air passing through a given air passage condenses and can be
      collected for use as fresh water. In one cooling system
      configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 3, exposed cooling coils 150
      are arranged in a plane above the condensation member 115 but near
      enough to it so that the surface of the condensation member may
      also be somewhat chilled. The cooling coils 150 are held in place
      by supports 153. The refrigerant course leading to the cooling
      coils 150 is embedded in the condensation member 115, and
      connections with other harvesters are made between fixed connector
      points within the condensation members.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In this configuration, water condenses on the cooling coils
      and drips onto the upper surface of the condensation member 115,
      where the water gathers through coalescing of drops of water and
      flow of the collected water to the lower end of the member. The
      gathering water is diverted by the collector trough or barrier 126
      into a removal pipe 138, through which it is removed for storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Alternatively, cooling coils may be disposed in more than
      one plane or in a more complex fashion, e.g., within multiple air
      passages 120, 130 of a multiple air passage assembly. In such a
      configuration (not illustrated), the coils are sized and located
      to create optimum conditions of air flow and heat exchange. Water
      is collected in the same manner described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In another configuration of the cooling system for a water
      harvester, the entire cooled fluid circulation system is
      miniaturized and embedded in a material having a high degree of
      thermal conductivity, which are known in the art. This is done in
      a fashion similar to some refrigeration systems designed for
      aircraft and spacecraft, where weight and size are important
      considerations and where physical protection of the refrigeration
      pipe system is important. Refrigeration apparatus such as these
      are also very durable and capable of long-term operation in
      unmaintained situations.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In such a cooling system configuration, illustrated in FIG.
      4, a cooled flat panel 115' has small diameter pipes on the order
      of a centimeter or less in diameter carrying the refrigerant that
      are embedded beneath the surface of the condensation member to
      provide a refrigerated surface 158 on which condensation can take
      place. Embedding the refrigerant pipes provides a number of
      benefits. For example, the temperature of the chilled surface 158
      of the refrigerated member 115' as a whole can be controlled by
      redirecting fluid using constrictor control valves to meet heat
      local sink demands. In addition, physical protection is provided
      by the material into which the refrigerant conduits are embedded.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Other means of refrigeration may also be employed.
      Thermoelectric coolers (TECs), for instance, are solid state heat
      pumps that utilize the Peltier effect, which is a solid-state
      method of heat transfer through dissimilar semiconductor
      materials. TECs may have particular application where light weight
      is a primary requirement. These would also be used where flat or
      complex surfaces were desired to be cooled, as circulated
      refrigerant is more difficult to use in those applications.
      Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) refrigeration exploits the magnetic
      properties of certain materials that warm when they are magnetized
      and cool when they naturally demagnetize. That method may also be
      used when cooling a surface is required because, like TECs, no
      circulating refrigerant is used or needed. However, because the
      surface alternately warms and cools as it is magnetized and
      demagnetized, condensation would be intermittent or cyclical
      rather than continuous. Thermoacoustic coolers (TACs) or pulse
      tube coolers can also be employed. They are gas-filled variable
      diameter tubes in which acoustic energy (instead of mechanical
      compression) is used to drive the compression and expansion of the
      circulated refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Hydrophilic materials such as special polymers that attract
      water molecules (e.g., nylon or rayon) may be used on the surface
      158 of the member 115' where condensation takes place. When
      droplets form directly on the surface, they increase in size and
      mass by coalescing with other water droplets and by direct
      condensation of water vapor onto their surfaces. Thus, the
      droplets gain mass and merge into streams that flow under the
      influence of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] To assist this movement of water, a dendritic system of
      micro-channels 165 that increase in cross-sectional area down the
      slope of the condensation member 115' is engraved into the surface
      158 of the condensation and water gathering member 115'. Ideally,
      hydrophobic materials that repel water molecules (e.g., Teflon)
      are used to line the surfaces of the micro-channels to promote
      rapid water flow from the upper end to the lower end of the
      condensation member 115'.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Furthermore, as illustrated in FIG. 5A, cooling member
      surfaces are preferably either corrugated, e.g., as at 160 or, as
      illustrated in FIG. 5B, finned, e.g., as at 162. This increases
      the surface or heat transfer area and thus increases the rate of
      condensation and accumulation of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In another cooling system configuration (not illustrated),
      one or more planar or more complexly arranged exposed
      refrigeration coils and a refrigerated surface of the condensation
      and water gathering member are combined. This maximizes
      refrigeration within the air passages.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Because the air cools and water condenses from it as the
      air moves through the air passage, the temperature of the cooling
      coils and/or the condenser member surfaces may be controlled to
      form local cooling zones, where different temperatures are
      maintained. This helps distribute the cooling load more equally
      and of improves the efficiency of water production by not
      overcooling some of the air and by facilitating condensation
      occurring generally equally along the length of the air passage
      for best water production. Additionally, optimizing temperatures,
      distribution of water production, and air flow will lead to the
      lowest energy costs per volume of water produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] As illustrated in FIG. 6, groups of autonomous atmospheric
      water harvesters, termed "arrays," can be joined together to form
      a single structural entity. For example, three water harvesters
      H1, H2, H3 share a single refrigeration system that circulates
      refrigerant through the array 200 of water harvesters as a whole.
      Harvesters are designed so that connections between them can be
      established quickly and securely with prefabricated connecting
      sections for both conventional gas/fluid refrigerant distribution
      line 199 and return 191 (where these are used).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The underside of each condensation member of an individual
      water harvester H1, H2, or H3 that is part of the array 200 has
      built-in "female" receptors (similar to small fueling points on
      aircraft and racing cars) that contain their own self-sealing
      mechanisms for secure, quick-fit connections between the
      condensation members and the distribution system. These receptors
      are small depressions into which the "male" connectors of
      prefabricated electrical and refrigeration connections are
      inserted. In the refrigerant distribution system, butt-end
      connectors 197 having a male fitting on one end 198 and a female
      fitting on the other end 199 allow an essentially continuous pipe
      configuration to be established rapidly at any array installation,
      where any number of individual water harvesters are assembled into
      an array. For refrigerant return, the return line 191 mates with
      female socket connectors 195 on the underside of the condensation
      members by a male fitting 193. Unused connectors are self-sealing
      so that the absence of a connector does not impede operation where
      a water harvester is to operate independently (i.e., by itself) or
      at the periphery of an array of harvesters. Different lengths of
      prefabricated refrigeration system piping are made so that in
      large arrays, the fewest butt-end connectors are used, as leaks
      are most likely to occur at mechanical joints.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In addition, a prefabricated electrical energy wiring
      system includes control cable harnesses 170 that plug into
      electrical and control sockets 176 in the underside of each
      photovoltaic member. The prefabricated electrical harnesses 170
      have plugs 173 in the connector cable system that fit into the
      female sockets 176 in each photovoltaic member in the array.
      Alternatively, each photovoltaic member may have a short,
      permanent fitted electric cable extending from about the same
      position as the female socket 176 shown on FIG. 6, which cable
      plugs into an electric cable with waterproof sockets (not shown).
      Electricity produced by the photovoltaic members is conditioned in
      an industry standard regulator and control device 179 used for
      controlling the output of photovoltaic panels. These regulators
      can also be linked with an electrical grid 181. Electricity is
      provided for operation of control and other equipment (not shown).
      The control system 179 operates and powers the condenser pumps 185
      and heat exchanger 187 of the refrigeration system.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] It may be required to store electricity to operate the
      control systems of the panels when the photovoltaic members are
      not generating electrical power. Electricity produced in excess of
      that required to recharge the control batteries or capacitor
      assembly may be stored. Where there is need for excess electricity
      to be stored locally (e.g., where electrical energy is required at
      night when the photovoltaics do not produce electricity), larger
      or higher energy density batteries may be located in the immediate
      vicinity of an array or group of arrays of autonomous atmospheric
      water harvesters. The excess electrical energy may be stored at a
      location remote or removed from the locations of the condensation
      water harvesters.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A water harvester can be pre-set to operate at particular
      temperatures on a time-of-day basis. For instance, where local
      environmental conditions such as the diurnal cycle of relative
      humidity and ambient temperature can be predicted, operation of
      the refrigeration system can be pre-set on a calendar basis, much
      like most heating and air conditioning systems in homes and
      buildings. However, in order to optimize chilling of the
      condensation member, a suite of sensors to measure parameters such
      as temperature, relative humidity, wind, water flow, and water
      levels can be linked to a computer or manual control (not shown)
      to provide for precise control over the refrigeration process.
      This will allow the temperature of the condensation member to be
      changed in response to changing conditions to optimize
      condensation and conserve energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] It is not necessary (or practical) to remove all moisture
      from a given volume of treated air, i.e., by reducing the
      temperature to the point where virtually no moisture remains.
      Also, because of the relatively short time that the moist air will
      be in the air passage where it can be cooled, it is more practical
      to reduce air temperature by no more than a few tens of degrees.
      For instance, Table 1 above shows the significant amounts of water
      that may be condensed from water vapor while still leaving
      substantial amounts of water vapor in the moist air. Thus, the
      temperature of the condensation panel should not be kept too cold,
      as this will waste energy due to diminishing returns.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Moisture-laden air may be moved through the airway 120
      either by gravity or by propulsion, for instance by fans. In
      particular, depending on the amount of moisture removed from the
      air and the temperature of the air in the airway following removal
      of that moisture, the air may be either more or less dense than
      the surrounding, ambient moist air. As a result, the treated air
      may move automatically either up or down in the inclined air
      passage due to such density differences. Such natural airflow is
      not, however, as dependable as forced airflow where a constant
      airflow is desired. Thus, small air-thrusters may be used to
      propel the air regardless of the density contrast with ambient
      moist air.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] An ideal application for an array of panels is for use as a
      roof. Using arrays of panels on roofs of buildings provides a
      number of benefits over a conventional roof and conventional water
      and electricity provision. A roof comprised largely of an array of
      autonomous water harvesting panels will be strong and provide
      shelter, electricity, and water all at the same time and as part
      of the same investment.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] An example of a thruster assembly for use where water
      harvesters are part of a peaked roof is shown in FIG. 7. An upper
      shroud assembly 208 with screened outlets is located above the
      apex of two harvesters such as would be found in a peaked roof.
      The thruster assembly consists of a metal or plastic shroud
      assembly that covers the top of the harvesters. Air A drawn into
      the lower end 124 of a water harvester passes through the air
      passages and out the top end 122 of the air passage and then
      upward through fan assembly 215.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The shroud 208 keeps rainwater and other material from
      falling into the interior spaces and air passages. In addition,
      the shroud supports the fan assembly 215. Although the fans are
      illustrated in FIG. 8 as being held in a vertical orientation in
      the fan assembly 215, with fan motors 220 mounted on the lower
      side of the fan assembly 215, a number of different orientations
      for the fans are possible. Fan blades 217 propel the air A while
      operating, and when the fans are not operating, the air passages
      ventilate naturally. A downward-facing air exit gap 222 (FIG. 7)
      is screened, similarly to the screening at the lower entry to the
      air passage 205 and for the same reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In another configuration (not shown), instead of exhausting
      the cooled air directly into the surrounding air mass from the
      shrouded hood at the apex as shown in FIG. 7, the air may be
      ducted through an insulated air pipe that carries the chilled air
      away from the air gathering assembly. This chilled air may be
      used, for instance, as input into an air conditioning system.
      Although the air within an air conditioning system tends to be
      mainly recirculated within the air conditioned space, it is good
      practice for health reasons and to keep the oxygen levels normal
      to introduce outside air during air conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Water harvesting apparatus according to the invention is
      designed for strength, reliability, and durability as well as for
      optimum photovoltaic and water condensation. Individual autonomous
      atmospheric water harvesters may be free-standing, but they are
      more likely to be deployed as groups or arrays of water
      harvesters. Harvesters and arrays of harvesters operate in a
      passive mode in that they can be deployed for continued use
      without excessive maintenance or control. Each array may be
      autonomous with respect to its operation in that it produces at
      least the electrical energy that it requires to produce condensed
      water. Where the electricity that is generated by the photovoltaic
      members exceeds that required to operate the harvesters, the
      energy may be put into an existing electrical grid for use
      elsewhere or from which the harvesters can be powered later, when
      they are not producing electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] An example of the relationship between electricity that can
      be generated photovoltaically and the relative amount of water
      that may be condensed can be derived for any location. Two
      examples of the electricity and water production at typical high
      solar insolation locations at which atmospheric water harvesting
      is practical have been calculated (taking into account the
      efficiencies of the photovoltaic members, the heat energy of
      condensation, and well known efficiency and energy consumption of
      conventional refrigeration) and are shown in Table 2.<br>

      [0063] Electricity generation and water production based on a 1.0
      kW photovoltaic system. This system uses (10) 100 Watt modules for
      a total area of 100 ft2. Site No. 1-Guam: Latitude=13.550 N,
      Longitude=144.830 W. Site No. 2-Hilo, Hawaii: Latitude=19.720 N,
      Longitude=155.070 W. DOE/NREL PVWATTS computer model (2000) was
      used to calculate a first approximation of electric energy
      production; the solar insulation data for the two sites are
      included in the model's database. Energy cost: 2,400 Watts/Gal for
      water production (600 Wh/Qt=632 Wh/L). Actual water production
      will be lower depending on efficiencies of particular systems.
      Water saturated air is assumed (See Table 1 for effect of
      undersaturation during chilling).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] When these calculations are extrapolated to a larger array,
      for instance as might be used to cover the roof of buildings, the
      amount of water that could be produced could be significant. Given
      a panel array surface of, for instance, 1,000 square feet, or
      about the size of the roof of a bungalow that would be occupied by
      a single family, about 40 kVh of electricity can be produced each
      day in each of the locations represented in Table 2 and in other
      regions having similar relative humidity and air temperatures.
      Integrated high quality water and electricity production using the
      integrated water harvester concept will have the greatest impact
      where population is widely scattered, and infrastructure for both
      water and electricity production is poor.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Another preferred embodiment of atmospheric water
      harvesters is as small, portable, self-powered, stand-alone units.
      These are for use where relatively small amounts of at least
      sustenance levels of high quality potable water are required
      and/or where the time to install water harvester units for water
      production can be very short, such as immediately following a
      natural disaster. Emergency supplies of potable water are almost
      always a priority immediately following typhoon, hurricane,
      earthquake, some terrorist activities, etc., (i.e., following
      natural or man-made disasters), where water and electrical systems
      are rendered unusable, often for substantial periods or time. For
      instance, typhoons affecting the American island possessions in
      the Southwest Pacific Ocean in 2002 created immediate need for
      potable water, which was only met by supplying bottled water by
      air freight in the near-term. Because bottled water is suitable
      for only one-time use as drinking water, the water to meet the
      disaster relief situation has to be flown or shipped in for often
      considerable periods of time. Waste bottles also create a waste or
      pollution issue, especially in a fragile environment such as an
      oceanic island.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In emergency situations, the amounts of water used to
      sustain human life can be much smaller than normal water use. The
      U.S. Department of Defense, for instance, recommends 1-3 gallons
      of water per soldier per day, but accepts 1 gal/day per person as
      a minimum in constrained circumstances. This provides a rough
      guide to the minimum water production required for atmospheric
      water harvesters used in a disaster relief situation<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Portable water harvesters according to the invention are
      unitary and self-contained apparatus in that they contain the
      means to produce electrical energy and means to extract water from
      the air using this energy, They have a maximum of integral
      controls and are designed to be simply deployed so that they
      automatically extract atmospheric moisture and produce potable
      water in an efficient manner. As illustrated in FIG. 9,
      stand-alone water harvesters 300 consist of a case or housing 303
      which, in a preferred embodiment, is molded high impact plastic or
      other material which has been designed specifically for strength,
      light weight, and durability and which forms the frame within and
      upon which all other components of the apparatus and its supports
      and connections are fixed. The case is special also with respect
      to its stand-alone nature and the requirements for operating in a
      variety of conditions. This embodiment is shown with its long axis
      parallel to the ground, but other embodiments may stand with their
      long axis vertical. Other embodiments may be more equi-dimensional
      or proportioned differently where either weather conditions or
      other physical constraints (such as a maximum size to suit
      deployment in restricted spaces) may be important.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] This portable water harvester is preferably employed in an
      upright or slightly inclined position, so no provision for
      collection of rainwater is made. The sole purpose of the apparatus
      is to produce potable water by extracting atmospheric moisture.
      The water harvester is meant to be located so that its front (i.e,
      the side visible in FIG. 9) always faces generally sunward.
      Consequently, the rear of the apparatus will be shaded to some
      extent. The water harvester may be moved and tilted during the day
      in order to allow its front to face the sun more directly. Easily
      and quickly attachable feet or props to hold the apparatus in an
      upright or inclined position, e.g., steel wire braces 305 and
      their receiving holes 306 formed in the case 303, are provided so
      that setup of the apparatus on even, uneven, or sloping ground is
      facilitated. Ring eyelets 308 are provided in the upper part of
      the apparatus to allow lines to be attached to each end or the top
      of a free-standing water harvester to further secure it in an
      upright position.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Energy for the operation of the portable water harvester is
      provided by photovoltaic panels 310 supplied with the water
      harvester. A primary design aim is that the power required to
      produce a certain quantity of water (which can be different from
      place to place or for different electricity requirements) is
      produced by the apparatus. External power may be used, but it is
      not required. These photovoltaic panels may be integral with the
      case 303 and folding and affixed to the front of the water
      harvester case, e.g., by hinges as shown; flexible panels fixed to
      the case (not illustrated); or free-standing from the case and
      connected by wire (not illustrated). Additional photovoltaic
      panels may be located on the front face of the case, but they are
      not shown in FIG. 9 since front face access panels by means of
      which access is gained to the interior of the water harvester are
      not shown (i.e., as if removed from the water harvester unit) in
      FIG. 9 for better illustration of internal components. Both
      integral and free-standing photovoltaic panels may be employed
      simultaneously. Where photovoltaic panels optimized for use with
      water harvesters are not integral parts of the structure of the
      water harvester, they are also supplied along with the water
      harvester.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Where no provision is made for storage of electricity, or
      where no other source of electricity is available, electricity
      generation and water production are carried out only during the
      day. Where other sources of electricity are available, or where it
      is desirable to produce additional electricity to be stored rather
      than to use all of the electricity produced by the supplied
      photovoltaics for just extraction of water, sockets 315 for power
      output and power sensors and regulators (not shown) are provided
      for electrical connection and are located in the electrical and
      control housing 324 Power input connectors 319 are also provided,
      e.g., for use where other sources of power are available. Where
      other sources of power are available, this will allow operation of
      the apparatus during those times of the diurnal cycle when the
      relative humidity is high but sufficient sunlight may not be
      available to provide the required amounts of electrical energy.
      This housing 324 also contains computer control apparatus that
      apportions energy from any source and regulates moisture
      extraction according to predetermined algorithms embedded in a
      micro-controller. Provision exists for rapid replacement of
      controller (ROM chips) so that water harvesters can be
      reprogrammed easily for different areas that have different
      sunlight and atmospheric conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In one configuration, variable speed fans 328 are provided
      at the upper rear of the case 303, in a cut-out portion 330, and
      draw air into the apparatus from the rear, shaded area of the case
      at a rate determined by the controller. These air intakes may be
      screened (not shown) to keep out insects and dust. The relative
      humidity of the cooler air from the shaded side of the apparatus
      is likely to be higher than warmed air from the front, sunny side
      of the water harvester. The ideal or operational aim for air flow
      (i.e., the optimal flow rate) is to only ingest as much air as can
      be fully chilled over a particular time, so that excess air is not
      chilled and so that all the air that is passed through the
      apparatus is chilled only to the extent necessary to produce a
      desired amount of water. Thus, minimal power is required to
      maintain the optimal airflow, even where conditions such as air
      temperature, relative humidity, and available power change, as
      they naturally do during diurnal cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The air is brought by the fans into the air equilibration
      chamber 331 in order to allow the air to be spread uniformly along
      the top, and then through an air diffuser 332, which allows
      uniform air flow through the separated airways below. The diffuser
      can be a coarse porous material or a metal or plastic strip which
      has slits or holes 322 (indicated by dashes in its upper surface
      on FIG. 9) through which the air can pass. The air (arrows) then
      passes downward through airways 338 formed between condensation
      panels 341 (three of which are shown, for illustration), where the
      air is chilled. Condensation thus forms on the condensation panels
      341. (Theoretically, a single panel 341 could be used, with
      airways formed between the single panel 341 and the walls of the
      case 303.) The air is then exhausted to the side and front of the
      case through an exhaust 344 that is smaller than the air intakes,
      which causes the exhaust speed of the air to be greater than the
      intake speed of the air so that the exhaust can be deflected away
      from the rear of the case, where the air intakes are placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Alternatively, in another configuration, a fan assembly
      having one or more fan motors located inside the case near the
      exhaust port blow air out through the exhaust port, thus causing
      air to flow into the case through air intakes located at the upper
      rear portion of the case. This lay-out permits the air intakes to
      be narrow slits and the air space in the air equilibration chamber
      above the diffuser to be narrower so that a larger surface area
      coverage of condenser plate assemblies can be fitted within the
      case.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In yet another configuration, fans for moving air can be
      placed at any point, and the air is preferably caused to move
      upwardly from the lower part of the apparatus through the airways
      bounded by condensation surfaces. This has the advantage of
      exposing the most highly saturated air to the lower part of the
      condensation panels, from where condensed water may collect and
      flow immeditely into the water collector and minimize its flow
      down the collector panels. Rapid collection of the condensed water
      will remove it from the airstream quickly and will preclude minor
      reabsorbtion of the water by the air where slight temperature and
      humidity variations may develop in the airways.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Where heat is produced as a byproduct of the refrigeration
      system, this heat has to be dissipated. Regardless of the
      locations of the motive electrically driven fans 328 in this
      preferred mode of operation, chilled air (arrows) that moves
      through the airways 338 and across the condensation panels 341 is
      then used to cool the heat exchangers of the electrically driven
      compressors or other refrigeration apparatus 348 in order to
      enhance the overall thermodynamics and performance. Because the
      air that has been chilled and subjected to water condensation will
      be cooler than the ambient air outside the apparatus, the overall
      efficiency of the condenser/refrigerator system is enhanced by
      passing this chilled air over heat exchangers that will more
      efficiently remove the heat than would be the case if the air were
      not chilled. Because the condensed water will also be cooled and
      removed from the water harvester, however, additional cooling air
      will need to be drawn from outside the apparatus and passed
      through a small but efficient heat exchanger (not shown, hidden by
      electrical and control box 324).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Chilled water is produced by condensation on condensation
      panels 341, which are optimized for light weight, durability, and
      performance. These are single- or double-sided and are spaced to
      form airways between the panels that are optimized for a
      relatively low volume of input air. Water that condenses on the
      panels 341 flows under the effect of gravity down the condensation
      surfaces and is collected in an integral water collector 351 in
      the base of the apparatus. This water collector is a small tank
      from which water is drained from the apparatus to water storage
      apparatus outside of the water harvester through a drain 354. The
      surface of the condensation panels are coated with hydrophobic and
      hydrophyllic materials that promote condensation (causing water to
      condense) and to then bead up and flow along the surfaces. A water
      deflector 362, which is placed over components in the lower part
      of the apparatus to shelter them from the dripping condensed
      water, allows water from the overhead condensation panels to flow
      into the water collector 351.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Portable water harvesters may be specially optimized for
      disaster relief situations. In this embodiment of the portable
      water harvester, it is designed to have a long shelf life so that
      they can be stored for considerable periods of time without
      significant deterioration prior to rapid deployment. They are
      sized to meet storage and emergency air transport requirements and
      are designed and packaged to provide for local deployment under
      primitive conditions where this may be done by hand over rough
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Portable atmospheric water harvesters can also provide
      substantial water under conditions where the use of the water is
      periodic. The production of water is semi-continuous, within the
      diurnal cycle, while use of the water may take place over shorter
      periods of time. A water harvester that produces water over the
      period of a week but where the demand for water is possibly for
      only a few hours of a few days, for instance, will result in
      quantities of water well above the subsistence level for the
      periods of time over which the water is required.<br>
