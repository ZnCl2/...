      </big></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The ISAAC Solar Icemaker</span>
      is an Intermittent Solar Ammonia-water Absorption Cycle. The ISAAC
      uses a parabolic trough solar collector and a compact and
      efficient design to produce ice with no fuel or electric input,
      and with no moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      The ISAAC Solar Icemaker operates in two modes. During the day,
      solar energy is used to generate liquid ammonia refrigerant.
      During the night, the generator is cooled by a thermosyphon and
      ice is formed in the evaporator compartment as ammonia is
      reabsorbed to the generator.<br>
      <br>
      The daily ice production of the ISAAC is about 5 kg per square
      meter of collector, per sunny day. The construction of the ISAAC
      Solar Icemaker involves only welding, piping and sheet metal work,
      and there are no expensive materials. It is estimated that, when
      produced in-country where wages are low and transportation costs
      can be minimized, the 11 square meter<br>
      ISAAC can be produced for less than $7,000. When produced
      in-country, the creation of urban employment is an additional
      advantage of ISAAC technology.<br>
      <br>
      The characteristics of the ISAAC which make it particularly well
      suited to provide refrigeration to unelectrified rural communities
      are:<br>
      <br>
      1. It is solar thermally powered, avoiding expensive diesel fuel
      or photovoltaics.<br>
      2. Low cost construction requires only welding, piping and sheet
      metal work.<br>
      3. Very low maintenance.<br>
      4. The quantity of ice is sufficient to support small scale
      businesses while maintaining sustainability in fragile
      environments, or provide low cost household refrigeration.<br>
      <br>
      The ISAAC design was developed by Energy Concepts Company. Over
      forty systems have been built and twenty installed in seven
      countries. The ISAAC is on display in Annapolis, Maryland and at
      Sandia National Lab, Albuquerque, New Mexico. ISAAC is now being
      distributed and commercialized by Solar Ice Co.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Providing Jobs to Remote
        Communities - By Providing Ice</span><br>
      <br>
      The ISAAC Solar Icemaker makes enough ice at low cost to support
      many small scale businesses in rural unelectrified areas.
      Enterprises using ISAAC will be environmentally sustainable
      because no fuel is required. They will be economically sustainable
      because the cost of producing the ice by the ISAAC is sufficiently
      less than the value of the ice that it can easily be recovered by
      a micro-enterprise.<br>
      <br>
      Ice is of major economic importance. In rural communities of
      developing countries, there is frequently a shortage of ice to
      support business activities. The result is loss of revenue, jobs,
      and substantial food spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      Three important community needs for electricity are:<br>
      <br>
      * lights<br>
      * communications and entertainment<br>
      * refrigeration.<br>
      <br>
      Lights, communication and entertainment require modest amounts of
      electricity and are affordable even at the high cost of
      electricity from emergency generators, diesel mini-grids or
      photovoltaics.<br>
      <br>
      When refrigeration is needed also, the amount of electricity
      required from the power system increases drastically. Thus it is
      usually omitted to keep costs down. An ISAAC Solar Icemaker
      supplies refrigeration without the intermediary step of
      electricity and at a much lower cost. Thus ISAAC Solar Icemakers,
      in combination with mini-grids and/or photovoltaics, are a good
      method of supplying remote community needs.<br>
      <br>
      For example, ISAAC can provide domestic refrigeration. An ISAAC
      produces six blocks of ice each day, weighing ten kilograms each.
      If an icebox requires five kilograms of ice per day to stay cool,
      then one ISAAC will be able to supply domestic refrigeration to
      twelve households. The cost of a standard electric refrigerator,
      plus the constant requirement of expensive electricity, would be
      much higher.<br>
      <p class="header"><b>The Absorption Process</b></p>
      <!-- START EDIT -->
      <p class="text">The Absorption Cycle was invented in 1846 by
        Ferdinand Carré for the purpose of producing ice with heat
        input. It is based on the principle that absorbing ammonia in
        water causes the vapor pressure to decrease. Absorption cycles
        produce cooling and/or heating with thermal input and minimal
        electric input, by using heat and mass exchangers, pumps and
        valves. </p>
      <p class="text">An absorption cycle can be viewed as a mechanical
        vapor-compression cycle, with the compressor replaced by a
        generator, absorber and liquid pump. The absorption cycle enjoys
        the benefits of requiring a fraction of the electrical input,
        plus uses the natural substances ammonia and water, instead of
        ozone depleting halocarbons. The absorption cycle enjoyed
        widespread use from the 1920’s as gas powered
        refrigerators/ice-makers.</p>
      <p class="text">The basic operation of an ammonia-water absorption
        cycle is as follows. Heat is applied to the generator, which
        contains a solution of ammonia water, rich in ammonia. The heat
        causes high pressure ammonia vapor to desorb the solution. Heat
        can either be from combustion of a fuel such as clean-burning
        natural gas, or waste heat from engine exhaust, other industrial
        processes, solar heat, or any other heat source. The high
        pressure ammonia vapor flows to a condenser, typically cooled by
        outdoor air. The ammonia vapor condenses into a high pressure
        liquid, releasing heat which can be used for product heat, such
        as space heating. </p>
      <p class="text">The high pressure ammonia liquid goes through a
        restriction, to the low pressure side of the cycle. This liquid,
        at low pressures, boils or evaporates in the evaporator. This
        provides the cooling or refrigeration product. The low pressure
        vapor flows to the absorber, which contains a water-rich
        solution obtained from the generator. This solution absorbs the
        ammonia while releasing the heat of absorption. This heat can be
        used as product heat, or for internal heat recovery in other
        parts of the cycle, thus unloading the burner and increasing
        cycle efficiency. The solution in the absorber, now once again
        rich in ammonia, is pumped to the generator, where it is ready
        to repeat the cycle. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="text">An absorption cycle can use a variety of working
        pairs. The working pair is made up of a refrigerant, typically
        ammonia or water; and a solution which absorbs the refrigerant.
        Other working pairs include lithium-bromide-water;
        TriDroxide-water; and Alkitrate-water. Tridroxide and Alkitrate
        are Energy Concepts patented working pairs with specialty
        applications in industry.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="text">Absorption cycles can operate at high efficiency
        by utilizing advanced cycles, using generator-absorber heat
        exchange, multiple pressures, and multiple effects. These cycles
        use extensive internal heat recovery to require less prime fuel
        input to produce the same thermal output. High efficiency
        operation, plus benefits of environmentally friendly
        refrigerants, clean-burning fuels, and few moving parts
        requiring maintenance make absorption a very good choice for
        consumers.<br>
      </p>
      Absorption cycles can produce a variety of thermal outputs. In
      common commercial use today are gas-fired absorption chillers,
      which produce chilled water for space cooling applications. The
      absorption cycle can produce low temperature cooling for ice
      production or cold storage. Turbine inlet cooling is a very
      efficient use of absorption cooling, boosting turbine efficiency
      by up to 15%. Many other applications exist in industry, where
      waste heat is available and cooling is required. Advanced cycles
      can also produce electrical or shaft power by producing steam or
      high pressure vapor to power a turbine/generator pair.<br>

      <!-- START EDIT --> <span class="text">The ThermoSorber™ is a
        gas-fired heat pump which supplies air conditioning or
        refrigeration at the cold end, and which uses all the reject
        heat (gas heat plus cooling duty ) to heat hot water. The high
        temperature glide achieved with the GAX absorption cycle makes
        it possible to heat hot water to 160°F, thus meeting the needs
        of commercial users. The hot water is normally the primary
        product, with the cooling in a supplementary role. This ensures
        high year round utilization and short paybacks. This appliance

      trisorption modules, each of which contains at least two solid
      sorbents, are free of pumps, valves, restrictors, or any similar
      devices for flow control of refrigerant or sorbent. The apparatus
      contains no moving parts beyond a small number of control and
      motive devices for the heat transfer fluids. The preferred
      refrigerant is ammonia and the preferred sorbents are the solid
      type with monovariant equilibrium, e.g., BaCl2, SrCl2, CaCl2,
      MnCl2, FeCl2 and SrBr2. The apparatus is preferably adapted for
      residential or small-scale commercial space-conditioning
      applications, and operates at double-effect efficiency in both the
      heating and cooling modes without inter-module heat transfer. <br>

      sorption cycles with fixed heat supply and removal and comprised
      of a generator/absorber (4), a condenser (2), and a
      receiver/evaporator (10) are adapted and simplified so as to
      require at most only two control valves (8) and (15) for their
      operation. With an integral thermosyphon (6) for absorption heat
      removal, only a single refrigerant charge is necessary. The two

      valve, and key gravity drains (14) and (17) are provided.
      Applications include hot water heating, solar refrigeration, and

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A
      triple-effect cycle is disclosed which avoids the two primary
      limitations of currently known triple-effect cycles:
      super-atmospheric pressures and/or low pressure absorbers that
      operate without mass transfer enhancers. The cycle is comprised of
      two hermetic loops-one a conventional LiBr double-effect loop, and
      the other a single-effect loop which overlaps the high pressure
      portion of the double-effect loop, and exchanges heat with it at
      three locations. Referring to FIG. 3, the latent heat exchanges
      are with absorber 302, condenser 304, and evaporator 305 of the
      single-effect loop. Sensible heat losses are reduced by
      incorporating inter-loop condensate-to-solution sensible heat
      exchanger 314. The inter-loop CSSHX also applies to other
      triple-effect cycles. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The absorption
      step of a continuous absorption cycle apparatus (refrigerator or
      heat pump) is externally cooled by an air-cooled thermosyphon
      having hot end 107 (FIG. 1), air-cooled end 115, and reservoir
      123. The absorption step is further recuperatively cooled by
      internal fluids, in absorber heat exchanger 108 and/or GAX 109.
      Thus the absorber is highly compact and the cycle is highly
      efficient. A hotter hermetic thermosyphon can advantageously
      supply additional cooling. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A sorber for
      sorbing a vapor into (absorber) or out of (desorber) a liquid
      sorbent comprised of a sequential plurality of highly effective
      and intensified locally cocurrent sorptions, but with
      non-cocurrent flow of vapor and liquid between the individual
      sorptions. The structure containing the locally cocurrent upflow
      is preferably comprised of enhanced heat transfer surface, making
      the sorption diabatic, further enhancing the intensification, and
      improving the sorption efficiency. Referring to FIG. 12 , vertical
      cylinders (70) and (71) form an annular space within which
      desorption occurs, powered by external heat source (72) and
      internal heat recuperation (77). The liquid portion of the annulus
      is divided into multiple compartments by folded rectangular fin
      (73). The space above fin (73) allows pressure equalization of all
      compartments. Each compartment is divided by insert (80) into
      separate vapor-liquid riser channels and a liquid downcomer
      channel. The sorbent liquid flow sequentially through the
      compartments via flow ports (74). The same high effectiveness
      sequential liquid recirculating cocurrent upflow desorption can
      also be accomplished in a horizontal cylindrical annulus, in plate
      fin exchangers, and in other geometries. <br>

      vapor-liquid contact device is disclosed which achieves high heat
      transfer effectiveness without sacrificing mass transfer
      effectiveness. Referring to FIG. 2, a helical coil of crested
      tubing 84 is contained within the annualr space between shrouds 82
      and 83. Liquid flows downward through the annulus, and vapor flows
      countercurrently upward. The mass exchanging fluids pass through
      the space between tube crests and the shroud, achieving very
      effective mixing. Heat transfer fluid is flowed through the tubing
      via connections 87 and 88. The heat and mass transfer is
      preferably additionally enhanced by interspersing contact media
      with the coiled tubing, either longitudinally or radially. <br>
