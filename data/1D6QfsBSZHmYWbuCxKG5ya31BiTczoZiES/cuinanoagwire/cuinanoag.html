      <br>
      By wearing clothes that have been dip-coated in a silver nanowire
      (AgNW) solution that is highly radiation-insulating, a person may
      stay so warm in the winter that&nbsp; they can greatly reduce or
      even eliminate their need for heating their home. Considering that
      47% of global energy is spent on indoor heating, and 42% of that
      specifically for residential heating, such highly insulating
      clothing could potentially have huge cost savings.<br>
      <br>
      A team of researchers led by Professor Yi Cui, along with PhD
      student Po-Chun Hsu and others at Stanford University, have
      published a paper on the AgNW-coated textiles in a recent issue of
      Nano Letters.<br>
      <br>
      As the researchers explain, most strategies to reduce indoor
      heating focus on improving the insulation of the buildings, such
      as by using high R-value insulation and low-emissivity windows.
      However, a large portion of the energy is still wasted on heating
      empty space and inanimate objects<br>
      <br>
      To avoid this waste, the researchers have used a new strategy
      called "personal thermal management," which focuses on heating
      people. They've demonstrated that clothing dipped in a solution of
      metallic nanowires, such as AgNWs, achieves this goal by both
      providing passive insulation and allowing for active heating when
      connected to an external power source.<br>
      <br>
      The main advantage of the AgNW-coated clothing is that it reflects
      over 90% of an individual's body heat (i.e., infrared radiation)
      back to the individual. This reflectance is much higher than even
      the warmest wool sweater, as the average clothing material
      reflects back only about 20% of body heat.<br>
      <br>
      This increase in reflectance is due to differences in the
      materials' emissivity, which is a measure of heat radiation.
      Low-emissivity materials like silver, which has an emissivity of
      0.02, emit less radiation and so provide much better insulation
      than high-emissivity materials like common textiles, which have an
      emissivity of about 0.8.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, wearing clothing made completely of silver would be
      impractical and uncomfortable, not to mention expensive. A main
      reason for this discomfort is that silver, like all metals, is not
      breathable. For example, Mylar blankets, which are made of
      aluminum and plastic, are extremely warm but are not
      vapor-permeable, causing moisture to accumulate on a person's
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      The new AgNW-coated clothing, on the other hand, is breathable due
      to the nanowires' porous structure. The large spacing between
      nanowires of about 300 nm offers plenty of room for water vapor
      molecules, which are about 0.2 nm, to pass through. The 300-nm
      spacing is still much too small to allow body heat to pass
      through, since human body radiation has a wavelength of about 9 µm
      and so interacts with the nanowire cloth as if it were a
      continuous metal film, and is reflected.<br>
      <br>
      Clothing coated in AgNWs would feel virtually identical to normal
      clothing because such a small amount of AgNW solution is required
      to achieve high reflectivity. Dip-coating cotton cloth into the
      AgNW solution adds a mass of just 0.1 g/m2, which would be less
      than 1 gram for an entire outfit. Only a small fraction of this
      mass is silver, so the cost would be relatively inexpensive. Using
      other metals such as copper, nickel, or aluminum, which have
      similar properties as silver, could further reduce costs.<br>
      <br>
      Besides providing high levels of passive insulation, AgNW-coated
      clothing can also provide Joule heating if connected to an
      electricity source, such as a battery. The researchers
      demonstrated that as little as 0.9 V can safely raise clothing
      temperature to 38 °C, which is 1 °C higher than the human body
      temperature of 37 °C.<br>
      <br>
      Variables such as outdoor temperature, length of the winter
      season, and home size make it difficult to calculate exactly how
      much energy a person would save by wearing AgNW-coated clothing.
      However, the researchers have calculated a rough savings estimate
      of 8.5 kWh of heating energy per person per day, or 1,000 kWh per
      year assuming that the heating system operates for four months per
      year. This estimate is based on the average person requiring 367 W
      of heating power, compared with 12 W required by the AgNW-coating
      clothing when actively operating.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers note that a 1,000 kWh savings in power consumption
      is equivalent to the power generated by a 2-square-meter solar
      panel. Plus, fabrication, installation, and maintenance of the
      solar panel would likely cost much more than the AgNW-coated
      clothing.<br>

      clothing.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also fabricated and tested clothing coated in a
      carbon nanotube solution. However, although carbon nanotubes are
      conductive and therefore suitable for Joule heating, their high
      emissivity of 0.98 does not enable them to reflect body heat
      nearly as well as the AgNW coating.<br>

      Heating consumes large amount of energy and is a primary source of
      greenhouse gas emission. Although energy-efficient buildings are
      developing quickly based on improving insulation and design, a
      large portion of energy continues to be wasted on heating empty
      space and nonhuman objects. Here, we demonstrate a system of
      personal thermal management using metallic nanowire-embedded cloth
      that can reduce this waste. The metallic nanowires form a
      conductive network that not only is highly thermal insulating
      because it reflects human body infrared radiation but also allows
      Joule heating to complement the passive insulation. The
      breathability and durability of the original cloth is not
      sacrificed because of the nanowires’ porous structure. This
      nanowire cloth can efficiently warm human bodies and save hundreds
      of watts per person as compared to traditional indoor heaters.<br>

            warm — without heating everything else</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      To stay warm when temperatures drop outside, we heat our indoor
      spaces—even when no one is in them. But scientists have now
      developed a novel nanowire coating for clothes that can both
      generate heat and trap the heat from our bodies better than
      regular clothes. They report on their technology, which could help
      us reduce our reliance on conventional energy sources, in the ACS
      journal Nano Letters.<br>
      <br>
      Yi Cui and colleagues note that nearly half of global energy
      consumption goes toward heating buildings and homes. But this
      comfort comes with a considerable environmental cost - it's
      responsible for up to a third of the world's total greenhouse gas
      emissions. Scientists and policymakers have tried to reduce the
      impact of indoor heating by improving insulation and construction
      materials to keep fuel-generated warmth inside. Cui's team wanted
      to take a different approach and focus on people rather than
      spaces.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers developed lightweight, breathable mesh materials
      that are flexible enough to coat normal clothes. When compared to
      regular clothing material, the special nanowire cloth trapped body
      heat far more effectively. Because the coatings are made out of
      conductive materials, they can also be actively warmed with an
      electricity source to further crank up the heat. The researchers
      calculated that their thermal textiles could save about 1,000
      kilowatt hours per person every year — that's about how much
      electricity an average U.S. home consumes in one month.<br>
