      </center>
      <p>Three hundred miles on a gallon of oil -- 10 times the mileage
        possible for the usual present-day motor! </p>
      <p>Such is the astounding record claimed for a crude-oil engine
        developed by Harry H. Elmer, of Syracuse NY for use in
        automobiles, airplanes, ships, and lighting systems. In
        experiments, the engine has generated sufficient power to run a
        battery of 18 incandescent lamps on 1-1/4 pints of oil, costing
        less than a cent. </p>
      <p>Because this mechanical marvel does not require a cooling
        system, government officials, it is reported, are studying the
        possibility of its use in dirigibles. </p>
      <p>Among more than 300 radically new features claims for the
        engine, the most important are these: </p>
      <p>It contains only 64 parts and has only three adjustments. </p>
      <p>It has no spark, carburetor, wiring, nor any sort of ignition.
      </p>
      <p>The cylinder has a bore of 3-3/4 inches and a 6-inch stroke,
        yet the engine, it is said, has developed 200% more power than
        internal combustion engines of the same size, and will pick up
        almost instantaneously from 100 to 2800 revolutions a minute. </p>
      <p><b>How the Motor Operates ~</b> </p>
      <p>The new engine is described as a 4-cycle motor, the cycles
        being suction, combustion, expansion, and exhaust. The crude oil
        is led through needle valves into mechanism, where it is
        compressed by the upward stroke of the piston. On compression
        the oil is "cracked" by chemical process and the expansion of
        gases takes place. As the piston is forced down, the exhaust
        port is opened, and the incoming charge forces out the expanded
        gases </p>
      <p>There is no combustion in the cylinder, though hydrocarbon gas,
        escaping the exhaust, explodes on uniting with atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The engine has been operated with equal success on mineral,
        animal, and vegetable oils. </p>

      <p>This method of operating internal combustion engine comprises
        generally, filling into the engine cylinder a combustion
        supporting atmosphere. Compressing a combustion gas above the
        pressure of such compressed atmosphere, raising the temperature
        of the fuel at or above the ignition point thereof, and
        injecting the gas thus formed into said atmosphere, so that the
        gas burns in the compressed combustion supporting atmosphere and
        hence develops the power for operating the engine. </p>
      <p>The method may further comprise vaporizing or atomizing
        additional fuel in the combustion supporting atmosphere, that
        is, carburizing the atmosphere, which fuel is ignited and burns
        by the burning of the combustible fuel injected into the
        compressed atmosphere within the cylinder and hence boosts or
        increases the power of the engine. </p>
      <p>More specifically, the method consists in compressing a liquid
        fuel in a confined chamber communicating through a jet opening
        into the cylinder, compressing the fuel in such chamber by the
        compression of the compression of the combustion supporting
        atmosphere in the cylinder under the influence of the piston
        during the compression stroke, until under such pressure and the
        heat generated, the fuel in the confined chamber, vaporizes and
        the pressure generated therein is greater than the pressure of
        the combustion supporting atmosphere so that the gasified fuel
        jets into such atmosphere and burns therein. After the engine is
        started the liquid fuel is volatilized in the generator chamber
        by the heat of the cylinder walls and its pressure increased
        above the pressure in the cylinder, so that it jets into the
        cylinder and burns in the air therein. Hence this method of
        operating the internal combustion engines such as here
        illustrated, in its entirety, comprises volatilizing the liquid
        fuel by heating the same in the confined chamber by heat
        generated during the operation of the engine thereby raising the
        temperature of the volatilized fuel and raising the pressure of
        the same, subjecting, through the jet opening communicating with
        the cylinder, the volatilized fuel in such chamber to the
        compression of a combustion supporting atmosphere within the
        engine cylinder during the compression stroke of the piston and
        thus additionally raising the temperature and pressure of the
        same above the pressure of such atmosphere and thereby causing
        the volatile fuel to jet into and burn in the compressed
        atmosphere in the cylinder and also causing the fuel in such
        atmosphere to burn. </p>
      <p>The engine here illustrated is of the four cycle type and
        comprises the cylinder 1, the piston 2 movable in the cylinder
        and connected in the usual manner by a connecting rod 3 to the
        crank shaft 4. The crank shaft operates cams through gears 6 and
        7, 8 and 9 are the cams on the cam shaft, they being shown as
        mounted on a stud 5. </p>
      <p>The cylinder here shown is provided with a detachable head
        block 10 which is formed with an air inlet passage 11 which
        follows a circuitous course and loops around the exhaust port,
        and acts to cool the exhaust and also to heat the incoming air
        or the incoming air containing the atomized fuel. The circuitous
        inlet also sufficiently cools the head block which is unprovided
        with a water jacket. </p>
      <p>The cylinder wall is provided with a water jacket 17 which
        opens at 18 through the top of such wall, and the head 10 closes
        the upper open end of the water jacket 17 so that the water
        washes against the underside of the margin of the head. </p>
      <p>The water is taken into the jacket at 19 at the lower end of
        one side thereof, and the jacket is provided with a lengthwise
        extending conduit 20, Figs. 1 and 3 here shown as cast integral
        therewith, this conduit terminating near the top of the jacket
        and communicating at its lower end with an outlet pipe 21 on the
        other side of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The head 10 is secured in position by screws as screws 22
        extending through the head, and threading into threaded passages
        23 in the cylinder. </p>
      <p>24 designates the confined fuel generating chamber which
        communicates through the jet opening 25 with the compression
        chamber of he cylinder, this generator chamber 24 being located
        in the wall or the head of the cylinder between the inner and
        outer faces of such wall or head so that the fuel in the chamber
        is volatilized by the heat held in the cylinder walls or
        associated parts. The generator chamber is here shown as formed
        in the exhaust valve 26 located in the exhaust port 16, although
        such chamber must be formed independently of the exhaust valve.
        By locating the generator chamber in the exhaust valve, it can
        be heated to a maximum extent and the cylinder head cooled to
        the necessary degree without cooling the generator materially. </p>
      <p>27 is a fuel valve for controlling the flow of the liquid fuel
        into the generating chamber 24. Preferably, the exhaust valve 26
        and the fuel valve 27 are arranged concentric with each other,
        the exhaust valve 26 having a tubular stem 28 extending upwardly
        from the generating chamber 24 through the head or a suitable
        bushing 29, and having a collar 30 near its upper end which
        constitutes an abutement for a spring 31 located on a bushing
        for holding the exhaust valve against its seat. </p>
      <p>The fuel valve 27 is provided with a head 33 within the chamber
        24, the head having a conical face which seats on conical seat
        on a wall of the chamber 24. This fuel valve also has a tubular
        stem 35 sliding within the stem 28 of the exhaust valve and
        extending above the upper end of the stem 28. </p>
      <p>A spring 36 is interposed between the upper side of the collar
        or spring seat 30 and a collar 37 on the stem 35 of the fuel
        valve, this spring tending to thrust the fuel valve upwardly
        into its closed position. </p>
      <p>The head of the fuel valve 27 is formed with a duct or
        passage38 leading through its seating face, and this duct is
        controlled, that is, the amount of oil or fuel to feed through
        this duct is controlled or measured by a needle valve 40
        extending lengthwise of the tubular stem of the fuel valve and
        threaded through a cap 41 at the upper end of the stem 85 of the
        fuel valve. </p>
      <p>In order to prevent the generator chamber from becoming air
        bound and to facilitate the flow of fuel thereinto said chamber
        communicates with the outer air and in the illustrated
        embodiment, the air passage is provided by flattening the stem
        35 on one side forming a passage 35a. Said passage 35a is thus
        controlled by the head 33 of the fuel valve 27. </p>
      <p>The jet opening 25 is here illustrated as formed in a plug 42
        inserted in the head of the exhaust valve 26. </p>
      <p>The jet opening 25 is here illustrated as formed in a plug 42
        inserted in the head of the exhaust valve 26. </p>
      <p>The stem 35 of the fuel valve 27 is connected to a suitable
        fuel supply or feed line, and as shown in Fig. 2, this stem is
        provided with transverse passages 43 opening into a chamber 45
        surrounding the stem 35 and communicating with a passage 46a
        connected by a pipe 46 to a suitable tank or other fuel supply.
      </p>
      <p>The chamber 45 is here shown as supported by a bracket 48
        mounted on the head 10 of the cylinder and secured thereto in
        any suitable manner as by cap screws 49. Also, a suitable needle
        valve 50 is provided for regulating the flow of fuel from the
        pipe 46 and passage 46a into the chamber 45. The stem 35 of the
        fuel valve 27 slides in the bracket 48 through the chamber 45,
        and hence the valve stem is guided by the bracket. </p>
      <p>The inlet 11 is provided with a suitable inlet pipe 51 having
        throttle means at its outer end and also means is provided for
        conducting the fuel into the intake 51, this means being here
        shown as an atomizing nozzle 52 arranged in the intake pipe 51
        and connected to the fuel supply pipe in any suitable manner, as
        by a pipe 53 connected at one end to the passage 46a of the
        bracket 48 and at its other end to a nipple 55 on the nozzle 52.
      </p>
      <p>The feed of the fuel to the nozzle is controlled by a suitable
        needle valve 56 associated with the nozzle 52. The nozzle as
        here shown terminated in a jet opening 57 arranged to project
        the jet against a spray plate 58 carried at the lower end of the
        nozzle. </p>
      <p>The throttle at the outer end of the intake pipe 51 may be of
        any suitable construction, and as here illustrated, comprises a
        register or shutter 59 movable by a suitable lever 60 about an
        axis 61 and having openings as quadrantal openings 62 arranged
        to be brought into and out of alignment partly or wholly, with
        similar openings 63 in the end wall of the casing 64 for such
        throttle. </p>
      <p>The exhaust valve 26 and the fuel valve 27 are operated form
        the cams 8 and 9, and the means for operating them comprises the
        cams 8, 9, rocker arms 65 and 66 mounted on an axis 67, like
        ends of the rocker arms pressing against the collars 36 and 37
        respectively on the stems of the exhaust and fuel valves 26, 27,
        and the other ends of the rocker arms enacting with lifter rods
        which coact with cams 8 and 9. </p>
      <p>As here shown, the lifter rods were concentrically arranged and
        the lifter rod 68 for the rocker arm 65 is tubular and the
        lifter rod 69 for the rocker arm 66 slides in the tubular lifter
        rod 68. </p>
      <p>The rod 68 is guided in the suitable bracket 70 supported on
        the engine base and also this rod is formed in sections
        adjustable lengthwise relatively to each other as by a
        turnbuckle or other right and left hand screw thread connection.
      </p>
      <p>In operation, during the suction stroke of the engine, a
        combustion supporting atmosphere or air is drawn into the engine
        cylinder. Also, the fuel valve 27 is opened to permit liquid
        fuel to pass through its hollow stem 35, the duct 38, into the
        generator chamber 24. During the compression stroke of the
        piston, the air is compressed in the cylinder and the pressure
        transferred through the jet 25 to the fuel within the generator
        chamber 24. </p>
      <p>The pressure at first in the cylinder and in the generator
        chamber 24 is equal, but the fuel becomes hearted and expands
        under the pressure until the pressure in the generator chamber
        24 is greater than that in the cylinder whereupon the now
        volatilized and heated fuel jets through the jet opening 25 into
        the cylinder and as its temperature is above the ignition point
        it burns in the combustion supporting atmosphere and creates the
        power to impel the piston on its power stroke. </p>
      <p>At the end of the power stroke the exhaust valve is opened so
        that during the exhaust stroke the cylinder is scavenged. After
        the engine has been started the liquid oil in the generator
        chamber 24 is quickly volatilized by the heat of the exhaust
        gases and the heated cylinder so that the amount of fuel to be
        passed into the generator chamber can be cut down if desired by
        turning the needle valve 40. </p>
      <p>To increase the power of the engine when necessary, that is, to
        boost the engine, the needle valve 56 can be opened more or less
        permitting atomized fuel to enter the cylinder with the incoming
        air or combustion supporting atmosphere. This booster charge is
        ignited by the burning of the charge from the generator chamber
        24. At certain speeds and loads the booster charge is not used,
        and the booster may be used for quick acceleration or for peak
        loads. </p>
      <p>When the booster charge is used, the engine is controlled by
        operating the throttle 59. For further reduction the valve 56 is
        operated to control the amount of fuel going into the air inlet
        11: and for further reduction the initial charge to the
        generator chamber 24 is controlled by operating the needle valve
        40. </p>
      <p>The charge in the generator chamber may be sufficient to idle
        the engine, that is, to keep it running with the ordinary load
        or with no load. It is sufficient, however, that this charge be
        enough to create power to idle the engine and the booster charge
        taken in through the air inlet 44 relied on to create the power
        to do work. Also, when the engine is started and the idling
        charge taken in, the valve 38 Can be entirely cut off and the
        engine running solely on the booster charge taken in through the
        air inlet 11. During such operation, it is probable that, during
        the compression stroke, some of this charge enters the generator
        chamber 24 through the passage 25 during the compression stroke
        and is there volatilized and generated into a gas and forced
        back into the combustion supporting atmosphere in the cylinder
        by the increased pressure generated by the volatilization
        thereof, and hence burns in the cylinder and ignites the
        combustible charge therein. Preferably the generator chamber and
        its jet passage are proportioned to receive and volatilize a
        charge that will run the engine with the ordinary load for which
        the engine is built to carry, and the booster charge used there
        for acceleration and increased power. </p>
      <p>An engine operating in accordance with my method is very easily
        started, develops high speed, and power, is very flexible or
        sensitive to the throttle, utilizes cheaper fuel as fuel oil, is
        economical in fuel as well as powerful, is much lighter in
        weight than other engines of the type not having spark plugs or
        ignition systems. In fact my engine is not heavier than engines
        of similar power using electric ignition to ignite the fuel
        charge in the cylinder such as engines used in motor vehicles.
        Owing to the light weight, high speed and power, and the
        flexibility of this engine, it is adapted for use in motor
        boats, motor trucks, and automobiles, as well as for stationary
        uses for which heavier engines are now employed.. </p>
