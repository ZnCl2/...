      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With low-level ultrasonic
          input signals, the Magnetic Resonance Amplifier (MRA) produces
          usable direct current power at levels above unity. This
          circuit is based upon the work and theories of John Ernst
          Worrell Keely, and is offered into the public domain in his
          memory.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Without lengthy discussion
          about the aether, tetrahedral geometric aggregate resonance or
          the Rule of Nines, it is possible to understand this circuit
          as basically a tuned magnetic and quartz amplifier.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, it was necessary to
          study those subjects in order to design and build the MRA, so
          if you want to fully realize how it works, avail yourself of
          the files on KeelyNet which contain all of that and much more.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the MRA schematic below,
          there is a tunable low-power oscillator which supplies a
          signal to one side of a barium titanate transducer. The
          opposite side of the transducer is connected to a primary coil
          which is wrapped around a barium ferrite magnet core. The
          opposite end of the primary goes back to the oscillator.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A secondary is wrapped
          around the primary and is connected to an ordinary bridge
          rectifier, and the output of the bridge is applied to a DC
          load. A filter capacitor can be used on the output of the
          bridge, and was used on the MRA which we built. Additionally,
          a load resistor across the capacitor will keep the output DC
          from getting too high as the circuit is tuned. We found that a
          30 ohm, 10 watt resistor was sufficient.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once this has been
          assembled, put a voltmeter across the output resistor to
          monitor the voltage rise as the circuit is tuned. Adjust the
          oscillator frequency to provide the highest DC output. During
          this process, be aware that the voltages across the piezo and
          the coil will be very much higher than the signal level which
          you are applying. We have seen combined voltages of almost
          1,000 volts AC with only 30 volts AC of signal input.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the circuit is tuned,
          the magnet will be "singing" at around 8,000 to 11,000 Hz. If
          the piezo sings, you are exceeding its power capabilities and
          will need to reduce the number of turns on your primary. The
          frequency that resonates both the piezo and the magnet at
          optimum resonance will be three times (three octaves above)
          the frequency at which the magnet is singing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the nine harmonics
          that are mentioned in the Rule of Nines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To test the circuit, place a
          precision, high wattage, low ohm resistor in series with the
          output from the oscillator to the piezo, and measure the
          voltage drop. It should be very small, less than 0.1 volt AC.
          Use this value to determine current in the series circuit, and
          then calculate power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next, measure the DC voltage
          across your output load resistor, and once again calculate
          power. You should be between three to four times above the
          previously calculated input power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once the circuit is in
          operation, you will note that the voltage will vary by 0.1
          volt DC or more, depending upon the time of day. This is due
          to the nature of etheric forces inherent in the Earth's
          magnetic field. Watch for peak voltage at or before sunrise.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our circuit, we measured
          0.084 volt AC drop across a 2 ohm series resistor, for a total
          of 0.685 W dissipation in the primary. With this, we attained
          2.75 W of output power and used this to drive a lamp and a
          motor. Increasing the signal voltage had the effect of
          decreasing the primary current while boosting output power,
          thus improving the power gain ratio. We believe that larger
          power systems can be built by using larger coils, more piezos,
          and a lower frequency, as long as the aggregate combination is
          within the resonant frequency range of the components.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA is essentially a
          means of releasing the electrical energy stored in magnets. As
          such, it is an AC battery with DC output. It can be used for a
          portable, self-charging power supply with a solid state
          oscillator and rechargeable battery. For those who want a
          synopsis of the technology, the following paragraphs are
          offered, but it is strongly suggested that you follow up this
          reading with a more thorough study of the KeelyNet files.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matter = Energy. To change
          matter, change the energy. Creation of a magnet is achieved by
          a process which causes the matter to be both expanded and
          compressed at the same time, with the result that a magnet is
          in a constant state of collapse. This is why magnets attract
          material with similar lattice structures, as they attempt to
          fill the energy void which created them. The "domains" of the
          magnet are fixed after the process of magnetization, and the
          only way to extract electrical energy is to physically spin a
          coil relative to a magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, it is also possible
          to induce virtual rotation by applying the resonant frequency
          of the magnet, which causes the lattices and the domains to
          vibrate. However, the power required to do this is greater
          than the energy released by the virtual rotation. Therefore it
          is necessary to increase the vibration without using excessive
          current.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The piezo has a virtually
          inexhaustible supply of free electrons, and it releases them
          when it is stressed. Using the piezo in series with the
          primary coil will almost eliminate primary current, because it
          is voltage which stresses the piezo, not current. Therefore
          the piezo can be stressed with very little actual power, and
          provide the current to the primary coil which vibrates the
          domains of the magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The piezo is the catalyst
          for the circulating current with the primary coil. The
          circulating current is additive, and this is the reason for
          the high potentials developed across both the piezo and the
          primary coil.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is at this point that
          resonance becomes important. You must have three octaves of
          separation between the magnet resonant frequency and the
          signal supplied to the piezo. The circulating current is rich
          in harmonics, and this is necessary for the operation of the
          circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although the circuit is
          simple, it utilizes the concepts of phi, of virtual rotation,
          of tetrahedral geometry, piezo and transformer theory, and
          electrical knowledge. It is not suggested as a beginner
          project, because of the high voltages present. For engineers
          and technicians of experience, it may be difficult to accept
          that the MRA is above unity. The ramifications are enormous.
          Hopefully, it will help to build a better world.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">by</font></b> <br>
          <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Joel McClain</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA is a series resonant
          LC circuit in which power gain is attainable as a result of
          the increase in effective impedance under certain operating
          conditions. When the series impedance increases, primary
          current is reduced. When the power available from the
          secondary coil either remains the same or increases as the
          primary circuit impedance increases, a power gain occurs.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is not possible with a
          series resonant circuit made of conventional materials. Even
          unity power transfer is considered to be unattainable as a
          result of accumulated losses in the components, which are
          passive (reactive) devices. Materials and construction methods
          are chosen for these components based upon the type of
          application and frequency to be applied, with the goal of
          minimizing losses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical capacitor with
          polyethylene dielectric has a dielectric constant of 2.3 times
          that of air. Air has a constant of 1.0, and is the basis for
          comparison. Titanium dioxide, however, has a dielectric
          constant maximum of 170, and a corresponding power factor of
          only 0.0006, comparable with polyethylene, so that the
          dissipation of primary current in the dielectric is extremely
          low. This is where the comparison ends, because the titanium
          composite "capacitor" is also a piezoelectric device as well
          as an excellent capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heat adversely affects the
          power factor of most dielectric materials. Titanium zirconate,
          however, contains polar molecules which rotate as thermal
          pressure is applied. This rotation increases the dielectric
          constant if the frequency applied is equal to or lower than
          the resonant frequency of the dielectric.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At series resonance, the
          rotation of polar molecules contributes to heat; as the
          dielectric constant increases, a corresponding release of free
          electrons occurs, as a direct result of the piezoelectric
          properties of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In application, the MRA is
          tuned at resonance for maximum power transfer, then detuned
          slightly for maximum power gain. This relates directly to the
          use of thermal pressure at resonance, and the effect that this
          has on continued polar rotation and the release of donor
          electrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coil, or primary of the
          MRA is a magnetic core which, relative to the fixed
          capacitance of the piezo, is a tuned permeability device. This
          is often used in RF devices to attain a stable resonant
          frequency. Magnetic materials are chosen based upon the
          operating characteristics of the intended application to
          reduce eddy currents in the operating range.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In these applications, the
          resonant frequency of the magnet itself is avoided, as this
          would "beat" with the oscillating current. However, in the
          MRA, this is the exact effect which we want.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The barium ferrite magnet
          resonates audibly at frequencies which are harmonics of the
          series resonant frequency. The effect of this in a typical
          audio application is called harmonic distortion, and is not
          desirable, but once again, in the MRA, this is what we want to
          occur.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is energy in the
          harmonics, and this energy serves to both counter eddy losses
          as well as to oppose primary current flow, while contributing
          to circulating current within the resonant circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The net effect of this, is
          that when the MRA is detuned, harmonics of the audible
          frequency "beat" with primary current, opposing its flow,
          while the increase in circulating current couples more power
          to the secondary, and therefore to the load. This is how the
          power gain is attained, basically by considering the naturally
          occuring harmonics as beneficial instead of as undesirable
          effects to be filtered out.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the MRA is detuned, the
          effective impedance increases as seen by the source, while the
          power available to the load decreases in less proportion. This
          is measurable by using resistive equivalent circuit testing.
          However, the detuning is load dependent, and slight
          adjustments are required if the load requirement is greater
          than the power band of a harmonic interaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After retuning, the power to
          the load will increase in quantum intervals as the circulating
          current is reinforced by the reaction of the permeable magnet
          core. This will be seen as slight incremental voltage
          increases across the load device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once the magnet is
          "ringing", it's frequency and therefore harmonics remain
          stable, as long as the series resonant range is not exceeded.
          Therefore, the detuning affects the piezo only, and the
          circulating current increase is a result of the phase
          relationship between the harmonic and the source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Voltage amplification is
          seen across the primary, measurably higher than the source
          voltage, and this is "seen" by the secondary. This is not the
          same thing as a power gain, because the power gain is a direct
          result of effective impedance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be noted that
          the term "virtual rotation" has been applied in describing the
          operation of the MRA. The comparison is made with a generator,
          in which relative motion occurs between a coil and magnet.
          Rather than use physical energy to rotate a mass, the MRA uses
          resonance to rotate the energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is seen in the polar
          rotation of the piezo dielectric as well as in the molecular
          energy occuring in the reactive component of the magnet, ie,
          the ringing. The lattice structures of the piezo and magnet
          are compatible for virtual rotation, and the materials
          complement each other electrically.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the past, researchers
          have noted many effects which occur at aggregate resonance,
          which typically includes a range of three octaves. Anomalous
          energy gains were referred to as "aetheric". The aether was
          believed to exist outside of the three physical dimensions,
          and could be "tapped" for free energy at resonance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Aetheric energy is said to
          be limitless, but to vary locally with increases in earth
          magnetic fields at sunset and sunrise, like the tides of an
          infinite ocean. This effect is not thoroughly understood, but
          has been observed in the MRA, as increases in output in the
          early morning, and decreases in the early evening. This is
          still being studied.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early talks with various

          confirmed this with his analogy of glowing luciferase as found

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a nonlinear ferroelectric
          capacitor there are three major nonlinear processes involved,
          so it is possible to carefully choose and arrange conditions
          so that the current through the capacitor moves against the
          voltage across its terminals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With adroit switching and
          timing, and some consideration for resonance effects, it is in
          theory possible to use such highly nonlinear effects in a
          circuit to allow (1) an overpotential at the terminals of the
          battery as a reaction from the ferroelectric capacitor, (2)
          consequent recharging of the battery via that back potential
          on the battery side, while the load is also being powered, (3)
          consequent driving of the load on the load side of the
          terminals, and (4) having a bypass ferroelectric capacitor
          across the terminals of the battery, where the capacitor is in
          the "current against the voltage" condition.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">McLain and Wooten patented a
          great little MRA (Magnetic Resonance Amplifier) system, based
          on that application. Dr. Robert Bass, a very fine
          electrodynamicist of exceptional knowledge, experience, and
          ability wrote the patent for them, and assisted in their work.
          For that he was persecuted, unjustly attacked, and suffered
          financial difficulties. The "system" does not forgive highly
          qualified scientists who take a serious interest in "perpetual
          motion machines" -- as permissible Maxwellian open dissipative
          systems are erroneously and derogatorily labeled by the
          orthodox scientific community. Any scientist violating that
          inquisition suffers the consequences.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After technical discussions
          back and forth, the Patent Office even notified Wooten and
          McLain that the patent had been accepted and the patent would
          be issued. Within days, to their consternation the patent was
          rejected and that was the end of that.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In other words, the fix was
          in.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our Own Experience In
            "Obtaining" Proper Ferroelectric Capacitors ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here's an interesting little
          tidbit, for what it's worth. We here at CTEC had included a
          specific use of ferroelectric capacitors (FECs) in one of our
          own patent applications. We attempted to obtain an FEC on the
          open market, one with the publicized nearly- square S-curve of
          hysteresis. No capacitor manufacturer we contacted had one for
          sale! I went all the way to a Swedish company, was assured
          they made just what I needed, and purchased several from them
          to be shipped by airmail. In due time they arrived. They did
          not have the square S-curve at all, but were carefully layered
          to eliminate that S-curve, into a rather straight slanting
          curve. That kind of curve is absolutely useless for overunity
          applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now why would anyone wish to
          purchase a supposedly nonlinear capacitor for its very
          nonlinearity, and instead purchase one that has been altered
          to behave just as linearly as possible? Why would a company
          advertise such a nonlinear capacitor, then sell you one that
          is highly linearized? And considering the rather substantial
          literature on nonlinear capacitors with square S-curves, why
          do not the capacitor companies sell such?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We eventually found there is
          indeed a U.S. manufacturer of ferroelectric capacitors with
          precisely that S-curve hysteresis loop. There was just one
          little problem. They had an agreement with the U.S. Navy for
          all their production of those capacitors, and in that
          agreement they were not to sell any to private persons or
          companies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now why would the U.S. Navy
          wish to restrict a perfectly unclassified, open component from
          being sold on the open commercial market? Zounds! If one were
          a conspiracy buff, one might even try to connect this with the
          U.S. Navy's long suppression of the Kron negative resistor. Do
          you suppose there could actually be some kind of connection
          between the two? Why of course not! Paranoia and all that, you
          know. And still one wonders...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The literature continues to
          publish tests of just such ferroelectric capacitors, etc.
          Contacting several of the researchers who author those papers,
          we found that they (at least the ones contacted) were all
          making their own ferroelectric capacitors if they wished one
          with that square S-curve! No one seemed to know where we could
          just purchase one off the shelf.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Maybe all that is just
          coincidence. And maybe not.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Possible Interpretation
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What the square S-curve
          hysteresis loop means is that, in one region of operation,
          with only a very tiny voltage change, you can get a rather
          enormous current change from that capacitor. In another region
          of operation, you can get a very large voltage change from the
          capacitor for a very small current change. In other words,
          biased into one region, you have essentially a voltage device.
          In the other region, you have essentially a current device.
          Neither device will "cost" you very much energy to operate it
          in its region. However, if you then nonlinearly mix the two
          outputs just right, as we filed on methods of doing, then
          bingo! You had a mixer device whose output now had both large
          current and large power, but you "paid for" and input not
          nearly so much "energy dissipation" (remember, engineers
          calculate energy dissipation flow, never energy transport
          flow!) to the mixer as what would be output by the mixer.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The whole question is this.
          We all know about ordinary nonlinear mixing and mixers.&nbsp;
          We know that two signals can indeed be mixed nonlinearly. Can
          we build a nonlinear mixer and a dual circuit, where we feed a
          voltage-like signal in and also a current-like signal in to
          the mixer, get the two combined into a high voltage, high
          current signal output, and do that without back-field coupling
          onto the two input "signals" to force equal energy dissipation
          in the input.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Look at this very carefully.
          There is absolutely no conservation of energy law that
          requires that the energy input circuit dissipate as much
          energy as does the load circuit that receives the energy to
          power it. So why are we taught only those mixing circuits that
          will indeed force equal input dissipation? We need three
          things in the input: (1) lots of voltage, (2) lots of current,
          and (3) small energy dissipation. That means we need a
          "voltage-like" input and a "current" like input, which do not
          interact with each other on the input side of the mixer. We
          then need a mixer that will mix the two into a single signal
          with high voltage and high current, but will not back-couple
          its fields onto the input circuit to up the input dissipation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Is all this mystery in
          trying to obtain square S-curve ferroelectric capacitors
          really due to the fact that it is possible to use them
          together with other circuit components to produce such an
          overunity mixer? Could something like that be behind what
          happened to McLain and Wooten, and to Dr. Bass? Again, at this
          point we wonder...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So you think such odd mixing
          violates the conservation of energy law? Then think again.
          There is no valid law of physics anywhere -- in complete
          contradiction to the assumptions in most electrical texts --
          that you have to conserve work. Energy, yes. Work, no. The
          energy that a circuit captures can involve the voltage only.
          Remember, W = fq. To get lots of W (joules) collected for use
          to power loads, we need lots of V (that is, Df ) and lots of
          q. We then need them mixed (interacting together). That's it.
          Anything else is what the circuit we construct is doing to
          fight us back. So, it would seem that we should focus on
          reducing the ability of that circuit to fight us back, while
          still doing the voltage-amperage mixing and interaction thing.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even in the flawed old
          electrodynamics, one volt is one joule collected per coulomb
          of charge collector. So if you place one volt on a circuit
          which has few Drude electrons for collection, you get very
          little collected energy in that circuit (and note that the
          energy dissipated in that circuit can only be the energy that
          it first intercepts and collects). And if you then input the
          same voltage to a circuit with lots of Drude electrons, this
          second circuit will collect (and can then dissipate) lots of
          joules of collected energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When you change the voltage
          of a circuit, you change the potential energy available for
          collection and dissipation. How much it collects and
          dissipates, then depends upon how many collectors it has to do
          so, and the dissipaters it has to change the form of the
          collected energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So one trick would appear to
          be to feed a nonlinear mixing unit from two circuits: one
          optimized for voltage and starved for current, and the second
          starved for voltage and optimized for current. The one
          remaining trick is to prevent any back-field coupling from the
          output of the mixer back to the two feed circuits. If you
          accomplish that, you have yourself a nice little overunity
          device, perfectly permissible by the laws of physics and
          thermodynamics, and one which does not violate conservation of
          energy. It darn sure violates "conservation of work", however.
          For that matter, so does a windmill or a waterwheel, or a
          solar cell. You yourself do not have to perform work on
          something to get it to collect energy (asymmetrically
          regauge). It can collect the energy freely, if you arrange it
          correctly. Something else -- such as a free flow of energy
          from the environment -- is perfectly capable of doing that
          work on the intercepting collector, so that collection of
          energy in the circuit occurs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In my view, McLain and
          Wooten were accomplishing something very similar to our notion
          of nonlinearly mixing a low power high voltage input and a low
          power high current input, but using ferroelectric nonlinear
          resonance as the "magic" mixer to combine cheap high voltage
          with cheap high current and obtain the product of the two
          while only paying for their "sum", so to speak.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Think about it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But if you wish to pursue
          that approach to overunity, let me advise you to first do your
          homework on nonlinear resonance, as opposed to the linear
          resonance in almost all the normal textbooks. It's not at all
          just a "capacitance-inductance-resistance" business or just
          simple LC resonance. LC resonance alone has never added a
          single excess joule of energy to the power system.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The word "rule" has several
          different meanings -- as a form of law, or as a form of
          dominion, or as a measuring standard. This text uses the word
          in all three contexts to define the effect of the supreme
          chord, the trinity of harmony, in the universe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the late 19th and early
          20th centuries, independent researchers began to notice the
          "anomalous" effects of applying resonance to a controlled
          experiment. Then, as now, this area of "science" is far from
          the mainstream. The results of those early experiments, such
          as the lightning of Tesla and the motors of Keely, have been
          ignored both as science and as history...at least in America.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Elsewhere, the work of Tesla
          is revered and has been "amplified" by paid research. With the
          creation of the Magnetic Resonance Amplifier, or MRA, perhaps
          history and science will have to take a second look. The
          theories behind the MRA are the same as those of Tesla, Keely,
          Russell, Bearden, King and others. The application, however,
          in a closed-loop ZPE device, takes a sharp turn away from
          effect and into application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Look at either a piece of
          quartz or a magnet, and you are looking at trapped energy. Tap
          the quartz, and you will get a spark as the electrical
          potential of the quartz instantaneously jumps. Spin a magnet
          relative to a coil of wire, and electrical current flows in
          the wire. How do we extract the power of these materials
          without the attendant physical energy required to either</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">tap or spin them?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matter = energy. To convert
          matter to energy, resonate the matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To achieve energy output
          which is above the energy applied at resonance, use three
          octaves, and there will be three harmonious notes in each
          octave, for a total of nine resonant frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These notes occur naturally
          when the base frequency applied is three octaves above the
          magnet's resonant frequency, and equal to the resonance of the
          quartz.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this way, the potential
          applied to the quartz "taps" it, without the need to use
          physical force. The result is electrical output.&nbsp; Connect
          this output to a coil around a magnet, and the domains of the
          magnet, which comprise a tiny portion of its weight, and which
          do all of the "work" in a generator, will be forced to spin.
          This spin is called "virtual rotation", because it is the spin
          of energy without the spin of the matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, this is only one
          application. How can we be sure that the "rule" applies
          anywhere else, much less universally? We have to go very far
          back in history to find the answer to this question. It
          involves Phi, the universal constant, and delves deeply into
          the construction of earth's great tetrahedrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nest two tetrahedrons, and
          put them in an orb, and you have a miniature model of the
          earth's magnetic field. Where the "bases" of the tet's touch
          the orb, you have the latitudes where all of the ancient
          pyramids were built. The "top" and "bottom" points are the
          north and south poles. This shows the naturally occuring
          magnetic resonance of earth as an "orb" in rotation. Connect
          lines between the points, and you have a map of the ley lines,
          which were mapped very accurately thousands of years ago.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Models of the earth as
          described above have been found in the ruins of every
          civilization which built pyramids. Earth is, as it must be, a
          model of the natural harmonic relationship which exists at
          every level, from the universe itself to the subatomic. The
          relationships have been understood for a long, long time. This
          knowledge, and the use of the energy which it can be used to
          provide, was believed to be the curriculum of "mystery
          schools" in Egypt and Greece.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you look at the lattice
          geometry of silicon or germanium, you will find tetrahedrons.
          In his famous "ring", Hans Nieper allowed the silicon of
          transistors to achieve self-resonance, with the result that
          the circuit became lower in weight. This implies that
          resonance may also be the key to countering the effects of
          gravity, or rather, the effect called gravity, for gravity is
          an effect, not a force.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity is "suspended" when
          you cancel the spin of the energy which comprises matter by
          resonating the matter. By virtually rotating the lattices, the
          subatomic particle spin virtually stops, like a spinning
          object seen with a synchronized strobe light.&nbsp; Because
          gravity is a complex quadrupole effect, when you stop the
          spin, you lose the effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The matter which comprises
          the quartz and the magnet of the MRA is comprised of cube
          lattices, each of which is a nested tetrahedron at 45 degrees
          relative to the polar axis of the molecules. Together in a
          circuit, there is a 90-degree phase separation, which allows
          the resonant energy to create the needed harmonics to fully
          resonate both materials. This is the application of the rule
          of nines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a standard, the
          standard of the geometry of the universe; it is the ruling law
          of nature; and it is the measuring tool for all electrical and
          mechanical interaction. If, as some have suggested, the
          ancient "sacred" knowledge was shared by extraterrestrials to
          permit the construction of the pyramids, and if, as we have
          seen, resonance is the key to anti-gravity as well as to free
          energy, then the tetrahedron has very far reaching
          implications.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Secondly, avoid using scopes

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since Joel and I have
          created a lot of interest in the MRA device we will place
          everything on line so that no "stone is left unturned".&nbsp;
          Long ago I saw a sci-fi movie of a suitcase size device that
          you could plug any size AC load into it and it would power it
          with no problem. I dreamed of building such a device by
          employing a block of natural quartz with a mechanical
          oscillator attached to all faces (Tesla oscillator) to force
          the quartz to yield free electrons. I envisioned the output
          (high voltage) to be stored in a capacitor bank (1 kilo joule)
          them the output going into an inverter circuit and stepdown
          transformer to take this piezo generated voltage down to a
          useful AC voltage.&nbsp; Now Joel and I have combined this
          effect to the resonating of the lattice structure of a magnet
          to sum the outputs of the piezo effect and the ferro-resonant
          effect to give an over-unity total at the bridge
          rectifier.&nbsp; Last night Bert Pool came over to gather up
          the needed supplies to build a prototype circuit to do
          independent evaluation.&nbsp; After I had run the circuit
          through the paces noting the outputs and thoroughly discussing
          what we thought was going on here I turned off the meters,
          scopes and the signal generator and finally went to bed. Well
          I woke up a 2:00AM with a headache, went to get the tylenol
          and went into the room with the test rig on the bench.&nbsp; I
          turned on the frequency counter and found that the circuit was
          running in free oscillation with no input. Although no power
          was being produced the free running oscillations were filling
          my living space with a high freq ultrasonic squeal that as
          Joel has warned will give you a migraine headache in short
          order.&nbsp; The free oscillation was [D[Ds around 44KHZ with
          the freq counter ranging up and down (no lock on). I had to
          take the circuit apart to stop the ultrasonic ringing.&nbsp;
          As Joel has pointed out these titanium zirconate transducers,
          once set into resonance will continue to ring for a long
          period.&nbsp; Since there is possible some conditioning taking
          place within the crystalline structure of the material I
          believe that over a long conditioning period (burn in time)
          the whole circuit can be make sensitive to a combination of
          two frequencies that are necessary. The first freq involved is
          the input to drive the transducer which has to be 3 octaves
          down from the fundamental natural frequency of the
          ferro-magnetic resonant frequency. Although it has not been
          mentioned before in "A" public on this net, Joel and I were
          successful in isolating and identifying the fundamental
          Ferromagnetic Resonant Frequency as being around 174.9 KHz.
          Doesn't it sound ironic that this freq should fall so close to
          what the Corums have determined that Tesla designed his big
          coil out in Colorado springs around? I have read several
          articles that speculated that the ferromagnetic freq or the
          earth natural magnetic field resonated around 180 KHz.&nbsp;
          With this 174.9 freq in mind we have applied the Joel McClain
          "Rule of Nines" to the circuit where we run the transducer at
          a freq that is a multiple of the fundamental 174.9
          ferro-resonant freq.&nbsp; His circuit is running at a fifth
          and mine is running at a third.&nbsp; Example- I input a sine
          wave signal at 2.28 VAC into the series resonant circuit at
          59070 Hz and get a voltage developed across the transducer of
          26.04 V and a voltage across the coil of 24.02 with an output
          voltage from the bridge rectifier of 30.2 VDC. If every thing
          is running in an ideal phase relationship (transducer
          oscillations and ferro-coil oscillations) then the beat freq
          will partially sum the two voltages since they are in a series
          circuit and set up a circulating current in the primary which
          when the primary winding and the secondary windings have the
          proper impedance matching will extract the maximum amount of
          energy from the circulating current in the transformer into a
          healthy output at the bridge which is far OVER-UNITY, high I/O
          ratio. My circuit is showing a 13:1 ratio at this time and I
          have not even approached a good impedance match in the
          windings. A real sharp RF engineer could sort all the details
          out in short order. I don't profess to be an RF engineer but
          have a good background in electronics.&nbsp; This is the
          reason for Joel and I going "PUBLIC DOMAIN" with the circuit
          so that some highly skilled folks out there can take this
          circuit and help develop it into something of practical use.
          We don't want PROFIT motivated people to "rip" off the idea
          for self gain. We want any potential benefits of the circuit
          to remain free for the taking. More notes as we learn more. As
          Joel says, "we are like teenagers learning to drive dad's
          Olds". A little help from interested fellow researchers is
          welcome. ~ Norm</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our discussion of the MRA
          circuit we keep referring to the key part of the circuit as
          being a transducer. Let me clarify this a little for I know
          there are a lot of folks out there who will be running around
          looking for that same device that we have. First let's settle
          the confusion about the type of material involved. Jerry
          Decker and I bought some of these devices from Tanner
          Electronics here in Dallas and were told that they were BARIUM
          TITANATE transducers made for the ultra-sonic heads in the
          ultra-sonic welders used in the plastics industry. There are
          numerous manufacturers of such welding devices in which they
          stack these devices (each rated at 50 Watts) to get the total
          power needed to weld plastic by kinetic contact heating.&nbsp;
          A physical description is: 2 inch outside diameter round with
          a 5/8th inch hole through the center with a thickness of
          3/16th inch with silver layered on each side which is
          convenient for soldering leads to the transducer. When
          employing these units they have to be suspended to that they
          are free to resonate. Don't lay them on a table or surface for
          this will dampen the free oscillations. We have not consulted
          an acoustical engineer to determine the best way to mount the
          units or attach the I/O leads so as to provide the optimum
          free resonances. We have discussed the employment of tuned
          pipes of the proper wave length ratios needed to enhance the
          free resonant or targeted resonance that we desire. I have
          even thought of a mechanical type of tuning fork device that
          would give us the Tesla described "CHILD ON THE SWING" type
          drive that would give the maximum output with the least
          possible input (wattage I/O). A good microwave engineer would
          possibly come up with a tuned cavity resonator which would
          drive the transducer at the optimum phase to extract the
          energy needed to drive the ferro-resonant coil in the primary.
          The magnet that Joel is using is from an IBM hard drive and is
          as follows: [A[D[B 7 inches long X 2 inches&nbsp; X 2 inches
          with the magnetic "Bloch wall" across the thickness. For those
          out there who may never heard the term "Block wall" it means
          the neutral plane in a magnet. The magnetic orientation is
          across the thickness of the magnetic therefore cannot be
          described as a bar magnet which has it's magnetic orientation
          along the long axis. By using a magnet which has the flux
          across the thickness and the windings are wound around the
          center of the long axis we have a coil which is wound with
          half of the winding turn in a "N" field and the other half of
          the turn in a "S" field. Makes no difference since the
          objective here is to ring the magnet into a resonant freq and
          it seems to me that it is easier to ring (mechanically) with
          the ends of the long axis protruding from the coil. In other
          words the "Node point" is under the coil with the free ends
          oscillating. There are several ways to suspend a bar that is
          in free resonance. All you have to do is open your door chime
          and look at how the chime bar is mounted to extract the
          maximum acoustical energy from the hammer strike.&nbsp; The
          same objective applies here so there is a lot of work to be
          done to maximize this device. It is public so YOU can help
          sort it all out. Joel is using 150 turns in the primary and
          secondary of his ferro-magnetic transformer. Experimentation
          will provide the ideal ratios and impedance matching. Get with
          the program and provide free exchange of findings so all may
          benefit. ~ Norm</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ I'm breaking in
          another piezo. It's been on the sig gen for a few hours. I
          have 1.33VAC at 34.2KHz from the sig gen, measuring current in
          line.&nbsp; Current starts at 4ma, then slowly drops for about
          three minutes until it gets down to just 1ma.&nbsp; Since the
          1.33VAC is RMS,&nbsp; nput power to the MRA is 1.33mw. Output
          is 3.1VDC across 4.7K from the decade box which calculates at
          2.0mw. Since the meter is rated at 200KHz, I know that we are
          well within its range.&nbsp; Gain at this low level of signal
          is 150%. We will learn how to condition a piezo from this,
          which we can pass along as another tech note. It looks like we
          have to start at the leakage threshold and work up in terms of
          power applied. It will take a LOT of tests to keep from
          conditioning parts until they are just barely marginal under
          useful load. Oh well, nobody ever said it would be easy.&nbsp;
          The noise from the magnet is amazing, even at low power. ~

          magnet and the driver piezos so when I visit you we can do
          some parallel testing on the two circuits for more
          verification of over-unity operation. After running all night
          the circuit is definitely in the (+) column so we need to nail

          Theory</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA is a series resonant
          LC circuit in which power gain is attainable as a result of
          the increase in effective impedance under certain operating
          conditions.&nbsp; When the series impedance increases, primary
          current is reduced. When the power available from the
          secondary coil either remains the same or increases as the
          primary circuit impedance increases, a power gain occurs.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is not possible with a
          series resonant circuit made of conventional materials. Even
          unity power transfer is considered to be</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">unattainable as a result of
          accumulated losses in the components, which are passive
          (reactive) devices. Materials and construction methods are
          chosen for these components based upon the type of application
          and frequency to be applied, with the goal of minimizing
          losses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical capacitor with
          polyethylene dielectric has a dielectric constant of 2.3 times
          air. Air has a constant of 1.0, and is the</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">basis for comparison.
          Titanium dioxide, however, has a dielectric constant maximum
          of 170, and a corresponding power factor of only 0.0006,
          comparable with polyethylene, so that the dissipation of&nbsp;
          primary current in the dielectric is extremely low. This is
          where the comparison ends, because the titanium composite
          "capacitor" is also a piezoelectric device as well as an
          excellent capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heat adversely affects the
          power factor of most dielectric materials. Titanium zirconate,
          however, contains polar molecules which rotate as thermal
          pressure is applied. This rotation increases the dielectric
          constant if the frequency applied is equal to or lower than
          the resonant frequency of the dielectric. At series resonance,
          the rotation of polar molecules contributes to heat; as the
          dielectric constant increases, a corresponding release of free
          electrons occurs, as a direct result of the piezoelectric
          properties of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In application, the MRA is
          tuned at resonance for maximum power transfer, then detuned
          slightly for maximum power gain.&nbsp; This relates directly
          to the use of thermal pressure at resonance, and the effect
          that this has on continued polar rotation and the release of
          donor electrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coil, or primary of the
          MRA is a magnetic core which relative to the fixed capacitance
          of the piezo, is a tuned permeability device. This is often
          used in RF devices to attain a stable resonant frequency.
          Magnetic materials are chosen based upon the operating
          characteristics of the intended application to reduce eddy
          currents in the operating range. In these applications, the
          resonant frequency of the magnet itself is avoided, as this
          would "beat" with the oscillating current. However, in the
          MRA, this is the exact effect which we want.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The barium ferrite magnet
          resonates audibly at frequencies which are harmonics of the
          series resonant frequency. The effect of this in a typical
          audio application is called harmonic distortion, and is not
          desirable, but once again, in the MRA, this is what we want to
          occur. There is energy in the harmonics, and this energy
          serves to both counter eddy losses as well as to oppose
          primary current flow, while contributing to circulating
          current within the resonant circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The net effect of this, is
          that when the MRA is detuned, harmonics of the audible
          frequency "beat" with primary current, opposing its flow,
          while the increase in circulating current couples more power
          to the secondary, and therefore to the load.&nbsp; This is how
          the power gain is attained, basically by considering the
          naturally occurring harmonics as beneficial instead of as
          undesirable effects to be filtered out.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the MRA is detuned, the
          effective impedance increases as seen by the source, while the
          power available to the load decreases in less proportion. This
          is measurable by using resistive equivalent circuit testing.
          However, the detuning is load dependent, and slight
          adjustments are required if the load requirement is greater
          than the power band of a harmonic interaction.&nbsp; After
          retuning, the power to the will increase in quantum intervals
          as the circulating current is reinforced by the reaction of
          the permeable magnet core. This will be seen as slight
          incremental voltage increases across the load device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once the magnet is
          "ringing", it's frequency and therefore harmonics remain
          stable, as long as the series resonant range is not exceeded.
          Therefore, the detuning affects the piezo only, and the
          circulating current increase is a result of the phase
          relationship between the harmonic and the source. Voltage
          amplification is seen across the primary, measurable higher
          than the source voltage, and this is "seen" by the secondary.
          This is not the same thing as a power gain, because the power
          gain is a direct result of effective impedance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be noted that
          the term "virtual rotation" has been applied in describing the
          operation of the MRA.&nbsp; The comparison is made with a
          generator, in which relative motion occurs between a coil and
          magnet. Rather than use physical energy to rotate a mass, the
          MRA uses resonance to rotate the energy. This is seen in the
          polar rotation of the piezo dielectric as well as in the
          molecular energy occurring in the reactive component of the
          magnet, i.e., the ringing. The lattice structures of the piezo
          and magnet are compatible for virtual rotation, and the
          materials complement each other electrically.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the past, researchers
          have noted many effects which occur at aggregate resonance,
          which typically includes a range of three octaves. Anomalous
          energy gains were referred to as "aetheric". The aether was
          believed to exist outside of the three physical dimensions,
          and could be "tapped" for free energy at resonance. Aetheric
          energy is said to be limitless, but to vary locally with
          increases in earth magnetic fields at sunset and sunrise, like
          the tides of an&nbsp; infinite ocean. This effect is not
          thoroughly understood, but has been observed in the MRA, as
          increases in output in the early morning, and decreases in the
          early evening. This is still being studied. Experimentation
          will determine the optimum MRA design for a specific range of
          applications.</font> </p>

          ones we are using&nbsp; I figure when this circuit is verified
          that the next step will be to go to a natural quartz milled
          wafer of&nbsp; the natural freq we desire to same as the
          crystals used in transmitters&nbsp; except a lot larger. If

          Branson who makes the ultrasonic welders so we can get a
          source manufacturer from them.&nbsp; Maybe someone on the
          Internet will know the manufacturers of these transducers.
          This circuit is a mindbender when you study its
          characteristics. For example I started off this&nbsp; morning
          (after I let the circuit run all night to condition the
          magnet&nbsp; and piezo crystal) with a total over-unity power
          gain of 1.65:1 ratio. After playing with the circuit all day
          taking measurements after each adjustment or change of
          operating parameters, arrived at a 150:1 I/O ratio. Here are
          the figures: Input 15.34 VAC @ 54.9 KHZ with .57 Ma which is
          .000874 Watts which has to be adjusted for power factor by
          multiplying by .707. The output is: 16.75 VDC @ 78.8 Ma into a
          pure resistive load. This figures out to be greater than a
          150:1 I/O ratio. I guess you have figured out how excited
          everyone is over this&nbsp; "Gadget". Now unless OHMS law has
          been nullified or there is some&nbsp; "spook" phenomenon that
          Joel and I cannot find then we have the 1 watt challenge in

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I know that there are quit a
          few folks out there running around digging up parts to build a
          MRA device to do independent testing.&nbsp; Let me share with
          you some findings that will assist all in this approach. First
          disregard the measurements that I gave Bill Beaty yesterday in
          a message about power gain.&nbsp; I like Joel find myself back
          at "square one". It happens like this, when you have this
          circuit up on the&nbsp; "ragged edge" where the first harmonic
          seems to be phase "beating" or attenuating the input current
          and providing potential only to drive the first stage
          resonance in the transducer, you disconnect the load to do the
          only accurate total power consumption test which is
          "equivalent resistance" measurements so we can nail down the
          elusive power figure according to OHMS LAW. Well when you
          unload the circuit under the optimum operating conditions the
          transducers will immediately trip into a very powerful
          mechanical oscillations around 2KHz and self destruct in short
          order and at the same time put out a violent voltage that can
          soar above 1000 VAC which in turn will literally wipe out your
          driving amplifier and your frequency counter.&nbsp;
          Fortunately the scope is better protected on the front
          end.&nbsp; So what I am saying is that you begin all over
          conditioning a new set of driver transducers which even fresh
          out of the box will display over-unity output in the
          circuit.&nbsp; The people over at the manufacturing firm that
          makes these transducers are&nbsp; "smiling" and calling their
          stock broker to exercise some stock options in their product
          for I see a lot of you destroying a bunch of transducers in
          the process of testing and improving the circuit. Let me share
          with you some ideas. When I go back and read TOM BEARDENS
          works about potentializing a circuit without the attendant
          circuit that is normally involved we will have achieved the
          over-unity that we are seeking. After careful study of the MRA
          I can see how this device can be separated into two separate
          devices. First the piezo is a source of high freq potential
          which at 3 octaves above drive the ferro-resonant primary coil
          at the natural resonant freq of the magnetic material. Now I
          believe I have figured out the secret behind the Swiss M-L
          Converter known as the TESTAVISTATIKA or TESTATIKA for
          short.&nbsp; This device was developed in the group called
          METHERNETA by Paul Baumann and it has been seen by our friend
          Stephan Marinov. This ZPE tapping can be accomplished through
          potential being derived from any source such as&nbsp; the
          electrostatic charge developed in the Wimhurst type generator.
          The secret is in the MAGNETIC RESONANCE AMPLIFIER. Ken
          Shoulders and R.A. Ford demonstrated that what we term as
          harmless energy&nbsp; (electrostatic charge) when stored in a
          large capacitor is real charge separation and can do some
          interesting things such as exploding water, wire and other
          interesting research projects. If we take advantage of the
          mechanical oscillations of the transducer and operate it at a
          level of mechanical resonance (in free oscillation) that will
          optimize the voltage output (lets say 400 volts) which in turn
          we use to drive the ferro-resonant barium ferrite core coil
          then we can extract some serious power from the coil providing
          that we have done our homework and provided the optimum
          impedance matching and tuning of the circuit&nbsp; to maximize
          the final product. We are a long ways from our final goal of
          having a unit that we can flip a switch and the thing will
          run&nbsp; "stand alone". Joel and I have taken the first step
          by sharing with you our findings so let's work this thing out
          together as a "joint project". We will share all findings in
          these Tech Bulletins so everyone is on the same sheet of
          music. Now for some "spook" type anomalies that occur around
          this circuit when it is running in the ZPE tapping mode which
          is where we purposely de-tune the circuit upward in freq so
          that we get the "beating" effect from the first harmonic. When
          you see this on the scope it will appear as the sine wave
          pattern of the input being broken into little line segments by
          an invisible or transparent oscillation at a much higher freq
          than the primary driving signal which in the case of my
          circuit is around 56.8 KHz. Even when I have Ch 2 turned on
          with no signal (base line only) it also is broken into short
          line segments as if the electron beam is driven into cut off
          by this invisible signal. Any RF engineers out there seen
          this? Please explain same. I believe that all the phenomenon
          that is being observed by people such as Sweet, Aspden, Adams,
          Lambertson, Searl and Tom Bearden are all connected by a
          common thread.&nbsp; Let's "unravel it". ~ Norm</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Jerry ~ The piezos, for
          all of their 50 watt capability, are fragile, especially along
          the edges. I had mine soldered at the edges, and when&nbsp; it
          bumped into the magnet while in transport, it cracked. The
          piezo has to be free to vibrate... if you touch it while the
          MRA is running, you can watch your output drop off, so it's a
          question of finding a way to mount them "loose", yet
          protected. However, whoever accidently picked up my stapled
          pack of tech notes might let me know so I can pick them up...
          has all of the test data and correspondence with Hal, and was
          on the corner of the table. THANKS!! ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hey!! Jerry, Don Smith is
          right all the way.&nbsp; Let me explain --- he has basically
          the same circuit that we (Joel and I). In his circuit he is
          using a Tesla coil as the driver and trying to extract power
          in his secondary from the "feeble" background earth magnetic
          field. If Don had been privy to what Joel and I know (now
          everyone) then he could have incorporated into his circuit a
          powerful barium ferrite magnet which he could drive at its
          resonant freq and effectively do the same thing we are doing.
          In fact the Tesla coil instead of the transducer is a much
          better driving potential.&nbsp; It is inherently much more
          stable with much higher potentials being able to be achieved
          and the fact remains that the ZPE tapping occurs in the
          domains of the magnet in&nbsp; "Virtual Rotation". Thoughts
          Jerry and Joel? ~ Norm</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ Sorry to hear that
          you also blew up your input amplifier. We've got a very
          powerful tiger by a very short tail with the MRA. It's purpose
          is to give power gain by bucking input current while using
          circulating current to drive the load, and this is done in a
          tuned, balanced state. As we've seen, unbalancing the MRA by
          removing the load can cause the "bucking" current to run open
          and blow up 40 to 50 watt amplifiers...with no other power
          applied.&nbsp; Even the flux from it blew up my panel mount
          DVM. Well, the good news is that we are over unity... the bad
          news is that we will have to cage the beast somehow. ~ Joel</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm/Joel, et. al ~ Just
          got a call from Tom Bearden... He's excited and even though I
          sent the MRA to him last week, he wants it today...so I am
          faxing&nbsp; it...along with the MRA1 and the UJTOSC (Woody's
          UJT oscillator file) because he can use all of it. As to the
          fracturing, he says this is due to pumping the potential
          field&nbsp; and went into a long explanation that I don't
          remember half of....he says his paper on stepped charging of
          the capacitors warns of this and&nbsp; they still haven't
          figured out how to get around it... He says they have
          transients exceeding 3000 volts and have smoked several test
          instruments on their end also... He says to be sure and warn
          Rosenthal of this before he trashes some of that very
          expensive stuff he will use... Tom says because the anomalies
          in such circuits are so radically different from normal
          electromagnetics, to prevent or at the very least ATTEMPT to
          minimize damage to their test devices and circuits.. They have
          adopted the approach of discrete charging only up to fixed
          levels... It is everyone's desire to get the max power out,
          but not at the expense of blown equipment, ruptured parts or
          circuits that burn out, so he thinks once the grad students
          and others start getting into it, they will work convergently
          (as everyone here does) to come up with the bottom line
          details of what works, what doesn't and what will produce
          anomalous effects...&nbsp; So, I have to get those faxes to
          him now, again, he said he is SO VERY PLEASED that everyone is
          working so well together and that the information is being so
          freely shared... ~ Jerry</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bert ~ At the meeting,
          you were talking about energizing an MRA with low level signal
          input, so I gave it a try with a weak stereo preamp. The input
          to the MRA was 0.562VAC and 1.1ma for 6.2mw of input power.
          The output power is only 2.2mw. After an hour, the input power
          power dropped off to 4.2mw as the circuit equivalent
          resistance increased from 510 ohms to 1.0K ohms, and the
          output power stayed the same at 2.2mw, but this is still only
          half of unity. Even given more hours of test, I don't think it
          will make unity. It's possible that the weak potential and
          resulting current are not enough to create the flux density
          and piezo effect that we need. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          circuit "Guru". Loves to play on the soldering bench. I would
          like to get your comments on the 12VDC powered audio amp test
          we did where the total current draw went down from an idle
          draw reading to a reading with the MRA in the circuit. Do you
          have reasonable explanation for this. Joel says that this
          little Radio Shack Stereo booster 40W amp is "class C"
          therefore can only go up on current draw when a load is
          applied. If idle DC current draw is 344 Ma and goes down to
          192 Ma when the MRA is attached then what are we seeing.&nbsp;
          Should we attach a thermocouple to the output transistors to
          see if they are making "ice"?&nbsp; That is the only
          phenomenon that we have not found that is usually associated
          with ZPE type devices. For those that are new to the ZPE or
          "Space Vacuum tapping" scene there have been numerous reports
          of over-unity type devices that usually have one or more of
          the following phenomenon associated with their&nbsp;
          operation. (1) Over-unity output of energy of some sort
          whether it be heat, electrical, mechanical or light. (2)
          Weight loss, anti-gravity tendencies. (3) Cooling in the

          invented. Almost immediately, it began to exhibit over-unity
          characteristics. However, there have also been a lot of
          "quirky" effects...each taken separately might have been test
          equipment error or technician error.&nbsp; However, these
          effects are forming familiar patterns now...familiar but not
          always predictable. The toll in dead and damaged test
          equipment so far is one panel mount DVM, one frequency
          counter, two audio amplifiers, and numerous 60watt light
          bulbs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sometimes, when supplying
          the MRA from a 12VDC powered audio amp, the battery current
          will decrease compared to the battery current to the amp with
          no load at all, and at the same time, amp output voltage will
          increase...taken together, this indicates that the MRA is
          feeding energy back into the amp. Later, with no changes to
          the circuit, the MRA will behave like a normal load, and cause
          a small increase in battery current with a small decrease in
          amp output voltage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The voltage and current
          waveforms look like dotted lines, where each dot and space
          segment is equal to 175KHz, which Norm and I believe is the
          free running resonant frequency of ferrmagnetism. We have
          never seen this before, and for that matter, neither has
          anyone else that we've talked to about it. Even with nothing
          on Channel B of the 'scope, the display will exhibit the
          dotted line effect whenever the MRA is running and connected
          to Channel A.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Anything and everything in
          the field of the MRA is affected.&nbsp; Should the MRA's
          output load become accidentally disconnected while the MRA is
          at resonance, an instantaneous and very powerful destructive
          surge will occur.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I THINK that the MRA, by
          resonating a magnet at mass aggregate frequency, is
          magnetically "linking" with everything in its field, and
          behaving like an "energy pump". We see this when we walk up to
          it and the output from the MRA goes up, even though the MRA is
          hooked up to a resistive load which is causing it to provide
          current. This also changes based upon the time of day relative
          to sunrise and set.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To test anything, you first
          must isolate it... By virtue of the design of the MRA, it
          cannot be isolated. It intrinsically links itself to
          everything with a coil or magnetic field, even to a quartz
          wristwatch if it is in the same room. As such, we get varying
          power gains, and the variations seem more to be a question of
          which test equipment is on the table at the time of the test.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Please bear in mind that
          this is a brand new circuit...as far as that goes, it's a
          whole new technology. Once the magnet has been resonated, and
          then disconnected from the rest of the circuit, it will
          continue to provide up to 25VAC at 60Hz using a human
          "antenna" to capture ambient energy in the room. Last night,
          Norm and I were measuring over-unity gains of 2X-3X, but we
          don't really know for sure if we were "pumping" the energy
          electromagnetically out of the test equipment, house wiring,
          earth's magnetic field, the ether, or some combination of the
          above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We need some independent
          testing by individuals with awareness of the anomalies
          mentioned in this message. There is obviously a lot of power
          "in flux" which collapses into the MRA if the load is removed,
          so there will probably be more equipment lost. There is also a
          whole area of gravitic anomalies to investigate, because the
          piezo will weigh measurably less when it is in the MRA
          circuit, and regain the weight when it is disconnected.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The original MRA is being
          sent out for engineering review, from which we hope to learn
          more, but the more voices that are heard from, the better our
          chances of finding out what is really happening.&nbsp; ~ Joel</font>

          the same frequency which is affecting our oscilloscope trace.
          Since the MRA is sensitive to sunset/sunrise, is it then going
          to exhibit higher gains at ley lines and grid intersections?
          With more power applied, will the MRA achieve zero gravity?

          They make driver IC/OP amps that will run on +/- 600VDC
          (1200VDC total swing) at .5A, and other power parts. They also
          have some parts that are speced to 15,000V/uS Dv/Dt.&nbsp;
          Dv/Dt maybe what is burning up things rather than the absolute

          if rises slow enough, to fast a rise and you've got toasted

          ($30-$500), but can still be a bargain when you considered the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Daniel ~ If we need RMS
          power for comparison with, for example, changes in the input
          power, yes we use the constant multiplier of 0.707, which is
          in the file info that we provided.&nbsp; Whether this is the
          exact phase angle for this circuit, without vector analysis,
          we don't know. The reason why we can't be sure is that we are
          vectoring harmonics for the express purpose of altering the
          effective impedance of the circuit. This is NOT what they
          teach at DeVry, but it is how it works. However, the world
          accepts the cosine of theta at 0.707 as the normal AC circuit
          power factor multiplier, so we use it.&nbsp; To the extent
          that the calculated output power performs the correct amount
          of work, such as driving a motor, it is as close as we can
          determine to be accurate. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          could not get any output from the secondary no matter how much
          I increased the input to the piezo. The only way I solved the
          problem was to swap sides on the circuit, in other words swap
          the output leads over to the input and vice versa then it took
          off running again. Glad this is a 1:1 turn ratio winding. This

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ Tested the
          "monster" MRA with two magnets, large coils and four piezos.
          First tested it with low power from the sig gen only, then
          with the amplifier. Since the piezos were in parallel, I
          tested both parallel and series connections. Also tested just
          the transformer, with no piezos. The transformer alone is just
          under unity (half of one percent difference in power) at
          144.5KHz. With all of the piezos in the circuit, the power out
          ratio dropped off.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Found that the best gain was
          with only one piezo, which added 1.2% over unity with the sig
          gen alone, and 11.8% with the amplifier. I used a regulated
          12VDC 10A power supply to power the amplifier, so that there
          would be no chance of current dropping off as load was added,
          and found that the additional drain to the supply with the MRA
          connected was 40ma. It took 180 ohms of equivalent load on the
          output of the amp to produce the same 40ma increase, so the
          MRA "looks like" 180 ohms to the output of the amp. That is
          the effective impedance of the MRA, which we can use to
          determine current and power into the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With 9.73VAC output from the
          amp at 180 ohms, and 18.8VAC from the MRA at 600 ohms, we have
          372mw RMS into the MRA and 416mw RMS out, which is 1.12 times
          unity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I think that the reason why
          the gain isn't higher is that the difference between max power
          out of the MRA and max power gain of the MRA is too wide of a
          spread in frequency. We used 85% as a "rule of&nbsp; thumb"
          with the first MRA, but this one requires 70% change, which
          puts us on the edges of the resonant range, and we lose much
          of the power of the harmonics. I'm not sure whether this is a
          result of using two magnets or more wire or a combination of
          the two, but the best power gains seem to occur where the freq
          spread between max power and max gain is less. We'll have to
          experiment with number of turns on a single magnet to find the
          "sweet spot"... no pun intended. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bob - Your guru is right.
          The current drop was seen on a DVM, and is likely caused by a
          meter error as a result of the surge at power-on. Also, a drop
          in input voltage would naturally cause a corresponding drop in
          input current, so we are using a ten amp regulated supply to
          avoid that pitfall. The current increases by 40ma after the
          initial surge, as measured on an analog meter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Michael - The aggregate
          resonant frequency is between 34KHz and 35KHz, although we
          found the resonant frequency of the magnet to be around 8KHz
          to 11KHz. The 174.9KHz is what we believe to be the resonant
          frequency of ferromagnetism, based upon Tesla's experiments
          and some of our own.&nbsp; We don't see this in the circuit on
          an oscilloscope, but we see wave chopping at this rate.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bill - The signals which we
          are inputting and extracting are all sinusoidal. We're using
          battery power as much as possible,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">although the sig gen is AC
          powered, and we've had to use a 12VDC supply to avoid battery
          drops during measurements. I'm not sure what the retrace or
          refresh rates are for this scope, but it should be higher than
          175KHz on a 80MHz scope, I would guess. Yes, I know how the
          "observer effect" is interpreted in mainstream science, except
          for the folks who work at particle accelerators who have both
          seen and documented it. There is an "interconnectedness of all
          things", but once it's measurable, mainstream science jumps
          all over it. God bless them, every one.</font> </p>

          anomalous energy fields that will show up to 27VAC on a meter
          with everything turned off it is possible to use the device as

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was an error in
          message # 10148...the MRA tested today was made by Norm for
          test, and has a two to one step up ratio, i.e., 150 turns on
          the primary, 300 turns on the secondary. From what I can
          measure, this is superior to the original one-to-one ratio of
          the first MRA, which I wound to test theory. Makes sense
          though, because as the magnet inhales energy, the more
          secondary you have, the more energy will be collected for the
          load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, have noticed that when
          light bulbs (ordinary 60W bulbs) blow, they do so with great
          vigor and a brighter than normal flash. The filament is
          exploded off of its posts, and flies around the inside of the
          bulb with enough force to leave striations on the glass.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the past, I have
          associated this with an accumulation of virtual particles on
          the neutral lines of the house (from other experiments). This
          accumulation causes the lines to superconduct when a light
          switch is turned on, because the neutral is no longer neutral
          but at an elevated virtual potential.&nbsp; The effect is the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ I don't think that
          all combinations of piezo and magnet types will work. The
          evolution in the original design was first, the resonating of
          a magnet, and determining the resonant range of the magnet,
          and second, adding a piezo which would resonate three octaves
          above the magnet. The magnets which we are using will "sing" a
          pure tone at just over 8KHz, and double that is 16KHz, and
          double that is 32KHz. The freqs that we are applying to our
          MRAs is beween 34 and 35KHz.&nbsp; This is also just below the
          peak resonant range of the piezos which we are using, and
          which were originally designed for ultrasonic welding.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The lattice structure of the
          piezo and magnet should also be compatible in order to get the
          harmonics... cube lattices, which are nested tetrahedrons.
          First wind a primary and secondary around your magnet, and
          apply a variable frequency to the primary while watching the
          secondary on a scope or high freq meter. Where the secondary
          output peaks, you have the resonant freq for the magnet.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Use that to find a piezo
          which has a resonant range three octaves higher. The easiest
          thing would be for you to use the same parts that we are
          using...they have already been found to be harmonious. If you
          want to experiment with what you have available, that's fine
          too, and may yield more and better results, or at least useful
          data on which combinations don't work until you find one that
          does. You will have to keep your mass aggregate freq well
          below 100KHz, or you will be above the alpha cutoff freq of
          audio xistors and diodes...you won't be able to get DC out, in
          other words. Let us know what you want to do. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          device</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ As Paul Harvey
          would say, now here's the "rest of the story" on the MRA as an
          energy pump.&nbsp; The energy source is the earth magnetic
          field, which gets its power from the combination of rotation
          and solar wind from the sun, so the MRA is technically a solar
          power device.&nbsp; As the MRA "warms up", it is extending its
          vortex upward and "linking" with layered fields of the
          atmosphere.&nbsp; At each link point, you will see the MRA
          output increase by a specific quantum interval.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA is attracting the
          electromagnetic energies, and funneling them back to the
          magnet, through the coils, which couple a portion of the
          energy to the load.&nbsp; Other conductors which are in the
          path of the vortex also collect energy, specifically the
          neutral wires. You can reduuce the output of the MRA by
          detuning it, and within a&nbsp;&nbsp; few hours, the output
          will be back up as a result of the quantum linked increases,
          and regardless of the energy applied to drive the MRA's
          oscillations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BTW, the MRA does have max
          output when the coils are aligned with magnetic north and
          south...and drops off when the coils are aligned toward east
          and west. You are going to have a LOT of fun with this! ~ Joel</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ I THINK that we
          have a 'magic square' relationship with the magnet, because
          when it was resonated in the 'monster' test, it was almost at
          unity (with no piezo) at 144.5KHz.&nbsp; If we divide 144.5 by
          17.5, we get 8.25KHz, and three octaves up is the mass
          aggregate frequency of the MRA. Why divide by 17.5?&nbsp;
          Because it is the Khz multiple of 175KHz, the ferroresonant
          frequency.&nbsp; Another piece of the puzzle is now in place.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because we are resonating

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The purpose of this message
          is to introduce a new term to describe the type of components
          which are used in tuned resonant devices. In the past,
          "active" has been used to describe switching parts, such as
          vacuum tubes and transistors. "Passive" is used to describe
          components such as carbon resistors, and "reactive" to
          describe coils and capacitors, which react to changes in
          frequency by altering their impedance to the flow of current.
          All of these devices consume power in application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">None of these apply very
          well to components that consume power but which also use
          resonance to tap the ether for equal or greater power than
          that which they consume. Therefore, to fill the void in usable
          vocabulary, I suggest the term "creactive".&nbsp; The term
          implies that something is created, which is NOT the
          case...energy cannot be created...however, the EFFECT of
          actively resonating material for the TRANSLATING of energies
          gives the appearance of creating energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The components are not
          creactive unless and until they are in the process of creating
          the effect. This should not be too confusing, as the same
          relationship exists with other components. A coil, for
          example, has no impedance...only resistance...to DC current.
          It is passive to DC, and reactive to AC. If anyone has a
          better terms to suggest, or sees any technical problem with
          "creactive", please let me know. Thanks!</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Norm, last month I was
          plotting sine waves using Mathcad trying to determine what
          Keely was doing with his destructive use of harmonics. It
          appeared to me that he was subtracting out the 3rd, 9th, 27th,
          81st, 243rd &amp; etc. harmonics from the 1st harmonic. The
          6th harmonic may have been added to create a shrinking effect
          on a molecule however? He kept saying that large impulses were
          being created when he was plucking his strings. The
          frequencies that were creating these impulses seemed to be in
          the terahertz range which he deduced from his vibrating
          hydrogen bubbles and the refracted and reflected light
          waves.&nbsp; Anyway, while plotting numerous combinations of
          harmonics a pattern started to emerge that blew my mind. There
          appeared to be the formation of a normal low frequency sine
          wave that was being chopped into regular occurring parts.
          These parts were created when large spikes of higher
          frequencies with fast rise times would shoot up and down from
          the ends of each part.&nbsp; As each succeeding harmonic was
          subtracted, the amplitude of the impulses became greater. I
          was not able to go beyond the 243rd harmonic because of
          Mathcad's limitations in plotting points. Keely was dealing
          with very high frequencies, even though each individual
          harmonic at these frequencies was not very powerful by itself
          the combined harmonics I feel produce tremendous pulses that
          could rip apart most any substance. There appeared also a
          pattern of smoothing the chopped sine wave as the higher
          harmonics were being subtracted. You might be seeing these
          effects on your scope when testing the MRA circuit. The dual
          trace feature on the scope could be also causing trouble as
          already suggested. If it is, throw the dammed thing out and
          use a pendulum or a pair of divining rods! One thing that
          keeps popping up in Mrs. Moore's book on Keely is that Keely
          seemed to be using segmented silver, gold and platinum wires
          as well as some bar stock attached to his devices as band pass
          filters. This appeared to allow him to pass selected
          frequencies to various parts of his apparatus in the proper
          sequence.&nbsp; The idea that he produced all frequencies at
          the same time does not seem to be true. There appears to be a
          very definite sequence of frequencies applied that created the
          required harmonics. Those using sound boards in their
          computers should be aware by now that digital producing sine
          waves are really chunky when dealing with high
          frequencies.&nbsp; The Mathcad simulation that I use really
          brings this home when using less points. Great numbers of
          points are needed to produce the finer details that are
          required to observe some of the above sine wave chopping.</font>

          calculate gain because this is an effective output impedance
          greater than infinity. Supply voltage to the amp was 11.89
          volts DC from a ten amp regulated supply and did not vary at
          all. Somehow, the MRA is increasing the impedance of the amp
          to the DC supply, possibly reducing the conduction of
          transistors. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          what you maybe dealing with is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
          Amplifier. As you are flipping the Magnetic fields in the
          magnetic core you are producing Energy; the question is at
          what cost. The following simple and inexpensive procedures may
          answer a few questions and raise many more.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">IF possible introduce a low
          level radio active material close to you device. The radium
          dial on a watch or any object that glows in the dark when
          exposed to sunlight or better yet a small amount of a radio
          active element... record radiation levels before and after a
          24 hr exposure to device.&nbsp; In case of a glow in the dark
          element determine how long it will glow before exposure to
          device and than after exposure to device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next take 2 equal amounts of
          water...using one as a control expose the other to device
          Have water checked by a chemist for changes...(extra elections
          or ions) or lack of also see if water is being broken down by
          electrochemical reaction with device....</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is my belief your device
          may have some rather interesting effects at low power levels
          and some very dangerous effects as size and power are
          increased... It is possible to upset the balance of matter
          only so far before things start to happen Materials may start
          changing or in some cases start coming apart in unusual
          ways...This device may have applications in areas other than
          free energy which need to be explored and may hold even
          greater promise...Consider the possibility of reducing or
          using spent nuclear material or waste as a source of direct
          energy. Extracting the deadly radiation and turning it into
          electrical energy. This may also apply to complex chemical
          chains with high atomic numbers.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">As has been observed and
          noted by a number of people who have written about there
          experience with this device on the internet...They feel that
          there is a field of influence around this object (flux fields,
          draws power from surrounding areas).</font> </p>

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you have not done so, you
          could put the current-sample resistor in series with the

          ground the scope to the same terminal, use one channel to look
          at the other end of the resistor, and the other to look at the

          Brock on Internet the fact that since I am also experimenting
          with "Cold Fusion" and have been doing so since back in 1987
          (before Pons &amp; Fleischman), that I have already seen the
          corelationship with the "transmutation" that is occurring in
          the cold fusion cells that John Bockris down at A&amp;M is
          most excited about. I have a Mills Nickel &amp; Potassium
          Carbonate cell running that gets cooler as it runs instead of
          emitting heat as normal. If the cell is absorbing energy in an
          endothermic reaction then the only conclusion is that some
          sort of "transmutation is taking place. It is my intent to
          couple the MRA effect to the "cold Fusion" effect to determine

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Last night I left a message
          for Norm describing a decrease in current to an amplifier as
          having theoretical greater than infinity impedance for
          purposes of calculating power gain. That has been bugging me
          ever since, so I went back to the drawing board.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In MRA theory, the phase
          relationship of harmonics is used to reduce the current flow
          from the input source. This results in a nonlinear power in |
          power out relationship, or ratio. This is mentioned in the
          file MRA1.ASC here on KeelyNet. This is actually done by
          tuning the input frequency to the MRA for maximum AC output on
          its output terminals, then DEtuning the MRA for the most
          favorable power gain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Detuning causes powerful
          harmonics to oppose the flow of input current, while
          continuing to contribute to the circulating current in the
          primary coil. This alters the EFFECTIVE impedance, and gives
          the MRA its gain. So far, so good. But what do we make of it
          when this effective impedance causes the input power of the
          amp to decline? The lowest level of input, in theory, is in
          "standby" mode, with no load attached, so that in measurement
          terms, the amp "sees" a resistor of infinite ohms on its
          output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Up until now, the signal
          input from the signal generator to the amp has not been given
          serious consideration because of its extremely low power,
          0.1mw at the input of the amp. However, this signal biases the
          transistors in the amp. As the MRA's output power increases,
          the signal at the output of the sig gen also increases,
          indicating that the amp's input impedance increases directly
          with its input and output power. Detuning the MRA causes an
          exact reversal of this process. It was found that at 3.3VAC @
          600 ohms output from the MRA, the transistors are at only 55%
          conduction.&nbsp; So, it is not the power from the signal
          source that DIRECTLY affects output power, but the PHASE of
          the input relative to the reflected phase of the harmonics
          from the MRA that cause the reduction in input current to the
          amp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I know that this is hard to
          visualize without the equipment sitting in front of you, but
          for those who will eventually build an MRA, this information
          may be useful. Now, how do we calculate gain when the input
          current to the amp decreases under the "load" of the MRA? We
          have to see the MRA as producing MHOS, the opposite of OHMS
          (yes, MHOS exist in theory... I'm not making this up). Due to
          the effects of interphase relationships, the load (MRA)
          crosses the line from being a load to being a source, and the
          extent to which it reduces amp power is gain IFF a
          corresponding output gain is seen or if the MRA output stays
          the same while input power decreases.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MHOS from the MRA, by
          forcing the transistors to conduct below standby levels, are
          using power which is "borrowed" from the secondary circuit.
          The power at the secondary is not "free" just because the
          input power to the amp is less than standby. The output power
          of the MRA also drops, so there is no gain at this point. The
          reduced conduction below standby crosses a threshold where the
          harmonic content "cuts off its own nose" by reducing input
          power below the level where harmonics are beneficial, i.e., to
          the point where circulating current in the primary is reduced
          to a level which causes unity or less gain.&nbsp; Bad Mhos,
          bad...no dessert for you! Your comments are welcome. ~ Joel</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ Yes, the MRA draws
          power from outside of itself.&nbsp; That is because the core
          is a magnet, and a magnet is in a constant state of collapse
          which is why it tries to "pull in" materials with similar
          lattice structures... to fill the energy void which was
          created when it was first magnetized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA allows the magnet to
          attempt to restore its matter/energy balance, or to
          demagnetize itself...slowly. We are resonating the magnet and
          it responds by collapsing energy into itself, via the coils
          which pick up this "surplus" energy and deliver it to a load.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The total energy drawn
          before the magnet is no longer a magnet will be less than the
          energy "stored" in its imbalance. If there was a "radioactive"
          reaction, it would have been immediate and very large in the
          original magnetization process, yet magnetizing is considered
          to be safe.</font> </p>

          and in the MRA files that the MRA is an energy absorber, which
          we have seen evidenced, but which I can now prove. Set up your
          MRA in 85% mode, and let it "warm up". Then, reset the
          secondary output to half of the maximum output voltage by
          further detuning the input frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Put an aluminum foil shield
          over it (I'm using an old pyramid made of kite sticks and

          getting to the MRA. Remove the shield, and the output&nbsp;
          goes right back up. Because aluminum is non-ferrous, the gain

          The MRA circuit is the same effect, you have to use sine wave

          magnet at 3 octave separation or you get "NO CIGAR".&nbsp;

          impedance of the circuit is slightly over 2500 ohms, and the
          power gain is 14.3, with the motor load. It came up within a
          half hour of powering it up...output and input voltages both
          climbing until the DC out was 15% less than max, while the
          voltage applied climbed until there was no drop across the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I used the decade box across

          and melted them into the solder balls. I think that this works
          because it doesn't break through the oxide coating. Reminds me
          of Bearden's concept, the "old wire" idea... only works if you

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ I just did the
          "ultimate" test of the MRA, proving that it is over unity even
          if you assume that the amplifier which feeds it is 100%
          efficient. I measured actual AC current to the amplifier, both
          with the MRA connected and disconnected.&nbsp; The difference
          at 120VAC is 12ma. This means that 12ma times 120VAC = 1.44W X
          .707 = 1.02W into the amplifier. The MRA is, at the same time,
          supplying DC output power to a motor of 12VDC at 140ma, for
          1.68W.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, even if you assume that
          the amplifier is 100% efficient, which it definitely is not,
          the MRA is still 61% over unity. This is a bottom line number
          to cut through the haze of "power factor" questions, and end
          the discussion of whether it is over unity, so we can
          determine exactly HOW MUCH it is over unity. I don't think
          that anyone will suggest that the Radio Shack amplifier is
          over unity, so the gain can&nbsp; only be coming from one
          place, and since it's DC off the bridge, it is true power. ~

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This guy Bob Jewett on
          internet pointed out a measurement problem which I had not
          noticed. Voltage measurements across a resistor CANNOT be done
          as two measurements referenced to a third point if phase is
          variable.&nbsp; In some common resonant circuits, the voltage
          on either end of a resistor could be way out of phase with
          respect to common, yet the peak and the rms voltages on the
          resistor ends would be identical. So if you measure each end
          separately, you see the same voltage, and assume the current
          is zero. But if you measure ACROSS the resistor, you see a
          large (real) voltage, and discover the current is large.&nbsp;
          So, measurements must be done with a floating meter across the
          resistor, or with a dualtrace scope in differential mode and
          the two probes placed across the resistor. Or you can always
          move the position of the resistor in the circuit so that one
          end is the same as the common point of all the test equipment,
          then measure from the common point to the 'high' side with
          less chance of mistakes caused by phase.</font> </p>

          all night and ran the I/O test again, comparing the AC power
          into the amp with the DC power out of the MRA under a motor
          load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The audio amp now draws 3ma
          LESS line current from the 120VAC input when the MRA is on the
          output of the amplifier.&nbsp; The motor is running along with
          10.6VDC at 140ma of power from the MRA.&nbsp; The MRA is
          forcing the amp's transistors out of conduction, which is seen
          by the line input as a lower load requirement to the power
          supply of the amp, or basically as a higher resistance to
          input current. This means that the MRA is producing Mhos,
          which it could be using for its own circulating current, but
          instead is using to drive down current from the amp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I compared this with the
          Universal Resonance Curve for series resonant circuits by
          first changing the input freq until the MRA was out of
          resonance, then bringing it to full output, then reducing the
          gain by increasing the frequency. The MRA, out of resonance,
          causes a 3ma increase in line current just by being connected
          to the amp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a series resonant
          circuit, the MRA has theoretical zero impedance (limited to
          copper loss) at peak resonance, which is its max power output
          point. DEtuning the MRA by increasing the frequency should
          decrease the input current, which it does.&nbsp; However, at
          the 65% point of relative resonance, which is where it is now,
          the resonance curve intersects with the phase angle of applied
          current from the amp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the "knee" of the
          input current phase angle rise. The current should continue to
          rise, but is being forced down by the harmonic content of the
          MRA at resonance, as seen by the decrease in input current to
          the amplifier... not just below the non-resonant load of the
          MRA, but below no-load. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ We have tried both
          methods of measurement, and the problem which we have is that
          there is very high voltage multiplication across both elements
          of the series resonant circuit. We are dealing with typical
          Q's of over 100, which is normal in a series resonant circuit,
          but which make a voltage drop measurement meaningless. So, we
          measure the equivalent load using a precision decade box, or
          as most recently we measure the delta in input power to the
          audio amp, which will decrease under the output load of the
          MRA at 65% of the resonant peak. Phase isn't just variable,
          it's 180 degrees out relative to the</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">individual components.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No matter where you put a
          resistor in the series resonant circuit, you will measure a
          drop which is the result of multiplied voltage. But you can't
          fool a decade box. When you remove the MRA and put the decade
          box in its place, and set the resistors to give the same delta
          in applied voltage, you know EXACTLY how much current is being
          drawn. If you use a current probe, which we have also done,
          you also see the multiplied voltage, because the pickup of the
          probe is a coil. I would think that, based upon his question,
          Bob Jewett is aware of these considerations. His assumption
          that you will see a high voltage drop is correct, because you
          are measuring the difference in multiplied voltages... now IF
          you want to relate this to actual INPUT voltage, divide this
          drop by the multiplication factor of the circuit, and you will
          have the voltage which you can use for current measurement,
          and which agrees exactly with the decade box.</font> </p>

          lot of thought into the high power test of the MRA device.
          Since you have determined that the circuit is creating what we
          call Mhos and usually this phenomenon is associated with
          vacuum tubes in operation and going back to the work of T.
          Henry Moray with his "valve" then I am setting up this 250
          watt tube power amp for the ultimate test. Since transistors
          seem to not be able to take the bucking effect of the "first
          harmonic" check in the input current into the circuit we
          should use the vacuum tube for this final stage of signal
          injection into the MRA series resonant primary. The "finals"
          tubes then are basically in the series circuit and will
          survive the punishment brought on by the "hammering" effect of
          the first harmonic. These large output tubes will display more
          of your "Mhos" effect than simple transistors. I still
          believe, (I keep dreaming about it) that the vacuum tube
          should play a part in the circuit as a "coherer" of the ZPE
          into the circuit. Certainly worth trying for we are at the
          point where we need to push the piezo's at their design power
          ratings of 50 watts at 150 Volts. There will be some serious
          voltages developed in the series resonant primary for we have
          already seen nearly 1000 Volts circulating with only 20 volts
          of primary input. A vacuum tube is the only animal that could
          survive the punishment in a high voltage circuit like this.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ You made a
          suggestion a while back about going into the amplifier output
          section and measuring current from an isolated point. That was
          done this morning, measuring both voltage and current into and
          out of the isolation transformer. It was easy, because the
          xfmr leads are wire wrapped to pins on top of the pcb.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The input to the isolation
          transformer is consuming 2.4 watts, and the output is
          measuring 1.9 watts, while the MRA is providing 2.3 watts,
          which is less than the input to the isolation transformer, but
          more than the output. Since the secondary of the isolation
          transformer is part of the "voltage multiplied" primary of the
          MRA, its power at 1.9 watts may be overstated... but
          regardless, the MRA output is above it by 26%, and that is DC,
          after a bridge rectifier. MRA primary current was decreasing
          while the secondary output was increasing, but I took a
          reading rather than wait all day to see exactly where it would
          go.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Increasing power to the MRA
          (went up to 20VDC out on a 19.1VDC rated motor) increased the
          ratio to 30%. What this is saying is that the gain of the MRA
          is high enough so that it doesn't matter whether you measure
          primary current direct in-line across multiplied voltage...
          it's still over unity.&nbsp; Now I really don't know what to
          test next. Suggestions? ~ Joel</font> </p>

          crazy?&nbsp; I had no intention to just turn the switch on a
          250 Watt amp driving the piezo. What I said is that we need to
          substitute a vacuum tube amp in the circuit instead of the
          puny transistors we are now using so we can proceed in the
          power test. I like you agree with caution on something we are
          not really sure of the true nature of the beast. Don't worry,
          there is no intention of running very significant amounts of

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even if the whole circuit is
          floating, the oscillator's 'common' terminal will act as a
          reference point, and the high voltages across the piezo and
          magnet then should not mess up the input measurements. Simply
          multiply the two RMS voltage readings, divide by 2.0 ohms, and
          you'll know the worst case input power (as close as the RMS
          meter can tell you, that is.) If you've already tried the
          above measurement, does it give overunity numbers? If it
          won't, then there may be something screwy with the other
          measurements. I would trust the above setup. If a dual-channel
          scope is substituted for the RMS meters (with the scope's
          common lead going to the oscillator common terminal) you
          should be able to see the current and voltage waveforms at the
          same time, so phase can be observed directly, ending lots of
          arguments. Whaddaya think? ~ Bill</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~&nbsp; Thank you
          for the diagram.&nbsp; I'm going to tell you some things in
          this message which will make no sense to you in terms of
          conventional electronics... but I've put in close to 90 test
          hours with the MRA so far, and these are reproducible
          constants for the circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tom Bearden has been quoted
          as saying "... think backwards" when you are dealing with
          devices of this type, and in many ways this is true. The MRA
          primary is a Tesla coil which is being fed by the matching
          xfmr secondary of the signal generator.&nbsp; As with any
          Tesla coil, there is voltage multiplication, and this appears
          across every element of the completed primary circuit,
          including the signal generator's output xfmr secondary.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of this, you will
          measure a voltage across the signal generator output secondary
          which is higher under load than it is at no-load. In a
          conventional xfmr, this is not possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After you turn on the MRA,
          and for a period of hours afterwards, you will see the DC
          output climb in increments while the MRA primary current drops
          in increments and the signal generator output secondary
          voltage goes above no-load. This is the opposite of a normal
          power supply.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you add a resistor
          anywhere in the MRA primary circuit, the primary current will
          increase... also the opposite of a typical transformer, where
          resistors are used to decrease current. While the primary
          current is increasing, the output DC is dropping, also the
          opposite of what you would expect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA can be tuned to
          drive down AC line current below no-load, and still produce
          usable power. As far as primary current, the only way that
          I've been able to measure it is inline, with a meter that has
          a freq range of 200KHz, and even the tiny voltage drop of the
          inline meter will increase current and lower output DC.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very few of the "old rules"
          apply in a circuit which is adding power to the applied power
          at resonance. It's like having an external power source in the
          middle of the circuit, and in fact, that is what you have. The
          piezo is adding free electrons and the magnet is acting like a
          generator, and the combination equals unity plus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You will have to see this
          for yourself... I still do, every day in fact just to make
          sure it's real. It is. Have fun! ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ Tom Bearden and
          others have reported the effect of "cold current" in free
          energy devices, and so the question comes up regarding the
          MRA, "where's the cold current?" I've taken the MRA's
          temperature at all inputs and outputs, and everything is 5-10
          degrees warmer than ambient air, except for one place. There
          is one place where the temp is the same as ambient, and it is
          a path in the series circuit which should read warmer, like
          all of the other paths... so, there is some cooling, but not a
          lot of it under low level input and output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That location is the wires
          connecting the piezo to the primary, which should be as warm
          as the other wires in the series circuit, but these wires stay
          at room temp. That is the location where we should see "blue
          light" on camera film. Now that Tom has seen the schematic, if
          we ask him where we should see it, I bet he'll know. ~ Joel</font>

          "wrong" --- things don't happen that fast. Our intent was to
          get the fundamentals out for all to see and experiment with.
          The most important document in the MRA project is the

          You are thinking of Transconductance (gm [small G with small

          several people that make Transconductance IC's now (Maxim and

          given tube, if Eg varies by some amount the Ip will vary by a
          certain amount. Tubes having the ability of&nbsp; producing a
          relatively wide Ip variation with a given Eg&nbsp; variation
          have high values of transconductance. Gm = DIp /

          A vacuum tube is the only animal that could survive the

          indestructible transistors won't cut it in this harsh
          environment. You're right a normal transistor would never
          survive this, but check out the IGBT's and MCTs in that Harris

          has some MOSFETs that get up in the 1000+ range, and

          apples, I've tested the MRA at both of the output levels which
          are important, Maximum Power and Maximum Gain, using the
          resistive equivalent load method. The measurements were made
          to attain the same signal source voltage drop as when the MRA
          is in the circuit as well as to measure the current in series
          with the decade box at those voltage drops.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The applied voltage is
          23.75VAC from a signal source. At Maximum Power, this voltage
          dropped to 21.9VAC. At Maximum gain, it dropped to 23.25VAC.
          At Maximum Power, the equivalent resistance to obtain a signal
          voltage drop to 21.9VAC is 165 ohms, and the measured current
          is 132ma. At Maximum Gain, the equivalent resistance to obtain
          a signal voltage drop to 23.25VAC is 595 ohms, and the
          measured current is 40ma. Input power is calculated using the
          above measurements to be 2.04W RMS at Maximum Power, and 658mw
          RMS at Maximum Gain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The output power for this
          test was in rectified and filtered DC voltage applied across a

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At Maximum Power, the output
          voltage w 18.38VDC, and power was therefore 2.57W. This is a

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At Maximum Gain, the output
          voltage was 15.5VDC, and power was therefore 2.17W. This is a
          gain of 1.51W, or 3.30 times unity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The measurements were made
          in the linear output region of the signal source, where
          variations in the resistive values, either higher or lower,
          would cause corresponding changes in applied voltage and
          series current. The pattern of current increases and decreases
          is the same as is seen when "live" measurements are taken in
          the MRA primary circuit. However, the live measurements in the
          circuit when it is reactive and therefore has multiplied
          voltages present do not conform to Ohm's Law, and are not
          considered to be reliable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any losses which occur as a
          result of rectifying and filtering the AC to DC are considered
          as a "cost of doing business", because DC is useful for
          powering a load, and 34KHz is not. Therefore, these losses are
          not factored into the power gain measurement. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That's excellent news on the
          MRA gain measurements. I am very unsure about this voltage
          multiplying effect as applied to any series resistors or
          components within the oscillator. In a series-resonant
          circuit, the voltage across the coil and capacitor will build
          up hugely because of resonant energy storage, but this will
          not affect the voltage across the current-sampling resistor or
          across the driving oscillator, or across the current probe
          coil (unless the probe coil has a resonant frequency the same
          as the MRA.) But then again, o/u physics could do all kinds of
          unexpected things. It sure would be strange if o/u devices are
          common, but their effects make measurement devices read
          incorrectly and underestimate actual energy "creation."</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The only true way to prove
          that the device works is to make it function as a self-acting
          black box. If the o/u percentage is high enough, the power amp
          could be driven from the DC out of the MRA. Or, as someone on
          the Net suggested, you could connect the MRA output to a
          120vac inverter, and feed that back to normal 120v drive
          equipment. Big losses via inverter efficiency though. It
          definitely should be possible to build a custom amp/oscillator
          having very low supply requirements, so that even a low o/u
          percentage could be made into a self-sustaining energy source.
          Until this is done, there is a chance that we are all fooling
          ourselves. The slowing wristwatches and the self-oscillation
          Norm observed are very good signs this is real.</font> </p>

          which may be useful for experimenters who choose to build and
          test their own MRA. Because we are resonating both the piezo
          and the magnet physically, it is important that the MRA is not
          left in a very cold environment before use. I put one out in a
          cold garage (well below freezing) for two days, and found that
          the magnet is slow to warm up, and as a result, the DC output
          voltage is under 80% of where it was when the MRA was at room
          temperature. Also, it will not detune properly when it is
          cold. In other words, it behaves like an ordinary series
          resonant circuit. Actually, I think it's more like the effect
          a cold car battery, which loses efficiency when it is cold.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If your MRA, particularly
          the magnet, gets cold, let it warm up overnight before you use
          it. These are big magnets, and it takes a long time for them
          to warm up. Even when the surface temperature is warm, the
          magnet is cold inside, and it takes time for it to transfer
          heat. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          suspending the magnet material inside a coil so that it is
          totally free to oscillate or resonate at what ever freq that
          "shakes out". We have had several Keely-Netters suggest the
          same thing but have not gotten around to that phase of
          testing. We have had a suggestion that there may be a "light"
          interface also that we have not investigated.&nbsp; To show
          that you input is valued, I have just finished winding a 4"
          diameter air core coil so we can suspend the magnet inside of
          same so as to be free to resonate. Now the trick, "some
          experimenting here" is to find the best method of suspension.
          I keep thinking about the "chime bar in the ordinary door
          chime" method of suspension.&nbsp; Support at the "node
          points" is the terminology&nbsp; therefore we don't interfere
          with the resonance or attenuate it. I will get back to you
          after we have done some testing on this approach. I will
          deliver this set up to Joel so he can run it through its
          paces. I want to build one that is a full-blown Tesla coil
          with a design freq of 174.9 KHZ so we can couple directly with

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The piezo is adding free
          electrons and the magnet is acting like a generator, and the
          combination equals unity plus. This reminds me of Joe Newman's
          idea where the mass of the wire is converted to energy via E =
          M(C*C). Have you ever put the MRA on a balance scale (A Hooks
          Law scale might be upset via the operation of the MRA, see the
          work of G. Hodowanec, the Gravity Wave Guy)?&nbsp; Is it
          losing mass at almost immeasurably small rate while operating?</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mhos...hmmm...well, per the
          books, it was the closest thing I could find to describe the
          effect...ok, I'll call it by it's proper name: "energy density
          and energy transport in bidirectional EM wave flux to create
          massless displacement current via hidden channel (Whittaker
          Field) phase conjugate pumping" I think I get it now (?). By
          your use of the term Mhos, I think you are implying Negative
          Resistance (Negative power creation), which is entirely
          different than Conductance (measured in the units Mhos).
          Sometimes my "education" gets in the way the Mhos being a case
          in point. Can we come up with a term for Negative Resistance,
          and Negative Power, and avoid the use of Mhos so as not to
          confuse others? Also "Displacement Current" has a text book
          meaning and a "Free Energy" meaning what do we do there?
          Tunnel Diodes exhibit Negative Resistance.&nbsp; Lambda Diodes
          also do too. Tunnel Diodes are expensive these days
          ($50+).&nbsp; But you can make a Lambda Diode out of back to
          back P and N JFETs, connect all like leads together (gate to
          gate, etc).&nbsp; Also the "Black Hole Antenna" work of
          Sutton, where he synthesizes -L/-R/-C. The problem here is
          that none of these really have much to do with Free
          Energy.&nbsp; So where does that leave us? I've read
          Whittakers papers, but the math in them is far beyond my
          abilities today. What I got out of them was that Whittaker
          showed than any Hertzen Wave (Transverse Vector Wave) could be
          broken down into its component Scalar Waves. How does this
          relate to the MRA? I've never quite "Got It" with the phase
          conjugate pumping stuff yet, time for more study. The timeless
          (-t) reflection back to the source point always seemed like a
          fun way to Zap the Zappers....</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ok I've went and dug up
          Physics Today/April 1981 "Applications of optical phase
          conjugation" by Concetto R. Guiliano [Has excellent references
          listed at the end for anyone that's interested]. Am I correct
          in assuming that the MRA is acting as the pilot/reference
          path, and that Aether is acting as the conjugator/source?
          Still feel I'm missing a connection here, I'll go dig out
          Bearden's books....</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the coils which Norm
          and I have wound so far, it appears that 22 gauge stranded
          wire is the best choice. Also, we've experimented with
          different turns ratios, and a step down to the secondary of
          two to one, with 300 turns on the primary and 150 turns on the
          secondary gives good gain ratios, and detunes very well.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, the transformer was
          originally wound as a step-up, so the primary is actually on
          the outside of the secondary, but we don't know yet if this is
          the best way to do it. Time and more experiments will tell. We
          do know that solid wire doesn't work.&nbsp; It will likely
          take a few months before we have collected enough data to
          recommend an absolute best design. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bob ~ When the MRA was
          designed, the intent was to create and above unity device
          based upon earth itself... its magnetic fields and
          frequencies. We've since seen that it is directionally
          sensitive to earth magnetic fields, and that it "responds" to
          sunrise and sunset. For all practical purposes, the MRA at
          resonance is like a funnel with a vacuum device attached to
          the narrow end, collecting energy which becomes more condensed
          as it travels into the funnel, where it is trapped in the
          windings of the transformer by the collapsing magnetic fields.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This then represents an
          excess potential, which we see when the signal input voltage
          is higher under load of the MRA than it is under no-load
          conditions. We also see this when we can reduce the entire AC
          power to the signal source below no-load, while at the same
          time producing usable power from the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to scalar theory,
          the excess potential is a quantum voltage potential which
          reacts according to known non-linear optical (NLO) laws of
          physics. Because the Coulomb gauge transverse potential (CTP)
          exists in all of space-time (also standard physics), small
          amounts of excess potential occur naturally in all
          semiconductors. This interferes with applied EM potential, and
          causes "noise", which is normally filtered out. Thus,
          semiconductors are natural scalar interferometers which
          translate low level amounts of excess potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When two or more
          semiconductors are connected, directly or indirectly in a
          conductive path, a hyperspatial link is formed and the
          translated excess potential will bounce back and forth between
          them within this link, which can produce laser beams. Or, the
          energy may reach the level sufficient to destroy one or more
          devices, or to destroy the semiconductors in the test
          equipment attached to the circuit. This is fully documented in
          the Lawandy experiment at Brown University and described in
          the March 31, 1994 issue of Nature Magazine. A "ping pong"
          effect occurs with semiconductors which have "self-targeted"
          each other, creating spurious bursts of normal EM energy.
          Credit for all of the above information to Tom Bearden, who
          kindly provided it after years of study and research.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now we have two "theories"
          to describe one effect (likely there will be many more) so we
          have to find one that works, in terms of being consistent and
          reproducible. It is, I believe, both. The "earth" theory is
          the "outer" or normal EM description, since we are dealing
          with EM to drive a motor load. The Bearden theory is the
          "inner" description, and provides mathematical exactness to
          the process. We used the "outer" theory to find the lattice
          structures, resonant octave ranges and LC relationship of the
          MRA. That still leaves us with the unseen mechanism by which
          excess potential is realized in the circuit. That is where
          Bearden's "inner channel" theory fills the void in
          understanding with clarity and precision.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is really neither Mhos
          nor negative resistance as I understand it, but the
          translation of low-level CTP energies into usable EM.&nbsp;
          The aspect of the MRA which is unique is that it traps this
          potential and puts it to work driving a load instead of
          building up and creating a NLO laser effect. I believe that
          the energies, as soon as they are translated into EM, are
          "caught" by the magnet and pulled into the resonant circuit,
          where they are measured as excess potential. I hope that this
          message ends up on the I-Net, as it will provide the
          references within conventional, accepted physics that can be
          studied in order to visualize the functioning of the MRA. ~

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ I wound (looser
          than normal) another MRA using #22 stranded wire, the wire
          with the purple insulation.&nbsp; It also has a step-down
          ratio, but with more turns that the first MRA. It is only 1.13
          X unity at max power, but detunes to 12.75 X unity under a
          motor load. This is much better than either of the ones sent
          to Walter or to Tom. This MRA will push the input voltage up
          to over 1.5VAC over no-load, while still powering the motor,
          which means that it has more excess potential than either of
          the others, and this shows up in the 2900 ohms of effective
          impedance at the max gain setting.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, since some piezos work
          well and others don't, I'm trying to locate the variable which
          determines this. In measuring the capacitance of the good
          piezo in the current MRA, it shows definite variance in
          capacitance when you reverse the leads from the meter. It
          measures 5nf in one direction, and 3nf when the meter leads
          are reversed. Comparing this with other piezos in the "reject"
          pile, most have lower capacitance and little if any difference
          when the leads are reversed. I think that this is related to
          the poling of the piezos... possibly it is lost on some in the
          process of soldering them. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          in the MRA files. The Fluke 87 True RMS meter specs in the
          Fluke catalog are listed as 20KHz max. I don't know if this
          means the tolerance is only good to that point, or whether
          that is the half-power point. I don't have the complete
          spec.&nbsp; This implies that the meter is not good to 200KHz
          as was said earlier, and its possible that all the readings
          taken with it are wrong. What say you? Have you tried crude
          calibrations of this meter versus a scope, when both read the
          output of a good oscillator that's fairly constant with
          frequency? Could you do a cross-check to find out where the

          Mountain" is going to get a care package, for we can't have
          Tesla experimenting with inferior parts. Ha! Ha! Just kidding,
          will send you the "real" thing to experiment with. We have
          been using filters on the DC bridge, mine is bigger than
          Joel's cap for I have been useing 16000 UF @ 60V while Joel is
          using something smaller. The only problem with a big cap is
          you have to be a little more patient with changing values and
          adjustments for it takes a little time for the cap to bleed of
          or build up with variations in the output but it is "pure" DC.
          All the measurements are cross checked by scope and the DC out
          from a filtered bridge is flat line DC. You are correct with
          the piezo freqs for most of these circuits settle out with a
          piezo freq around 34600 range which is a fifth (1/5) of the
          ferro-magnetic-resonant freq that we derived. I wish someone
          else would do some testing in this area to verify our
          findings. When you get your "TET" finished you can do the same
          test we did and see where and how this was done. So far
          everything goes back to this fundamental freq which I am still
          convinced that Tesla knew full well when he built his Colorado
          Springs coil. Sounds reasonable to me that he would use a freq
          very close to the natural earth ferro magnetic resonant freq
          to form a beat difference of the 7.83 (that's close enough)
          which is the Schuman cavity resonant freq. Back then he had it
          close to 8 Hz and since it has been narrowed down even better.
          This would have been an "elegant" approach to form an 8 Hz
          standing wave between his big coil, the earth and the
          surrounding air. I would like to get the "Corum's" feed back
          or comments on this idea. Thanks for the interest in the MRA,

          numbers from the meters with scope back-up so we feel
          comfortable so far with the measurements. Joel's total
          resistive equivalence to the circuit places everything back on

          inverted or does just the opposite that you would normally
          expect from a circuit. Well, the proof is in the hands of
          Walter Rosenthal and Tom Bearden at this time and soon will be
          on Hal Puthoff's work bench so what else can we do other than

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Gerald ~ Yup, we've been
          using ordinary electrolytic filter caps on the output of the
          bridge, same as with any other power supply. We can do this
          because 34KHz is still well within the alpha cutoff freq of
          diodes and audio transistors. Good that Norm is sending you a
          kit, because if your magnet is not ringing audibly, you aren't
          going to get the effect of virtual rotation of the domains,
          and will have an ordinary series resonant circuit. From what
          we've seen, you have to have the magnet resonant range in the
          first octave of a three octave series. The magnet's range is
          about 8-9KHz, so one octave up is 16-18KHz and the next octave
          is 32-36KHz, with the piezo right in the middle of its range
          at about 34KHz +/- a few hundred hertz.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In answer to Bill's
          question, I rechecked the "Owner's Manual" for the Fluke #87,
          and it definitely says 200KHz... in fact, while you are
          measuring voltage with it, you can press the "HZ" button and
          get an instantaneous reading of freq and if you press it again
          get a reading of the duty cycle. It's a great piece of gear.
          Also, since Norm and I have both blown up test equipment with
          the MRA, it's a lot less to risk for routine measurements.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you caught that last
          message for Bob Paddock, you have a better idea of the reason
          for measuring primary current with a resistive equivalent
          circuit.&nbsp; There is a scalar to EM conversion going on
          which manifests itself as circulating current... Bearden calls
          it a "ping pong" effect, as the "inner channel" increase is
          bounced back by the resonant circuit, causing yet another
          increase, and so on. The components themselves and the amount
          of load determine amount of this current.&nbsp; However,
          adding a series dropping resistor effectively alters the
          circuit by closing the channel, which is why primary current
          from the signal source increases, a direct violation of Ohm's
          Law (increasing resistance should decrease current) and the
          result is an ordinary series resonant circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I'm going to try to get some
          of the info from Tom Bearden into a file because he can
          describe the effects with far more scientific authenticity
          than I have the knowledge or experience to do. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whew, sigh of relief. I
          don't have the specs, but it sounds like your meter is good
          for voltage up to 20KHz, then is not accurate at higher
          frequencies to the full number of meter digits. So, accuracy
          depends on how fast the meter response tails off above 20KHz.
          And the Fluke literature DOES say 200KHz for the frequency
          counter, but 20KHz for the Vrms part. I hate to be finding
          fault with your measurements, but I'm really just trying to
          get more confidence in what you are seeing (until I get a
          chance to try it myself.). It still probably would be a good
          idea to measure voltage of a good source with both the scope
          and the meter, and find where the meter starts to fail. For
          example, when does its reading dip 5% below that of a 50MHz
          scope?&nbsp; At 21KHz? Probably not. At100 KHz? Could well be.</font>

          I'm sure that you have some concerns along with a very full
          agenda, so I'll not ask any favors at this point. We've really
          only just begun with the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I see now that it is
          possible to add additional quantum coupled stages. Because the
          coupled potentials are instantaneous in the self-targeting
          mode, they can be effectively added in 3-space to realize EM
          power outside the P-channel. What is different in this "mode"
          is that voltages in parallel will "add", and voltages in
          series will stay the same, albeit at excess potential.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With one output on the MRA,
          we are limited to one set of complete Whittaker biwave

          characteristics...and will "attract" other biwave pairs in the
          MRA, as long as the loads are within the aggregate resonance.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I believe that this is
          similar to the concept used by Moray, with charge coupled
          stages, or for that matter, with Keely in his use of
          sequentially applied vibrations. Each turn of wire around a
          Tesla coil, or each crossover of a caduceus coil is the same
          in effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The materials in the MRA are
          all optically active, which engages them in the P-channel via
          the CTP process. If light is reflected away from the MRA, or
          if it is optically shielded, it loses all effect. For the
          record, however, we have seen most, if not, all of the
          "anomalous" criteria associated with unity + devices. The
          piezo will lose weight. Clocks and watches run slow. Some
          wires in the series path stay cool. And, of course, there's
          the matter of excess potential above no-load.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Last night Norm was over and
          we added another output to the MRA, so that it was driving
          lights (incandescent and fluorescent) in addition to the usual
          motor load. This required retuning the MRA for maximum power
          to match the new load requirement. We were "overdriving" the
          output of the MRA below unity to "max out" the power to the
          load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After the lights were
          removed so that only the motor was on the output, the MRA was
          retuned for the motor, but the resonant frequency had changed.
          Prior to adding the lights, the resonant frequency was 34.28
          kHz. After removing the lights, it was 33.43 kHz. Although
          this is only a difference of 850 Hz, it is interesting as it
          indicated that the MRA is alterable. This might be useful in
          some applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA still detunes for
          max gain as before, and still provides surplus potential
          (1.5VAC above noload) when detuned, but this is the first
          indication that it can also be REtuned to a new resonant
          center frequency. Apparently, the magnetic core is more
          "permeable" than we had thought.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Went back and read the
          WBSMEMO.ASC file again... memory ain't what it used to be, and
          never was. I hadn't thought of the MRA within the context of
          that file, but you are right on the mark with your comparison.
          The biggest hurdle to understanding the MRA is in seeing it as
          a new device via existing technology. It is a different
          technology, actually a very, very old technology using new
          components. However, because the technology isn't in the
          "books" yet, it is viewed (at best) as a "new" technology.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The existing "rules" don't
          apply...but the old, really old rules do. For example, when
          Heaviside bastardized Maxwell's Theories (you will NOT find
          the Heaviside interpretation in ANY of Maxwell's published
          works), Heaviside stripped out all of the references to the
          ether, which he said was "mystical and should be murdered from
          the theory", and so he murdered the ether...except that it
          just wouldn't die!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Maxwell opened the door to
          P-channel quantum potentials, and Heaviside slammed it shut.
          Heaviside wanted to provide simple "laws" so that the
          electricians of that day could vector power and measure
          current in workable systems. Heaviside never went to college,
          did not know calculus, and was lost in the true implications
          of Maxwell's theory. It's time we moved up to the reality of
          ALL of Maxwell's theory, not just the kindergarten version.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Anyway, I got side
          tracked...back to your question.&nbsp; Without having seen the
          WBS device, it's hard to say for sure, but the effects seem
          similar. The INTENT of the MRA was to design a device
          compatible with naturally occurring energies, specifically
          ferro-resonance as it applies to earth's electromagnetic
          fields. However, in DOING this, especially with optically
          sensitive materials, we enabled the MRA to re-open Maxwell's
          door. What we caused was a link to form which translated
          etheric energy into ordinary EM in a closed loop resonant
          circuit. This link is referred to as the "P-channel", because
          it manifests as excess potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This effect has been
          experienced in semiconductor circuits for many years, and is
          normally destructive to the devices, so resistive and
          filtering components are added to effectively "close" the
          channel. This isn't necessarily bad, because until circuits
          can be designed to USE the excess potentials, we don't want
          them going into resonance and burning out. As seen by the
          Neiper/Seike Ring (the schematic that is on KeelyNet is wrong,
          btw), you also experience gravitic effects when you allow
          tetrahedral lattices to self-resonate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Considering that the MRA at
          resonance is virtually stopping the spin of particles (like a
          strobe synchronized to a timing mark), it is very likely that
          a more efficient MRA could cancel the quadrupole effect of
          gravity. There are other ways of doing this, such as the
          Biefield-Brown method of high potential or the Searl method of
          folding energy onto itself in resonant plasma layers, and
          possibly the technology of anti-g (for a practical space ship)
          would utilize some or all of the above.&nbsp; However, we'll
          never get "there" from "here" by using the Heaviside "laws".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conventional science has a
          "circle the wagons" mentality to this new (old) technology,
          and insists on trying to hammer the wheel back into a square,
          on the assumption that it will "work" better because roads are
          flat. So we clunk along and congratulate ourselves on our
          "vast" achievements. OK, I'll get back down off the soap
          box...</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To: Hal Puthoff ~ Hi Hal,
          Yes, you are correct about the motor current. We checked it
          with an analog meter early on in the tests, and it indicated
          140 ma. This was then used as a constant. However, I just
          rechecked it with the Fluke 87 inline to the motor, and the
          true DC current varies from 120 ma at max power to 116 ma at
          max gain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As for the output switching,
          we are trying to determine the actual primary circuit current
          of the MRA. Once we have tuned the MRA, we remove it from the
          output of the signal source, and connect the signal source to
          the decade box. Once we measure the amount of resistance
          required to attain the same drop in amplifier output voltage
          as the MRA was causing, we then can divide resistance into
          voltage to determine the current draw of the MRA. We've tried
          other methods, such as low values of resistance in the primary
          of the MRA, and the results defy ohm's law. Adding resistance
          actually increases primary current...which should also
          increase secondary output, but in fact, causes it to
          decrease.&nbsp; As you will see, the current in series with a
          resistor in the primary circuit is higher than the current
          with just a meter in series with the primary, which makes no
          sense in terms of classical EM theory. We believe that the
          resistor is closing the "P-channel", which removes the source
          of excess potential. Even the slight resistance of the meter,
          or of a current probe which contains a coil, will have the
          same effect in varying degrees. So, we use the decade box as
          an equivalent load, instead.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, Norm and I put a very
          heavy combination of output loads on the MRA last night to see
          how much power we could extract from it, regardless of gain.
          This experiment lasted for about an hour. After we were
          finished, we found that the center resonant frequency of the
          MRA had changed from 34.28 to 33.48 with just the motor on the
          output. Apparently, the magnetic core is more "permeable" than
          we had thought. So, here are the new measurements, factoring
          in the measured motor current and the "new" center resonant

          ~&nbsp; Incandescent lamp test</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is a very easy method
          for "seeing" the power gain of the MRA, and it does not
          require power amplifiers, only a sine wave generator. You need
          two of the tiny "grain of wheat" lamps...if you don't have
          them on hand, I will send you some. Put one lamp is series
          with the input to the MRA primary, and put the other lamp in
          series with the MRA secondary to the bridge rectifier. If you
          are not using an amplifier, put a 50-100 ohm resistive load on
          the output of the bridge rectifier. If you are using an
          amplifier, use more resistance to avoid burning out the lamps.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using only a signal
          generator for the MRA input, tune the MRA to peak resonance.
          The lamp in the primary circuit will not illuminate, but the
          lamp in the secondary circuit will begin to glow. The glow is
          bright enough to photograph for your records of this test.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you are using an
          amplifier, do not put the lamps in the circuit until you have
          detuned the MRA for max gain. Then put them in, and you will
          see that the secondary lamp is much brighter than the primary
          lamp. You can continue to detune until the primary lamp is
          "out" (at which point the input voltage from the amp is above
          no-load) but the secondary lamp is still glowing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I suggest that light
          sensitive devices could be used with the lamps to measure
          gains in terms the output of these devices.&nbsp; However, I
          still have no idea of how to measure gain once the primary
          lamp is "out" and the secondary lamp is still lit. ~ Joel</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bill:&nbsp; I sent a package
          of MRA info to Don Smith down in Houston for he has a similar
          circuit to the MRA except that it uses a Tesla coil running at
          high voltages to interact with the earth's weak ferro-magnetic
          field to produce over-unity operation. A lot of people have
          practically given up on Don's device for he has not powered a
          practical load to date that we know of but his theory is sound
          as far as I can determine. An incorporation of what we have
          learned about ferro-magnetic resonance frequencies and his
          Tesla coil driven circuit could provide another effective
          method of ZPE tapping. Don has done some research on the piezo
          material and pinned down three current manufacturers of these
          transducers. The first is ADDCHEM a spin off from the PENWALT
          family. Then there is SOLVA and KERRA. He also went to the
          specialty wire manufacturers and asked about making a piezo
          type conductor that could be incorporated directly into our
          circuits. The wire manufacturers were amused to say the least
          for their comments were "we have been working all these years
          to make a wire that produced</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">no noise and you come along
          and ask for a degenerate conductor that will make maximum
          noise". They are interested in the concept though and will get
          back to us with the data needed. I would not be too quick to
          judge the MRA as a non-reproducable device for between Joel
          and I we have built 8 of the units and have been able to
          achieve the over-unity ratios that we are comfortable with.
          The biggest problem that I see is that no one wants to take
          the time to do the necessary reading of the messages, tech
          reports and go out and find the materials. We clearly stated
          that we do not have all the answers and have not nailed down
          exactly what will or will not work as to magnet type or shape.
          The piezo is a big variable for we have a stack of culls which
          just will not work. We expect that they have lost the poling
          that was done at time of manufacturer. I know that there is
          someone out there on the Internet who has experience in this
          area. Dan Davidson told me that to the best of his knowledge
          the poling is done at the "curie point" of the piezo material
          with a capacitive discharge used to establish the required
          "polarity of charge".&nbsp; If anyone out there has knowledge
          in this area please give us some input so we can revive some
          of these "dead" piezo's. I'm sure others will encounter this
          problem so we need more knowledge about the piezo element.
          Since the "Jury" is still out as far as testing is concerned
          we have to wait but in the meantime Joel and I are still
          building more working devices&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Norm</font> </p>

          get to the natural resonance of the transducer. The MRA cannot

          made all magnetic flux the same "hyperspatial" frequency

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This report is here is
          because of the problems with measuring the primary current of
          this beast. The MRA adds voltage to the circuit, which is
          nice, but it creates ALL KINDS of current measurement
          problems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, I have appended the
          "grain of wheat" lamp test to give real numbers instead of
          just seeing the difference in light.&nbsp; I put one</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">of the lamps directly on the
          signal generator output, and measured its impedance at the
          frequency of the MRA under test. Why? Well, because the lamp
          can thus be put into the primary, and when you measure the
          voltage drop across it, you can divide that by the impedance
          and KNOW the actual primary current... no need to worry about
          the excess voltage, because if any of it "adds" across the
          lamp, primary current will appear HIGHER, which would reduce
          the gain of the MRA, and help to disprove it as an overunity
          device. I'll take that chance, as long as I know the exact
          impedance of the lamp. Also, where there is a difference in
          measured versus calculated output current, I've taken the
          lower number, also to be ultra-conservative. So, here goes:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "lamp test" of the MRA
          has been further used for the purpose of standard "ohm's law"
          tests and measurements. The "bottom line" figures are 470.0 mw
          input to the primary of the MRA and 751.0 mw output from the
          secondary. This is a gain of 1.6 times unity at the low power
          end of the resonant range. The measurements and calculations
          are given below:</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To cross check these
          numbers, the total primary impedance was calculated, and the
          impedance of the lamp was subtracted from it. If accurate, the
          difference in power should equal the power which is added to
          the primary when the lamp is not connected:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Primary impedance = 28.94

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Primary power without lamp =

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because:</font> <br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I THINK that nails it...at
          least as far as can be measured with a low power lamp, and
          assuming that the MRA should eat any differences in
          measurement versus calculations which would reduce its gain.
          All of the measurements are in series for current, as per
          ohm's law, and all other calculations are ohm's "to the
          letter". As usual, my coffee got cold, so I'll stop here.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just an addendum to the lamp
          impedance test report. Found that the circuit would not stay
          at unity + indefinitely at that very low level of input. After
          about an hour, the voltage drop across the lamp in the primary
          went up to over a volt, and that knocked the MRA down below
          unity. I think that the low level of input wasn't enough to
          sustain the harmonics that had built up as the MRA was warming
          up. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bob ~&nbsp; Thanks a million
          for the package and the schematics. I'm very interested in the
          "high performance" transistors so I really appreciate your
          search efforts. The magnets are bonded together so don't try
          to separate them for they break very easily. As to the
          transducers Joel and I have not figured out the .07 figure. In
          the batch I bought they were sorted out and grouped under that
          number, i.e., all the .07's were together then there would be
          a group of .09's etc. Some sort of matching they did at
          manufacturing. I guess they were installed in the welders in
          matched sets so as to have the highest performance. The brass
          strip method of providing electrical contact works for I have
          several mounted this way in between two pressure plates so I
          can torque them down to about 100 # pressure which Dan
          Davidson recommended I try. The other train of thought is to
          make the contacts in a way as to allow the piezo to freely
          resonate in free air with minimum contact at any point.
          Soldering directly to the silver surface is detrimental to the
          piezo as evidenced by our stack of "dead transducers". They
          are in effect almost a pure capacitive device and will give
          off a very loud "squeal" when they go "sour" and quit working.
          I know that someone who works with these devices will
          eventually "jump in" and educate us about these animals. The
          sooner the better. These "OEM" items are always like that for
          they are manufactured for use in a specific piece of equipment
          with precise specs. We come along and try to adapt this device
          to one of our experiments out of convenience sine we picked
          them up surplus. This is OK for experimentation and all out
          there should realize the facts behind what I said.&nbsp; When
          questions arise as to data on the&nbsp; transducers I would
          say that we really don't know what we are dealing with but
          they work. When we get further along and get some "optimum"
          numbers we may be able to go to the original "OEM" source and
          have some super piezo's designed that will target the
          performance curves that we develop through trial and error. It
          would be nice if there was a computer program that could
          analyze the MRA parameters and design the optimum piezo
          characteristics we need. Right now all we can say is that in a
          circuit that does everything "contrary" to accepted electronic
          and physics theory we can't get a handle on exact and optimum
          design characteristics. It will eventually take a team of
          specialized engineers to figure out how to take this MRA idea
          and make it do useful work. All we have done is open the
          "door" to the fact that tapping the Zero Point is real and can
          be demonstrated. Where and how this is developed remains to be
          seen. Once the fundamental theory is proven then very large
          sums of capital will be thrown into research and all this will
          become reality. All we could do was give the info to the world
          and let smarter folks run with it to it's useful application
          in solving our energy problems. What more can I say. Thanks
          again Bob and good luck with your MRA. ~&nbsp; Norm</font> </p>

          and have spent a few hours messing with it. THANKS!&nbsp;
          Excellent packaging job, nothing&nbsp; damaged at all. It
          seems that my signal generator can't put out a high enough
          voltage to get the effect to kick in. Next I'm going to get a
          friend's Carver amp. My Wavetek at work puts out 20 Vpp, but
          it gets pulled down to 8Vpp at resonance, and the energy
          throughput is totally conventional: exactly 100% at resonance,
          and falling fast at other frequencies. The magnet does NOT
          make any noise, and all the signals in the circuit are pure
          sine waves, without any other frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have brochures on the way
          from five separate PZT manufactures, so I should get some info
          on "poling." Speaking of which: the piezos themselves behave
          very strange near resonance. All kinds of pure tones appear,
          and turn on and off when frequency or voltage is varied. The
          best freq for this seems to be a bit higher than the resonance
          peak.&nbsp; I saw signals start small and slowly grow, then
          vanish when the piezo is touched, only to slowly grow again. I
          got the "death" effect, when the piezo makes a screech and
          then the sounds vanish for about a half hour. Very similar to
          that TVQ opto-isolator device. Also similar to nonlinear
          optical crystals illuminated with laser light, where
          conventional phase conjugation creates closed reflection
          paths, optical resonances, self-organized hologram elements,
          etc. I wouldn't be surprised if the innards of the piezos were
          doing the acoustic version of this. I notice that when a piezo
          is being silent, sometimes I can get it to sound weakly by
          applying slight pressure to the leads. It seems that tiny
          bending forces have a great effect on piezo audible
          "subharmonic" sounds. I wonder if your piezo "culls" could be
          made to work by pulling or pushing just right on the lead
          wires. Also, the "culls" may generate a set of frequencies
          that just by coincidence miss the magnet resonant frequency,
          so they are too far off for the piezo and magnet frequencies
          to grab each other and start talking. The cure for this might
          be to grind little flat areas on the edges to retune them.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have a couple of ceramic
          slab magnets, so I built a plexi form and wound a coil around
          it, with the magnet suspended inside. With an extremely tiny
          signal applied to the coil at 11KHz the magnet rings VERY loud
          (and annoying!) If I touch the corners of the magnet slab, the
          ringing goes way down and the tuning is much broader. Instead
          of suspending the magnet, I found that soft foam rubber does
          not interfere much with the ringing of either the magnet or
          the piezo. This makes sense, since foam is mostly air, so the
          magnet thinks its hanging in air. More soon...</font> </p>

          everthing "intact" and you are progressing with your research.
          If you stick strictly to the RULE9 doc. and make the magnet
          resonate (about 8-8.5K audible) you will find the piezo
          running at exactly 3 octaves up or around 34-35KHZ. Only under
          these conditions will you achieve the "virtual rotation"
          within the crystalline lattice of the magnet material.&nbsp;
          Check out the "E" message from Joel about the phone call from
          the engineers at Lockeed Corp that verify that the MRA does
          achieve over-unity for they are getting 140% and congratulate
          us on our output figures. They said that some German and
          Russian engineers have achieved similar results also. Last
          night I got a call from an engineer down in Clearwater FL who
          is getting 125% and is not even using the "cadillac" piezo's
          that we are using. The iron content of the ferro magnet
          material seems to be the key to the gains. It all goes back to
          what Tesla claimed when he said "A fine grade of steel will
          play a very important part in tapping an infinite source of
          energy for iron is a unique element in that it has 2 free
          electrons in the "M" shell of the atom that can be extracted
          for use only to be replenished by the ether". About the
          document scan, I really appreciate your efforts with this for
          in the near future you will see where this is going. By the

          info on the Perkins Pump and my Cold Fusion test, etc. This
          will eventually all be tied in a nice little package for it
          all goes back to Joel's RULE9 document. Please send down the

          be fine. As to the I-net dialog, the worm seems to be turning.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, when the requisite
          criteria is met, the biwave pairs vector into 3-space energy
          at the harmonic frequencies.&nbsp; That's it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rest of the MRA theory
          is resonance theory, as is the Rule of Nines, and exists to
          describe how to use naturally occurring lattice structures to
          mimic earth (and any other EM generator) in terms of the
          nested tetrahedral relationships.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why three octaves? Because
          we exist in 3-space, and we are creating a 7-space effect,
          with the fourth dimension, or p-channel, acting as a conduit
          into (and out of) 3-space.&nbsp; Now, a trained observer will
          want to see exactly where the harmonic biwave translation
          occurs, and ill go nuts looking, because the wave pairs exist
          simultaneously with our space-time and translate
          instantaneously...no speed of light required.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why nested tetrahedral
          relationships? Because they are the geometric relationships
          which embody PHI, and PHI is the pure mathematical constant to
          create resonance... musical, or any other type. That is why
          you see the excess potential at the load and source
          simultaneously, and it is load dependent to the extent that
          the load affects harmonic interaction of the magnetic
          core.&nbsp; That is why you have to lower gain of the MRA to
          close the p-channel by removing the excess potential first.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can't see the
          translation, only you can only see the effect. I look forward
          VERY MUCH to your tests and comments. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ The last message
          wasn't as clear as I would have liked with regard to PHI. I
          once worked out the harmonic and octave relationships as PHI
          (and PI, since PI = PHI squared, times 6/5... thus PHI squared
          = PI...also, 1 + 1/PHI = PHI, which is also known as the
          Fibonacci Series).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The file PHI&amp;RES.ASC has
          some of this information, and because the "notes" harmonize
          perfectly and the octaves double exactly, this conforms to
          "standard" musical scales as are used today. Using the
          Fibonacci series as a starting place for note frequencies is
          not an arbitrary decision.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today, we see PHI as a
          methematical constant, ie, 1.618, for use in plane geometry.
          To the ancient Egyptians, it was math but had a much deeper
          implication it was the symbol of rebirth throughout eternity
          just as the Fibonacci series "perfects" at higher number
          intervals. Also, because the use of PHI in art is very
          "harmonious" to view, PHI coordinates (nested tets) were used
          by Michelangelo in the dome of the Sistine Chapel, as well as
          by Veronese, Raphael, da Vinci, and was even used by the
          architect Le Corbusier in the design of the United Nations
          building.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In retrospect, I think that
          this must be a perfect validation of the resonance based chart
          of the elements as created by Walter Russell, although he
          certainly doesn't need any validation from me. The fact is,
          music is math and geometry, and geometry is the yardstick for
          three dimensional existence. It's all one nested relationship,
          and the singular constant is PHI. If you want to create
          resonance and balanced harmonics in octave groups, you must
          use PHI. Because we tend to separate "music" from "science",
          we don't HEAR nature, and we trust our intellect to create
          unnatural yardsticks. Fact is, when computers were invented,
          and IBM needed programmers, they hired musicians to train for
          the positions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an electronic circuit,
          semiconductors are made of silicon or germanium, both of which
          are tet lattice structures, and both of which will
          occasionally break into free oscillation, rich in PHI based
          harmonics... that is how the Nieper ring works, because once
          the material has three octaves of resonance, the particle spin
          is virtually stopped... like a timing mark under a
          strobe...and the effect of gravity is suspended.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three octaves are necessary
          in 3-space because the each of the octaves "fills" one
          dimension. The octaves interact with each other to make
          harmonics at 90 degrees of phase separation, effectively
          "filling" a 3-space object. This is mass aggregate resonance,
          and it allows you to couple biwave vectorless energy into a
          circuit.&nbsp; It also allows you to overcome temporal effects
          as well as gravitic effects. That is why I said that when you
          nest two tets, you have the keys to everything.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA uses materials which
          are cube latticed, and a cube IS a nested tet sitting on its
          "flat side". So, when you trap the harmonics on one side of a
          phase reversed series resonant circuit, you develop a
          potential which is higher than the no-load voltage of the
          device which is supplying the circuit. That's half of ZPE. The
          other half is having ferrite in the resonating core to provide
          electrons to match with the excess potential to create power
          to a load. And that's the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Part of the resentment to
          this information is simply due to the fact that all of this
          was known to and possibly discovered by very ancient
          peoples...and we are lagging behind them today in our
          comprehension of science as nature, by the division of music
          and science, etc. Well, all I really wanted to do was to
          provide correlations to help tie in the octave relationships
          with the lattice geometry, and I hope that this information
          helps. You can see how well it is received by most people, but
          you can also measure the excess potential on your own MRA so
          you'll have to decide for yourself.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Joel ~ Thanks for the
          insightful commentary. I've asked some math professors about
          Quarterions and they haven't heard of them. As I am now
          attending college fulltime, I will poke around for some info
          on them. I have a couple of more things for you on the MRA:
          After studying the schematic for the MRA, I noticed that the
          Ultrasonic transducer would have a very high electrical "Q".
          To get maximum power out of the circuit, I think the magnet
          and coil combination should also have as high a "Q" as
          possible. Can a magnet have a "Q"?? I understand that magnets
          seem to produce (resonate) an output near 175 KHz.&nbsp; Would
          a stronger magnet put out a higher amplitude signal at 175
          KHz? I suspect the stronger magnet (higher gauss) would have
          an effectively higher "Q", thus possibly getting more out of
          the MRA. For a given transducer, has anyone noted a
          leveling-off of output for increased strengths of magnets</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">John ~&nbsp; Since I have
          been doing the testing of different winding combo's and magnet
          material while Joel is doing the performance testing I may be
          able to answer your questions as to a more powerful magnet
          material giving a better performance. That ain't the way it
          works as far as we have been able to determine. We are dealing
          with a phenomenon here that is hard to grasp in that we are
          generating in the primary of the MRA circuit what we term as
          excess potential. This means that the voltage across the
          primary input to the MRA as coming from the signal source is
          driven up as much as 1.9 X.&nbsp; Example: I have a MRA
          running as we speak that has a signal source from the amp of
          20.95 VAC @36KHZ no load (MRA out of the circuit). When I
          connect the MRA to the signal source the voltage goes up to
          38.27 VAC for an excess potential of 17.32 V.&nbsp; While
          stronger magnet material such as alnico 8 and neodymium
          increase the excess potential seen in the circuit we have not
          been able to translate it into a useable output. Still some
          matching problems that we may be able to work out and be able
          to utilize these other magnet types. We believe the answer
          lies in the looseness of the domains in the magnet and their
          ability to oscillate so we get the "virtual rotation" we are
          looking for. I'm sure that all this will be worked out and it
          may be possible to use anything that has a magnetic field
          including the "old mother earth". The whole idea of going
          "public domain" was to get others to experiment with the
          circuit so we could sort all this out faster. If Joel and I
          can find this phenomenon then others should be able to help us
          "flesh it out" into something useful. My friend Mike down in
          Clearwater FL (one of Don Kelly's group) has a MRA running at
          unity but he has not seen the excess potential that I
          described therefore this is an indication that his piezo is
          not up to "snuff". We have found that the piezo is very
          sensitive in that it can lose it's poling when you solder the
          input leads to it.&nbsp; Joel and I have a stack of piezo's
          that just will not show the over-unity we are looking for
          while others work just fine. For this reason we have gone to
          Internet in search for someone who has extensive knowledge of
          piezo's and their applications. Thus far we have had no
          responses. Please experiment and help the cause. ~ Norm</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi John, ~ Going to college
          full time and still finding time to ask questions outside of
          your designated curriculum? I'm impressed. I'll try to make
          the answers worthy of the questions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Q of the circuit, like
          any series resonant circuit at resonance, is very high. The
          MRA output follows the contours of the Universal Resonance
          Chart for series resonant circuits, except for the point of
          intersection with input current.&nbsp; The current is forced
          low while still in the area of its linear rise according to
          the chart, and is at minimum at the 65% point where it should
          be at the "knee" of its peak rise. That is manifested as a
          very high circuit impedance, for as you know, a series
          resonant circuit is supposed to be a dead short at resonance
          except for copper losses.&nbsp; Because there is excess
          potential, i.e., the voltage level across the output terminals
          of the signal source which supplies the MRA is higher when
          connected to the MRA than it is with nothing connected to it,
          the MRA is not behaving like a dead short or even like an
          impedance, but more like a voltage supply...which, as you will
          see, is what it is.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The magnet is merely a
          saturable ferrite core, except that it is also a magnet in
          resonance, and its harmonics are being reflected, or fed back
          into the primary by the piezo. Here is where we have to figure
          this out ourselves, because there is no "prior art" that this
          has ever been done before. The result is the creation of a
          potential which is applied to the piezo in opposition to the
          supply potential, and which literally pushes back supply
          current which increases supply voltage. In the process of
          doing this, this created potential is converting flux into
          electrons to keep this "new" current circulating in the series
          resonant circuit, so that the output power from the MRA is
          higher than the power consumed in the primary. This is
          non-linear operation, which will be described further into
          this message.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The saturation point of the
          magnet as a ferrite core determines the gain of the MRA. For a
          given load, the MRA will saturate as seen by increases in
          supply potential above the saturation point which result in
          decreases in the MRA output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The three octave range of
          the MRA is related to the 175 kHz resonant frequency of
          magnetISM, not of magNETS. In other words, the resonant
          frequency of flux particles, which are universally constant
          regardless of the type of magnet, its size, etc., is 174.925
          kHz.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having determined that the
          magnets which we use will resonate most audibly at 8-9 kHz, we
          double that for an octave separation of 16-18 kHz, and again
          for 32-36 kHz, and apply approximately 34 kHz to the piezo.
          After the MRA "warms up" for about an hour, building up its
          harmonics, it rings at its 8-9 kHz magnet resonant frequency.
          Some experimenters keep aspirin on hand because the pure
          ringing sound over time will really give you a wallbanger of a
          headache.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, here's how that relates
          "upward" to the 175 kHz. Once again, we are in new territory
          here, so please feel free to disagree, offer new ideas, etc.
          The 34 kHz mass aggregate frequency will double if the MRA is
          allowed to run open, and that will double if two MRAs are tied
          together and allowed to run open. Each doubling = one octave,
          so at the third octave, the frequency is 136 kHz. When you
          subtract this from 175 kHz, you have 39 kHz.&nbsp; If you
          subtract 136 kHz from 170 kHz, you have 34 kHz, which is the
          MRA mass aggregate frequency. Either the frequency of flux is
          170 kHz instead of 175 kHz, or the 5 kHz difference is due to
          component variations, which seems more likely.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Based upon the results which
          we have seen, I believe that we are using multiples of flux
          resonance in the MRA, in which case the earth, or more
          directly the sun, is providing energy which is sympathetically
          resonating and adding energy to the circuit.&nbsp; However,
          the weak flux potentials would not provide unity, much less
          several times unity. For this, we have to go back to Maxwell's
          Quaternions, as well as to Whittaker 1903, the
          Stoney/Whittaker/Ziolkowski description of the decomposition
          of CTP (coulomb transverse potential) into bi-directional EM
          wave pairs, and analyze the nonlinear operation of the MRA
          using known, already accepted NLO (non linear optical)
          functioning.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to NLO, the piezo
          and primary of the MRA are connected by their CTPs, which
          causes slightly amplified PCR (phase conjugate replica) waves
          between them, which skews the energy density of the CTPs. This
          (most importantly) alters the ordinary isotropic distribution
          of potential with respect to radial direction. Each component
          becomes a pump for the PCR waves until the saturation point of
          the circuit is reached. That's standard textbook NLO, applied
          to define the quantum step potential increases which occur as
          a result of the principles of interferometry, as described by
          Whittaker, 1904.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA applies principles
          which were know 90 years ago, to create effects that are
          defined by currently accepted NLO theory. Because these
          effects include over-unity, more than a few people are less
          than courteous in their assessment of the circuit and its
          inventors. However, YOUR generation can use this information
          to make real changes in this tired old world.&nbsp; Thank you
          for your excellent questions. Good luck with your studies!</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Gerald ~ If you insert a
          resistor or other device in series with primary, it will
          interfere with the biwave translation which is occurring, and
          effectively shut down the p-channel. After you have tuned the
          MRA for max output, let it cook there for about an hour to
          build up harmonics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, reduce the frequency,
          and as you do, you will see the input voltage to the MRA
          increase above the no- load voltage of the signal supply. You
          can "stop" anywhere in this region, and after you do, the
          output from the MRA as well as the input voltage will begin to
          step up incrementally as the harmonics once again begin to
          build up.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you can measure AC
          current into your signal supply, you will see it decrease
          below the standby level. This assumes that you have an
          amplifier which will provide about 25 VAC to the MRA, because
          it sinks voltage (the piezo does) below a threshhold of about
          that level.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The best way to determine
          primary current is to detune as above but stop before your
          amplifier voltage goes above no-load.&nbsp; While you still
          have a voltage drop across the MRA, remove it from the circuit
          and replace it with a decade box, and find the resistance
          value which will give you the same voltage drop. This is the
          effective impedance of the MRA, and can be used to determine
          source current. Then when you compare the power as determined
          by IE X 0.707 with the output power, either AC or DC from a
          bridge, you will see your power gain. If you add a resistor to
          the primary, and measure current inline with it, you will find
          that current is greater than if you measure inline current
          without the resistor... which violates ohm's law... and which
          demonstrates the activity of the p-channel. Hope this info
          helps. Enjoy! ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bill ~&nbsp; The dead
          piezo's make a very loud "screeck" sound around 2KHz when they
          go "sour" and will not drive the MRA circuit. I have wound
          some turns ratios that produced the same effect from a very
          good piezo though so it could be a condition of the piezo not
          liking the reflected excess potential being shoved back at it.
          Normally, when the piezo goes bad it is "clinically dead"
          which is the reason for needing more info on the possible
          "poling" loss. I can't believe that someone out on the I-Net
          has some valued input on this subject but has not come forward
          to help us out in this "vague" area. The biggest problem is
          that these piezo's were designed for very special applications
          at precise specs and it is not something you go down to
          "Wal-Mart" and purchase. I had a call last night from a guy
          who wanted to build a MRA and was fussing about a price of
          $100 for a new piezo of the type we are using (quote from the
          manufacturer) minimum purchase $200 for R&amp;D sample. Thanks

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Terry ~The frequency of
          174.925 kHz was found while testing the Nieper Ring. Because I
          believe that gravity is a quadrupole effect in which the spin
          of particles is reacting to EM fields, I felt that signal
          injecting the Nieper Ring would create field stability as seen
          in the scope display of the Ring's harmonics at the resonant
          frequency of flux. The center freq of the Ring is about 1.3
          MHz, and is a complex waveform with a real 'soup' of
          harmonics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At 174.8 kHz, the Nieper
          Ring waveform became synchronous. Norm tested this using a
          magnet/coil combination and found that it locked on at 174.925
          kHz.&nbsp; Norm's test equipment has a higher degree of
          accuracy, so I believe that his measurement is closer.&nbsp;
          If you want to try this yourself, and to verify the ability of
          the Nieper Ring to 'lose weight', build a Nieper Ring.&nbsp;
          It's only three audio power transistors and some passives, so
          it's cheap and easy to put together in one afternoon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The reason that you get 1.3
          MHz from audio xistors is because they are biased on with no
          signal input, and they break into self resonance as a result
          of their tetrahedral lattice structures. The PHI of the
          lattices determines the center frequency and harmonic
          relationships. Silicon and germanium both have tet lattices.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I think that Norm's method
          is closer to the one used by Tesla, but I don't have the
          details on it. Enjoy! ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Gerald ~ Yes, you can use
          just a resistor as a load...I forgot to answer that in the
          previous messages. Regardless of whether you measure output
          power as AC across a resistor, or as rectified DC across a
          motor, light, resistor, etc., you first need to be in the
          operating range of the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first MRA that was built
          could provide gain with only a HP-200cd signal generator to
          drive it, which we have not been able to match since, except
          with the most recent MRA in tests with the little
          grain-of-wheat lamps...and that falls off after about an hour,
          as the harmonics die out.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As you can see from the
          data, it takes a couple of watts in to prime the pump (waves),
          after which you can back off on the frequency and achieve
          nonlinear gain on the output.&nbsp; We use a Radio Shack amp
          to drive the MRA...just about any good audio amp with 25 VAC
          output will do.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We use DC output because we
          believe in demonstrating the output power in useful
          applications, such as driving motors and lights. If you just
          want to measure the power I/O ratio, rectification is not
          necessary.&nbsp; Our measurements "eat" the loss caused by the
          rectifying and filtering, because we want to show gain in
          usable power, and DC is far more usable that 34 kHz. Just give
          a holler if we can be of any help. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          if the MRA effect requires that the piezo be imperfect, so
          multiple resonances can start out in the first place. If so,
          then it might be required that they have a dead spot from the
          heat and solder in order to work right.&nbsp; Sort of similar

          at what temp the plating oxidizes. If you run them with an

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Jerry ~ Been doing a
          little studying regarding barium. It is never found in pure
          form due to its reactivity. It's usually processed out of
          barytine, and has to be stored under kerosene to keep it pure
          after processing. It also has a cube (body centered) lattice
          structure which consists of ten tetrahedrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The reactivity of the barium
          atom causes the ether in the area of the nucleus to become
          semiconductive, so in a poled device, like a piezo or a
          magnet, there is always a certain amount of potential
          "slippage" occurring. Barium alloys seem to be ideal for Sweet
          and MRA types of devices. When you combine that with titanium,
          which is also optically active, you can get a lot of energetic
          reaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For this reason, there is
          always some time distortion or p-channel activity around these
          piezos and magnets, if they are poled, and regardless of
          whether they are energized by external potentials or not.
          Using resonance just widens the existing channel and skews the
          potentials in such a way that more subharmonics can react with
          the ether to translate more of the biwaves, which are there
          anyway, into EM. A barium ferrite magnet will cause a clock or
          watch to run slow, not due to magnetic fields, but because the
          magnet is in a constant state of self oscillation with the
          ether...so will a barium piezo, to a lesser extent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you use these features to
          create an open system in a closed loop, you can keep the
          potentials moving faster than the load device can use the
          energy, and that is unity plus. I think maybe Sweet knew this
          and knew how to use it.&nbsp; The VTA, however, is an open
          system in an open loop, in that it uses the ether itself to
          reflect as well as to provide subharmonics, with the effect
          that you can't "load it down". It just keeps bouncing back
          with more, because the energy is only limited to whatever is
          available in the entire universe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are using the piezo as
          the reflective element, which contains the potentials within
          the series resonant closed loop, and does not allow the MRA to
          "run open" if you load it heavily...it just drops below unity.
          Actually, the ferrite, not the barium,&nbsp; determines the
          gain by reaching the point at which it becomes a saturated
          core, and can't add any more power for additional increases in
          excess potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Barium is curious stuff.
          There are probably other elements which will work as well or
          better, depending on their reactivity and optical
          characteristics. Will keep researching this and report back. ~

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Bill ~ I THINK that the
          piezos have to be good, poled parts in order to work properly
          in the MRA.&nbsp; The DEGREE of poling may alter the gain,
          because the gain of a MRA will vary from one piezo to another,
          when using the same magnet and output load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A quick test has been with
          the Fluke 87 to measure capacitance, and the "good" piezos
          measure about 5 nf, but if you reverse the leads, measure 3
          nf.&nbsp; The "bad" piezos have less capacitance and no
          difference when the meter leads are reversed. Also, even the
          "good" piezos need to be "conditioned" at low signal input for
          a day or two before they will hold up under an amplifier and a
          load of any wattage. Conditioning seems to improve the poling
          by increasing the dielectric strength of the piezos.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I really need some mfr's
          spec's on these parts to be any more specific about their
          characteristics.&nbsp; It seems reasonable that poling will
          result in a standing potential, and this is necessary before
          the inner, or "p" channel subharmonics can translate into EM.
          Same effect with the magnet...the process of creating the
          magnet places the barium into a poled environment, and the
          inner channel activity will occur whether there is externally
          applied potential or not. Hope this is helpful. ~ Joel</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Jerry ~&nbsp; Just
          finished reading the McKie patent, or PODmod as it is called.
          As you know, there are two parallel resonant circuits running
          at 20 kHz, alternately powering a series resonant circuit
          running at 40 kHz.&nbsp; Because each tank discharges twice as
          fast as it charges, the power is amplified because the output
          current is doubled for half the charge time, with two tank
          circuits, so the output is constant.&nbsp; The tank circuits
          offer maximum impedance to source current while the series
          resonant circuit offers minimum impedance to the load.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, there's
          more...there is an LR circuit and an LC circuit in the load,
          so the LR causes voltage to lead current by 90 degrees, which
          charges the inductor while minimizing current BEFORE the LC
          circuit "sees" the potential and charges the LC circuit.&nbsp;
          Remember "Eli the ice man?"?&nbsp; McKie is driving his load
          almost exclusively on potential ONLY.&nbsp; I read the
          comparison with the "Tesla Switch" in the KeelyNet file, and
          by golly, this is what it is happening.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the LR is discharging
          into the LC, the next "wave" of potential is getting ready to

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Woody ~ The drop off in
          over-unity can occur at either of the "ends" of the operating
          range, and seems to define the boundaries of operation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By either increasing load on
          the secondary beyond the saturation point of the permeable
          core, or by decreasing frequency until the subharmonics ring
          out, you can force the MRA below unity. There is an optimum
          range of output load and input frequency, wherein the
          nonlinear increase in input impedance creates an effective
          reduction of primary current, hence input power, for a
          disproportionately higher amount of output power. The
          dimensions of this range appear constant in relative terms for
          differing MRA configurations, although the actual parameters
          of center resonant frequency and output power will vary with
          the components. Within the optimum range, the MRA hasn't "rang
          out" through extended testing to date.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, the effects of
          impedances in a circuit do not relate directly to pure
          resistance, but the average value of each has the same effect
          on circuit current.&nbsp; This is especially true of a series
          resonant circuit because the reactances cancel, leaving only
          resistance. While this is true within the resonant range of
          the circuit, the individual effects of Xl and Xc become more
          pronounced as you move either above or below the center
          resonant frequency. We wish we had the type of equipment which
          would allow millisecond-by-millisecond analysis of the MRA
          with simultaneously monitored voltages and currents, so that
          we could then plot the coordinates as vectors... lacking that,
          we turned the MRA over to those who have knowledge superior to
          ours, and the tools to test the MRA properly. Obviously, we
          have a great respect for these people and we anxiously await
          their reviews and analyses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If there are hidden
          variables which "average value" testing cannot see, they will
          be found, and the effects will be clearly defined in terms of
          power. You know as well as anyone that there are always hidden
          variables in anything, so it remains to be seen how much they
          will affect the power gains which we measure as average
          values. We can use (and accept) Thevenin's Theorem, but we
          also know Murphy, so reality is somewhere in between. Thanks,
          dude! ~ Joel</font> </p>

          power input. If you can get a clean DC Watt out of an MRA from
          nowhere, you will have something tough to deny. (I know, I
          have a firm grasp of the obvious.) By pumping out an excess
          watt = 1 Joule/second, you will quickly eliminate other
          explanations of where the power comes from, such as using up
          the energy of magnetization of the magnet, for example. Each
          day of operation would yield about 90,000 joules. You can
          compare this against the energy of magnetization of the core,

          combination coming (eventually) from the MRA output.&nbsp;

          w/r/t VTA</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~&nbsp; I have been
          avidly following the MRA updates since being alerted to it's
          existence by Mr. Don Kelly.&nbsp; Congratulations on your and
          Joel McClain's success! Over the past 2 years I've also been
          studying Mr. Sweet's VTA system (also with the information
          help of Don K).&nbsp; The MRA is reminiscent of the VTA and I
          would guess probably draws from the same energy source, but
          using a different engineering realization which is much more
          reproducible. However, Sweet was able to get out much higher
          over-unity gains.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps I can offer some
          design insights from my VTA studies?&nbsp; Two main issues are
          apparent now. First is the output windings.&nbsp; Sweet was
          able to get his outputs using what's called 'bifilar' winding
          for the output coil(s). At the INE conference last May,
          Sweet's setup was replicated and verified by Mr. Don Watson. I
          spoke with Don at length, and obtained his design specs (which
          he has freely given for public domain usage). He also used
          bifilar windings on the output. Bifilar windings are basically
          two identical and independent windings cross-connected at the
          output. One can make elaborate windings where first one layer
          is wound with one wire, then another layer wound (even in the
          opposite turn direction) with the second wire. But Don W took
          a simpler approach of winding from 2 solid-wire spools at the
          same time. This way, the same amount of identical wire is put
          on the coil in two independent (and insulated) strands. The
          outputs are cross-connected.&nbsp; From normal E-M theory, it
          should not be possible to get any effect in this sort of
          winding, since any kind of magnetic induction effect would set
          up a current in each of the two output windings, which would
          cancel each other due to the cross-connection at the terminus
          of the wires. However, this is what Sweet and Don W used. Don
          says his circuit worked well, similar to Sweet's setup. It
          occurred to me this could well be why you were able to get the
          MRA only to work with stranded wire.&nbsp; The stranded wire
          would be acting like a bifilar winding.&nbsp; In that case,
          the fact that the wires are continually shorted must not make
          a difference, which goes along with the hypothesis that a
          different energy than surface-wire electron motion is what we
          are dealing with here. However, it may be that a directly
          bifilar wound output coil would work better than the stranded
          wire. So I mention it here for your</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">consideration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second issue is the
          magnet itself.&nbsp; The big stopping point for replicating
          Sweet's setup has been that it requires 'conditioned' magnets.
          The specs for this had not been forthcoming from Sweet in
          clear form. (He apparently has given out grains of truth along
          with a lot of nonsense, perhaps due to legal restrictions or
          his own inclinations). Anyway, Don Watson has done a lot of
          work with magnets, and was able to put together an approach
          that seems to replicate the needed conditioning.&nbsp; Your
          1/16/95 note about "looseness of the domains in the magnet"
          plays directly to this conditioning process. What Don W
          basically does is mostly demagnetize the magnets using
          powerful capacitor-pulsed coils around the periphery of the
          flat slab magnets. He alternates the magnet from top up to top
          down (talking about the large flat side here), and also varies
          the tilt of the magnet up to about 30 degrees on the two major
          axes, giving a pulse or two at each orientation.&nbsp; The
          goal (as measured with 'magnet paper' which shows the domain
          boundaries) is to end up with a weakly magnetized magnet that
          has about 1/2 to 3/4 inches of one polarity (N or S pole
          perpendicular to the large flat surface) around the outer edge
          of the flat surface of the magnet, and then the inner section
          being the other polarity (6"x4"x1/2" magnets). In this way, a
          'magnetic bubble' is formed, which is quite visible in the
          magnetic paper. The second step is to place this magnet
          between two copper hand-built capacitor plates and charge it
          to a few KV for a while (I have more specific specs on all
          this). Don found that doing this step loosened up the magnetic
          bubble such that a small magnet could easily move it around,
          as evidenced by the magnetic paper. So, the drive coil (wound
          normally) could easily wiggle the magnetic bubble (and
          therefore a lot of magnetic grains in the magnet) to a large
          degree with a minimal input.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Don Watson's work was only
          with Barium Ferrite magnets which he found at surplus houses.
          He found that a VOM can show the difference, where touching
          any two points on the surface of a BaFe has almost infinite
          resistance; whereas the now available SrFe has a few megohms
          resistance. One theory is that the low resistance wipes out
          eddy currents which dampen the effect. Also, BaFe has better
          magnetization curves than SrFe for the demagnetizing,
          bubble-forming process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sweet (and Don W) runs the
          system completely at 60HZ. (The final conditioning step is to
          pulse the demagnetizing coils at a 60HZ peak a few times). He
          probably needs the very loosened-up magnetic domains to get
          the system to work at that frequency.&nbsp; You and Joel have
          hit on the idea of resonating the magnet at it's natural
          frequency, which perhaps gets the domains shaking nicely
          without being so loosened up. However, applying some of these
          conditioning techniques might loosen up the magnet domains
          further for greater-output operation at your frequencies also.</font>

          difference mentioned above is only 1 % of the voltages that
          you are measuring the difference between. Considering that
          this is in all likelihood about the precision of the meter you
          are using, it could be out by as much as 100%. Therefore these
          calculations are meaningless. Furthermore, you do not give any
          information about waveform, or phase. Although I appreciate
          that phase between input current and voltage are difficult to
          determine, if you can't measure input current! Personally for
          the sake of experiment, I would risk including a small
          resistor in the input circuit, even if it means reducing the
          gain somewhat, just to be sure of what is going on. Then once
          you are sure (i.e. you have measured wave-form, phase, etc.,
          with over unity operation), you can remove the resistor again,
          for the rest of your experiments. As it stands, your input
          circuit must already have some ohmic resistance, therefore it
          is not a priori fatal to the operation of the circuit. A good
          scope should be able to measure milivolt voltage drops across
          a small resistor (And with much better accuracy than
          subtracting two almost equal high voltages). On another point:
          I was wondering if you could tune the frequencies of your
          piezos, but putting them under pressure. e.g. clamped between
          rubber blocks in a small vice. Alternatively, you might&nbsp;
          include a small adjustable capacitor in series in the circuit,
          to tune the tank frequency, as is done in digital watches. I
          suspect</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">that best results will be
          obtained, only at very precise frequencies. (Perhaps improving
          asymptotically as THE frequency is approached). Another
          thought, if the piezo frequency is a multiple of the magnet
          frequency, then you might try mechanically coupling the two,
          to ensure that they resonate on exact harmonics (I suspect
          that this will further improve the Q factor of the primary
          circuit). It occurs to me that if this is not the case, then
          the input impedance will&nbsp; not rise as high, and the gain
          won't be as high as it might. Next point: I got the impression
          that Keely was talking about the third harmonic, however you
          seem to be operating on the second, i.e., 4 times the
          frequency, rather than 8 times. What happens if you use a
          magnet frequency of about 4 kHz, OR a piezo frequency of 64
          KHz? ~ Robin van Spaandonk &lt;rvanspaa@ozemail.com.au</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.&nbsp; The shape of the
          magnet might matter. We don't know because we have been
          working with the same generally oblong rectangular shape all
          along.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4.&nbsp; The dominant
          frequency is the frequency applied. There are other
          frequencies apparent, similar to the "noise" that you see in a
          transistor circuit. This "noise" is "riding" on the dominant
          frequency, and becomes more apparent as the MRA "warms up".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operation, the MRA is
          energized at peak resonance for an hour, and then detuned by
          approximately 140-160 Hz, which causes the effective impedance
          of the primary to increase by ten or more times, while only
          slightly reducing the output power.&nbsp; We use an audio
          amplifier to provide the input, with a signal generator
          feeding the amplifier. The amplifier has an impedance matching
          transformer for its output, and we use the highest impedance
          tap of the transformer secondary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A sine wave input is
          necessary, as is stranded wire. We wind the secondary first,
          and the primary over it. We are using step down ratios of 2:1
          from primary to secondary. All of the above is not to say that
          there are not better ways of doing it...these are only how we
          are doing it, and other methods may yield better results.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A friend is in the process
          of building a low power sine wave generator which we plan to
          use for a self-sustaining mode of operation. We believe that
          the generator should be able to provide 20-30 VAC at 150 ma
          maximum (for the warmup), and be tunable within 30-40 kHz. We
          will use rechargable batteries to start and maintain the
          circuit.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Late yesterday, I received a
          fax from Hal Puthoff and Scott Little at the Institute for
          Advanced Studies at Austin.&nbsp; Hal confirmed the
          measurements which we had documented for both load and no-load
          operation of the MRA.&nbsp; However, different conclusions
          were reached with regard to interpretation of the measurements
          which do not support over-unity gain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While we are still in
          dialogue with Hal and Scott with regard to the interpretation
          of the measurements, I felt it best to share this information
          with all interested KeelyNetters, along with a sincere "thank
          you" to Hal and Scott for their kind and generous assistance
          in the test of the MRA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As is often the case,
          especially with ZPE devices, correct data can lead to
          incorrect conclusions... this may be the case with the MRA as
          well, in terms of Norm's and my testing. Looking back, I'm
          very glad that we shared our data with everyone, as this may
          help others as a "case in point". Alternately, however, we
          have requested that Hal and Scott try testing the MRA without
          adding series resistors in the primary circuit. We think that
          the addition of resistors might have the effect of blocking
          subharmonics, which would cause an increase in primary source
          current. When components are added, it is no longer the same
          circuit, i.e., it is no longer the MRA, in our opinion.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We will be continuing our
          work with the MRA, as the most difficult measurement for us to
          verify is that of primary current.&nbsp; We hope to perform
          the ZPE "litmus test" with an oscillator to test the ability
          of the MRA to self-sustain. As with all tests, we will share
          the test results. My personal thanks to all of you as well,
          especially Jerry and Bill, for helping to share this and all
          previous information. ~ Joel</font> </p>

          message</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sorry I got cut off half way
          through the last message. Here is the rest of it, with some
          thoughts and data. Here are two direct ways for self powering
          the MRA that I can think of:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1)&nbsp; Make a DC powered
          sine wave oscillator and amplifier combination to drive the
          MRA, with the DC power for the oscillator/amplifier
          combination coming (eventually) from the MRA output. First,
          you power up the MRA using a battery or other external supply.
          When the MRA is up and running, you switch over to MRA power.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note: the sine wave
          oscillator/amplifier output voltage must be set by some
          reference voltage independent of the MRA DC voltage output to
          prevent unwanted positive feedback.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2)&nbsp; Make a DC powered
          AC amplifier to drive the MRA, with the DC power for the
          amplifier coming from the MRA, as above.&nbsp; Have the
          amplifier input driven by the signal generator through an
          opto-isolator (or even a fiber optic cable, if you want to
          spend a few dollars more.)&nbsp; The opto-isolator prevents
          any power flow from the oscillator to the amplifier. It
          consists of a LED and a photodiode. Current in the LED causes
          current in the photodiode. These devices cost about $1.00 and
          are available in wide variety. This method allows you to use
          the signal generator for control but totally eliminate it as a
          source of power. Eventually, you would replace it with a low
          power sine wave oscillator on the MRA board.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amplifier will probably
          need both + and - DC voltages if you want the sine wave to be
          symmetrical about ground. (No DC component.) In addition to
          using a full wave bridge at the MRA output for output power,
          use two half wave rectifiers and capacitors to generate + and
          - DC voltages. For the MRAs discussed, this means about +12
          &amp; -12 out to the amplifier. A low output impedance
          amplifier capable of putting out 30 VRMS (~90 V peak to peak)
          is not to tough to make. You need transistors rated at
          probably 150+ volts to be safe. The TIP31C NPN and the TIP30C
          PNP may be good choices. Each are rated at 140 volts Vcbo at 3
          Amps with an fT of 4 MHz. If the amplifier voltage output to
          the MRA is to be 2 to 5 VRMS (~15 V peak to peak =&gt; +/- 7.5
          volts peak from the MRA power supply) when running, the MRA
          should be able to power it with no problem.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instrumentation Thoughts: To
          measure high voltages, use a 1000:1 probe, such as a 10 Meg
          and 10K resistor pair. One end of the 10 meg goes to the
          measurement point, the other to the 10K; the other end of the
          1K goes to ground.&nbsp; Have the scope measure across the 1K
          resistor. This protects the scope, keeps the load on the test
          point small (0.1 mA at 1 KV) and allows the 1KV+ voltage to be
          in range on the scope. You might want to use a high voltage
          10 meg or a string of 2 or more resistors so they dont arc
          over.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another approach is to use a
          10 pF and a 10,000 pF (.01 uF) capacitor pair, since you are
          looking at AC. This would eliminate any DC load. Use a high
          voltage 10 pF cap.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Watch out for the current
          probes: they add some inductance because they act like a
          ferrite bead around the wire they measure.&nbsp; They measure
          current by transformer effect. What you are clipping around
          the wire is a split ferrite core.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you are not sure about
          whether the scope is chopping your signal, cut it back to one
          channel, unchopped. By the way, chop rates of 100 to 500 KHz
          are common, and so are chopped scope artifacts if your signal
          happens to be near some phase locked harmonic of the chop
          rate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I hope I have piqued your
          interest and that we can work together. It looks like

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ I had a most
          illuminating conversation with Hal today. I've asked him to
          keep the MRA for as long as he feels that it has anything to
          offer him as a device for testing. At this point, he may be
          about done with it, as it appears not to be above unity. The
          key to this is not in the reduction of current, which occurs
          as we have seen, but in the cosine of the phase angle, which
          changes as the circuit is detuned. Thus it is possible to have
          a vastly reduced current in combination with a measurable
          increase in terminal voltage and still have a relative
          increase in input power. Reactance, which alters the phase
          angle, becomes more prominent as the MRA is detuned. Now, I
          THINK that this is minimal as long as we are within the
          bandwidth of the Universal Resonance Chart, but I could be
          wrong.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If this is what is
          happening, and Hal's test provides data which indicates that
          this is the case, then the phase angle changes should be
          directly measurable. I'm not completely convinced, and won't
          be until we have quantified this. The other indications which
          we have seen, such as the reduction in output current from the
          driver xistor of the amp, and the net reduction in AC current
          to the amp, and the tests with the grain-of-wheat lamps, and
          other tests, lead me to believe that there is something more
          going on here.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I mentioned that we are
          going ahead with the plan to build an oscillator to test the
          MRA in self-sustaining mode, and that the oscillator must be
          inductively coupled to the MRA. I've asked Hal to test the MRA
          using inductive coupling via an isolation xfmr and to omit the
          series resistor. This would eliminate the local value of
          impedance, i.e., the resistor, which is replacing the
          distributed resistances in the tuned circuit. The inductive
          coupling will provide the same E&amp;I lead-lag relationships
          which we have in our own tests.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I hope that everyone is
          aware that I have the utmost respect for and confidence in Hal
          and his staff. Sometimes typed messages are subject to wrong
          interpretation, and I really DO NOT want that to be the case
          here. I genuinely respect them and the efforts which they have
          given in the test of the MRA. I understand the conclusions
          which they have reached, and am gratified that they have
          verified the accuracy of our measurements. Hopefully, this
          will put to rest all of the doubts concerning the accuracy of
          our measurements, frequency range of test equipment, etc. We
          differ only in the interpretation of those measurements as
          related to input power. I would hope that any inventor of a
          device of this type would have the advantage of a review by
          Hal Puthoff. Regardless of the outcome of the review, it is an
          honor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As I told Hal, to paraphrase
          Yogi Berra, "we agree differently"... and that is all. The
          burden of proof is, as it should be, on the inventors.&nbsp;
          So we'll prove it;&nbsp; it works or it doesn't...and we'll
          quantify it either way, and share the results.&nbsp; C'ya. ~

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Norm:&nbsp; In regard to
          your question as to our response to the MRATEST1 Report I will
          go on record with the following comments. First there is a
          strange "paradox" here that thus far has eluded even the best
          instrumentation in attempts to explain this circuit. Let say
          before going any further that I as does Joel personally
          appreciate the efforts of Hal and Scott in their analysis of
          the MRA device and look forward to working with them in the
          future in further testing when we can nail down what is really
          going on in the circuit. This project is not going to just die
          out. I personally have 3 ea. "Super MRA devices" on my bench
          which do some rather interesting things which defy all
          explanation by conventional "EM" theory. I will stand by my
          statement that there is a phenomenon here that has eluded all
          attempts to explain the circuit even with the most
          sophisticated "digital equipment". Case in point: MRA that I
          call "big coil 1"; Input is 80.2VAC @ 798HZ across a "grain of
          wheat" bulb (glows very dim) with an output of 52.7VDC into a
          load of 2 ea. (parallel) 48V panel lamps drawing 3.42 Watts at
          a current of 61.5MA. Will some "electronics engineer" out
          there tell me how a tiny grain of wheat bulb with 80.2VAC
          applied across it in series with the MRA circuit pass enough
          current to drive the observed load of 3.42 Watts? Any and all
          explanations will be accepted and considered. Wouldn't you
          agree that something real strange is going on here? To show
          you that this "DOG" is not going to lay down and die is
          evidenced by my latest MRA that I constructed last night which
          does the following: Input, 53.5VAC @ 33,600HZ with an output
          of 120.2VDC into a resistive load of a standard light bulb
          rated 120V 13.5 Watts burning very brightly.&nbsp; Input
          current? Well let's put it this way, I placed a small
          miniature Radio Shack lamp rated at 6V @ .025A in series with
          the MRA input and the tiny little lamp was burning very bright
          while sustaining the output load. Keep in mind that we are
          dissipating power in the form of heat and light in the series
          resistive load in the input side of the circuit therefore the
          question arises as to what is the effective voltage and
          current across the piezo and primary coil of the MRA circuit.
          Does conventional "bridge" or series resistance calculations
          apply. If so then will you figure it out and get back to me as
          to your explanation. I told you it wouldn't be easy. ~ Norm</font>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi Norm ~ Those are some
          very impressive figures on the Magnum. Actually, the input
          current IS as low as it seems...but the phase angle is altered
          by the reactance (capacitance) of the primary. Since the power
          factor is the cosine of the phase angle, the input power may
          be greater than it would appear...even with the lower current.
          That is the basis of Hal's conclusion, as I understand it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, comma, if the phase
          shift is occurring and is ISOLATED from the source, as with
          the autotransformer example, then the power increase as a
          result of phase shift is affecting the power in the MRA
          only.&nbsp; Therein lies the rub.&nbsp; It APPEARS that this
          is the case because of the net reduction in AC power to the
          amplifier (below standby), and because of the extremely high
          impedance of the primary as seen by the tiny amount of current
          in the grain-of-wheats, and none of that even considers the
          effects of mass aggregate resonance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, when the autoxfmrs
          would short out, the effect would be the same as if either
          half of the autoxfmr was connected to a one ohm pure
          resistance:&nbsp; 00000^^^^^^^^00000.&nbsp; With 480 VAC
          applied, the current coil 1 ohm&nbsp; coil would be 480 amps,
          and the I*E is 230,400. However, the line fuses still see a
          net inductance. These fuses are rated at 480 VAC and 100 amps,
          so their I*E is only 48,000, but they will not blow. The
          windings heat up and burn out. The massive current in the
          shorted turns is referred to as "circulating current", because
          it circulates in the windings as a result of the phase shift
          across a pure value of resistance. If the line were "seeing"
          the power in the shorted windings, the fuses would blow...but
          the line can't see it. There exists a ratio of five times the
          power which the line "sees" as opposed to the power being
          dissipated.&nbsp; Is that above unity? Well, to a fuse or a
          watt-hour meter it is. Because the MRA drives the amplifier
          below standby current for the same line voltage, I'd guess
          that the effect is related.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The isolation is the
          key...with the autoxfmr, the shorted windings are isolated
          from the line fuses by the net inductance of the coil. With
          the MRA, the isolation xfmr of the amplifier is the key...as
          long as resistances remains distributed... I think. Testing
          with a self-powering MRA will prove or disprove it, one way or
          the other. Adding a pure resistive value in the inductive path
          of the MRA may represent the shorted turn in the
          autoxfmr...maximum circulating current which the source does
          not see, but which gives the appearance of a lot of power into
          the MRA from the source. Hmmm again.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Come to think of it, the
          autoxfmr example sounds like Russell's device, doesn't
          it?&nbsp; And the shorted winding seems like a caduceus turn.
          Anybody can feel free to jump in here!&nbsp; Ideas? ~ Joel</font>

          thoughts on MRA testing. I think a critical test is to measure
          the input current.&nbsp; You could do this by putting a 1 ohm
          resistor in series with the return lead of the MRA and
          measuiring the voltage across the resistor with a scope. You
          can make the 1 ohm resistor out of ten 10 ohm resistors in
          parallel, which you should get able to get at Radio
          Shack.&nbsp; Even 5% carbon comps should work to begin with
          because you are looking for an order of magnitude.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you have grounding
          problems between the scope and the amplifier, you could a)
          float the scope with an isolation transformer (a very handy
          thing to have for this function), b) run the amplifier off a
          12-volt battery if it is the Radio Shack PA system dual
          voltage amplifier. You could use a lantern battery or run a
          length of 14 gage Malibu garden light zip cord to the
          cigarette lighter of a car, or c) make a differential
          isolation amplifier from an op amp, four 10K ohm resistors and
          a pair of 9 volt batteries.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Almost any op amp will do:
          OP-07, OP-27, LF411, LM324, etc. Connect the 9 volt batteries
          to the +V and -V power terminals. Connect the output to the
          amplifier (-) input through a 10k resistor, and connect the
          amplifier (+) to battery common. Connect the remaining two 10K
          resistors between the 1 ohm resistor and the amplifier (+) and
          (-) inputs. The scope ground goes to battery common and the
          amplifier output goes to the scope input. The result is a
          gain-of-1 differential amplifier, which will eliminate ground
          loops. (Reference: National Linear Applications Handbook,
          etc.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When you check the current,
          also check the applied voltage to the MRA and try to estimate
          the phase angle between them.&nbsp; Power = V*I*cos angle.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I got the impression that
          when you got the MRA in its low input power mode, you could
          reduce the input drive voltage from 30 VRMS to 3-5 VRMS and
          still maintain the output voltage.&nbsp; True, or am I
          dreaming? Good Luck! ~ Dave Wyland</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">David you were correct to
          assume that we had thought out the testing procedure and yes
          (to answer your question) we knew exactly what the outcome of
          the test would be by adding a "lump" resistance to the
          circuit. It kills the over-unity effect "dead as hell". All
          three of the testing parties were told that this would
          happen.&nbsp; Now if you would please go back to the starting
          point and read the whole thing over then you will not come
          back and suggest placing a "lump" resistance value anywhere in
          the input circuit to derive a current value. It just cannot be
          done this way for it completely alters the MRA into as Hal
          stated "an ordinary series resonant transformer
          circuit".&nbsp; Put you thinking cap on for there has to be a
          method of determining input current and not "close the P
          channel".&nbsp; What would you say if I told you that Joel and
          I fine tuned a MRA last night and had the voltage and current
          wave forms exactly 180 degrees out of phase at the input of
          the MRA?&nbsp; See there is something real peculiar here for
          between the piezo and the coil the phase angle was 90
          degrees.&nbsp; Comments?? ~&nbsp; Norm</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I hear you about the lumped
          resistance. However, some resistance insertion must be
          possible: at least of the order of the DC resistance of the
          wires, perhaps 0.01 ohms. This can be estimated by wire tables
          for 20 gauge wire.&nbsp; With a very small resistance plus an
          amplifier you should still be able to get a current waveform
          reading. Having the voltage and current 180 out seems strange
          Could be, but I would check by substituting a DC resistance
          for the MRA to check polarity to be sure. Strange things
          happen to phase with high Q resonant circuits near resonance.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note: the MRA circuit must
          have some effective resistance in it. Real amplifiers have
          some DC output resistance, closed loop or no. It sounds like
          the trick is to measure the current without disturbing the
          circuit. You can still try the current probe too. The ultimate
          test will be to measure the DC current into an efficient, low
          power drive amplifier. If the current to the amplifier drops,
          as (and don't forget to decouple it with a cap to make sure
          the current you are measuring is DC) you move into the good
          region, then you are in good shape. The amplifier current
          method is the ultimate method: the DC output current must be
          enough to drive the amplifier with some left over for the
          system to be over unity as a whole. Say again what drive
          voltage, peak-to-peak you are using? Good Luck ~ Dave Wyland</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hi David ~ The MRA starts
          out below unity, and builds up "steam" over an hour. It takes
          time for the harmonics to reach their peak.&nbsp; You can
          watch it happen it increments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secondary side of the
          input amp xfmr "belongs" to the MRA, so if you need to add
          resistance, add it to the primary side.&nbsp; When you add it
          to the secondary side, you modify the device under test. Look
          at it this way...if your car starts rolling down a hill, you
          can stop it with very little resistance at first. You can also
          stop the MRA with very little resistance at first. That's how
          transistor circuits are designed so that resonances won't
          build up and croak them... add a small resistance to stop them
          when they are still small, so they can't grow.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You don't have to be IN the
          circuit to measure the power TO it. If you want to "black box"
          the MRA, don't put anything extra in the box...put it outside
          (ahead) of the box.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Look at what is going on in
          your amplifier... transistors forced near cutoff, AC line
          current dropping below standby. Then look at the nice robust
          DC power off your bridge. Then go ahead and build the circuit
          to make it power itself. ~ Joel</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An MRA device provided by
          Joel McClain and Norman Wooten was tested for power
          efficiency.&nbsp; The MRA is essentially a power converter,
          driven by an audio frequency AC voltage and producing a DC
          output.&nbsp; Our tests included meter measurements, made in
          the manner employed by McClain and Wooten, and digital
          oscilloscope measurements, which provided high-resolution
          recording of input voltage and current traces. Our meter
          measurements duplicated the results reported by McClain and
          Wooten which would appear to indicate over-unity (&gt;100%
          efficiency) performance at certain frequencies, but only
          because the reactive behavior of the system is not properly
          taken into account by this measurement procedure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The digital oscilloscope
          measurements, which correctly account for the effects of
          circuit reactance, yielded a nearly constant 50% efficiency at
          all frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MRA device we tested
          consisted of a piezoelectric transducer connected in series
          with the primary of a specially constructed, hand-wound
          transformer. The transformer has a ferrite core and the
          secondary is connected to a full-wave bridge whose output is
          connected to a load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">McClain and Wooten computed
          AC input power by determining an equivalent resistance R of
          the MRA, and then substituting that value R, and the
          closed-circuit MRA input voltage V, into V^2/R to calculate an
          input power. They determined this equivalent resistance by
          substituting a decade resistance box in place of the MRA to
          find the resistance that would yield the same
          connected-circuit driving voltage. (Such a procedure is
          appropriate for purely resistive loads.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In their most recent tests
          McClain and Wooten used a small DC motor as a load for the
          MRA. We used the motor initially to confirm proper operation
          of our MRA test bed, but replaced it with a 130 ohm resistor
          to eliminate commutation noise for the tests described below.
          We also attached a 30,000 microfarad filter capacitor across
          the load resistor to smooth out the DC to ensure accurate
          measurement with common digital meters. We used two Micronta
          22-185A meters, one in series with the load to measure
          current, and one connected across the load and the other meter
          to measure total voltage delivered to the load and current
          meter.&nbsp; Total output power is the product of these two
          quantities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To generate the 34 kHz
          signal needed to drive the MRA we used a TEK FG504 Signal
          Generator amplified with a Pioneer H100, a modern solid-state
          160-watt audio power amplifier without output transformers. To
          duplicate the performance of McClain and Wooten's Radio Shack
          MPA-45, 35-watt amplifier, we had to add series L (34
          microhenries) and R (11.68 ohms) to our amplifier.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Without the series R we only
          observed a 0.10 volt droop when driving the MRA at resonance
          (McClain and Wooten's amplifier exhibited a 1.58 volt droop
          under this loading).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Without the series L the
          anomalous effects were still present but substantially lower
          in magnitude than those observed by McClain and Wooten.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With our amplifier thus
          modified by the addition of these elements, we have duplicated
          the McClain-Wooten driver amplifier setup precisely.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We used a LeCroy
          ScopeStation 140 100MHz digital oscilloscope with simultaneous
          sampling on 2 channels to measure MRA input voltage and
          current. Current was sensed as the voltage drop across the
          11.68 ohm resistor placed in series with the amplifier
          output.&nbsp; This resistor was made by placing two 22 ohm, 2
          watt carbon comp resistors in parallel to provide the desired
          resistance with a minimal inductance.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Procedure ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We conducted a series of
          measurements at different frequencies. At all times the MRA
          was connected to the 130 ohm load resistor. At each frequency

          the AC signal source:</font> <br>

          are in watts.&nbsp; The last two columns contain ratios. The
          column labeled "Mc-W eff" is the power efficiency calculated
          by dividing the DC output by the McClain-Wooten input power
          V^2/Requiv.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Discussion ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second row in the table
          shows the condition that McClain and Wooten interpreted as
          over-unity performance (e.g., an efficiency of 5.36).&nbsp;
          The problem lies in the value of 1900 ohms for Requiv.&nbsp;
          This value was obtained because of the small voltage change
          between open- and closed-circuit conditions (24.04 to 23.84)
          measured at that frequency.&nbsp; Note that at even lower
          frequencies, the source voltage was observed to actually
          increase above the open circuit voltage when the MRA was
          connected... a condition that McClain and Wooten also observed
          but did not attempt to analyze. At first glance this could be
          interpreted as evidence that the MRA was now feeding power to
          the source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, this behavior is
          exactly what is predicted by classical AC circuit analysis
          when a load with a net capacitive reactance is driven by a
          source that has a net inductive reactance.&nbsp; Since the MRA
          is essentially a series LC circuit, at frequencies below
          resonance it will exhibit a net capacitive reactance.&nbsp;
          The audio amplifier used by McClain and Wooten has an output
          transformer which, at the MRA operating frequency
          (substantially higher than the middle of the audio range),
          will exhibit a noticeable inductive reactance in its output
          impedance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With such a combination of
          reactances one cannot, using only the magnitudes of voltage
          and current, determine the actual power being transferred to
          the MRA device.&nbsp; In particular, the Requiv method fails
          as one detunes from resonance because it ignores the effect of
          reactance.&nbsp; Such reactance creates a phase shift between
          voltage and current, a fact well-known in the electric power
          industry as "power factor."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For example, if both voltage
          and current are sinusoids, true power is given by V*I*cos(A)
          where A is the phase angle between the voltage and current
          waveforms.&nbsp; An equivalent method, which is more general
          because it is applicable to any waveform, is to average the
          product of the voltage and current waveforms over an integer
          number of cycles.&nbsp; This is the method we used to obtain
          the values in the second table in the column "avg Vin*Iin".</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Based on the results of our
          experimentation and analysis we find that the MRA device
          provided by McClain and Wooten does not produce
          over-unity-efficiency results.&nbsp; The MRA circuit behaves
          instead as one would expect of a loaded transformer with a
          series capacitor in the primary circuit.&nbsp; When the MRA is
          detuned from resonance to frequencies slightly below
          resonance, the observed changes may give the impression that
          the MRA then draws unusually little power from the source
          while nonetheless maintaining a healthy output. This
          impression is false.&nbsp; True power measurements show that
          the MRA continues to draw about twice as much power from the
          source as it delivers to the load.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Analysis ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The data in the second line
          in these tables is of particular interest. That is the
          frequency at which the input power determination suggested by
          McClain and Wooten yields an efficiency of 536% whereas our
          input power measurement yields an efficiency of only 49%.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us examine the
          individual errors that contribute to the total error in our
          efficiency measurement (i.e., the 0.49 value that appears in
          the column labeled "Vin*Iin eff" in the second table).&nbsp;
          This value is the ratio of the DC output power (1.604 watts)
          to the AC input power (3.265 watts in the column labeled "avg
          Vin*Iin").</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The DC output power value
          was obtained by multiplying Vout by Iout. Both of these
          measurements were taken with Micronta 22-185A digital
          multimeters. The Vout meter was connected across both the 130
          ohm load resistor and the current meter so as to include the
          voltage drop across the current meter so that the power
          dissipated in that meter would be included in the DC output
          power determination. It should be noted that a small amount of
          power, not included in our original determination was
          dissipated in the Vout meter itself. This meter has a 10
          megohm input resistance and, at the15 volts present in the 2nd
          observation, was dissipating 22 microwatts. This should be
          added to the result of Vout*Iout to obtain the total output
          power.&nbsp; For the 2nd observation, this omission results in
          a 0.001% underestimation of the output power, an error that
          will be seen to be insignificant when compared to the errors
          in Vout and Iout which directly affect the DC output result.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mfgr's literature on the
          22-185A meter indicates that our Vout measurement accuracy was
          +/- 0.8%&nbsp; relative and the Iout measurement accuracy was
          +/- 1.5% relative.&nbsp; These errors are independent so they
          add in quadrature to yield a +/- 1.7%&nbsp; uncertainty in the
          computed DC output (Vout*Iout).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The errors in the avg
          Vin*Iin values are more difficult to characterize.&nbsp; The
          digital scope manufacturer's stated voltage measurement
          accuracy does not completely describe the errors that occur
          when two different waveforms are recorded by the scope and
          multiplied together.&nbsp; There is a finite amount of
          non-simultaneity (i.e., jitter) in the sampling of the two
          channels.&nbsp; When the two traces are multiplied together,
          the resulting error will be highly dependent on the actual
          waveforms being sampled.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore we elected to
          determine the error in the avg Vin*Iin value
          empirically.&nbsp; Ten sets of current and voltage waveforms
          were taken from the MRA device after it had been operating for
          about an hour to ensure thermal equilibrium.&nbsp; The
          operating conditions were similar to those in the second line
          of the data tables. The results of the Vin*Iin averaging for
          the ten sets were as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.26</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.24</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.25</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.20</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.20</font> <br>

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.16</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.24</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.18</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.27</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The observed standard
          deviation in these values is +/-0.042 watts. This is 1.3% of
          the mean value.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Combining (in quadrature)
          this error with the 1.7% error in the DC output power, we get
          a 2.1% relative error expected in our "Vin*Iin eff" values.
          That is, the 0.49 in line 2 should be interpreted as 0.49 +/-
          0.01.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, there is
          virtually zero chance that the conclusions presented in the
          original report were wrong due to experimental error.&nbsp;
          Our measured efficiency is 0.49 +/- 0.01.&nbsp; The
          McClain-Wooten value of 5.36 is 487 standard deviations away
          from our value.&nbsp; The probability of our reading being a
          chance observation, assuming that such readings exhibit a
          normal distribution, is astronomically small.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A number of persons have
          commented upon one particular aspect of the test conditions we
          employed to generate the data presented in our original
          report, namely the resistor we placed in series with our
          amplifier output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be noted that this
          resistor is controversial because the inventors of the MRA
          device have repeatedly claimed that, when they add such a
          resistor, the over-unity performance of the MRA is
          significantly diminished.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As we emphasized in our
          original report, we conducted our tests with a Pioneer 160
          watt power amplifier that had a much lower output impedance
          than the 35 watt Radio Shack amplifier used by McClain and
          Wooten. The resistor we added should be considered only as a
          modification of our power amplifier to make it match McClain
          and Wooten's amp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some people have suggested
          that the presence of this resistor is the reason that our MRA
          device did not produce over-unity results.&nbsp; This is not
          the case. With the resistor present we observed the same
          over-unity results claimed by McClain and Wooten when we used
          their measurement procedure. Specifically, at a frequency just
          below resonance, where the DC output is about 85% of maximum,
          we demonstrated with our equipment that the McClain and Wooten
          method of input power determination yields an efficiency of
          536%. In other words, we reproduced the results of McClain and
          Wooten perfectly. The MRA worked just as they claimed it
          would. At the same operating frequency we recorded
          high-resolution traces of input voltage and current with our
          digital scope and used them to compute the true input power to
          the MRA. This data showed the MRA to be only about 50%
          efficient.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore it was not a
          matter of MRA performance but a matter of measurement
          technique that disconfirmed the over-unity results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In our original report we
          explained why the methods of McClain and Wooten yield
          erroneous results. For the basic AC circuit theory that
          underlies our discussion we would recommend any of a number of
          excellent texts on this subject, for example "Principles of
          Linear Networks" by Friedland, Wing &amp; Ash, McGraw-Hill,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been discovered that
          an apparently hitherto unknown or unexploited source of
          ambient power exists everywhere on&nbsp; earth (extrapolating
          from experiments in Atlanta, GA and Austin,&nbsp; TX!)&nbsp;
          and from which essentially "FREE" energy can be&nbsp;
          extracted at almost no cost, merely by using&nbsp; the Key
          Concept in the Wootan/McClain discovery, namely external&nbsp;
          armonic excitation of a saturable core transformer, which
          causes it to act like an Antenna that extracts ambient energy
          in amounts 19 times or more than the energy required for the
          harmonic excitation. Indeed, the original MRA design continues
          to work and to exceed all original expectations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the MRA2 configuration,
          even when the piezoelectric capacitor has been removed and
          even when the primary resonant circuit has been cut, it still
          continues to produce verifiable output power! All that is
          required is a single wire from the AC Signal&nbsp; Generator
          to the saturable-core transformer of the original MRA
          disclosure in order to cause useful power to be generated in
          the secondary circuit in amounts vastly greater than the power
          input from the harmonic Signal Generator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This appears to be an
          electrical analogue of the chemical phenomenon of Catalysis,
          namely the periodic pulses of energy into the transformer
          'catalyze' the transformer's nature so that it operates in an
          apparently hitherto never before seen mode, namely it behaves
          like a novel 'Antenna' which is extracting AMBIENT ENERGY from
          "somewhere"! It is not necessary to understand completely at
          this time what the source of Ambient Energy may be, in order
          to exploit the phenomenon in an environmentally benign way for
          the benefit of mankind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Numerous maverick scientists
          and engineers have suggested that there may be hitherto
          unknown aspects of electromagnetic radiation not comprehended
          in the standard Maxwell's Equations, such as the controversial
          "scalar&nbsp; waves" postulated by&nbsp; retired Air Force
          Colonel Tom Bearden.</font> </p>

          about it from the New Energy News newsletter, which reproduced
          the internet announcement of Wootan and McClain, suggests that
          the ambient energy&nbsp; comes from the earth's gravitational
          field and is somehow being converted into electrical energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Former BYU professor of
          Physics &amp; Astronomy, Dr. Bob Bass speculates that MRA2 (as
          was the original MRA1) may be somehow tapping the ambient
          electromagnetic energy known to exist in the Earth-Ionosphere
          Cavity in the form of Schumann&nbsp; Resonances which are
          continually resupplied every time a lightning bolt from a
          cloud strikes the earth. "As explained in the Second Edition
          of Jackson's classical book on Electromagnetism, the great
          genius Nikola Tesla discovered the Schumann resonances
          experimentally 50 years before Schumann predicted them
          theoretically," says Bass, who adds that he once calculated
          that "every cubic meter of space near the surface of the earth
          contains on the order of one kilowatt of standing waves,
          similar to those in a microwave oven except at vastly reduced
          frequencies, which no one knows how to extract efficiently."
          Or do they? The late Utah inventor Moray, author of a book
          entitled "The Sea of Energy in Which the Earth Floats",
          astounded famous scientists in the 1920s and 1930s with
          never-explained demonstrations of his ability to extract 3
          kilowatts from 'nowhere' at will, anywhere (even randomly
          selected points in the desert), using his unexplained Moray
          Valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moray submitted a Patent Application, but
          withdrew it and his secret died with him. Admirers of Moray
          point out that his&nbsp; writings included the words
          "Germanium triode" decades before the Transistor was
          discovered by Bell Labs scientists (who won a Nobel Prize) and
          who had been directed into solid-state physics by the late
          Harvey Fletcher, who had earlier witnessed Moray's work and
          been shown every detail except the secret of the
          vest-pocket-sized Moray Valve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A recent controversial
          theory of Austin Institute for Advanced Study physicist Hal
          Puthoff and his collaborators Haisch and Rueda appears to
          explain gravity as not an intrinsic property of matter but as
          an indirect consequence of Maxwellian electromagnetic
          radiation, namely that (as earlier suggested by the late
          Russian dissenter Sakharov) gravity is a "shadow&nbsp; effect"
          similar to the accepted Casimir Effect of quantum
          electrodynamics. Bass points out that if the
          Haisch-Puthoff-Rueda theory is correct then Hodowanec's idea
          of tapping the earth's gravity field in some electromagnetic
          way not hitherto suggested is conceivable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whatever the Ambient Energy
          Reservoir into which the MRA is tapping, the novel phenomenon
          is real and deserving of exhaustive further investigation,
          according to elated inventors Wootan, McClain, Taylor and
          McCracken, who urge independent investigators to seek to
          replicate their discovery.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Lead Zirconate Titanate
          piezo transducer can be had from H&amp;R Corp, but its
          dimensions are: 2" dia x 0.1" thick, not the same as the
          original Keelynet device. It has a 45KHz resonance. Will it
          work? Dunno. They have several hundred in stock.</font> </p>

          numerous ceramic magnets, but it's unknown whether or not any
          are close enough to Norm's original that they will work. They
          offer one large ceramic magnet, 4 x 3 x 1", and have only
          about 50 in stock. This magnet has its poles on the flat
          magnet face, and has TWO poles on each face.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At least two kinds of
