        Subject: Piezo Test </p>
      <p>Hi Jerry:&nbsp; You remember those piezo's that you got from
        Tanners'? I've been testing one of them, and have seen an
        "anomalous" effect, so maybe <br>
        some of the other experimenters will try. I put one of the
        piezos on the top of a CB antenna, and connected the antenna to
        a square wave generator.&nbsp; I tuned the generator until the
        piezo started to "sing", and put a 'scope on it. At 7480 Hz, the
        peak sine wave output from the piezo is 8 volts at 37430 Hz. In
        other words, frequency is being multiplied by a factor of 5.00
        times, and voltage is going from millivolts of radiated signal
        to eight volts peak to peak. More interesting is that when the
        piezo is resonated at 37430 Hz, the output goes up be 50 times
        to 400 volts. </p>
      <p>If this can be duplicated, we may have a way to use piezos to
        convert earth's naturally occuring background radiation into
        useful energy.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

      <p>Hi Norm:&nbsp; Since the Nieper ring exhibits anti-g
        characteristics, it seems to me that the free-running freq.
        should relate in some way to the resonant freq. of ferromagnets.
        That freq. has been listed as 170KHz or 180KHz, depending on
        whose file you read. I injected signals into the base of a
        Nieper ring xistor until the collector signal locked on at
        174,800Hz and froze the display on the scope. So, IF my
        assumption is correct, the ferromagnetic resonant freq is
        174.8KHz, as measured of the Simpson 710 counter.&nbsp; ~&nbsp;

      <p>Joel:&nbsp; Now that you have nailed down the freq as 174.8KHZ
        it is interesting that this verifies what I have been pounding
        on the desktop for years now the fact that Nikola Tesla's big
        coil out in Colorado Springs was tuned to around 170 KHZ.
        Coincidence, never: Tesla knew the Ferro Resonant freq very
        well. I will bring to you a 50 Watt RF Linear amp and my Wavetek
        function generator which has 8 different wave forms and will go
        up to 30 MegHZ. We will try to "levitate" some barium ferrite
        magnets or do a little "harmonizing" with them with some special
        coils which I would like to try. Just maybe the "Sparky Sweet"
        phenomenon is not that hard to do. ~&nbsp; Norm </p>

      <p>Joel:&nbsp; I set up an experiment to verify what you had found
        as follows: I placed a piece of Neodymimum magnet material into
        one of my TET multi <br>
        resonance coils and got an output of free resonance of 174.925
        KHZ. I then placed into the circuit in "parallel" one of the
        barium titanate <br>
        transducers with an alnico bar magnet through the center hole
        which immediately tripped the circuit into free resonance at a
        freq of 349.850 which is one octave higher. The scope locks on
        and the freq counter is very stable. The RF coming off the TET
        coil sure screws up the lower bands on the TV. I will bring out
        to you the while set-up later this weekend. Very interesting.

        Subject: (R) Ferromagnetic Resonance </p>
      <p>Hi Norm: Excellent squared! Here's the latest on the 'ring':
        Using the freq. counter to measure the major component of the
        Nieper ring output, as it is a complex waveform with harmonics,
        the output is 1.1MHz. The counter may be averaging somewhat, but
        the ring was reported to drop off from 1.3 MHz after warming up.
        This seems to be about par.&nbsp; Been thinking that the
        resonance may be electromechanical as opposed to purely
        electrical... Since the constant in all versions of this circuit
        is the TO3 case xistor, perhaps there is a 'ringing' within the
        case cavity. Will have measure a TO3 and apply cavity resonance
        equation to determine this. </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN&nbsp; ~&nbsp; To: GERALD O'DOCHARTY <br>
        Subject: Ferromagnetic Resonance </p>
      <p>Gerald:&nbsp; Maybe you could provide some input to this
        puzzle. Joel and I&nbsp; are building the Neiper Ring
        transistorized circuit which is reported <br>
        to loose 15% of it's weight when it enters free resonance. This
        project led Joel into the investigation of the resonance freq of
        ferromagnetism. Remember Tesla's coil was designed for somewhere
        around 170 KHZ. Corum calculated the values as close as could be
        determined from available info. After Joel did his test and got
        174.8 KHZ, I set up a similar test but used what we refer to as
        a multifreq resonant coil which I must confess is my own
        "rube-goldberg" device. Basically it is a tetrahedron coil which
        has each of the 6 edges 12 inches in length with 26 turns of #30
        silver polyeese covered wire. The coil is wound in a full
        tetrahedron shape with one continous wire with no breaks so that
        you have in the base plane of the geometric shape of a
        tetrahedron a current which goes in one direction and creates a
        magnetic plane with North pole above the plane and the South
        pole below the plane when current is sent into the coil in one
        direction and the poles reverse when the polarity is reversed.
        What is interesting is that the vertical legs of the tetrahedron
        contain 26 turns of wire with current going in both directions
        or a total of 52 turns. The input and output wires enter and
        exit the whole coil at the verticies of the TET. This coil will
        resonate with about any freq in the area and when amplified will
        pick up even the faintest magnetic disturbancies.&nbsp; For
        example, I can attach my scope to the coil with no amplification
        and pick up the paterns of data from my printer while it is
        running in the next room.&nbsp; When everything is absolutely
        quiet it will sit there and pick up a background signal around
        the 170KHZ freq which I always thought was caused by the earth's
        magnetic flux. By placing a Neodymimum magnet inside of the coil
        and injecting a signal from my Wavetek signal generator into it
        I looked for a freq which gave me the maximum gain on the scope
        which turned out to be 174.925 KHZ.&nbsp; I next wanted to
        back-up the figure so I placed a round bar of alnico 5 magnet
        material about 1 inch long and 1/2 inch in diameter in one of
        the barium titanate transducers (which you were blowing up).
        When you ring these transducers they will go into free
        resonance. The alnico provided a reference freq and when placed
        on to of the Neodymimum magnet the circuit tripped into a
        powerful free resonant freq of 349.850 Khz which is one octave
        higher than the previous freq. This whole experiment is still
        not conclusive and needs attention from others like yourself and
        Dan Davidson. Bert's interest is "tweaked" along with several
        others like Bill Beaty. I'm sure Woody will "get off" on this
        one also. More later. Will appreciate input from all interested
        in this worthwhile experiment. ~&nbsp; Norm </p>

        Subject: Ferromagnetic Resonance </p>
      <p>When Joel started "poking" around with nailing down the natural
        "ferromagnetic" resonant frequency we were refining the Neiper
        Ring circuit which looses weight when it runs in free resonance.
        What Joel wanted to do was match the free running freq of the
        Neiper Ring to the natural resonant freq of the earths magnetic
        field, voila, gravity cancellation. With our numbers it may soon
        be possible to build a "Sparky Sweet" type of coil with a
        tickler running off freq by just enough to cause the full
        cancellation and boost of a permanent magnets field 120 times a
        second which will yield 60 HZ sine wave out of the power coil.
        If you all will go to the Nikola Tesla book "Complete Patents"
        and go to page 176 you will find Patent # 413,353 dated Oct. 22,
        1889 in which Tesla designed and built a permanent magnetic
        device which would rectify or convert AC to DC to drive the
        existing street lights of New York which were DC arc lamps until
        the AC powered incandescent bulbs were installed. See, he
        provided AC power to the city before the lights could be
        converted or replaced. Being an ingenious fellow he simply came
        up with a simple rectifier long before the selenium types were
        even thought of. This principle is easy to understand for it is
        basically the familiar "buck-boost" where we cancel then boost
        the magnetic flux in "counter magnetic" fields. We have now two
        projects springing out of one. First being the original
        "enhancement" of the anti-gravity tendacies of the Neiper
        circuit and the fabrication of a "Sweet" type of ZPE generator
        utilizing the findings. We welcome all in "E" to join the hunt
        so to speak. There is room for all to learn from this.&nbsp;

      <p>Norm brought over his Dec-O-gram precision scale, and we used
        it todetermine whether the Nieper ring would become "lighter",
        as was reported in the New Energy News. It does work... weight
        loss wasmeasured to be 350 milligrams, as opposed to the maximum
        loss of 500 milligrams that N.E.N had seen.&nbsp; The weight
        loss occurs over a periodof about 15 to 20 minutes, also as
        reported. However, the weight gain after the circuit was
        deenergized took considerably longer. After about 20 mimutes,
        only 200 mg had been regained, at which point we disassembled
        the test setup for another test.&nbsp; We will upload a file
        with the circuit description if anyone wants to try this. </p>

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN&nbsp; ~&nbsp; To: ALL <br>
        Subject: Nieper Ring = Tetrahedron </p>
      <p>First it had to be verified that the Nieper Ring worked as
        described by both Nieper and the N.E.N evaluation. Next, it has
        to be understood why this anomolous reaction occurs.&nbsp;
        Questions: (1) Why use audio power transistors in a circuit that
        is going to "run" at 1.3MHz?&nbsp; Transistors are designed
        around an "alpha cut-off frequency", which is five times the
        maximum expected frequency to be used.&nbsp; For an audio
        xistor, that is 5 X 20KHz, or 100 KHz.&nbsp; The xistors are
        over ten times out of their range. (2) Why use a fixed bias to
        drive the xistors into hard conduction with no input except
        capacitive coupling from a previous stage? Why use common
        emitter configuration, which is capable of the highest power
        gain, but with a collector load resistor value so low that power
        gain is negligible? (3)Why drive the xistors into a collector
        load value that is so low that both the xistors and the load
        resistors become hot?&nbsp; Since the weight loss only occurs
        after about 15 minutes, does the accumulated heat play a part in
        this effect? (4) Why use three stages, coupled from output to
        input?&nbsp; Does it make any difference how many stages are
        used? Is more better? (5) Why does the circuit free-oscillate at
        1.3MHz, or oscillate at all for that matter?&nbsp; Why is the
        collector signal a mixed bag of harmonics?&nbsp; What does
        1.3MHz have to do with gravity? </p>
      <p>Answers (I think): (1)&nbsp; Silicon atoms form a crystal
        lattice structure, and the crystals are tetrahedral in shape,
        with each of the four valence electrons forming a covalent bond
        with each of the four adjacent atoms. This is the key to
        understanding the Nieper Ring.&nbsp; An audio transistor in
        forced conduction with no input signal is stressed by the
        biasing potential.&nbsp; As heat builds at the junction, the
        lattice structure begins to resonate at its' own frequency, ie,
        that of a natural tetrahedron.&nbsp; Using audio xistors is
        effectively a low-pass filter, keeping out high freq noise or
        ambient signals. (2) The Nieper Ring design produces junction
        heat, but within the design parameters of the xistors.&nbsp;
        Potential and heat provide the stress which permit the
        tetrahedral resonance. (3) Accumulated heat over time allows the
        silicon to reach the level of resonance which is limited by the
        collector load resistor. (4) There is a natural symmetry to the
        circuit.&nbsp; Viewed as a point-to-point diagram, the ring is a
        Delta-T, or tetrahedron.&nbsp; Viewed as a conventional
        schematic, this is not apparent.&nbsp; However, if you WIRE it
        point-to-point, you are building a tetrahedron of material which
        is tetrahedral in its' atomic structure. Three xistors form the
        base, and the EB and CB networks meet at the B+ point, which is
        the fourth corner of the tetrahedron. (5) The output "waveform"
        is a complex wave, whose major component is approx. 1.3 MHz as
        measured on an oscilloscope. However, using a frequency counter,
        the AGGREGATE frequency is 1.1 MHz, and using signal injection
        at the xistor bases, the waveform will peak at harmonics of the
        1.1MHz aggregate. One of those harmonics is the ferromagnetic
        resonant frequency used by Nikola Tesla, and it is this harmonic
        which may be responsible for the weight reduction. The small
        level of this harmonic, at 1/6 of aggregate resonance, is
        nevertheless amplified in effect by a factor of 1000 because it
        is incorporated into a resonant tetrahedral lattice structure.
        The EFFECT is measured by the weight loss. </p>
      <p>I see this circuit as a spinning pyramid, where the walls
        (electrons) are forced to spin in a tetrahedral pattern,
        creating a vortex at the natural resonance of a tetrahedral
        lattice. The walls appear to be stationary, but the material
        that forms the walls is moving, as if the walls were hollow and
        water were being pumped through the void. </p>
      <p>There are many potential uses for this circuit... it is an
        excellent investigation tool, and with no further modification,
        is a natural gravity detector. It could also be used to test
        time = gravity, by placing a synchronized watch into the field,
        and observing changes that occur. I'm sure that there are many
        other uses, but those two come to mind. The Nieper Ring is
        essentially a passive device. Actively "pumping" the output via
        an external amplifier may result in even greater effect,
        provided that the input impedance of the external device is high
        enough not to disturb the naturally occuring resonance.&nbsp; ~

      <p>Gerald:&nbsp; The inspiration behind the construction of my

        Buckey-Ball manufacturer) <br>
        and I met a lady that claims to have ridden on an alien space
        craft during which time she was told that the flight physics was

        TETRAHEDRAL geometry. She was told that the tetrahedron was
        rotated "virtually" which extracted enery directly from the
        aether or space <br>
        vacuum. My design was based on her discription and incorporated
        a scalar vector cancellation in the vertical legs of the
        geometric figure. This electrical and magnetic field
        cancellation can be verified by the total absence of magnetic
        flux along the legs of the TET while under considerable power.
        There is a very powerful base plane magnetic field created which
        revolved at extreme RPM (virtual rotation). I have one version
        that Joel is doing some test on that is a full nested pair of
        TETs to model the earth or any other spherical object. Will keep
        you informed of test results. When the nested TET is run you get

        Subject: Nested Tet, Cube and Phi </p>
      <p>Built a double tetrahedron as a nested pair. In the process of
        doing this, I noticed that when rotated 45 degrees, the nested
        tet is a cube in which each square side is divided into four
        equilaterals. This provides an 8:1 ratio, or octave, which is at
        right angles to the octave formed by the sides. Reminded me of
        the "Law of Squares" book by Searle, and Keely's mention of
        using freq's at right angles for resonance. Seen from this
        angle, the double tet is both a Lissajous and a caduceus... but
        when rotated back "up", the double tet is "earth", as viewed
        from the perspective of the grid ley lines. </p>
      <p>There's also an interesting Phi relationship, because the Phi
        overlap from one square to the next is 0.618, and that is 0.118
        more than the half which it intersects, which in eight rotations
        produces one whole "virtual" rotation. This virtual ninth is, I
        think, interdimensional because it does not exist in 3-D, and
        may be the gateway to ether or ZPE when the nested tet is at
        resonance. Anyone who has already been down this road, feel free
        to jump in here... Jerry? </p>

        and a diagram of the wave flow 4 wave 6 path? I looked at this
        diagram and it is exactly what Joel is seeing in the nested tet.
        When I built my nested tet, before I tied off everything into a
        complete 3D "Star of David" configuration, also the same
        configuration as the "nested" tets form inside the earth I could
        rotate them within one another and see what Joel is referring to

        Subject: Magnet as Battery </p>
      <p>Using Gerald's analogy of visualizing a spring in compression
        and expansion at the same time, I'm trying to understand
        magnets. I think of magnets as batteries which we don't know how
        to "connect" to, yet. </p>
      <p>Magnetizers electrically "slam" material with capacitive
        discharges. Material is energy is "solid" form. The "slam"
        compresses and expands the energy/material, resulting in an
        imbalance. The "outside" continues to try to compress while the
        "inside" is trying to expand. That may be why magnets fracture
        so easily, and why each chip, as in a hologram, retains all of
        the characteristics of the whole. A magnet is in a constant
        state of trying to collapse into itself, which is why it
        attracts ferrous materials which match the patterns of its own
        lattice structure. </p>
      <p>The "domains" of a magnet are each holographic miniatures of
        the whole magnet, held together by the molecular structure of
        the magnetized material. When a domain flips, as in the VTA, it
        reverses the compression/expansion, releasing electrons from the
        material. Sweet has learned how to "connect the battery"... just
        reverse the process of magnetization slowly, and collect the
        electrons that are released via sympathetic vibration. Even if
        you could collect just the amount of energy that is contained in
        the expansion/compression, without any of the catalyst
        electrons, magnets would be excellent, rechargable power
        sources. </p>
      <p>The problem is that the amount of power needed to "excite" the
        domain structures of most magnets exceeds the power out. That is
        why it is <br>
        important to find magnetic resonance as a method of "tripping"
        the domains into a controlled energy expansion. All domains,
        regardless of the type of magnet, respond to 175KHz, indicating
        that they all share the same lattice structure. This is a start,
        but it is not the "aggregate". Maybe acoustic vibration at the
        cavity resonance of a magnet would also "loosen" the domains, if
        it were in phase with the electrical resonance signal. Maybe the
        resonances have to be applied from within the magnet to reverse
        the externally applied force which created the original
        imbalance. A round, hollow magnet... like earth, would permit
        this. </p>

        Subject: Barium Ferrite Beat Freq. </p>
      <p>Hi Norm: I've found a way to "tickle" the barium ferrite
        magnets... you can get any output freq you want as a result of
        the "beat" freq between 8KHz and 174.9KHz. A barium ferrite pair
        resonates audibly loudest at exactly 8KHz. I'm using your spool
        of magnet wire inside the gap between the halves to turn the
        magnet into a "speaker", and you can hear it "sing". The coil is
        connected to 8KHz from a sig gen. </p>
      <p>Wrap a primary coil around one of the halves, and connect it to
        the other sig gen running at 174.9KHz. Wrap a secondary around
        the primary, and you will see a waveform that doubles in size at
        a rate that is equal to the variation of either of the sig gen's
        from their tuned freq. The increase in waveform is the b/f
        magnet expanding into the secondary as the excitation field
        "collapses" at the rate of the beat freq. You can double or half
        the 174.9 and see the same thing but at lower amplitude. Since
        the 174.9 and 8 are constants for these magnets, the more we can
        sensitize them, the easier to flip the domains. </p>
      <p>We need to blast one pair with 8KHz at high power to loosen its
        tie a little, I think.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

        Subject: Piezo + Magnet + Unity+ </p>
      <p>Hi Norm: Found a way to nearly triple the I/O ratio of the
        barium ferrite transformer. Use a piezo in series with the
        primary and tune the sig gen to three times the resonant freq of
        the magnet... I'm only using a single magnet from the pair, and
        the res freq is 10800 HZ. However, using the piezo as a coupling
        cap, and tuning the sig gen to 32400 HZ, the input power is
        3.4mw, and the output power is 9.7 mw. The measurements are
        taken across Dale precision resistors. This isn't going to drive
        much of a load, but by applying more power than half a volt from
        a sig gen will, if the same power ratios apply at greater input
        levels. The piezo's lattice being connected to the magnet's
        lattice causes harmonic sympathetic vibrations and this is a way
        to avoid "tuning" the magnets, as "Sparky" did. Because the
        piezo is resonating, it is "coupling" the input + free
        electrons, sort of like a quartz lighter. Applying this to the
        magnet at the third octave of the magnet's resonance will keep
        the magnet in a state of agitation, which releases MORE free
        electrons. This plus the high impedance of the input, especially
        when you consider that it is a series resonant circuit
        (typically LOW impedance) allows the output power to exceed the
        input power.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

      <p>Hi Norm: This circuit is basically an AC battery, which is
        connected to an ordinary bridge rectifier to give DC out. It is
        a piezo in series with a coil connected to a sig gen.&nbsp; The
        sig gen is putting out a measured half volt, but there is a volt
        apiece across the piezo and the coil as a result of the coil
        being wrapped around a barium ferrite magnet. According to Ohm,
        this is not possible, and it is ONLY possible because the piezo
        is being resonated at the third octave of the resonant freq of
        the barium ferrite. Let's crank this up and give Mr. Puthoff a

        Subject: The Rule of Nines </p>
      <p>There is a "rule of nines", somewhere under the "Law of
        Squares", and it basically says that VIRTUAL or ETHERIC rotation
        occurs at PHI rates in resonant (all) matter. In an earlier
        message, I said that the nested tet is a
        cube/lissajous/caduceus, depending on where you are when you
        look at it. Also, in PHI, you have a VIRTUAL rotation of the
        cube after each octave, and there are three octaves (Front,
        Right, Left), and each octave contains resonance for each of the
        notes( Front, Right, Left) for a total of nine notes. As Keely
        said, and as we can see by looking at the tet, the forces are at
        RIGHT ANGLES relative to each other. </p>
      <p>Using the tetrahedral lattice structure of silicon in a
        tetrahedral device such as the Nieper ring, the effect created
        is a reduction of the quadrupole forces of gravity. </p>
      <p>Using the rule of nines in a device that combines lattice
        structures in series, and applying three octaves (nine
        harmonics) to the mass, you receive more power out than is
        applied to the device. This is because the lattices are
        virtually rotating 360 degrees for every cycle of input, and
        each cycle consists of eight tetrahedrons, which are apparent
        when you "square the circle, which is done with PHI. It's a
        nested relationship. </p>
      <p>I now understand why the PHI relationship was once considered
        as part of a "sacred" geometry, and why the Fibonacci series,
        which is PHI, is a part of "magic squares". It is how things
        really work.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

        Subject: Magnetic Resonance Amplifier </p>
      <p>Today, to test the validity of the Magnetic Resonance
        Amplifier, or AC Battery, either name "works", Norman Wootan and
        I applied a signal <br>
        amplitude to the circuit which would "trip" the components into
        a higher level of output. The actual measurements, including
        power gains, will be included in a file to be uploaded with a
        schematic. </p>
      <p>However, the circuit design is so simple that many people can
        build it from a written description. It only has two parts. The
        power gain is between 300-400%, and increases as the load is
        increased. The theory of operation can wait until the file is
        written. For now, if you want to build it, just connect a piezo
        in series with a primary coil that is wrapped around a barium
        ferrite magnet. Connect the secondary to a bridge rectifier, and
        the bridge to a DC load. Apply a signal level AC to the piezo,
        and adjust the frequency for the peak DC voltage. </p>
      <p>You will find that the AC voltage across either the piezo or
        the primary is greater than the voltage from the signal
        generator. Primary current is virtually nil due to the piezo,
        and DC output power is several times the input power. Today, we
        measured 0.685W in, with 2.75W out. We used this to run a DC
        motor which consumed 2.5W, and to light a DC lamp very brightly.
        This is hard output DC. As we increased the potential from the
        sig gen, current dropped even lower, and output power increased,
        which improved the power gain ratio. </p>
      <p>Norm and I plan to exhibit this at the next KeelyNet meeting.
        If you have any questions before the file is created, please
        address them to either me or to Norm. We worked together on
        this, and it took the symmetry of both of us to get it into
        operation. We think that it can make a difference.&nbsp; ~ Joel

      <p>Jerry:&nbsp; To improve the performance of the test rig Joel
        and I wound a new coil with about 600 turns in the primary and
        secondary which made the overall coil about the size of one of
        those "nerf" footballs. When we hooked it into the circuit we
        found that when the freq was readjusted to the different
        impedance of the new coil that we got a multiple of 25.7:1
        voltage across the series pizzo and coil versus the input
        voltage. We were inputing 35 volts at about 22 KHZ and got 600
        volts across the barium ferrite coil and 300 volts across the
        barium titanate transducer which was singing in free resonance.
        Since the coil and the pizzo are in series there is a total of

        "constructive" feed-back from fellow builders like yourself.
        Keep in mind that this is a compound resonant device and
        therefore is deceptive in it's simple appearance. You may change
        winding ratios many times before you get it right so that the
        "Rule of Nines" that Joel talks about is complied with. If you
        will go back to the KeelyNet files on Keely's experiments and
        the DANART1 file then you will get the "hang" of tripple
        resonances and how they cause the crystalline lattice of the
        magnet to trip into free oscillation. When you get your circuit
        running properly you will be able to hear the magnet "singing"
        all over your house. Depending on the mass you will get a
        sustained note anywhere from 8 KHZ up to 12 KHZ. This is a very
        interesting circuit because off the shelf permanent magnets can
        be used with "no conditioning" needed. Basically you are
        "ringing" the fundamental structure of the magnet at the
        molecular level and possible at the atomic level causing it to
        be an "etheric pump" yielding electron that are somehow being

      <p>Since Joel and I have created a lot of interest in the MRA
        device we will place everything on line so that no "stone is
        left unturned". Long ago I saw a sci-fi movie of a suitcase size
        device that you could plug any size AC load into it and it would
        power it with no problem. I dreamed of building such a device by
        imploying a block of natural quartz with a mechanical oscillator
        attached to all faces (Tesla oscillator) to force the quartz to
        yield free electrons. I envisioned the output (high voltage) to
        be stored in a capacitor bank (1 kilo joule) them the output
        going into an inverter circuit and stepdown transformer to take
        this piezo generated voltage down to a useful AC voltage. Now
        Joel and I have combined this effect to the resonating of the
        lattice structure of a magnet to sum the outputs of the piezo
        effect and the ferro-resonant effect to give an over-unity total
        at the bridge rectifier. Last night Bert Pool came over to
        gather up the needed supplies to build a prototype circuit to do
        independent evaluation.&nbsp; After I had run the circuit
        through the paces noting the outputs and thoroughly discussing
        what we thought was going on here I turned off the meters,
        scopes and the signal generator and finally went to bed. Well I
        woke up a 2:00AM with a headache, went to get the tylenol and
        went into the room with the test rig on the bench. I turned on
        the frequency counter and found that the circuit was running in
        free oscillation with no input. Although no power was being
        produced the free running oscillations were filling my living
        space with a high freq ultrasonic squeal that as Joel has warned
        will give you a migraine <br>
        headache in short order. The free oscillation was around 44 KHZ
        with the freq counter ranging up and down (no lock on). I had to
        take the circuit apart to stop the ultrasonic ringing. As Joel
        has pointed out these titanium zirconate transducers, once set
        into resonance will continue to ring for a long period. Since
        there is possible some conditioning taking place within the
        crystaline structure of the material I believe that over a long
        conditioning period (burn in time) the whole circuit can be make
        sensitive to a combination of two frequencies that are
        necessary. The first freq involved is the input to drive the
        transducer which has to be 3 octaves down from the fundamental
        natural frequency of the ferro-magnetic resonant frequency.
        Although it has not been mentioned before in "A" public on this
        net, Joel and I were successful in isolating and identifying the
        fundamental Ferromagnetic Resonant Frequency as being around
        174.9 KHZ. Doesn't it sound ironic that this freq should fall so
        close to what the Corums have determined that Tesla designed his
        big coil out in Colorado springs around? I have read several
        articles that speculated that the ferromagnetic freq or the
        earth natural magnetic field resonated around 180KHZ. With this
        174.9 freq in mind we have applied the Joel McClain "Rule of
        Nines" to the circuit where we run the transducer at a freq that
        is a multiple of the fundamental 174.9 ferroresonant freq. His
        circuit is running at a fifth and mine is running at a third.
        Example: I input a sine wave signal at 2.28 V AC into the series
        resonant circuit at 59070 HZ and get a voltage developed across
        the transducer of 26.04V and a voltage across the coil of 24.02
        with an output voltage from the bridge rectifier of 30.2 V DC.
        If every thing is running in an ideal phase relationship
        (transducer oscillations and ferro-coil oscillations) then the
        beat freq will partially sum the two voltages since they are in
        a series circuit and set up a circulating current in the primary
        which when the primary winding and the secondary windings have
        the proper impedance matching will extract the maximum amout of
        energy from the circulating current in the transformer into a
        healthy output at the bridge which is far OVER-UNITY, high I/O
        ratio. My circuit is showing a 13:1 ratio at this time and I
        have not even approached a good impedance match in the windings.
        A real sharp RF engineer could sort all the details out in short
        order. I don't profess to be an RF engineer but have a good
        background in electronics. </p>
      <p>This is the reason for Joel and I going "PUBLIC DOMAIN" with
        the circuit so that some highly skilled folks out there can take
        this circuit and help develope it into something of practical
        use. We don't want PROFIT-motivated people to "rip" off the idea
        for self gain. We want any potential benefits of the circuit to
        remain free for the taking. More notes as we learn more. As Joel
        says, "we are like teenagers learning to drive dad's Olds". A
        little help from interested fellow researchers is welcome. ~

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN&nbsp; ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA in Conventional Theory </p>
      <p>The MRA is a series resonant LC circuit in which power gain is
        attainable as a result of the increase in effective impedance
        under certain operating conditions. When the series impedance
        increases,primary current is reduced. When the power available
        from the secondary coil either remains the same or increases as
        the primary circuit impedance increases, a power gain occurs. </p>
      <p>This is not possible with a series resonant circuit made of
        conventional materials. Even unity power transfer is considered
        to be unattainable as a result of accumulated losses in the
        components, which are passive (reactive) devices. Materials and
        construction methods are chosen for these components based upon
        the type of application and frequency to be applied, with the
        goal of minimizing losses. </p>
      <p>A typical capacitor with polyethylene dielectric has a
        dielectric constant of 2.3 times air. Air has a constant of 1.0,
        and is the basis for comparison. Titanium dioxide, however, has
        a dielectric constant maximum of 170, and a corresponding power
        factor of only 0.0006, comparable with polyethylene, so that the
        dissipation of primary current in the dielectric is extremely
        low. This is where the comparison ends, because the titanium
        composite "capacitor" is also a piezoelectric device as well as
        an excellent capacitor. </p>
      <p>Heat adversely affects the power factor of most dielectric
        materials. Titanium zirconate, however, contains polar molecules
        which rotate as thermal pressure is applied. This rotation
        increases the dielectric constant if the frequency applied is
        equal to or lower than the resonant frequency of the dielectric.
        At series resonance, the rotation of polar molecules contributes
        to heat; as the dielectric constant increases, a corresponding
        release of free electrons occurs, as a direct result of the
        piezoelectric properties of the device. </p>
      <p>In application, the MRA is tuned at resonance for maximum power
        transfer, then detuned slightly for maximum power gain. This
        relates directly to the use of thermal pressure at resonance,
        and the effect that this has on continued polar rotation and the
        release of donor electrons. </p>
      <p>The coil, or primary of the MRA is a magnetic core which
        relative to the fixed capacitance of the piezo, is a tuned
        permeability device. This is often used in RF devices to attain
        a stable resonant frequency.&nbsp; Magnetic materials are chosen
        based upon the operating characteristics of the intended
        application to reduce eddy currents in the operating range. In
        these applications, the resonant frequency of the magnet itself
        is avoided, as this would "beat" with the oscillating
        current.&nbsp; However, in the MRA, this is the exact effect we
        want. </p>
      <p>The barium ferrite magnet resonates audibly at frequencies
        which are harmonics of the series resonant frequency. The effect
        of this in a typical audio application is called harmonic
        distortion, and is not desirable, but once again, in the MRA,
        this is what we want to occur. There is energy in the harmonics,
        and this energy serves to both counter eddy losses as well as to
        oppose primary current flow, while contributing to circulating
        current within the resonant circuit. </p>
      <p>The net effect of this, is that when the MRA is detuned,
        harmonics of the audible frequency "beat" with primary current,
        opposing its flow, while the increase in circulating current
        couples more power to the secondary, and therefore to the load.
        This is how the power gain is attained, basically by considering
        the naturally occuring harmonics as beneficial instead of as
        undesirable effects to be filtered out. </p>
      <p>When the MRA is detuned, the effective impedance increases as
        seen by the source, while the power available to the load
        decreases in less <br>
        proportion. This is measurable by using resistive equivalent
        circuit testing. However, the detuning is load dependent, and
        slight adjustments are required if the load requirement is
        greater than the power band of a harmonic interaction. After
        retuning, the power will increase in quantum intervals as the
        circulating current is reinforced by the reaction of the
        permeable magnet core. This will be seen as slight incremental
        voltage increases across the load device. </p>
      <p>Once the magnet is "ringing", it's frequency and therefore
        harmonics remain stable, as long as the series resonant range is
        not exceeded. Therefore, the detuning affects the piezo only,
        and the circulating current increase is a result of the phase
        relationship between the harmonic and the source. Voltage
        amplification is seen across the primary, measurable higher than
        the source voltage, and this is "seen" by the secondary. This is
        not the same thing as a power gain, because the power gain is a
        direct result of effective impedance. </p>
      <p>It should also be noted that the term "virtual rotation" has
        been applied in describing the operation of the MRA. The
        comparison is made with a generator, in which relative motion
        occurs between a coil and magnet. Rather than use physical
        energy to rotate a mass, the MRA uses resonance to rotate the
        energy. This is seen in the polar rotation of the piezo
        dielectric as well as in the molecular energy occuring in the
        reactive component of the magnet, ie, the ringing. The lattice
        structures of the piezo and magnet are compatible for virtual
        rotation, and the materials complement each other <br>
        electrically. </p>
      <p>In the past, researchers have noted many effects which occur at
        aggregate resonance, which typically includes a range of three
        octaves. Anomalous energy gains were referred to as "aetheric".
        The aether was believed to exist outside of the three physical
        dimensions, and could be "tapped" for free energy at resonance.
        Aetheric energy is said to be limitless, but to vary locally
        with increases in earth magnetic fields at sunset and sunrise,
        like the tides of an infinite ocean. This effect is not
        thoroughly understood, but has been observed in the MRA, as
        increases in output in the early morning, <br>
        and decreases in the early evening. This is still being studied.
      </p>
      <p>Experimentation will determine the optimum MRA design for a
        specific range of applications. </p>

      <p>Bill:&nbsp; Yes those transducers will work but they are
        physically smaller than the ones we are useing. I figure when
        this circuit is verified that the next step will be to go to a
        natural quartz milled wafer of the natural freq we desire to
        same as the crystals used in transmitters except a lot larger.
        If you have access to a Thomas Directory at work, please look up
        Branson who makes the ultrasonic welders so we can get a source
        manufacturer from them. Maybe someone on the Internet will know
        the manufacturers of these transducers. This circuit is a
        mindbender when you study it's characteristics. For example I
        started off this morning (after I let the circuit run all night
        to condition the magnet and piezo crystal) with a total
        over-unity power gain of 1.65:1 ratio.&nbsp; After playing with
        the circuit all day taking measurements after each adjustment or
        change of operating parameters, arrived at a 150:1 I/O ratio.
        Here are the figures: Input 15.34 VAC @ 54.9 KHZ with .57 Ma
        which is .000874 Watts which has to be adjusted for power factor
        by <br>
        multiplying by .707. The output is: 16.75 VDC @ 78.8 Ma into a
        pure resistive load. This figures out to be greater than a 150:1
        I/O ratio.&nbsp; I guess you have figured out how excited
        everyone is over this "Gadget". Now unless OHMS law has been
        nulified or there is some "spook" phenomenon that Joel and I
        cannot find then we have the 1 watt challenge in the bag by a
        wide margin. More as we learn more.&nbsp; ~ Norm </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA (Tech Bulletin) </p>
      <p>I know that there are quit a few folks out there running around
        digging up parts to build a MRA device to do independent
        testing. Let me share <br>
        with you some findings that will assist all in this approach.
        First disregard the measurements that I gave Bill Beaty
        yesterday in a message about power gain. I like Joel find myself
        back at "square one". It happens like this, when you have this
        circuit up on the "ragged edge" where the first harmonic seems
        to be phase "beating" or attenuating the input current and
        providing potential only to drive the first stage resonance in
        the transducer, you disconnect the load to do the only accurate
        total power consumption test which is "equivalent resistance"
        measurements so we can nail down the elusive power figure
        according to OHMS LAW. Well, when you unload the circuit under
        the optimum operating conditions the transducers will
        immediately trip into a very powerful mechanical oscillations
        around 2KHZ and self distruct in short order and at the same
        time put out a violent voltage that can soar above 1000 VAC
        which inturn will literally wipe out your driving amplifier and
        your frequency counter. Fortunately the scope is better
        protected on the front end. So what I am saying is that you
        begin all over conditioning a new set of driver transducers
        which even fresh out of the box will display over-unity output
        in the circuit. The people over at the manufacturing firm that
        makes these transducers are "smiling" and calling their stock
        broker to exercise some stock options in their product for I see
        a lot of you destroying a bunch of transducers in the process of
        testing and improving the circuit. Let me share with you some
        ideas. When I go back and read TOM BEARDENS works about
        potentializing a circuit without the attendant circuit that is
        normally involved we will have achieved the over-unity that we
        are seeking. After careful study of the MRA I can see how this
        device can be separated into two separate devices. First the
        piezo is a source of high freq. potential which at 3 octaves
        above drive the ferro-resonant primary coil at the natural
        resonant freq of the magnetic material. Now I believe I have
        figured out the secret behind the Swiss M-L <br>
        Converter known as the TESTAVISTATIKA or TESTATIKA for short.
        This device was developed in the group called METHERNITHA by
        Paul Baumann and it has been seen by our friend Stephan Marinov.
        This ZPE tapping can be accomplished through potential being
        derived from any source such as the electrostatic charge
        developed in the whinshurst type generator.&nbsp; The secret is
        in the MAGNETIC RESONANCE AMPLIFIER. Ken Shoulders and R.A. Ford
        demonstrated that what we term as harmless energy (electrostatic
        charge) when stored in a large capacitor is real charge
        separation and can do some interesting things such as exploding
        water, wire and other interesting research projects. If we take
        advantage of <br>
        the mechanical oscillations of the transducer and operate it at
        a level of mechanical resonance (in free oscillation) that will
        optimize the voltage output (lets say 400 volts) which inturn we
        use to drive the ferro-resonant barium ferrite core coil then we
        can extract some serious power from the coil providing that we
        have done our homework and provided the optimum impedance
        matching and tuning of the circuit to maximize the final
        product. We are a long ways from our final goal of having a unit
        that we can flip a switch and the thing will run "stand alone".
        Joel and I have taken the first step by sharing with you our
        findings so let's work this thing out together as a "joint
        project". We will share all findings in these Tech Bulletins so
        everyone is on the same sheet of music. Now for some "spook"
        type anomalies that&nbsp; occur around this circuit when it is
        running in the ZPE tapping mode which is where we purposely
        de-tune the circuit upward in freq so that we get the "beating"
        effect from the first harmonic. When you see this on the scope
        it will appear as the sine wave patern of the input being broken
        into little line segments by an invisible or transparent
        oscillation at a much higher freq than the primary driving
        signal which in the case of my circuit is around 56.8 KHZ. Even
        when I have CH 2 turned on with no signal (base line only) it
        also is broken into short line segments as if the electron beam
        is driven into cut off by this invisible signal. Any RF
        engineers out there seen this? Please explain same. I believe
        that all the phenomenon that is being observed by people such as
        Sweet, Aspden, Adams, Lambertson, Searl and Tom Bearden are all
        connected by a common thread. Let's "unravel it" ~ Norm </p>

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: NORMAN WOOTAN <br>
        Subject: MRA and the Nieper Effect </p>
      <p>Hi Norm:&nbsp; As we suspected, there is a "Nieper effect" with
        the piezos when they are at mass aggregate resonance in the MRA
        circuit.&nbsp; I've measured it many times this morning, and it
        is very consistent.&nbsp; Here's the test: </p>
      <p>First, warm up the MRA for about an hour. I'm using the sig gen
        as shown in the schematic that I left in a message for you
        yesterday, <br>
        with all of the same voltages and currents. Then take the piezo
        out of the circuit and set it aside for a few minutes. </p>
      <p>Put the piezo on the scale and zero the scale with the "dot"
        side of the piezo up. Attach leads to the piezo so it is back in
        the circuit and let it run for a few minutes. Remove the leads
        and the piezo now weighs 200mg less, but it regains the weight
        within three minutes. </p>
      <p>Do all of the above, but with the "dot" side down, and the
        piezo will gain 200 mg, and lose it in three minutes. </p>
      <p>Because this test is at low power, I suspect that the effect
        may vary in degree with the application of greater or less
        power. </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA </p>
      <p>Well tonight Joel and I did some testing which we hoped would
        clearly define just what we were dealing with in the MRA
        circuit. Joel, in an <br>
        earlier message described it as "having a tiger by the tail",
        you ain't seen nuthing like this tiger. The only way I would
        attempt to describe this circuit is a "mini black hole" on your
        work bench. Electrical engineers and PHD's in electronic theory
        will go "ballistic" on this one I promise. After running the MRA
        at low power levels for several hours we turned off every thing
        on the work bench "everything". After attaching one lead of a
        Fluke 87 true RMS meter to the input of the MRA and holding the
        other lead in my hand we were getting a reading of 27 VAC at 60
        HZ and the readings got stronger the further away from the
        energy field which had developed around the device. This circuit
        when set into resonance even without any "excitation" of any
        kind will pull in "ambient" energy in this case the 60HZ flux
        field present in the room. Would this be clasified as a "virtual
        energy collector". </p>
      <p>Maybe Tesla was right about the possibility of a "cosmic ray or
        energy collector". Another interesting thing that we verified
        tonight was that the natural ferro-magnetic frequency is
        approximately 174.9 KHZ. While the MRA is operating with an
        input freq on Joels device (each magnet has it's own operating
        or resonant freq) of 32.4 KHZ the wave form can be seen as a
        segmented line which under careful study shows by the broken
        line segment count to be caused by a "phantom" oscillation from
        the ferro-magnetic material that blanks the electron gun at a
        freq of 174.9 KHZ.&nbsp; We are using a good Techtronic 80 MHZ
        scope so this we find real interesting for this opens the door
        to tapping energy directly from the "earths magnetic field".
        Everyone says that weight loss is associated with any device
        that displays any over-unity tendacies. Well, that too has been
        verified. Joel will address this phenomenon in a later message
        but I am here to tell you it is more exciting as time goes on
        here. If I were to tell an electronics engineer that we have
        seen "negative numbers" on current draw when this circuit is
        running would this mean gain would be "infintiy"? Joel is going
        to have to explain this one for we decided to use a 12 VDC
        powered amplifier so we would have a pure DC input so we could
        pin down the input current draw. Well if you take the idleing
        current draw (amp unloaded) then tune the MRA for maximum gain
        and the current draw goes to a negative number then what? This
        will take some explaining. More as we learn more. ~&nbsp; Norm <br>
        PS: This circuit is absolutely over-unity. </p>

      <p>12/21/94 <br>
        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA Anomalies </p>
      <p>Eight days ago, the MRA was invented. Almost immediately, it
        began to exhibit over-unity characteristics. However, there have
        also been a lot of "quirky" effects... each taken separately
        might have been test equipment error or technician error.
        However, these effects are forming familiar patterns
        now...familiar but not always predictable. The toll in dead and
        damaged test equipment so far is one panel mount DVM, one
        frequency counter, two audio amplifiers, and numerous 60 watt
        light bulbs. </p>
      <p>Sometimes, when supplying the MRA from a 12 VDC powered audio
        amp, the battery current will decrease compared to the battery
        current to the amp with no load at all, and at the same time,
        amp output voltage will increase... Taken together, this
        indicates that the MRA is feeding energy back into the amp.
        Later, with no changes to the circuit, the MRA will behave like
        a normal load, and cause a small increase in battery current
        with a small decrease in amp output voltage. </p>
      <p>The voltage and current waveforms look like dotted lines, where
        each dot and space segment is equal to 175 KHz, which Norm and I
        believe is the free running resonant frequency of ferrmagnetism.
        We have never seen this before, and for that matter, neither has
        anyone else that we've talked to about it. Even with nothing on
        Channel B of the 'scope, the display will exhibit the dotted
        line effect whenever the MRA is running and connected to Channel
        A. </p>
      <p>Anything and everything in the field of the MRA is affected.
        Should the MRA's output load become accidently disconnected
        while the MRA is at resonance, an instantaneous and very
        powerful destructive surge will occur. </p>
      <p>I THINK that the MRA, by resonating a magnet at mass aggregate
        frequency, is magnetically "linking" with everything in its
        field, and behaving like an "energy pump". We see this when we
        walk up to it and the output from the MRA goes up, even though
        the MRA is hooked up to a resistive load which is causing it to
        provide current. This also changes based upon the time of day
        relative to sunrise and set. </p>
      <p>To test anything, you first must isolate it... by virtue of the
        design of the MRA, it cannot be isolated. It intrinsically links
        itself to everything with a coil or magnetic field, even to a
        quartz wristwatch if it is in the same room. As such, we get
        varying power gains, and the variations seem more to be a
        question of which test equipment is on the table at the time of
        the test. </p>
      <p>Please bear in mind that this is a brand new circuit... As far
        as that goes, it's a whole new technology. Once the magnet has
        been resonated, and then disconnected from the rest of the
        circuit, it will continue to provide up to 25 VAC at 60 Hz using
        a human "antenna" to capture ambient energy in the room. Last
        night, Norm and I were measuring over-unity gains of 2X-3X, but
        we don't really know for sure if we were "pumping" the energy
        electromagnetically out of the test equipment, house wiring,
        earth's magnetic field, the ether, or some combination of the
        above. </p>
      <p>We need some independent testing by individuals with awareness
        of the anomalies mentioned in this message. There is obviously a
        lot of power "in flux" which collapses into the MRA if the load
        is removed, so there will probably be more equipment lost. There
        is also a whole area of gravitic anomalies to investigate,
        because the piezo will weigh measurably less when it is in the
        MRA circuit, and regain the weight when it is disconnected. </p>
      <p>The original MRA is being sent out for engineering review, from
        which we hope to learn more, but the more voices that are heard
        from, the better our chances of finding out what is really
        happening.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

        Subject: MRA (Power Test) </p>
      <p>Joel: I have been putting a lot of thought into the high power
        test of&nbsp; the MRA device. Since you have determined that the
        circuit is creating what we call Mhos and usually this
        phenomenon is associated with vaccuum tubes in operation and
        going back to the work of T. Henry Moray with his "valve" then I
        am setting up this 250 watt tube power amp for the ultimate
        test. Since transistors seem to not be able to take the bucking
        effect of the "first harmonic" checking the input current into
        the circuit we should use the vaccuum tube for this final stage
        of signal injection into the MRA series resonant primary. The
        "finals" tubes then are basically in the series circuit and will
        survive the punishment brought on by the "hammering" effect of
        the first harmonic. These large output tubes will display more
        of your "Mhos" effect than simple transistors. I still believe
        (I keep dreaming about it) that the vacuum tube should play a
        part in the circuit as a "coheror" of the ZPE into the circuit.
        Certainly worth trying for we are at the point where we need to
        push the piezo's at their design power ratings of 50 watts at
        150 Volts. There will be some serious voltages developed in the
        series resonant primary for we have already seen nearly 1000
        Volts circulating with only 20 volts of primary input. A vacuum
        tube is the only animal that could survive the punishment in a
        high voltage circuit like this. Bob Paddock's indestructible
        transistors won't cut it in this harsh environment. <br>

        "negative energy" being <br>
        expended out there trying to discredit something that we offered

        any re-imbursement of any kind for anything connected with the
        MRA device for the very reason sited in the message traffic. No,
        I will not sell off my small stock of transducers. I will give
        magnets and transducers only to serious researchers for the

        minded that they will not analyze the circuit for what it does,
        so be it.&nbsp; They are beyond help. To those who question why
        we have not "self powered" the device, we are working on the

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: BOB PADDOCK <br>
        Subject: Mo' on Mhos </p>
      <p>Hi Bob: When the MRA was designed, the intent was to create and
        above unity device based upon earth itself...its magnetic fields
        and frequencies. We've since seen that it is directionally
        sensitive to earth magnetic fields, and that it "responds" to
        sunrise and sunset.&nbsp; For all practical purposes, the MRA at
        resonance is like a funnel with a vacuum device attached to the
        narrow end, collecting energy which becomes more condensed as it
        travels into the funnel, where it is trapped in the windings of
        the transformer by the collapsing magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>This then represents an excess potential, which we see when the
        signal input voltage is higher under load of the MRA than it is
        under noload <br>
        conditions. We also see this when we can reduce the entire AC
        power to the signal source below no-load, while at the same time
        producing <br>
        usable power from the MRA. </p>
      <p>According to scalar theory, the excess potential is a quantum
        voltage potential which reacts according to known non-linear
        optical (NLO) <br>
        laws of physics. Because the Coulomb gauge transverse potential
        (CTP) exists in all of space time (also standard physics), small
        amounts of <br>
        excess potential occur naturally in all semiconductors. This
        interferes with applied EM potential, and causes "noise", which
        is normally filtered out. Thus, semiconductors are natural
        scalar interferometers which translate low level amounts of
        excess potential. </p>
      <p>When two or more semiconductors are connected, directly or
        indirectly in a conductive path, a hyperspatial link is formed
        and the translated <br>
        excess potential will bounce back and forth between them within
        this link, which can produce laser beams. Or, the energy may
        reach the level sufficient to destroy one or more devices, or to
        destroy the semiconductors in the test equipment attached to the
        circuit. This is fully documented in the Lawandy experiment at
        Brown University and described in the March 31, 1994 issue of
        Nature Magazine. A "ping pong" effect occurs with semiconductors
        which have "self-targeted" each other, creating spurious bursts
        of normal EM energy. Credit for all of the above information to
        Tom Bearden, who kindly provided it after years of study and
        research. </p>
      <p>Now we have two "theories" to describe one effect (likely there
        will be many more) so we have to find one that works, in terms
        of being consistent and reproducible. It is, I believe, both.
        The "earth" theory is the "outer" or normal EM description,
        since we are dealing with EM to drive a motor load. The Bearden
        theory is the "inner" description, and provides mathematical
        exactness to the process. We used the "outer" theory to find the
        lattice structures, resonant octave ranges and LC relationship
        of the MRA. That still leaves us with the unseen mechanism by
        which excess potential is realized in the circuit. That is where
        Bearden's "inner channel" theory fills the void in understanding
        with clarity and precision. </p>
      <p>It is really neither Mhos nor negative resistance as I
        understand it, but the translation of low level CTP energies
        into usable EM. The aspect of the MRA which is unique is that it
        traps this potential and puts it to work driving a load instead
        of building up and creating a NLO laser effect. I believe that
        the energies, as soon as they are translated into EM, are
        "caught" by the magnet and pulled into the resonant circuit,
        where they are measured as excess potential. I hope that this
        message ends up on the I-Net, as it will provide the references
        within conventional, accepted physics that can be studied in
        order to visualize the functioning of the MRA.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

      <p>01/06/95 <br>
        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: JOHN PETERS <br>
        Subject: mmmmm.... could be! </p>
      <p>Went back and read the WBSMEMO.ASC file again... memory ain't
        what it used to be, and never was. I hadn't thought of the MRA
        within the <br>
        context of that file, but you are right on the mark with your
        comparison. The biggest hurdle to understanding the MRA is in
        seeing it as an new device via existing technology. It is a
        different technology, actually a very, very old technology using
        new components. However, because the technology isn't in the
        "books" yet, it is viewed (at best) as a "new" technology. </p>
      <p>The existing "rules" don't apply... but the old, really old
        rules do. For example, when Heaviside bastardized Maxwell's
        Theories (you will NOT find the Heaviside interpretation in ANY
        of Maxwell's published works), Heaviside stripped out all of the
        references to the ether, which he said was "mystical and should
        be murdered from the theory", and so he murdered the ether...
        except that it just wouldn't die! </p>
      <p>Maxwell opened the door to P-channel quantum potentials, and
        Heaviside slammed it shut. Heaviside wanted to provide simple
        "laws" so that the electricians of that day could vector power
        and measure current in workable systems. Heaviside never went to
        college, did not know calculus, and was lost in the true
        implications of Maxwell's theory.&nbsp; It's time we moved up to
        the reality of ALL of Maxwell's theory, not just the
        kindergarten version. </p>
      <p>Anyway, I got side tracked... back to your question. Without
        having seen the WBS device, it's hard to say for sure, but the
        effects seem similar. The INTENT of the MRA was to design a
        device compatible with naturally occuring energies, specifically
        ferroresonance as it applies to earth's electromagnetic fields.
        However, in DOING this, especially with optically sensitive
        materials, we enabled the MRA to re-open Maxwell's door. What we
        caused was a link to form which translated&nbsp; etheric energy
        into ordinary EM in a closed loop resonant circuit. This link is
        referred to as the "P-channel", because it manifests as excess
        potential. </p>
      <p>This effect has been experienced in semiconductor circuits for
        many years, and is normally destructive to the devices, so
        resistive and filtering components are added to effectively
        "close" the channel. This isn't necessarily bad, because until
        circuits can be designed to USE the excess potentials, we don't
        want them going into resonance and burning out. As seen by the
        Neiper/Seike Ring (the schematic that is on KeelyNet is wrong,
        btw), you also experience gravitic effects when you allow
        tetrahedral lattices to self-resonate. </p>
      <p>Considering that the MRA at resonance is virtually stopping the
        spin of particles (like a strobe synchronized to a timing mark),
        it is very likely that a more efficient MRA could cancel the
        quadrupole effect of gravity.&nbsp; There are other ways of
        doing this, such as the Biefield-Brown method of high potential
        or the Searl method of folding energy onto itself in resonant
        plasma layers, and possibly the technology of anti-g (for a
        practical space ship) would utilize some or all of the above.
        However, we'll never get "there" from "here" by using the
        Heaviside "laws".&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

        Lots of info from this guy...they are doing something similar to

        same piezo material, but have only got 140% gain so far.&nbsp;

        They are going to buy some at Tanner's and try to match our
        gain. </p>
      <p>He thoroughly understands the MRA, and offered his
        congratulations to us for developing and sharing it.&nbsp; He
        also mentioned that the <br>
        virtual rotation is the real definition.&nbsp; He asked about
        some guy in Mississippi who is using neo-d, and who is
        "rotating", but agreed <br>
        with me that the neo-d lacks the ferrite core to turn the excess
        potential into load current, so this guy will barely exceed
        unity. </p>

        From : JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To : BILL BEATY <br>
        Subject: PHI and the MRA </p>
      <p>Hi Bill: The last message wasn't as clear as I would have liked
        with regard to PHI.&nbsp; I once worked out the harmonic and
        octave relationships as PHI (and PI, since PI = PHI squared,
        times 6/5...thus PHI squared = PI...also, 1 + 1/PHI = PHI, which
        is also known as the Fibonacci Series). </p>
      <p>The file PHI&amp;RES.ASC has some of this information, and
        because the "notes" harmonize perfectly and the octaves double
        exactly, this conforms to "standard" musical scales as are used
        today. Using the Fibonacci series as a starting place for note
        frequencies is not an arbitrary decision. </p>
      <p>Today, we see PHI as a methematical constant, ie, 1.618, for
        use in plane geometry. To the ancient Egyptians, it was math but
        had a much deeper implication... It was the symbol of rebirth
        throughout eternity just as the Fibonacci series "perfects" at
        higher number intervals. Also, because the use of PHI in art is
        very "harmonious" to view, PHI coordinates (nested tets) were
        used by Michelangelo in the dome of the Sistine Chapel, as well
        as by Veronese, Raphael, da Vinci, and was even used by the
        architect Le Corbusier in the design of the United Nations
        building. </p>
      <p>In retrospect, I think that this must be a perfect validation
        of the resonance based chart of the elements as created by
        Walter Russell, although he certainly doesn't need any
        validation from me.&nbsp; The fact is, music is math and
        geometry, and geometry is the yardstick for three dimensional
        existance.&nbsp; It's all one nested relationship, and the
        singular constant is PHI.&nbsp; If you want to create resonance
        and balanced harmonics in octave groups, you must use PHI.
        Because we tend to separate "music" from "science", we don't
        HEAR nature, and we trust our intellect to create unnatural
        yardsticks.&nbsp; Fact is, when computers were invented, and IBM
        needed programmers, they hired musicians to train for the
        positions. </p>
      <p>In an electronic circuit, semiconductors are made of silicon or
        germanium, both of which are tet lattice structures, and both of
        which will occasionally break into free oscillation, rich in
        PHI-based harmonics...that is how the Nieper ring works, because
        once the material has three octaves of resonance, the particle
        spin is virtually stopped...like a timing mark under a strobe...
        And the effect of gravity is suspended. </p>
      <p>Three octaves are necessary in 3-space because the each of the
        octaves "fills" one dimension. The octaves interact with each
        other to make <br>
        harmonics at 90 degrees of phase separation, effectively
        "filling" a 3-space object. This is mass aggregate resonance,
        and it allows you to couple biwave vectorless energy into a
        circuit. It also allows you to overcome temporal effects as well
        as gravitic effects. That is why I said that when you nest two
        tets, you have the keys to everything. </p>
      <p>The MRA uses materials which are cube latticed, and a cube IS a
        nested tet sitting on its "flat side". So, when you trap the
        harmonics on one side of a phase reversed series resonant
        circuit, you develop a potential which is higher than the
        no-load voltage of the device which is supplying the circuit.
        That's half of ZPE. The other half is having ferrite in the
        resonating core to provide electrons to match with the excess
        potential to create power to a load. And that's the MRA. </p>
      <p>Part of the resentment to this information is simply due to the
        fact that all of this was known to and possibly discovered by
        very ancient peoples... and we are lagging behind them today in
        our comprehension of science as nature, by the division of music
        and science, etc. Well, all I really wanted to do was to provide
        correlations to help tie in the octave relationships with the
        lattice geometry, and I hope that this information helps. You
        can see how well it is received by most people, but you can also
        measure the excess potential on your own MRA so you'll have to
        decide for yourself. Enjoy. </p>

      <p>Hi Norm: I got a fax from Hal, and he states that the MRA is
        only 50% of unity. He put resistance in series with the primary,
        over 11 ohms, and measured the voltage drop across it to
        determine input current. In effect, he used the only method
        which would drive the MRA below unity. I had already told him
        about this before he did it, so I don't know why he did it. I
        called Tom to get his slant on it, and he suggested that I
        immediately write back to Hal and point this out, and to keep a
        dialog going with Hal. I sent Hal a fax, which is below this

      <p>First of all, thank you both for the time and effort which you
        gave to the test of this device. It is very gratifying to us
        that your measurements did not differ with those which we had
        reported. </p>
      <p>I think, however, that we need to continue dialogue with regard
        to the method of determining input power to the MRA,
        specifically with regard to the measurement of primary current.
        In our testing, we had found that adding resistance in series
        with the primary had the effect of increasing primary source
        current. I had mentioned this to you in one of our telephone
        conversations, and was hoping that you might shed some light
        onto this apparent violation of classical theory. </p>
      <p>We had found that primary current, as measured inline with a
        meter, is greater with a resistor in series with the primary
        than it is with only the meter inline. Using Thevenin's Theorem
        as a basis for using the equivalent resistive circuit, we
        believe that the primary current from the source is much lower
        than your tests indicate. </p>
      <p>Adding resistance in series with the primary does, as you
        indicate, cause the MRA to behave as an ordinary series resonant
        circuit. You have verified that which we stipulated. We also
        noted that we don't know how to determine power when source
        potential exceeds noload. We attempted, but were unable to
        determine this. </p>
      <p>The use of a series resistor is not debatable in a classical
        EM&nbsp; circuit. However, classical EM theory excludes the
        possibility of outputs above unity, and adding resistance has
        already been shown to eliminate the over unity effect of the
        MRA. We hope that you will consider further tests which do not
        add resistance to the primary. </p>
      <p>Again Hal and Scott, our sincere thanks to you both. Best
        regards&nbsp; ~ Joel McClain </p>

        Subject: MRA Evaluation by IAS </p>
      <p>Late yesterday, I received a fax from Hal Puthoff and Scott
        Little at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin. Hal
        confirmed the measurements which we had documented for both load
        and no-load operation of the MRA. However, different conclusions
        were reached with regard to interpretation of the measurements
        which do not support over-unity gain. </p>
      <p>While we are still in dialogue with Hal and Scott with regard
        to the interpretation of the measurements, I felt it best to
        share this information with all interested KeelyNetters, along
        with a sincere "thank you" to Hal and Scott for their kind and
        generous assistance in the test of the MRA. </p>
      <p>As is often the case, especially with ZPE devices, correct data
        can lead to incorrect conclusions... this may be the case with
        the MRA as well, in terms of Norm's and my testing. Looking
        back, I'm very glad that we shared our data with everyone, as
        this may help others as a "case in point". Alternately, however,
        we have requested that Hal and Scott try testing the MRA without
        adding series resistors in the primary circuit. We think that
        the addition of resistors might have the effect of blocking
        subharmonics, which would cause an increase in primary source
        current. When components are added, it is no longer the same
        circuit, ie, it is no longer the MRA, in our opinion. </p>
      <p>We will be continuing our work with the MRA, as the most
        difficult measurement for us to verify is that of primary
        current. We hope to perform the ZPE "litmus test" with an
        oscillator to test the ability of the MRA to self-sustain. As
        with all tests, we will share the test results. </p>
      <p>My personal thanks to all of you as well, especially Jerry and
        Bill,&nbsp; for helping to share this and all previous
        information. ~ Joel </p>

        Subject: MRA Testing </p>
      <p>Jerry: Read carefully what transpired in the Hal Puthoff test
        of the&nbsp; MRA. I now see what you tried to tell us about Hal
        Puthoff. OK! Go ahead and say it "I told you so in the very
        beginning".&nbsp; We live and learn.&nbsp; The very thing that
        we pointed out to Hal that would drive the MRA below unity
        during testing is to apply a resistor in series with the
        primary, what did he do, placed a resistor in series and made
        the MRA into an ordinary series resonant transformer which is
        below unity and then based his report of findings on this very
        point which we had already told him was not a valid test for it
        modified the MRA so that it could not possibly be an over-unity
        device. He just doesn't get it. We are proceeding full speed and
        I have a special MRA running at 7.5 Watts output. I am faced
        with the same problem that you have in that I still need that
        oscillator and front end driver to make it <br>
        "stand-alone". In time, In time. ~ Norm </p>

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: NORMAN WOOTAN <br>
        Subject: More testing, Igor!! </p>
      <p>Hi Norm: I had a most illuminating conversation with Hal today.
        I've asked him to keep the MRA for as long as he feels that it
        has anything to offer him as a device for testing. At this
        point, he may be about done with it, as it appears not to be
        above unity. The key to this is not in the reduction of current,
        which occurs as we have seen, but in the cosine of the phase
        angle, which changes as the circuit is detuned. Thus it is
        possible to have a vastly reduced current in combination with a
        measurable increase in terminal voltage and still have a
        relative increase in input power. Reactance, which alters the
        phase angle, becomes more prominent as the MRA is detuned. Now,
        I THINK that this is minimal as long as we are within the
        bandwidth of <br>
        the Universal Resonance Chart, but I could be wrong. </p>
      <p>If this is what is happening, and Hal's test provides data
        which indicates that this is the case, then the phase angle
        changes should be directly measurable. I'm not completely
        convinced, and won't be until we have quantified this. The other
        indications which we have seen, such as the reduction in output
        current from the driver xistor of the amp, and the net reduction
        in AC current to the amp, and the tests with the grain-of-wheat
        lamps, and other tests, lead me to believe that there is
        something more going on here. </p>
      <p>I mentioned that we are going ahead with the plan to build an
        oscillator to test the MRA in self-sustaining mode, and that the
        oscillator must be inductively coupled to the MRA. I've asked
        Hal to test the MRA using inductive coupling via an isolation
        xfmr and to omit the series resistor. This would eliminate the
        local value of impedance, ie the resistor, which is replacing
        the distributed resistances in the tuned circuit. The inductive
        coupling will provide the same E&amp;I lead-lag relationships
        which we have in our own tests. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;I hope that everyone is aware that I have the utmost
        respect for and confidence in Hal and his staff. Sometimes typed
        messages are subject <br>
        to wrong interpretation, and I really DO NOT want that to be the
        case here. I genuinely respect them and the efforts which they
        have given <br>
        in the test of the MRA. I understand the conclusions which they
        have reached, and am gratified that they have verified the
        accuracy of our measurements. Hopefully, this will put to rest
        all of the doubts concerning the accuracy of our measurements,
        frequency range of test equipment, etc. We differ only in the
        interpretation of those measurements as related to input power.
        I would hope that any inventor of a device of this type would
        have the advantage of a review by Hal Puthoff. Regardless of the
        outcome of the review, it is an honor. </p>
      <p>As I told Hal, to paraphrase Yogi Berra, "we agree
        differently"... and that is all. The burden of proof is, as it
        should be, on the inventors. So we'll prove it; it works or it
        doesn't... and we'll quantify it either way, and share the
        results.&nbsp; C'ya. ~ Joel </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: NORMAN COMPARINI <br>
        Subject: MRATEST1 Response </p>
      <p>Norm:&nbsp; In regard to your question as to our response to
        the MRATEST1&nbsp; Report I will go on record with the following
        comments. First there is <br>
        a strange "paradox" here that thus far has eluded even the best
        instrumentation in attempts to explain this circuit. Let’s say
        before going any futher that I as does Joel personally
        appreciate trhe efforts of Hal and Scott in their analysis of
        the MRA device and look forward to working with them in the
        future in futher testing when we can nail down what is really
        going on in the circuit. This project is not going to just die
        out. I personally have 3 ea. "Super MRA devices" on my bench
        which do some rather interesting things which defy all
        explanation by conventional "EM" theory. I will stand by my
        statement that there is a phenomenon here that has eluded all
        attempts to explain the circuit even with the most sophisticated
        "digital equipment". Case in point: MRA that I call "big coil
        1"; Input is 80.2 VAC @ 798 Hz across a "grain of wheat" bulb
        (glows very dim) with an output of 52.7 VDC into a load of 2 ea.
        (parallel) 48V panel lamps drawing 3.42 Watts at a current of
        61.5MA. Will some "electronics engineer" out there tell me how a
        tiny grain of wheat bulb with 80.2VAC applied across it in
        series with the MRA circuit pass enough current to drive the
        observed load of 3.42 Watts??? Any and all explantions will be
        accepted and considered. Wouldn't you agree that something real
        strange is going on here? To show you that this "DOG" is not
        going to lay down and die is evidenced by my latest MRA that I
        constructed last night which does the following: Input, 53.5VAC
        @ 33,600HZ with an output of 120.2VDC into a resistive load of a
        standard light bulb rated 120V 13.5 Watts burning very brightly.
        Input current? Well let's put it this way, I placed a small
        miniature Radio Shack lamp rated at 6V @ .025A in series with
        the MRA input and the tiny little lamp was burning very bright
        while sustaining the output load. Keep in mind that we are
        dissipating power in the form of heat and light in the series
        resistive load in the input side of the circuit therefore the
        question arrises as to what is the effective voltage and current
        across the piezo and primary coil of the MRA circuit. Does
        conventional "bridge" or series resistance calculations apply?
        If so then will you figure it out and get back to me as to your
        explanation. I told you it wouldn't be easy. ~ Norm </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>01/26/95 <br>
        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: NORMAN WOOTAN <br>
        Subject: Cosines </p>
      <p>Hi Norm: It's been a while since I vectored a circuit, but the
        thought kept bothering me that the maximum value for the cosine
        of theta is 1.0, which is based upon a zero degree phase
        difference in voltage and current... or pure DC. The least value
        for the cosine of theta is zero, which represents 90 degrees of
        phase separation. The value most ommonly used is 0.707, which is
        the cosine (and the sine) of 45 degrees, or AC across a
        resistive circuit. </p>
      <p>Now, a series resonant circuit is different, because it has a
        180 degree phase difference between the inductor and the
        capacitor at resonance. However, that difference exists BETWEEN
        the inductor and the capacitor, and the source sees a resistor
        because the Xl and Xc cancel each other, just like a Tesla coil.
        A resistor across a source of AC represents a 45 degree
        difference, or a power factor of 0.707 times the product of the
        voltage and current. </p>
      <p>When you tune a series resonant circuit slightly off resonance,
        the source will once again begin to see reactances, and the
        phase angle&nbsp; will shift. While we don't know exactly where
        it is, we know that it has to be somewhere between zero and
        ninety degrees, so that the power input is equal to voltage
        times current, times some value between one and zero. Even if it
        is one, the MRA is well over unity while in the "max gain" mode.
      </p>
      <p>Reactances limit current but do not dissipate power, with the
        exception of leakages and distributed resistances. However, a
        pure resistor will certainly dissipate power, while adding
        nothing to the circuit.&nbsp; See what I mean? </p>
      <p>Now, in reviewing the data which we received, the input power
        at the max power mode is given at 3.168 watts, based upon V
        squared/R equiv, but no power factor is applied. Since the
        series resonant circuit, at peak resonance, is a resistor to the
        source, the power factor should be 0.707, and the input power
        should therefore be 2.24 watts, slightly below the 2.473 watts
        of DC output power. </p>
      <p>In other words, the primary current of 150.42 ma is equal to
        the V-in MRA of 21.06 divided by the effective resistance of 140
        ohms. When you multiply them together, you get 3.168 watts, but
        unless it is DC power, which it isn't, you have to multiply it
        by a value less than one, and in a resistive circuit, that is
        0.707, so the power input for comparison with the DC power
        output is less by 233 mw. </p>
      <p>The comparison, however, is made using the avg V-in*I-in, which
        is 4.566, which says that the sine waves, which are not pure
        sine waves, have a greater amount of power than if they were DC!
        Hello? </p>
      <p>We don't have the equipment to measure average values of
        waveforms, but when a circuit goes from resistive to reactive,
        current and therefore power go down, ESPECIALLY in a series
        resonant circuit. And, pure sine waves have more inherent power
        than distorted waves. Measuring distorted waveforms as average
        is how that other guy, I can't remember his name, THOUGHT he was
        over unity, but was wrong. You know, the "firefly" circuit. </p>
      <p>Now, looking at the power comparison in the max gain mode, you
        have 23.84 VAC divided by 1900 ohms of equivalent resistance, or
        12.5473 <br>
        ma. This correlates to the V-squared/R-equiv value of 0.299 as
        23.84 times .00125473 exactly as shown. Since we don't know the
        phase angle in max gain, we'll just leave it at 0.299 watts for
        now, and eat the power factor. Regardless, we have 1.604 DC
        watts on the output. </p>
      <p>Now, the avg V-in*I-in is given at 3.265, which means that the
        average current has gone from 217 ma to 137 ma, or over ten
        times the current <br>
        which we estimate based upon equiv resistance. By comparison,
        the current as determined by the avg V-in*I-in in the max power
        mode is 217 ma, or about 67 ma above the value based upon 140
        ohms of equiv resistance... so the current is decreasing (from
        217 to 137 ma) as per the test data, but is still too high for
        the MRA to achieve unity. ... OK... Now let's look at our test
        results by comparison. </p>
      <p>I've measured the actual impedance of the grain-of-wheat lamps
        at 20.77 ohms at the resonant freq of the MRA. If the current
        were 137 ma, the lamp would be dropping 2.85 VAC. Put another
        way, that would make the effective impedance of the rest of the
        primary equal to the ratio of this drop to terminal voltage
        times the 20.77 ohms. 23.84/2.85 = 8.36, times 20.77 = 174 ohms,
        and therefore the current is 137 ma. </p>
      <p>Of the 20.77 ohms impedance of the lamp, five ohms is
        resistance. Now, the inductive reactance will consume no power,
        but the five ohms sure will! That is why it lights up, as the
        resistive element of the coil (the filament) draws current and
        gets hot. So, if the current really is 137 ma, the power
        consumed by the lamp is almost 100 mw. That's a VERY BRIGHT
        grain of wheat lamp at its max rating, not the dim lamp that you
        are seeing. Measure the drop across your lamp, and divide it by
        five, and you will have the true primary current. Multiply this
        by the terminal input voltage, times 0.707, and you will have
        input power.&nbsp; Even still, the resistance of the lamp is
        consuming power, so you can determine that power, deduct it from
        the total, and then get rid of the lamp. Just multiply the
        current by the drop across the lamp, and multiply that by .707,
        and subtract it from the previous input power amount, then get
        rid of the lamp. </p>
      <p>There's no point in having ANY resistance that you don't need
        in a reactive circuit. </p>
      <p>I'm sure someone will analyze the data and recognize the
        obvious error of not applying the power factor to the max gain
        measurement. However, the other part, the average V-in*V-in
        [V-out ?], cannot be determined because it came from data which
        was only available when the report was written. However, since
        we know the input voltage, the assumption is that current is
        very much higher... and yet the wheat lamps tell us otherwise...
        Measurably, if you use the 5 ohms of resistance. </p>
      <p>I am satisfied that we are right. Now we have to prove it. ~

      <p>Hi Norm: I accidently left out a part in the previous message,
        and it is very important! In using the grain of wheat lamp to
        determine primary current, FIRST you have to find the amount of
        the voltage drop that is resistive only. That is the ratio of
        five ohms to 20.77 ohms of impedance, or 0.24. Multiply the
        voltage drop across the lamp by 0.24 to get the resistive
        voltage drop. Then divide that amount by five to determine the
        current. You can use that current as the series current for
        input power.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>

      <p>David: you were correct to assume that we had thought out the
        testing proceedure and yes (to answer your question) we knew
        exactly what the <br>
        outcome of the test would be by adding a "lump" resistance to
        the circuit. It kills the over-unity effect "dead as hell". All
        three of the testing parties were told that this would happen.
        Now if you would please go back to the starting point and read
        the whole thing over then you will not come back and suggest
        placing a "lump" resistance value anywhere in the input circuit
        to derive a current value. It just cannot be done this way for
        it completely alters the MRA into as Hal stated "an ordinary
        series resonant transformer circuit". Put you thinking cap on

        current wave forms exactly 180 degrees out of phase at the input
        of the MRA? See there is something real peculiar here for
        between the piezo and the coil the phase angle was 90 degrees.

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: DAVID WYLAND <br>
        Subject: Alpha and Omega </p>
      <p>Hello David: You are most kind in your offers and that is truly
        appreciated. The basis for our beliefs concerning the use of a
        resistor for testing the MRA... There are, of course,
        distributed resistances in any circuit. If there weren't, every
        circuit would be at unity. </p>
      <p>The effect of directly coupling poled devices with tetrahedral
        lattice structures is that the devices will break into resonance
        when an external potential is applied. This is why the Nieper
        ring, which led us to the MRA, resonates a rich blend of
        harmonics at over ten times the alpha cutoff frequency of the
        transistors. Transistors are made of silicon or germanium, both
        of which have tetrahedral lattice structures. The key to the
        resonance is in the PHI relationship within the lattices. Please
        read the file PHI&amp;RES.ASC for the background work on this. </p>
      <p>PHI and the Fibonacci series is how nature works. Even plants
        grow according to the Fibonacci series. A plant will grow a
        leaf, then two more, then three more, then five more, then eight
        more, etc. These relationships are imbedded in the fabric of all
        existance. </p>
      <p>Many cases of transistor circuits going over unity have been
        reported and the result is normally destructive to the
        transistors. How many times have you heard of this as "spurious
        noise"? Engineers add... guess what... RESISTORS to eliminate
        this "noise". Since the devices aren't designed to handle the
        extra power, they HAVE to do that. If you want examples of this,
        let me know. Sometimes the transistors will shoot out lasers, as
        seen by Lawandy, and reported in "Nature". </p>
      <p>The MRA also uses poled devices (magnet and piezo) with tet
        lattices and applies an external potential. However, we apply
        the potential at resonance to "kick start" the effect, and let
        it build up for an hour to get the most harmonics. In so doing,
        we are taking advantage of the "hidden" potentials which exist
        across ALL standing potentials in the form of biwave pairs,
        according to Maxwell, et al. </p>
      <p>The biwave pairs are frequency matched to the MRA harmonics to
        add POTENTIAL... which then is "seen" by the flux of the
        magnetic ferrite <br>
        core to add electrons (up to the saturation point) for a net
        increase in power. However, this power will be consumed by a
        cumulative value of resistance, and it will appear that the
        power is coming from the source! Now, we've been able to add a
        "resistance" in the form of a lamp, which has an effective
        impedance of 20 ohms, only 5 ohms of which is resistive, and
        this lessens the effect, but does not kill it as a pure
        resistance will do. </p>

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: Transcension and the ether </p>
      <p>Transcendental numbers are, as most people know, indeterminate.
        The&nbsp; decimal fractions will continue infinitely without
        repeating. Another way of saying that is to say that these
        ratios cannot be contained in 3-space. In the file
        PHI&amp;RES.ASC, work was begun to show how these ratios,
        specifically PI and PHI, relate to natural geometric vibration
        as perceived in harmonics and octaves of music. Later, these
        same ratios were used in an application of resonant geometry in
        the MRA, and most recently as seen in Stewart Harris's TMI
        device. </p>
      <p>I keep asking myself, "where is this all leading?" We know this
        is really very, very old knowledge, because it was APPLIED by
        people long ago. In their analogy, the basic elements of earth,
        air, fire and water were contained in the first four Platonic
        solids, all of which are PHI based. The fifth Platonic solid,
        the dodecahedron, was the representation of ether. PHI and
        resonance are inextricably linked to ALL of reality, both inner
        and extra dimensionally. Ether (the dodecahedron) was THE MOST
        SACRED of the geometries. However, as a Platonic solid, it can
        be contained within both the cube and the circle... implying
        that the ether is within. Maxwell agreed with this. </p>
      <p>The dimensions outside of 3-space are actually within as seen
        by the Platonic solids. The atomic lattice structures of cube
        elements are already "tuned" to the ether. The cube is the
        nested tetrahadron. The lattice structure of silicon is a
        tetrahedron. Transistors can break into free oscillation, and
        the etheric energy causes them to produce energy above unity,
        because the PHI (transcendental) ratio is within. </p>
      <p>However, the cube, which contains the dodecahedron, can also be
        contained within the sphere, and when two spheres intersect into
        each other at the center, the result is the vesica pisces, also
        a PHI ratio and within which (at the neutral center) the natural
        vortical spin of all energy occurs. Particle spin of atoms is
        the result of this relationship. It is etheric energy. </p>
      <p>We as people are linked to these geometric relationships from
        conception, and we are transcendental beings. That is why the
        Incunabula type of dimensional shift is an innate capability,
        but the process is learned through the understanding of sacred
        geometry, and applying it in relation to our dodecahedral
        component. All of the answers are in the geometry... from the 13
        wavelengths of light which will cure any illness, to free
        energy, to any possibility. </p>
      <p>I suggest that those who have tunable musical instruments might
        want to retune them to the PHI based transcendental frequencies,
        and use the musical vibrations to tune their own vibrations to
        the ether. Using only the whole notes, as practiced by the
        ancient Greeks, is supposed to be particularly balancing. It is
        one thing to be aware of the PHI and resonance links to extra
        (inner) dimensionality. As was done long ago, however, we can
        now begin to apply them, which is why are here. </p>
      <p>We've spent a long time either ignoring, denying and defying
        nature, and we can see the resulting decay of our species and
        our habitat. We really need to become aware and then apply
        balancing principles now. </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: GLENDA STOCKS <br>
        Subject: TMIDEVIC </p>
      <p>Glenda: Joel and I have worked out a full sustaining method of
        making the TMI not only run itself continously but generate
        power in the process and if you so desire take "flight" just
        like the Searl Disk. Last night I went out to Joel's and we had
        a long visit during which we worked outr a lot of the details as
        to how the device actually worked and how it related to the
        Searle rollers. After I got back home I ran several test on the
        magnet runner for I was interested in the relationship between
        the fixed track portions and the rotating magnetic runner or
        roller. The interesting phenomenon here is that the runner has
        to be rotating or the device will not provide the necessary
        thrust to continue to move. One very interesting point that
        Stewart mentioned <br>
        was that he used the "tinker toy" wheels to slow down the
        roller. Well what I did was increase the spin rate of the roller
        or runner by the Phi rate in relation to the fixed magnetic
        track and found that the intersecting vesica pisces vortex
        patterns were multiplied to the extent that this thing has
        incredible thrust and does not need the broken segments in the
        track as per the original plans. The track can be a continous
        vortical or helixal magnetic flow with the runner magnetic
        vortex intersecting at 90 degrees to provide 3D nested visica
        pieces vortices. Very interesting little device which as Joel
        properly put it, "This dog will WARP". A very true statement for
        what you will have created is a very simplified version of John
        Searle's SEG. For you non-indoctrinated out there that means
        Searl Effect Generator. This thing properly constructed will not
        only run itself, but generate plenty of excess power in the
        process.&nbsp; The biggest problem you are faced is that if you
        ever lose the load on it you will have the same problem that
        John Searl had, in that your home powering generator will simply
        accelerate to the critical velocity of the rollers and simply
        fly away leaving a hole in your roof. All kind of possibilities
        here.&nbsp; Thanks for sharing this little device with the
        world.&nbsp; Everyone will have fun with this one. ~ Norm </p>

        Subject: Another MRA </p>
      <p>Sam Faile, who writes for New Energy News up in Cincinatti,
        sent me a document which is very interesting for it is from an
        individual who wishes to remain anonymous at this time but
        wanted to make a contribution. Basically this man has another
        take off on the MRA. </p>
      <p>HISTORY: (1993) Circuit was originally intended to produce
        series of time decrement pulses for anti-gravity experiment
        (concept of an expanding E-M wave form). Never was taken beyond
        breadboard level. Other projects took precedence. Had intended
        on feeding expanded pulse sequence into various trancducers to
        look for unusual effects. </p>
      <p>Description: A positive sawtooth wave of about 24 V P-P is
        generated by a simple N-channel JFET oscillator. This signal is
        coupled through a <br>
        capacitor to a 555 timer chip which is configured as a voltage
        controlled oscillator. The output of the 555 then consists of a
        +12V pulse train, wherein each pulse is of a duration period of
        twice as long as the pulse before it. The pulse train is
        contained within an envelope about 10-15 us in duration. When
        this pulse sequence was fed into a ferrite core inductor,
        instantly a tremendous voltage rise occured! A nearly pure sine
        wave of about 130 V P-P was measured across the inductor. It is
        unknown if any substancial power was developing in the inductor,
        however a neon lamp across the unit lit very brightly without
        diminishing the magnatude of the sine wave. No attempts were
        made to try to couple this energy into a secondary circuit for
        I-V <br>
        analysis. (Could be done with a secondary winding added over the
        primary of the inductor). Objective: This effect may or may not
        embody any unusual or new principles. I found two aspects to be
        unusual: (A) The production of a sine wave across the inductor
        with 130 V P-P magnitude; (B) The fact that this voltage does
        not blow out 555 chip or the op-amp. </p>
      <p>Applying the decrement pulse train to an iron core coil, or an
        air core coil or a quartz piezo transducer did not produce any
        unusual effects. This information is being released in light of
        the developments by N. Wootan and J. McClain and others. If
        barium ferrites or other ferrites are found to posses the
        ability to store energy, or "ring", then maybe the actions of my
        aforementioned device add up. Hopefully, any who are currently
        working with barium ferrite might find value in this circuit.
        Best of luck. ~ G.A., Wichita </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA Tech Bulletin </p>
      <p>Well, just for grins I built a "super MRA" which is in the form
        of a right cylindrical magnet section with large flanges top and
        bottom made of plexiglass so I could wind a very long wire
        primary and secondary coil so as to be able to play some turns
        ratio games without having to take the unit apart and rewind
        each time I needed to change ratios. I did this by winding
        18,000 feet of wire on the magnetic core with taps brought out
        about every 1000 feet of winding. This way you can play some
        interesting games not only with impedance matching but also with
        wire lengths in the windings for resonant tuning as we do in
        Tesla Coils. Any one interested in building the MRA and fine
        tuning it to peak out the performance should consider this
        approach for it provided me some rather impressive data. Now
        there is no doubt about over-unity for I have been able to back
        off to practically nothing the input power to the unit and
        maintain a healthy output. I am seeing the input potential from
        my source amplifier being trippled from an idle available source
        voltage of 48 VAC goimg up tp 160 VAC with the MRA tuned to max
        gain. You can place a grain of wheat bulb in the primary of the
        circuit and it will not even light at all while driving a 120 V
        3Watt standard bulb across the bridge rectifier. Real
        interesting what happens when <br>
        you approach a near perfect impedance and resonant match in the
        windings. This is something that we wanted to do in time. That
        is the point all should consider, that is all this takes
        valuable time and it will be done by not only Joel and I but by
        others out there who are serious researchers such as Hans Becker
        and others. ~ Norm </p>

        Subject: MRA Test Results </p>
      <p>I have been rather quiet on the subject of the MRA test that
        was conducted for I have let Joel handle the responses since he
        is more diplomatic the I. Well I have a few comments for all who
        are interested to really ponder. First, let us consider the true
        nature of the piezoelectric element in the MRA. This is probably
        the most "NON LINEAR" device that man or nature has ever
        constructed. Everyone knows just how NON-linear they are
        especially when I can hit the piezo with a simple pulse of 57 V
        and get a return of over 1000 V as a response from this little
        device. Now let us look at the peculiar little MRA coil. First
        we start with a totally "saturated" magnetic core with a primary
        coil and a secondary coil wound directly onto the magnet. We are
        "ringing" the crystaline lattice structure of the BaFeSi
        material that composes the magnet therefore this component is
        also "TOTALLY NONLINEAR". What do you get when you couple two
        "TOTALLY NON LINEAR" devices together into a series resonant
        circuit where we are driving one element 3 octaves above the
        other and producing 9 harmonics and purposely detuning the
        circuit to cause one of the harmonics to beat <br>
        against the incoming current from the signal source to cause the
        MRA to achieve over-unity??? Well if you haven't figgured it out
        yet you have a circuit that does things that are "NOT IN ANY
        TEXT BOOK PRINTED". Joel and I have spent countless hours
        looking at results of simple experiments conducted with the MRA
        that simply defy all EM theory or logic. Now "please" consider
        what I have said about how "NONLINEAR" this whole device is and
        go down to the last line in the file MRACLAR.ASC and read the
        recomendation that we should read "Principles of Linear
        Networks" by Friedland, Wing &amp; Ash, McGraw-Hill, 1961. I
        highly respect Hal Puthoff and his theoretical abilities but in
        the case of the MRA, I'm sorry the "light has not come on". This
        circuit is over-unity and we are still proceeding with the
        driver circuit to make it obvious to all who wish to see and
        "believe". ~ Norm </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN&nbsp; ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA Testing </p>
      <p>This question goes out to Tom Bearden and Walter Rosenthal who
        are on the same "sheet of music" as to the testing of the MRA. I
        have gone <br>
        back and degested all of the available info on the Maxwell
        approach to the MRA device and Tom is right on in his analysis
        that you simply <br>
        cannot use a "FLATLAND EM" (classic EM theory) approach to this
        circuit. If you go back and study Maxwell's model in quaternions
        you <br>
        begin to appreciate the "higher topology" possibilities and see
        the Whittaker bi-wave pair coupling in the circuit. I see the
        same current wave form that has puzzled Walter in his analysis
        of the input to the MRA. When you fine tune the MRA to a maximum
        gain where the current wave form is a complex wave on the scope
        with a leading and lagging sine wave form aproximately 45
        degrees apart with a complete "fill" of rich harmonics of
        various magnitudes then you are getting a picture of what is
        really happening in the input. Is this complete fill in of the
        complex current wave form an indication of "time forward and
        time reverse" biwave EM pair coupling taking place before our
        eyes. Walter has photographed this phenomenon and states that he
        has never seen anything like this before in conventional EM
        analysis. I along with Joel have studied this current wave
        display and have concluded that it is the key to the MRA
        over-unity display. Only when you have this complex current wave
        form does the MRA display the over-unity traits. This is the
        prime area that has to be resolved to better understand what is
        really happening in this circuit. Norm </p>

        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: CHRIS FLAMIG <br>
        Subject: Bootstrap designing </p>
      <p>Hi Chris: Greg's report is four pages long, including the
        cosmological study. He states that his Rhysmonic Theory
        describes the power gain of the MRA. Based upon the experimental
        results and conclusions, I think that he very well understands
        the aetheric 'interface' with 3-space. His gravity detectors are
        working proof (I have built one) of the soundness of his
        theories. </p>
      <p>He measured the same source current reduction which Norm and I
        have documented, with the same (but higher) power gain at the
        load. He used a signal generator which is only capable of 4mw
        max output, which the MRA drove down to only 1.85mw. At the
        output he measured 18.5 mw. With the components that he used,
        the max power frequency was 90KHz, and the max gain frequency
        was 100 KHz. Interesting that he increased the freq for max
        gain, as this causes the circuit to increase its inductive
        reactance and to decrease its capacitive reactance. This
        increases core saturation, enabling more free electrons to
        couple with the excess potential provided by the piezo effect in
        the series resonant circuit, and thus providing output power
        above unity to the load. </p>
      <p>Greg used two different transformers and got similar results.
        The first was a small potted xfmr with a ferrite (not magnetic)
        core, and it was marked 5.0 mh and 5:1 ratio. The second was an
        ordinary 125 VAC to 25 VAC xfmr into which he inserted two of
        the R.S. magnets. In both cases, he achieved above unity
        results. Since he used the parts which he had 'on hand', by
        understanding the theory, I suggest that you could likely do the
        same and get similar results. </p>
      <p>I think that the transformer which has a non-magnetic core is
        acting more like a magneto than a virtual rotation generator, as
        the core is reacting to the alternating cycles of input where
        the voltages are 180 degrees out of phase but the currents are
        equal and in phase. In other words, the magneto effect is
        creating a magnetic "bubble" which "moves" 180 degrees with each
        cycle, but never dissipates because the resonance of the circuit
        "breathes" it virtually "in" and "out". The alternating polarity
        of the "bubble" blocks primary current, as it is a sphere of
        influence which opposes the source sphere. </p>
      <p>The source sphere is essentially counterrotating, and as long
        as the circuit remains in balance (resonance), each alternate
        half cycle has an aetheric counterpart which finds a "home" in
        the output load. Somewhere in between a weak magnet with a lot
        of ferrite and ferrite which has not been magnetized, but which
        magnetizes and "flips" at resonant half-cycle intervals, we will
        find the optimum core, and it may vary by design as per load
        requirement. I don't want to get too wordy here, but the main
        idea is to use what you have, which is what Norm and I did, and
        is also what Hans B. and Greg H. have done, and all have been
        successful. Have fun! ~ Joel </p>

        you rate a footnote in one of T. E. Bearden's articles: </p>
      <p>In the just out Explore! magazine, Vol 6, #1 appears: "Vacuum
        Engines and Priore's Methodology: The True Science of Energy -
        Medicine Part I of II" by T. E. Bearden. </p>
      <p>Under the heading of "Vacuum Engines: Ordering and Utilizing
        the Vacuum Virtual Particle Flux:" </p>
      <p>"This VACUUM ENGINE now does the work and furnishes all the
        working energy.&nbsp; We just have to pay to set up the GATING
        MECHANISM AND THE TEMPLATE in the beginning, and continue to
        play a little bit to sustain them. Literally we have created a
        stupendous ENERGY AMPLIFIER. [19]" </p>
      <p>19:&nbsp; "As example of such an actual amplifier was Floyd
        Sweet's vacuum triode - [Long dissertation about Sweet which
        ends with -&gt;] Unfortunately nothing can be done with the
        device - e.g., because of formidable legal entanglements due to
        the conflicting agreements Sweet made with different financial
        backers. However, McLain &amp; Wooten has produced a repicable,
        tested over unity device &amp; full construction details have
        been rebuilt on Internet." [Rebuilt? Odd use of the word.] </p>
      <p>Some thing else that has been discussed here recently under the

      <p>"Normally, so QM tells us, the observation process destroys
        time, so that all "observables" are spatial only. So the
        completion of each observable change in a living mass system
        momentarily destroys the only connection that the mass had with
        associated mind! It vanished in the so-called "collapse of the
        wave function." [26,27,28] </p>
      <p>28:&nbsp; "Since the entire area is highly nonlinear, then
        nonlinear oscillator theory applies. Gravitation lattices may
        therefore be activated harmonically or subharmonically. This
        means that "optical band" results can be initiated by analogous
        subharmonic input - e.g., microwaves or even sound waves.
        G-lattices work like music; one recognizes a C-chord regardless
        of the octave. In similar manner, vacuum engines (G-lattices)
        may be shifted by any number of octaves, with initiation of
        results then being delayed in the responding physical systems,
        and prescribed by nonlinear oscillator theory." </p>

        Subject: Repeat of Hodowanec's Test </p>
      <p>Brother Norm (we've adopted each other) came over tonight with
        a very small MRA, so that we could try the test previously done
        by Greg Hodowanec. The transformer consists of two of the
        rectangular R.S. BaFe magnets with primary and secondary wrapped
        around them. </p>
      <p>First, we tried using an ordinary electrolytic capacitor for
        the piezo, and that didn't work...couldn't even get unity out of
        it. Then we put a tried-and-true piezo in the circuit, and
        commenced to tune it. It peaked at 33.4 KHz, so we tuned it up
        to 40 KHz, at which all current ceased to flow. We tuned it do
        34.1 KHz, at which point we had 73 microamps of primary current
        at 11.8 VAC, or about 0.86 milliwatts. </p>
      <p>The output measured 6.2 milliamps at 1.915 VDC, for 11.87
        milliwatts. This power difference was also obvious in the LED
        brightness, as <br>
        described by Greg. The gain computes out to 13.8 times input.
        Greg found 10 times input, using a planar capacitor instead of a
        piezo. Norm and I used the old reliable HP-200cd sig gen for
        input. </p>
      <p>The key, as always, is in the tuning for max gain. It's
        necessary to increase the frequency, as Greg described, and as
        Norm has been doing all along, to make the circuit primarily
        inductive. I goofed in some of the early tests by DEcreasing the
        frequency, and I hope that didn't cause too much confusion. </p>
      <p>I think that it's important to mention the need for
        co-inventors on projects like this, as illustrated above, it's
        so very easy to make a dumb mistake that doesn't otherwise get
        corrected. Without both of us, there would be no MRA. The total
        is always greater than the sum. </p>
      <p>We both have had the same vision and shared the load as each of
        us was best able to do. That's why we be bro's now. Keely may
        have <br>
        been able to do it solo, and Tesla too for that matter, but the
        rest of us always work better when we work together. ~ Joel </p>

        Subject: MRA </p>
      <p>Jerry: Re: your notes on the MRA as to being over-unity and the
        availability of the parts we are useing. I was in Tanner
        Electronics last week and he offered me the last 50 piezzo's he
        had. They are still available but no one is asking for them. I
        put out the info on the magnets we are useing (IBM 3380E hard
        drives, drive model 391X). I have personally, at my expense
        shipped out 30 of these magnets to interested parties. Joel and
        I are working on the elusive standalone demo but this is not as
        easy as it may sound to you. The anomolous characteristics of
        this device has taken out 3 of my audio amps and 2 more scopes
        plus two frequency counters eventhough I have taken great care
        in trying to isolate this equipment best I know how. If there
        were nothing to this circuit then we would not see all this
        anomolous behavior that cannot be explained by conventional
        theory. When we attempt to build a self-sustaining oscillator,
        it suffers the same fate that the test equipment experiences.
        I'm so frustrated that I am about to turn to a simple Tesla air
        core tuned Tesla coil with spark gap to get away from
        transistors which are "self targeted" by the bi-wave coupling
        (scalars) <br>
        reflected in the primary. This circuit is "destructive to solid
        state devices". If you haven't been there like Joel and I then
        you don't have a clue as to what is happeneing in the circuit.
        It looks so simple, two components in series resonance. Simple,
        no, for they are the two most "non-linear" devices we could have
        come up with. The totally saturated barium ferrite core
        transformer is just reverse of conventional transformer theory
        where we drive the core towards saturation. In the MRA we are
        driving the core out of saturation at a 3 octave down freq from
        the piezzo. The piezzo is also a very "nonlinear" device and
        when you&nbsp; couple the two components together in a series
        resonant circuit you have a lot of "wild cards" that you don't
        even know about. The text books do not cover this device
        therefore we are "plowing new ground". Hal Puthoff and Scott
        Little saw this and had to fall back on conventional theroy to
        try to resolve the anomolous behavior of the circuit. Joel and I
        elect instead to try to resolve the "anomalies" of the MRA and
        not just apply conventional theory and sweep it under the rug.
        This circuit is not going to just "go away", I promise. We are
        doing all we can with our meager budget and time available. As
        to duplicatability (big word), why can't others do as Greg
        Hodawanec did and build a MRA with off the shelf (Radio Shack)
        magnets and capacitor with LED's used to demonstrate the circuit
        behavior. Joel and I have done the Hodawanec test and it works.
        This takes about 30 minutes of time and about $5 worth of parts
        along with a sig gen to provide the excitation. Simple enough,
        but try to get <br>
        someone to build one instead of sitting back and waiting for the
        proof to come from others who are really trying. WE ARE TRYING
        TO GET AN <br>
        OSCILLATOR THAT IS SUITABLE TO RUN THE MRA "standalone". Norm </p>

        From: NORMAN WOOTAN ~ To: ALL <br>
        Subject: MRA </p>
      <p>The most recent discussion as to whether the MRA is truly
        over-unity was to be expected.&nbsp; The biggest problem here is
        understanding what is going on in the circuit. Tom Bearden
        explained the whole theory of the MRA with the Whittaker bi-wave
        electron pair coupling in the primary of the circuit which
        produces "scalar" potential that are reflected back into the
        signal source. These potentials being "scalar" cannot be
        attenuated or blocked for as we have already seen with the
        "Frolov" single line transmission experiment. The accumulation
        of this "virtual potential" in a transistor or solid state
        circuit literally destroys all.&nbsp; Between Joel and I we have
        all the "proof of this phenomenon in "dead, expensive
        equipment".&nbsp; I bought a nice (second one) audio amp from
        Radio Shack, brought it home and hooked up on of my advanced
        prototype MRA's driving 25 watt T8 flourscent load, turned it on
        at very low signal output and immediately blew up the amp. Radio
        shack repaired it after replacing the power transformer, the
        output transformer, the full wave bridge, and all the final
        output transistors. Yes, it blew the line fuse but this all took
        about 10 seconds of operation of the amp. The "E" section of
        this net was set up by Jerry so as to give us a forum for a
        small group of like-minded researchers to resolve problems and
        discover new energies. Let's work together on this problem and
        not point fingers as to not comming up with "conclusive"
        evidence as in the case of the MRA. Joel and I don't have all
        the answers. Frankly we are in a quandry as to how to solve the
        perplexing problem. If we can't rely on solid state compoments
        because of the "scalar potential" problem, then we may have to
        fall back on some old non-solid state solutions. I even picked
        up some fiber optic material for possible doing some optical
        isolation between equipment and MRA under test. If any one out
        there in "E" has ideas, let's hear them. ~ Norm </p>

      <p>03/14/95 <br>
        From: JOEL MCCLAIN ~ To: RICK WOOD <br>
        Subject: Tune above resonance </p>
      <p>Hi Rick, and thank you for your timely message. I think that it
        may clear up a lot of questions that others have as well. We are
        using the piezo both as a capacitor and as a piezo. As a
        capacitor, it completes the series resonant circuit. A series
        resonant circuit develops potentials across the capacitor and
        the coil at Q times the source voltage, and at resonance the
        voltages are 180 degrees out of phase.&nbsp; The currents,
        however, remain in phase. </p>
      <p>If you tune below resonance, the circuit becomes net
        capacitive, and if you tune above resonance, the circuit is net
        inductive. Xl=2PIFL. Increasing the frequency into a net
        inductive region creates a virtually lossless circuit, where
        current can be calculated within 1% without even considering
        resistance. At peak resonance, where Xc=Xl, the circuit is pure
        resistance. </p>
      <p>At the upper resonant range, the lossless circuit can transfer
        power to an output, and yes the load is reflected into the
        primary, so it is necessary to retune when the load changes
        outside the frequency range and causes the source current to
        increase. However, the Q of the circuit is equal to the Q of the
        coil alone in this mode. </p>
      <p>So far, standard textbook theory. Using a barium titanate piezo
        and a barium ferrite magnet at their resonant frequencies
        creates a ringing of harmonics which couples additional energy
        to the circuit. This can be both heard audibly and seen on the
        scope display. It is the same ringing which can occur in
        transistors and cause them to burn out as a result of excessive
        energy, except that these components will not burn out. We
        couple the energy to the load. Some folks call this 'harmonic
        distortion' or 'spurious oscillation', but we call it useful
        energy. </p>
      <p>When this happens, the piezo and magnet become phase conjugate
        mirrors (PCM), and instantaneously couple potentials, which are
        then matched to electrons from the stressed piezo as well as
        from the saturated ferrite core. Interestingly, when the piezo
        is removed from the circuit, it will continue to regenerate
        finger-zapping charges for quite some time, as you discover when
        you pick them up. However, when the instantaneous potentials
        "mate" with electrons, power results. </p>
      <p>The core, after being deenergized, will also ring on and off
        from time to time unless you put it in a freezer. Now, having a
        Hodowanec MRA here and in test, I have found that the barium is
        not necessary, at least in very low power designs. The power
        gain is both measurable and visible in the LEDs on both the
        input and the output. There is enough piezo quality in the
        silver mica capacitor to provide the electron coupling for
        energy stored in the coil, while returning very little to the
        source.&nbsp; Because the circuit is very low loss, the energy
        is coupled via a secondary to the load for a net gain. </p>
      <p>I know the relationship of capacitors in series and in
        parallel, and the effect that has on frequency. However, we have
        found that only one piezo per MRA will work at a time, because
        no two of them are exactly the same. The capacitance wouldn't
        matter that much, but the electron coupling has to be precisely
        phased. </p>
      <p>Thanks again, and take care.&nbsp; ~ Joel </p>
