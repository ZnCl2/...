      From Jerry Decker / KeelyNet-Escribe <br>
      To: William Beaty &lt;billb@eskimo.com&gt; <br>
      Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 2, 2005
      <p>Hola Bill! </p>
      <p>Alek is so full of ***... remember him from the
        conference?&nbsp;
        Bumbling,
        self-effacing... said he'd figured out how to make a solid state
        Bedini
        generator... </p>
      <p>Bedini told him he was wrong very politely at first, but Alek
        is
        so
        hung up on his 'genius' (read SMART) that he won't listen to
        anyone...
        and as you know, conmen who fail in their initial con quickly
        move to
        something
        else...failing that, something else, on and on....always looking
        for
        the
        scam, always wanting people to tell them what a friggin genius
        they
        are... </p>
      <p>One thing about spook science, if you can't measure it or
        repeat
        it
        and its only 'experiential', then you can sell all kinds of
        nebulous
        crap
        to <br>
        the gullible who believe your stuff... </p>
      <p>If Alek would give some hardball test that might give a greater
        than
        statistical average measurement...doesn't have to be 100% <br>
        reliable... like the Molecular Frequency Discriminator and how
        flaky
        it is....at least others could check out his claim...but Alek
        comes
        along
        trying to set himself up as some kind of 'mystery spot
        heavyweight'... </p>
      <p>Go for the real deal...Nick Nelson who worked at the Oregon
        Vortex
        for
        3 years and did all kinds of experiments....we just happen to
        sell his
        book... apparently Alek is trying to latch onto Nicks work...but
        at a
        much
        higher price...Nick claims he can make an artificial vortex
        ANYWHERE
        that
        produces measurable results and won't die until he kills it...
        interesting
        guy... he also thinks he has discovered a new magnetic
        phenomenon as
        written
        in this file; </p>
      <p>http://www.keelynet.com/temp/vortex/vortex1.htm </p>
      <p>I haven't been able to detect this spin effect nor have I seen
        his
        production
        (or methods) for an artifical vortex... but its an interesting <br>
        claim. </p>
      <p>Alek is just another ***&nbsp; like BAP, Smith, Harwood and the
        other
        losers out for easy bucks and to sell 'plans' or devices that do
        nothing.... </p>
      <p>Something else... I broke off all my contact with Dan
        Davidson...
        haven't
        written it up cause it would stir up too much shit... would you
        believe
        that *** *** Norman Wootans/Joel McClains MRA way back around
        1995??? </p>
      <p>You know we released it on KeelyNet when they called me very
        excited
        one night in 1994 Xmas... we agreed it best not to make claims,
        just
        say
        this is what they saw, if you are interested, please duplicate
        it and
        report
        back on any anomalies... etc... </p>
      <p>So Davidson, who I've known since way back in the Keely
        Conference
        days
        (around 1989).... and who has lifted TONS of stuff from me and
        others,
        never giving credit, etc... for YEARS, but I let it slide cause
        I'm not
        one to raise hell about credit... </p>
      <p>Anyway, Davidson calls me saying he is flying into DFW airport
        in
        January
        1995... about 1 month after the FREE release of the MRA in <br>
        mid-December 1994... he SAYS he is going to Washington on a
        business
        trip for the company he works for... I meet him and we talk
        during his
        4 hour layover... </p>
      <p>Years later, around 1999, Norman tells me Davidson actually
        patented
        the MRA in his own name which totally screwed up all their plans
        and
        investors...
        I didn't believe it... he shows me on the computer... sure
        enough,
        there
        it is; </p>
      <p>http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=ptxt&amp;s1=davidson&amp;s2='sierra+vista'&amp;OS=davidson+AND+

      <p>United States Patent&nbsp; 5,568,005 <br>
        Davidson&nbsp; October 22, 1996 <br>
        Acoustic-magnetic power generator </p>
      <p>The Acoustic Magnetic Field Power Generator uses an acoustic
        signal
        focused into a permanent magnet to stimulate the nuclear
        structure of
        the
        magnet to cause the magnetic field of the permanent magnet to
        move or
        oscillate.
        This effect can be used to tap power from the oscillating
        magnetic
        field
        by putting a coil of wire in the oscillating field. When an
        alternating
        current signal generator is connected simultaneously to an
        acoustic
        transducer
        and a stimulating coil; whereby, both the acoustic transducer
        and the
        stimulating
        coil are located within the magnetic field of the magnet, the
        acoustic
        signal enhances the stimulating effect to the permanent magnet
        transformer.
        The acoustic transducer can be any acoustic generation device
        such as a
        piezoelectric, magnetostictive, or other acoustic transducer.
        The <br>
        combined effect of the acoustic signal and the stimulating coil
        increases
        the efficiency of permanent magnet induction transformers. </p>
      <p>The *** FILED in January 1995 on that Washington trip and
        received
        it
        in October 1996.&nbsp; Man, I was STUNNED... all the inside shit
        I've
        told
        Davidson over the years... don't know if he is a mole or just a
        ***...
        I think a little of both.. </p>
      <p>I called him up all pissed off... he said he didn't think it
        necessary
        to tell me he'd gotten a patent?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; He said it
        was
        completely <br>
        different and he'd been working on this for 30 years... I asked
        him
        so WHY THE RUSH TO PATENT NOW after the MRA? </p>
      <p>I think getting a patent is a pretty big deal between
        'friends'...but
        he KNEW he'd screwed over Norm/Joel and didn't tell me hoping he
        could
        milk more info about a lot of subjects... man, I was SO PISSED
        and
        disheartened
        because of all we'd done and shared in the past.. </p>
      <p>Told him I wanted nothing more to do with him as I HATE
        thieves,
        liars
        and con artists...hell, wrote the forward for his book, an
        article for
        ITS journal, etc...he came slinking back all apologetic when he
        knew
        about
        the KeelyNet conference in Dallas... I figured I'd let him speak
        but be
        VERY GUARDED about whatever I told him or involved him in... </p>
      <p>We still sell his book on Shape Power which of course no one
        has
        duplicated
        any of his claimed experiments.... </p>
      <p>I can't wait for the day we can get totally away from him...
        Chuck
        deals
        with him now in purchasing the books from him which we resell..
      </p>
      <p>But I was so upset that Davidson, one of my key players would
        do
        that
        STEAL and sneakily at that, hoping no one would notice!...and I
        <br>
        apologized to Norm who thought I KNEW about it and had CHOSEN to
        still
        associate with Davidson despite his theft..NO WAY!!! </p>
      <p>One day, I will write all this up publicly and let people read
        the
        facts
        and judge for themselves... I hate it but people need to be made
        aware... </p>
      <p>I really miss the discussions Dan and I had but I can't abide a
        crook...I
        turned him on to SO MANY THINGS and people he never knew <br>
        about... the final straw was the Grebennikov thing...despite him
        talking
        at the conference, we still emailed but nothing like before...
        no <br>
        secrets, just headsup on various things... but I could never
        trust
        him again... and he was so DISMISSIVE about the patent and the
        clear
        THEFT
        and breach of confidence... </p>
      <p>He blew Grebennikov off completely until I broke it all down
        for
        him
        in quantum physics/gravity correlations...then he 'got it'...and
        I told <br>
        Discovery Channel to include him so when they came to Dallas and
        wanted
        to interview me, I told them no, I haven't built anything that
        works
        and
        make no claims...but they insisted saying I was a key player...
        so
        after
        my spiel I asked Mark if he wanted the inside details of <br>
        Grebennikov... he tells me no, Davidson had done an HOUR ON
        IT...
        forget
        about his Shape Power or the ripped off work of Joe Parr and the
        gravity
        wheel (which I also turned him onto), he jumps on Grebennikov
        which I
        spent
        hundreds of bucks researching and sharing with him and others! </p>
      <p>Davidson is completely wrong in his approach to it...
        Grebennikov
        WROTE
        me telling me in all these years, only I had figured it
        out....so Dan
        in
        his thirst for publicity jumped on something he never even
        believed in
        just because it is a remarkable claim that would get a lot of
        attention. </p>
      <p>Apparenty trying to correlate it with 'his' gravity wheel
        experiments
        and shape power.. yet he gives no details on how anyone can
        verify his
        claims... anything to try to add 'legitimacy'... in this case,
        Grebennikov
        claim... so you'll remember, he is the now deceased Russian
        entomologist
        who claimed to have found an insect that had a shell able to
        'deflect'
        local gravity... see it in the Chapter 5 translation kindly sent
        in by
        Slavek Krapelka and Ren Berghuis and posted at; </p>
      <p>http://www.keelynet.com/greb/greb.htm </p>
      <p>I could go ON AND ON with many things I turned Davidson onto
        that
        he
        absorbed and tried to rework as if HE were the INVENTOR or
        current hot
        researcher... but I'll not bore you... I hate it... to think I
        trusted
        him with a lot of inside stuff that only a couple of trusted
        people
        knew
        about and he intentionally screwed over and Norm and Joel.... </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a solid state electrical
        generator
        having no moving parts in its structure. More particularly, the
        invention
        makes use of a new method of stimulating the nuclear material of
        a
        permanent
        magnet so that the electronic structure of the atom will vibrate
        and
        thus
        cause the magnetic field of the permanent magnet to oscillate.
        It is a
        well-known
        fact that an oscillating magnetic field will induce electrical
        current
        in a coil and was originally discovered by Michael Faraday in
        the last
        century. What is new in this invention is the discovery of the
        ability
        of an acoustic field to stimulate the nuclear structure of a
        material
        to
        cause the electrons to wobble under the influence of the
        acoustic
        field.
        If the material is magnetic or temporarily magnetized by an
        external
        magnetic
        field then the magnetic field will vibrate under the stimulus of
        the
        acoustic
        field. If this effect is combined with a coil which is
        simultaneously
        stimulating
        the magnet then the efficiency of stimulating the permanent
        magnet's
        field
        is enhanced. If a pickup coil is placed in the oscillating
        magnetic
        field
        so as to create an induction transformer then the combination of
        the
        acoustic
        and magnetic stimulation will enhance the efficiency of the
        induction
        transformer. </p>

        Electromagnetic
        Generator. </p>
      <p>The above references to Pasichinsky, Richardson, and de Rivas
        all
        use
        inductive methods to stimulate the motion of a permanent
        magnetic
        field.
        In the de Rivas invention, the Electromagnetic Generator, the
        flux of
        the
        permanent magnet is "alternate(d) by switching" using inductive
        coupling.
        In the Richardson disclosure an "energy conversion system" the
        flux of
        the permanent magnet is also "shifted" by inductive means. In
        the
        Pasichinsky
        disclosure, alternating magnetic coils induce flux changes in a
        closed
        magnetic circuit and output coils attached to the circuit are
        induced
        by
        the changing flux to produce a magnetic field. All of these
        devices are
        essentially variations of transformer design with permanent
        magnets as
        part of the transformer cores and all use magnetic induction.
        The
        transformer
        aspect of these references is the use of permanent magnets as
        the
        transformer
        core with coils wrapped around the magnetic core which are
        energized to
        produce oscillation or movement of the permanent magnet's field.
        The
        above
        references are herein called under a class name herein referred
        to as

      <p>The above cited reference to Peek takes advantage of the
        difference
        in operation of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive crystals to
        produce
        a response in one when stimulated by the other. The Peek patent
        does
        not
        use an acoustic wave to stimulate a permanent magnet as in the
        present
        invention. </p>
      <p>The above cited reference to Sommers is a transducer which uses
        a
        conductive
        bar or tube, which supports relatively slow helicon waves,
        placed next
        to a piezoelectric or magnetostrictive crystal. The transducer
        is
        designed
        in such a way to either enhance the acoustic wave or the
        electric wave
        by interaction of the two materials. The Sommers patent does not
        use an
        acoustic wave to stimulate a permanent magnet as in the present
        invention
        to enhance to oscillation of the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>The above cited reference to Balmuth uses mechanically resonant
        reeds,
        rods, or chambers that are coupled to transducers that are
        piezoelectric,
        magnetostrictive, or transistorized. The electrical output of
        the
        transducers
        stimulate an electrical circuit when the resonator receives
        acoustic
        energy
        and again does not use an acoustic wave to stimulate a permanent
        magnet
        as in the present invention to enhance to oscillation of the
        magnetic
        field. </p>
      <p>The above cited reference to Olson uses an acoustically
        responsive
        material
        such as a piezoelectric or a magnetostrictive to act as a delay
        line
        for
        microwave signals and again does not use an acoustic wave to
        stimulate
        a permanent magnet as in the present invention to enhance to
        oscillation
        of the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>The above cited references to Benson, Quinn, Grisdale, Scott,
        and
        Butler
        are all concerned with acoustic transducers which convert
        acoustic
        pressure
        to an electrical signal or vice versa using only the
        piezoelectric
        and/or
        the magnetostrictive effect. The Benson patent is an underwater
        acoustic
        transformer which converts acoustic waves hitting a transducer
        into an
        electromagnetic field which excites a transformer. The Quinn
        patent
        uses
        a magnetostrictive effect to stimulate piezoelectric crystals to
        output
        a high voltage which is a reverse of the Benson patent. The
        Grisdale
        patent
        uses mechanically stacked piezoelectric or magnetostrictive
        crystals to
        produce a more efficient mechanical gyrator. The Scott patent
        uses and
        electrical oscillator to stimulate magnetostrictive rods which
        put
        pressure
        on piezoelectric crystals to output a high voltage from the
        piezoelectric
        crystals. The Butler patent uses a combined effect of
        piezoelectric and
        magnetostrictive crystals to produce an enhanced acoustic energy
        detector. </p>
      <p>The above cited reference to Thompson uses a permanent magnetic
        transducer
        to induce eddy currents in metal which is in the field of the

        or uses moving eddy currents in a piece of metal to stimulate a
        magnetic
        field. The induction of the eddy currents is the result of an
        oscillating
        magnetic field generated in the transducer. </p>
      <p>None of the above cited references use an acoustic wave to

      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>An object of this invention is to provide a power generator
        invention
        with no moving parts therein. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to use an acoustic field to
        stimulate
        the nuclear level of the magnetic material and provide a method
        of
        oscillating
        the magnetic field of permanent magnets. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a simple method
        of
        generating
        electrical energy by including a piezoelectric transducer which
        is used
        to vibrate the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When the
        nucleus
        the
        atom is vibrated by the piezoelectric, it in turn, vibrates the
        electronic
        structure of all the atoms. Since the electronic structure is
        the basis
        of the magnetic field of the magnet then the entire magnetic
        field of
        the
        magnet is vibrated when the electronic structure is vibrated.
        Coils
        placed
        in the vibrating magnetic field will have voltage and current
        induced
        in
        them. </p>
      <p>It is well established fact that when the magnetic field of the
        permanent
        magnet is vibrated it is possible to generate an alternating
        current in
        a coil winding which is within the vibrating magnetic field
        influence.
        What is unique about this invention is to increase the
        efficiency of
        permanent
        magnet transformers by using acoustic stimulation from
        piezoelectrics
        to
        further stimulate the permanent magnet so as to add to the
        inductive
        effects
        of permanent magnet transformers. This invention does this by
        stimulating
        the permanent magnet cores of permanent magnet transformers with
        an
        acoustic
        field generated by a piezoelectric or other acoustically active
        generator
        which is vibrated at the same frequency as the electrical
        induction of
        the permanent magnet transformers. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In FIG. 1 a frequency signal generator 6 is connected to a
        piezoelectric
        1 via wires 4 and 5 connected to the electrode surfaces of the
        piezoelectric
        2 and 3 respectively. The piezoelectric 1 is defined to be a
        high
        dielectric
        material such as barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate or
        any
        other
        acoustic transducer material suitable for sonic and ultrasonic
        generators.
        The piezoelectric 1 is placed in close proximity to the
        permanent
        magnet
        7 such that the acoustic field of the piezoelectric 1 can
        radiate into
        the permanent magnet material. A permanent magnet transformer
        defined
        by
        a coil 8 is in the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 7.
        When the
        piezoelectric
        1 is stimulated by the frequency generator 6 then a voltage and
        current
        is generated at the output 9 and 10 of the above defined
        permanent
        magnet
        transformer. </p>
      <p>Another embodiment of this invention is shown in FIG. 2. and is
        similar
        to FIG. 1. with a similar frequency signal generator 6 connected
        to a
        piezoelectric
        material 1 via wires 4 and 5 connected to the electrode surfaces
        of the
        piezoelectric 2 and 3 respectively. The piezoelectric 1 is as
        defined
        above,
        that is, a material suitable for sonic and ultrasonic
        generators. The
        piezoelectric
        1 is placed in close proximity to the permanent magnet 11 such
        that the
        acoustic field of the piezoelectric 1 can radiate into the
        permanent
        magnet
        material. A permanent magnet transformer defined by a coil 12 in
        the
        magnetic
        field of the permanent magnet 11. When the piezoelectric 1 is
        stimulated
        by the frequency generator 6 then a voltage and current is
        generated at
        the output 13 and 14 of the above defined magnetic transformer.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 is similar to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 with a frequency signal
        generator
        6 connected to a piezoelectric 1 via wires 4 and 5 connected to
        the
        electrode
        surfaces of the piezoelectric 2 and 3 respectively. The
        piezoelectric 1
        is as defined in the descriptions above. The signal generator 6
        is also
        connected to the input coil 20 of the permanent magnet
        transformer
        defined
        by the torroidal permanent magnet core 11, input coil 20 and
        output
        coil
        19. The piezoelectric 1 is placed in close proximity to the
        permanent
        magnet
        11 such that the acoustic field of the piezoelectric 1 can
        radiate into
        the permanent magnet material. The magnetic transformer defined
        by 11,
        19, and 20 is in the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 11
        and is
        connected
        to the frequency signal generator 6 wires 15 and 16. The
        frequency
        generator
        6 by stimulates the piezoelectric 1 which stimulates the
        permanent
        magnet
        transformer via the acoustic field and at the same time the
        signal
        generator
        also stimulates the coil electromagnetically. A voltage and
        current is
        generated at the output coil 19 and power can be taken from the
        output
        wires 17 and 18 of the magnetic transformer. </p>
      <p>A further embodiment of this invention, shown in FIG. 4, is a
        frequency
        signal generator 6 driving a pair of permanent magnet
        transformers
        defined
        by 26, 35, 27 and 25, 36, 28 respectively and also driving a
        piezoelectric
        transducer 1. The piezoelectric is as described above. The
        signal
        generator
        is connected via input wires 23 and 24 to the input coil 26 of
        the
        permanent
        magnet transformer on the left and to the input coil 25 of the
        transformer
        on the right respectively. The other input wire 38 of the left
        permanent
        magnet transformer is connected to the remaining input wire 39
        of the
        right
        magnetic transformer. The output of the signal generator in also
        connected
        to the piezoelectric 1 via connections 21 and 22 to the
        connector
        surface
        of the piezoelectric 33 and 34 respectively. The output of the
        permanent
        magnet transformer on the left is connected to a load 40 via
        wire 30
        and
        the output of the permanent magnet transformer on the right is
        connected
        to the load via wire 29. The remaining output wires 31 and 32 of
        the
        left
        and right permanent magnet transformers are also connected to
        the load.
        The load 40 can be anything such as a motor or electrical lights
        or
        appliance. </p>
      <p>This invention is not limited to the 4 different versions of
        the
        invention
        shown in FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and 4 as there are any number of
        cascading and
        electrical hookup techniques that can be accomplished to amplify
        power
        and to take advantage of the acoustic influence of the
        piezoelectric
        upon
        the magnetic material. Similarly, this invention is not limited
        to the
        torroidal core configuration as there can be many types of
        permanent
        magnet
        transformers with any number of magnetic core and coil
        configurations
        that
        can be enhanced with acoustic stimulation depending on power and
        output
        requirements according to the rules of electronics and those
        familiar
        with
        the state of the art in permanent magnet power transformers. </p>
