                        turn out to be an effective approach in the
                        cavitation process was the with ultrasonic waves
                        creating of bubbles in heavy water with
                        palladium for the hosting metal. This marriage
                        between the cold-fusion process and the
                        cavitation process stemming from 1989,
                        unexpectedly turned out to be effective in the
                        hands of Roger Stringham, a researcher of First
                        Gate Energies, in Hawaii, USA. He developed what
                        he calls the sonofusion process, which produces
                        twice as much watts of heat than was put in in
                        the form of energy. In a tiny device of 20 grams
                        he produces piezoelectrically in heavy water
                        bursting bubbles that generate about 100 watts
                        of energy with an input of 50 watts. In the
                        process is also Helium 4 created, a standard
                        byproduct of cold fusion. He temporarily
                        collaborated with the researchers Ruses George
                        and Steve Wolff. Based on his findings he
                        acquired a patent in 2004: U.S.10/925,347. He is
                        also copied by other cold fusion researchers
                        like Xu and Butt of the Purdue University
                        (pesn-page, his research, article, page). The
                        generation of energy by means of sound and by
                        influencing atomic processes was already known
                        from Keely. The hereupon based generation of
                        cavitation-energy with sound isn't something new
                        either. It was preceded by a patent (U.S.
                        4333796) of Hugh H. Flynn that was filed in 1978
                        (and obtained in 1982). He directed from four
                        sides sound waves through a sealed chamber
                        containing fluid metal consisting of
                        Lithium-alloys mixed with hydrogen isotopes in
                        the process of which meanwhile gravity was
                        canceled by means of magnetic pulses. He also
                        made use of the element Deuterium. What he did
                        was thus in fact cold fusion tens of years
                        before Fleischmann and Pons made their heavy
                        water discovery of the electrical version of
                        this cold fusion process.</font><b><small><big>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Two different
                  cavitation fusion reactors (CFR's) are disclosed. Each
                  comprises a chamber containing a liquid (host) metal
                  such as lithium or an alloy thereof. Acoustical horns
                  in the chamber walls operate to vary the ambient
                  pressure in the liquid metal, creating therein small
                  bubbles which are caused to grow to maximum sizes and
                  then collapse violently in two steps. In the first
                  stage the bubble contents remain at the temperature of
                  the host liquid, but in the second stage the
                  increasing speed of collapse causes an adiabatic
                  compression of the bubble contents, and of the thin
                  shell of liquid surrounding the bubble. Application of
                  a positive pressure on the bubble accelerates this
                  adiabatic stage, and causes the bubble to contract to
                  smaller radius, thus increasing maximum temperatures
                  and pressures reached within the bubble. At or near
                  its minimum radius the bubble generates a very intense
                  shock wave, creating high pressures and temperatures
                  in the host liquid. These extremely high pressures and
                  temperatures occur both within the bubbles and in the
                  host liquid, and cause hydrogen isotopes in the
                  bubbles and liquid to undergo thermonuclear reactions.
                  In one type of CFR the thermonuclear reaction is
                  generated by cavitation within the liquid metal
                  itself, and in the other type the reaction takes place
                  primarily within the bubbles. The fusion reactions
                  generate energy that is absorbed as heat by the liquid
                  metal, and this heat is removed from the liquid by
                  conduction through the acoustical horns to an external
                  heat exchanger, without any pumping of the liquid
                  metal. </big></small></p>

                  relates to a method of producing thermonuclear energy
                  by cavitation of a liquid metal, and more particularly

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>When certain
                  liquids are subjected to reduction in pressure of an
                  appropriate duration and magnitude, small pre-existing
                  bubbles of gas and vapor in the liquids expand to some
                  maximum size and then collapse with great violence.
                  This phenomenon is called cavitation and, when
                  properly controlled, causes very high energy densities
                  to occur both within the bubbles and in the
                  surrounding liquid. The invention disclosed
                  hereinafter relates to a device called a cavitation
                  fusion reactor (CFR), which uses cavitation of a
                  liquid metal to bring about thermonuclear fusion of
                  hydrogen isotopes and other liquid (low Z) elements,
                  both within a bubble created in the host liquid
                  (metal), and in the surrounding host liquid. In its
                  normal operation a reactor of this type produces one
                  or more of the following: the release of energy which
                  is removed as heat; the creation of elements, such as
                  tritium or helium-3, that can be used as thermonuclear
                  fuel, either in the CFR itself in a regenerative
                  manner or in some other fusion device; the fission of
                  heavy elements distributed in the liquid metal; and
                  the radiation of neutrons. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In what follows, as
                  asterisk (*) used on a symbol for a physical quantity
                  denotes a quantity that is in some system of units.
                  Thus, R.sub.n * denotes the equivalent or equilibrium
                  radius of a bubble in centimeters. The symbol R* is
                  the time-varying radius of the bubble in centimeters.
                  The symbol, R, is the non-dimensional radius of a
                  bubble and is defined by R=R*/R.sub.n *. The absence
                  of an asterisk denotes a non-dimensional quantity. The
                  words "negative pressure" will mean a reduction of the
                  ambient pressure in the liquid metal by an applied
                  pressure, which may or may not make the total pressure
                  less than zero. The small bubbles from which
                  cavitation starts will be called "seeds", the liquid
                  in which the cavitation takes place will be called the
                  "host liquid", and a method of obtaining a specified
                  distribution of seeds will be called "seeding" the
                  host liquid. A very small seed containing N moles of
                  gas may be lodged on a minute particle and not have a
                  spherical shape. The term, "equivalent radius",
                  R.sub.n *, will be used to denote the radius of a
                  spherical bubble containing the same number of moles
                  of gas at the same ambient temperature and pressure in
                  the host liquid. For a spherical bubble at rest in a
                  liquid, the terms "equivalent radius" and "equilibrium
                  radius" are identical. The cycle of expansion and
                  contraction that a bubble undergoes under the
                  influence of an applied pressure field will be called
                  a "cavitation event", and the region in the host
                  liquid where these events occur will be called the
                  "cavitation zone". Seeds may be a random distribution
                  of very small bubbles with some average equivalent
                  radius (say, of the order of 10.sup. -5 or 10.sup.-4
                  cm.) or may be distribution of larger bubbles whose
                  equivalent radii fall in a specified range. The words
                  "bubble" and "cavity" used herein are synonyms. </big></small></p>

                  energy and other useful products through thermonuclear
                  fusion in the host liquid; and the Type II CFR, which

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Both types of
                  cavitation fusion reactors may be operated in a mode
                  which produces little or no radioactive products. In
                  this mode the reaction is between lithium nuclei and
                  ordinary hydrogen (.sub.1 H.sup.1 or h) nuclei. In
                  alternative modes of operation the devices use
                  deuterium (.sub.1 H.sup.2 or d), tritium (.sub.1
                  H.sup.3 or t), or a mixture of both d and t as the
                  H-isotope fuel, and the liquid metal may be lithium,
                  beryllium, aluminum, tin, indium, thallium or some
                  other element or alloy. Deuterium is the heavy
                  hydrogen isotope (H-isotope) that occurs in nature,
                  while tritium, the other heavy H-isotope, does not.
                  Only deuterium need be supplied from an external
                  source in both the start-up phase and steady-state
                  operation of the Type I CFR or a Type II CFR. Type I
                  CFR uses a mixture of deuterium and tritium in order
                  to yield a net gain of energy that can be transformed
                  into useful work. The required inventory of tritium is
                  produced within the reactor by the fusion of deuterium
                  nuclei and the interaction of neutrons with lithium or
                  lithium alloyed with beryllium. In a similar manner, a
                  Type II CFR may operate as a generator of tritium that
                  requires only deuterium as the externally supplied
                  fuel. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Once a CFR of
                  either type is placed in operation, the reactor will
                  "breed" its own tritium; that is, the reactor will
                  produce more tritium than it burns, no matter whether
                  or not the fusion reactions start with deuterium alone
                  or with a mixture of deuterium and tritium. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In the collapse of
                  a cavitation bubble, the controlling parameter is the
                  compressibility of the host liquid. Viscosity plays a
                  minor role and in the final stage of collapse the
                  interface moves so rapidly that the effect of heat
                  conduction is minimal and the entropy of the gas and
                  vapor within the bubble becomes constant. The term
                  "compressibility" is here used with a specific
                  meaning: a compressible liquid is one with a finite
                  speed of sound. The greater the speed of sound in a
                  liquid, the less is its compressibility in this sense
                  used here. If the speed of sound of a liquid were
                  infinite, the liquid would be incompressible. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>All real liquids
                  have finite speeds of sound which increase with an
                  increase of pressure in the liquid. When the speed of
                  sound in a liquid is low, compressibility is most
                  effective in moderating the violence of collapse of a
                  bubble and in lowering the maximum temperatures and
                  pressures that can be attained. When a bubble
                  collapses, the pressure in the liquid at and near the
                  interface increases, and hence the local speed of
                  sound increases there also. Because of this increase
                  in the speed of sound at the interface, the violence
                  of collapse may also be increased. </big></small></p>

                  the host liquid must be one with a speed of sound as
                  large as possible, and thus the host liquid must be a
                  liquid metal. While all liquid metals have large
                  speeds of sound, lithium and beryllium have the
                  largest speeds of sound over a wide range of

                  measure of the suitability of a metal as a host
                  liquid. Of the metals listed beryllium has the

                  spend most of their lifetimes in an expanded state in
                  which the vapor pressure of the liquid may be much
                  greater than the pressure of the gas in it.
                  Consequently a high vapor pressure at the start of
                  collapse could have a disproportionate effect on the
                  maximum temperatures and pressures attained at the end
                  of collapse. Similarly, during collapse, a high vapor
                  pressure could mean that a large fraction of the
                  mechanical energy used in compressing the bubble would
                  be expended in heating and ionizing the vapor atoms
                  rather than the hydrogen isotopes. On the other hand,
                  the presence of a small amount of vapor could have the
                  effect of decreasing the thermal conductivity of the
                  gas-vapor mixture and thus hastening the onset of the
                  adiabatic phase of compression. Both lithium and
                  aluminum are examples of liquid metals with moderate
                  vapor pressures over a wide range of temperatures
                  above their melting points. Indium and tin are
                  examples of liquid metals that have very low vapor
                  pressures over an even wider range of temperatures

                  and a small value of .DELTA. K. A large value of

                  interacting with a neutron. In a second chain, the
                  reaction produces helium-4 and tritium and a net gain

                  that helps moderate energetic neutrons and the tritium
                  can be used directly as fuel in the CFR or removed for
                  use in other fusion reactors. Hence a host liquid of

                  or beryllium alone possesses. Such alloys containing
                  hydrogen isotopes would be very effective in slowing
                  down and capturing energetic neutrons released in

                  for Li-Be alloys does not seem to have been
                  determined. However, the chemical similarity between
                  beryllium and aluminum makes it probable that Li-Be
                  alloys behave much as Li-Al alloys. Based on the phase
                  diagram for Li-Al, it is anticipated that the addition
                  of beryllium to liquid lithium would gradually
                  increase the melting point and the sound speed of the
                  alloy. The great advantage of such an alloy would be
                  this increase in the speed of sound as compared to
                  that of lithium alone. At the same time, the vapor
                  pressure of beryllium at such temperatures would be
                  very low compared to that of lithium alone. Solid
                  beryllium has a sound speed of 1.24.times.10.sup.4
                  meters sec.sup.-1 while liquid lithium has a sound
                  speed of 4.2.times.10.sup.3 meters sec.sup.-1 at 1000
                  K. Thus the sound speed of a liquid Li-Be alloy at
                  that temperature should be much higher than that of Li
                  alone. </big></small></p>

                  dispersed in the liquid (either dissolved or as

                  specified ambient temperature, .theta.*. The
                  H-isotopes are absorbed, either in dissolved form or
                  as hydrides. Small seeds of H-isotopes will nucleate
                  on existing inhomogeneities in the liquid. As a
                  result, there will be a stable distribution of very
                  small seeds with some equilibrium size (of the order
                  of 10.sup.-5 cm. to 10.sup.-4 cm. in equivalent
                  radius). A more rapid dispersion would be effected by
                  allowing the liquid metal to be mixed mechanically
                  with the H-isotopes under the same conditions. </big></small></p>

                  In one mode of operation, deuterium is introduced into
                  the host liquid at a surface and diffuses into the
                  cavitation zone. The required inventory of tritium is
                  then produced in the cavitation zone by fusion of
                  deuterium nuclei alone. A specified mole fraction,
                  Y.sub.d, of deuterium is maintained in the host liquid

                  inserted into the wall of the reaction chamber or into

                  of an operating temperature, .theta..sub.n *, depends
                  on the type of cavitation fusion reactor. Viewed as
                  part of a thermodynamic system, the host liquid is
                  simply a reservoir from which heat is transferred to a
                  second, external reservoir. The fraction of energy in
                  the second reservoir available for conversion to
                  useful work increases when its temperature increases.
                  Because the fusion-generated heat is transferred to
                  the external reservoir by conduction, this
                  thermodynamic condition requires that the host liquid
                  be operated at as high a temperature as possible
                  consistent with other constraints. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>There are several
                  constraints that effectively place an upper limit on
                  the ambient (or operating) temperature. One is the
                  corrosion of the reaction chamber by the liquid metal
                  used as the host liquid. The attack by a liquid metal
                  on such surfaces is accelerated by an increase in
                  temperature and the host metal will become
                  increasingly contaminated by material from the reactor
                  surfaces. Another constraint is the vapor pressure,
                  p.sub.v *, of the host liquid, which is a rapidly
                  increasing function of the temperature. The vapor
                  pressure in a bubble may have a disproportionate
                  effect on the dynamics of bubbles; a high vapor
                  pressure may moderate the collapse of a bubble and a
                  large mole fraction of vapor atoms in the bubble may
                  impede the operation of both Type I and Type II
                  reactors. </big></small></p>

                  during all of the expansion phase and most of the
                  contraction phase. In the final stage of collapse, the
                  bubble and a thin shell of liquid around it are
                  compressed adiabatically and the terminal, constant
                  values of the entropy in the bubble and in the liquid
                  shell are to a large extent determined by the ambient
                  temperature. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In a Type I CFR, a
                  major design objective is to achieve as high a maximum
                  pressure as possible in the liquid at the bubble
                  interface on collapse. This objective requires that
                  the terminal, constant value of the entropy, S.sub.c
                  *, of the gas and vapor in the bubble be minimized and
                  hence a low ambient, or operating, temperature be
                  chosen. In a Type I CFR, the objective of a high
                  maximum pressure on collapse also necessitates that
                  the amount of H-isotopes and vapor in the bubble be
                  minimized when the radius approaches its minimum
                  value, R.sub.m *. For given mole fractions, Y.sub.d
                  and Y.sub.t, of deuterium and tritium in the host
                  liquid, the equilibrium "dissociation pressure",
                  p.sub.H *, of the H-isotopes is a function of the
                  ambient temperature when the host metal is an
                  alpha-metal. A choice of a low ambient temperature
                  minimizes both p.sub.H * and p.sub.v * and hence the
                  amount of H-isotopes and vapor in the bubble on
                  collapse. </big></small></p>

                  generation of thermonuclear fusion in a thin shell

                  function of the terminal, constant value of the
                  entropy, S.sub.L *, in the liquid shell. Hence placing
                  some upper limit on the operating temperature does not
                  in itself mitigate against the generation of very high
                  temperatures in the liquid on collapse of a bubble. In
                  a Type I reactor, the temperature in the liquid shell
                  is multiplied by the very intense shock wave radiated
                  by the bubble interface near its minimum radius and
                  the condition for fusion is reached by a sequence of
                  adiabatic compression of the liquid followed by a
                  second compression by the shock wave. </big></small></p>

                  limit on the temperature is established by the

                  of any solid hydride that can form. In lithium where

                  have a vapor pressure of approximately 15 mm Hg at

                  vapor pressure within a bubble is undesirable for the
                  reasons stated above. Lithium is an exception to this
                  general design criterion. At low concentrations,
                  lithium atoms in a mixture of H-isotopes will markedly
                  reduce the thermal conductivity of the gas-vapor
                  mixture and hence assist in bringing about adiabatic
                  compression of the bubble's contents at an earlier
                  stage of motion. Lithium nuclei in a mixture of
                  H-isotopes may serve as a fuel in thermonuclear
                  reactions with those isotopes. While in most liquids,
                  it is desirable to keep the vapor pressure and hence
                  the ambient temperature low, the restriction is not
                  critical for lithium at temperatures at or below 1200
                  K. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In a Type II CFR, a
                  major design objective is to achieve the highest
                  possible temperature within a collapsed bubble. The
                  final temperature reached in the adiabatic compression
                  of a bubble is an exponential function of the
                  terminal, constant value of the entropy. This
                  statement is exact for an ideal gas and an approximate
                  one for non-ideal gases. This requirement means that
                  the entropy, S.sub.c *, of the contents should be as
                  large as possible during the adiabatic compression of
                  a bubble in a Type II CFR. If the host metal is tin,
                  the vapor pressure is 1.33.times.10.sup.-3 mm Hg at
                  1400 K. Hence the operating temperature in a Type II
                  CFR may be as high as 1400 K. or 1500 K. in order to
                  achieve a large value of S.sub.c * in the final stage
                  of collapse without having an undesirably high vapor
                  pressure. </big></small></p>

                  dissociating and then ionizing the gas and a larger
                  share is then used in heating the ionized gas to high
                  temperatures. The fewer heavy vapor atoms that are

                  independently of a time-varying pressure, p.sub.A

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The static pressure
                  affords an alternative way in which to apply a
                  positive pressure of specified magnitude to a bubble
                  that has expanded to a maximum radius, R.sub.o *, and
                  starts to contract. In some modes of operation, it may
                  be preferable to transfer mechanical energy to the
                  collapsing bubble via the static, ambient pressure
                  than by means of an acoustic pressure. For example,
                  when the applied pressure field consists solely of a
                  negative pulse, causing a seed to expand into a much
                  larger bubble, the required positive pressure at the
                  start of collapse may be supplied by the ambient
                  pressure. However, it is important to point out that
                  the speed of collapse depends almost solely on W.sub.m
                  *, the total mechanical work done on the bubble by the
                  total pressure. The ambient pressure, p.sub.ln *, may
                  be 1 bar or 100 bars, but the speed of collapse for a
                  given compression ratio, R.sub.o */R*, is controlled
                  by W.sub.m * and not by p.sub.ln *. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>One effect of

                  contained in a bubble with a specified equivalent
                  radius, R.sub.n *. Thus, for R.sub.n * =10.sup.-3 cm.,
                  a bubble would contain 50 times more gas when p.sub.ln
                  * =100 bars than when p.sub.ln * =1 bar. In a Type II
                  CRF, this multiplication of H-nuclei available in a
                  large seed is an important factor in energy gain and

                  H-isotopes in metals such as W, Mo, Ti and Zr (that
                  may be used as walls of the reaction chamber) increase
                  rapidly with pressure. Hence the normal specification
                  of p.sub.ln * will be that due to hydrostatic pressure
                  plus the dissociation pressure, p.sub.H *, of the

                  the cavitation zone of any CFR. These pressure fields
                  may be generated in a variety of ways and devices.
                  However, as noted above, the most important quantity
                  associated with the interaction of a bubble with such
                  a field is the amount of mechanical energy transferred
                  to the bubble during its expansion from a seed and its
                  subsequent collapse. The detailed specification of the
                  acoustic field and the manner in which it is generated
                  are less important than its ability to transfer a
                  given amount of energy to the bubble. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>There is, however,
                  one important time constraint on the cycle of negative
                  and positive pressure created in the CFR. At the start
                  of such a cycle, the pressure falls to some negative
                  minimum and then rises back to zero. This time
                  interval in which the pressure p.sub.A *(t) is
                  negative must be long enough in duration for the seed
                  to grow to its maximum size before a positive pressure
                  is applied. A typical example is a seed whose initial
                  radius, R.sub.n *, is 2.times.10.sup.-5 cm. As a
                  result of an applied negative pressure of -50 bars,
                  the seed grows into a bubble whose maximum radius,
                  R.sub.o *, is 2.7.times.10.sup.-1 cm. during a time
                  interval of 1.8.times.10.sup.-4 sec. Under an applied
                  positive pressure of +50 bars, the bubble collapses to
                  a minimum size in 1.7.times.10.sup.-4 sec. If the
                  acoustic pressure field in this example were
                  time-harmonic (or sinusoidal), the period would need
                  to be at least 3.6.times.10.sup.-4 sec. and the
                  frequency not greater than 2.8.times.10.sup.3 Hz.
                  Otherwise, the expansion ratio of the bubble would be
                  much less and the collapse much less violent. That is,
                  if the frequency were higher, the bubble would not
                  reach the maximum radius of 2.7.times.10.sup.-1 before
                  it started to contract under the positive pressure. </big></small></p>

                  favors the use of a Type I CFR. The operation of a

                  operation of a Type II CFR in which a high repetition
                  rate is not required. The drawback on their use is
                  that the operation of such resonant systems normally
                  requires the host liquid be homogeneous. Once a bubble

                  their maximum radii, collapsed and effectively
                  vanished. When a resonant device is used to produce a

                  of the bubble remain at the ambient or operating
                  temperature of the host liquid. In the second phase

                  contents and of a thin shell of liquid surrounding the
                  bubble. The positive pressure applied to a collapsing

                  causes the bubble to contract to a smaller minimum

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>At, or near, the
                  minimum radius, a very intense shock wave is radiated
                  by the bubble. The crucial difference between the
                  design of a Type I CFR and a Type II CFR is the
                  relative importance in each of the adiabatic
                  compression of a bubble's contents and the very high
                  pressures and temperatures created in the host liquid
                  by the intense shock wave. A controlling factor during
                  a cavitation event is the amount of work done on a
                  bubble by the applied pressure field. There are many
                  ways in which the parameters of the applied pressure
                  field (duration, period, amplitude) may be chosen, but
                  they are effectively equivalent if the work done on a
                  bubble is the same. </big></small></p>

                  high pressures and temperatures produced by a
                  collapsing bubble in the host liquid depends strongly
                  on whether or not the interface of the bubble remains
                  spherical during most of the collapse. When the bubble
                  is expanding, the interface is stable in shape, but
                  when the acceleration is inward the interface is
                  dynamically unstable against any small perturbation of
                  the spherical interface caused by asymmetrical forces.
                  However, in the very final stage of collapse, the
                  acceleration is again outward and the interface is
                  again stable. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The gravitational
                  field of the earth is an asymmetrical force that tends
                  to create perturbations in a bubble's interface and
                  this external force may cause the spherical interface
                  of bubbles to deform during collapse. A zero-gravity
                  field in which such distortions of the initial
                  spherical shape do not occur is found in an orbiting
                  space vehicle. On the surface of the earth a similar
                  cancellation of the earth's gravitional field is
                  produced in a properly designed static, inhomogeneous
                  magnetic field. Both the contents of the bubble and
                  the host metals are either diamagnetic or paramagnetic
                  and, as a consequence, a magnetic field may be so
                  designed that in the cavitation zone of the host
                  liquid the vertical force per unit area (magnetic
                  pressure) exerted by the magnetic field on the surface
                  of the bubble cancels the force per unit area
                  (gravitational pressure) exerted on the bubble by the
                  gravitional field. </big></small></p>

                  this invention an inhomogeneous magnetic field,
                  similar to those generated in conventional magnets, is
                  used to create an approximately zero-gravity field in
                  the cavitation zone of a CFR. </big></small></p>

                  such that its strength falls off rapidly along a
                  vertical axis from its specified maximum, B.sub.o *.
                  Below the maximum, the gradient of the field is
                  positive (with positive distance upward) and above the
                  maximum the gradient is negative. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>At any point in the
                  host liquid, the force due to gravity may be cancelled
                  in the cavitation zone by an upward force due to a
                  magnetic field, which can be calculated to show, that
                  for a given example, B.sub.o * must be 44 kilogauss in
                  the absence of a bubble and 30 kilogauss in the
                  presence of an H-isotope bubble. Hence, in this
                  example, a value of B.sub.o * of the order of 30-44
                  kilogauss would effectively cancel the effect of
                  gravity in the cavitation zone. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The crucial
                  statement is that, by proper design of an
                  inhomogeneous magnetic field, there will be a region
                  in the host liquid where any value of B.sub.o *, equal
                  to or less that the value specified for cancellation
                  of gravity, will also help inhibit the growth of an
                  instability of the bubble interface. Properly designed
                  (as described hereinafter) an inhomogeneous magnetic
                  field counteracts the effect of gravity and creates a
                  "zero-gravity" field in the cavitation zone of the

                  seeds placed in a liquid rapidly float to the surface
                  and disappear from the cavitation zone. However, the
                  zero gravity field used in a CFR will cause such seeds
                  to remain in the cavitation zone where they are
                  introduced or generated. Thus such seeds remain at
                  their site of formation and in a Type II CFR do not
                  vanish through diffusion of the H-isotopes into the
                  liquid metal. Similarly, in a Type I CFR a
                  zero-gravity field causes seeds of tritium generated
                  by fusion to remain within the cavitation zone. </big></small></p>

                  heat exchanger housing 36, having an inlet 37
                  connected to a supply of heat exchange fluid, and an
                  outlet 38 connected to a device which is to receive
                  the heat energy drawn from the reaction that takes
                  place in chamber 11. Also mounted on the outer end of
                  each horn 30 within the associated exchanges housing
                  36 is a conventional transducer 39, which is operable
                  in a known manner to supply mechanical energy to the
                  associated horn 30. As shown more clearly in FIG. 1,
                  the outer end of each horn 30 and its associated
                  transducer 39 are enclosed within a heat transfer
                  housing 36, so that any heat which is generated in the
                  horn as the result of a fusion reaction in chamber 11
                  will be transmitted through the horn and transducer 39
                  to the fluid that circulates in the associated heat

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Also as illustrated
                  in FIG. 1, the six horns (only five of which are
                  illustrated) are positioned to form three pairs of
                  coaxially disposed horns, with each pair having its
                  axis lying in one of three different planes which
                  intersect one another at right angles. Assuming that
                  the outer surface of each horn 30 is S.sub.o and the
                  inner surfaces S.sub.i, the conical taper of the horn
                  causes a broad beam of intensity I.sub.O to change
                  into a narrower beam of intensity I.sub.i =I.sub.O
                  (S.sub.O /S.sub.i). The particle velocity of the
                  narrow beam radiated into the chamber 11 increases as
                  the square root of the ratio S.sub.O /S.sub.i.
                  Therefore a decrease in the radius of the horn by a
                  factor of 4 increases the intensity by a factor 16 and
                  the particle velocity by a factor of 2. The pressure
                  in the beam that is radiated from the inner end of
                  each horn increases in the same ratio as the particle
                  velocity--i.e., by a factor of 2. Consequently with
                  the arrangement as illustrated in FIG. 1, when each
                  horn increases the pressure by a factor of 2, the six
                  horns increase the total pressure in the cavitation
                  zone (the volume in chamber 11 where the beams from
                  the horns intersect) by a factor of 12. Thus a
                  pressure of 10 bars at S.sub.O of each horn becomes a
                  pressure of 120 in the cavitation zone. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Instead of using
                  six transducers 39 as described above, it would be
                  possible to use an array of three transducers, so
                  arranged that there is a reflecting acoustical mirror
                  opposite each inner surface of a horn 30. Such as
                  arrangement will concentrate the acoustical energy in
                  the cavitational zone as before, but the design
                  decreases the number of holes that must be made in the
                  walls of the housing 12 defining the chamber 11.
                  Refractory metals such as tungsten make effective
                  mirrors because their characteristic acoustic
                  impedances are 30 times greater than that of lithium
                  at 1000.degree. K. and the pressure reflection
                  coefficient of such a mirror would be of 0.94. </big></small></p>

                  transferring acoustical energy in the reaction chamber
                  11, and to extract heat from the chamber, this dual
                  function could also be performed, as desired, by a
                  modified acoustical horn of the type denoted at 40 in
                  FIG. 2. Each such horn 40 may comprise a bundle 41 of
                  metal fibers made of a refractory metal such as
                  tungsten, and enclosed or encased within a shield or
                  housing 42 made of the same material (tungsten, for
                  instance). As in the case of the previous embodiment,
                  housing 42 has thereon a pair of external flanges 43
                  and 44, which seat against the outsides of the walls
                  of housings 12 and 21 to secure the housing 42 in the
                  registering openings in these walls so that the
                  forward end of each housing 42 projects into chamber
                  11. The outer end of each housing 42 projects into a
                  heat exchange housing 36 through which fluid flows, as
                  in the case of the first embodiment, to remove heat
                  which is transferred by the horn 40 from chamber 11 to
                  the exterior of the shield 21. Also as in the first
                  embodiment a transducer 39 is secured to the outer end
                  of horn 40 for supplying energy thereto. </big></small></p>

                  the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is that the removal of

                  increase in the surface area in contact with the heat
                  transfer fluid. If desired, the external end of the

                  only of hydrogen (.sub.1 H.sup.1 of h) into the
                  lithium, and the fusion reaction is between this
                  isotope and lithium. However, in the example described
                  in connection with the CFR as illustrated in FIGS. 1
                  or 2, the mole fraction Y.sub.H of hydrogen is taken
                  to be zero initially, and the mole fraction of
                  deuterium Y.sub.d, and the mole fraction of tritium
                  Y.sub.t, in the steady state are taken to be equal,
                  and their sum Y.sub.d +Y.sub.t is approximately 0.1.
                  The rate at which the reaction (d, t,) occurs in the
                  liquid host is proportional to the product Y.sub.d and
                  Y.sub.t, and thus this product should be as large as
                  possible without making the liquid metal more
                  compressible. The tritium inventory is built up in the
                  host liquid by generating tritium from deutrium alone
                  in the CFR during the start-up phase. </big></small></p>

                  fraction of H-isotopes dissolved into lithium and of
                  the operating temperature. For a combined mole
                  fraction of 0.1 of H-isotopes and the range of

                  The initial concentration of tritium is renewed by the

                  By choosing the proper magnitude and frequency of
                  vibration, the shaker imparts to the reaction chamber
                  11 a downward acceleration during part of the
                  vibration cycle so that the host liquid is essentially

                  expansion-compression cycle of the cavitation bubbles
                  is timed so that collapse of the bubbles occurs during
                  the zero gravity interval created by the vertical

                  lithium. Hence the use of solid metal horns 30 or
                  fiber bundles 41 of tungsten provide an effective way
                  in which to remove fusion heat from the liquid lithium
                  and transfer it out of the reaction chamber 11. These

                  mechanical energy from external acoustic transducers
                  39 to the liquid lithium and transfer heat from the
                  lithium to an external heat reservoir. In this manner,

                  negative voltage on the reaction chamber and grounding

                  electric field of the specified direction at the

                  back into the interior of the chamber. If tritium does
                  escape from the reaction chamber, it will mix with the
                  helium and then be removed from that inert gas by a
                  variety of ways when it is circulated as a heat

                  in the cavitation zone will be concentrated in the
                  zone by the flow of acoustical energy into that region
                  of the host liquid. A fundamental requirement that has
                  been placed on the acoustic field in this example of a
                  Type I CFR is that one pressure cycle consist of a
                  negative pressure of specified amplitude followed by a
                  positive pressure whose amplitude typically is twice
                  that of the negative pressure. Thus on an average the
                  pressure will be a maximum in the cavitation zone and
                  decrease with distance toward the wall of the chamber
                  11. There will thus exist a negative pressure gradient
                  in the liquid lithium. This pressure gradient will
                  cause the H-isotopes to diffuse toward the center of
                  the cavitation zone relative to the liquid metal. In
                  this manner the specified acoustic pressure field will
                  itself be used to help contain the tritium generated
                  in the cavitation zone, and thus meet a primary design
                  requirement. </big></small></p>

                  surface of the horn to the cavitation zone. Such flows
                  set up rotational patterns of convection that may also
                  help contain tritium in the cavitation zone. In a
                  given mode of operation, streaming or the negative
                  pressure gradient may be more effective in this
                  containment. Streaming can be eliminated by using
                  short burts of a few cycles of negative-positive
                  pressures while at the same time an average negative
                  pressure gradient is maintained. </big></small></p>

                  maximizes the production of tritium and other useful
                  products through thermonuclear fusion inside
                  collapsing bubbles. The bubbles contain H-isotopes and
                  vapor of the host metal and, in one mode of operation,
                  lithium vapor as well. In a Type II CFR fusion is
                  brought about by the high temperatures and pressures
                  caused by adiabatic compression of the bubbles'
                  contents in the terminal phase of collapse. The host
                  liquid is tin, although any one of the several
                  gamma-type metals such as indium, thallium or gallium
                  may be used. Characteristics of tin that make its
                  selection useful are its low vapor pressure over a
                  wide range of operating temperatures, the very low or
                  zero solubility of H-isotopes of hydrogen in the
                  liquid, and the instability of its hydrides in the

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The use of tin as
                  the host metal requires that its container be
                  surrounded by a layer or "blanket" of lithium or a
                  lithium-beryllium alloy in order to generate tritium
                  for use as a fuel. The blanket of Li or Li-Be will be
                  referred to hereafter as the Li-blanket for brevity.
                  The Li-blanket is separated from the host liquid by a
                  neutron moderator to be described below as part of the
                  reaction chamber. Tin has small collision and capture
                  cross sections for neutrons and the function of the
                  moderator is to reduce the energy of fast fusion
                  neutrons to the range where they have a high
                  probability of interacting with Li and Be and
                  producing tritium. The Li-blanket is at an operating
                  temperature at which removal of tritium is simply
                  effected by acoustic means. A low amplitude acoustic
                  field (as constructed with the high amplitude acoustic
                  field in the cavitation zone) applied to the
                  Li-blanket will cause any small aggregation of tritium
                  atoms to grow into bubbles that will rise to a surface
                  of the blanket or aggregate in specified regions as
                  described below. </big></small></p>

                  large, with equivalent radii of 10.sup.-3 to 10.sup.-2
                  cm. Although a variety of methods may be used to
                  introduce seeds into the host liquid, a specific
                  method will be described below. When such seeds are
                  introduced into the host liquid below a zero-gravity
                  field caused by an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the
                  seeds rise until they enter the zero-gravity region in
                  the cavitation zone. The seeds remain essentially
                  unchanged in the cavitation zone until they are caused
                  to expand and collapse by the applied acoustic
                  pressure field. A bubble may then either reform as a
                  seed in the cavitation zone and repeat the
                  expansion-collapse cycle or be ejected from the
                  cavitation zone by hydrodynamic forces or be released
                  by pulsing of the magnetic field. </big></small></p>

                  between deuterium nuclei generates both tritium in the
                  reaction chamber 61 and in the blanket 66 by reaction
                  of fusion neutrons. This initial distribution of
                  tritium is then renewed by reactions of Li and Be with
                  neutrons from fusion reactions in the collapsing
                  bubbles. The tritium generated in the blanket 66
                  aggregates into seeds, which are made to grow into
                  large bubbles by application thereto of a
                  low-amplitude acoustic field through the horns 40.
                  This field causes the seeds to grow by a process
                  called rectified diffusion, which forces tritium into
                  the bubbles. </big></small></p>

                  zero-gravity field is created, as above, by a
                  horizontal magnetic field, B*, in a small, central
                  region parallel to the horizontal axis of the magnetic
                  field. This zero-gravity field exists in the liquid
                  Li-blanket as well as in the liquid tin in the
                  reaction chamber 61. Tritium bubbles that form in the
                  blanket 66 above the zero-gravity field float to the
                  surface S-1, and those that form in or below the
                  zero-gravity field are trapped in it. By pulsing the
                  magnetic field at intervals, the trapped tritium is
                  released and floats to the surface S-1 where it is
                  removed by pumping. It may be used as fuel at another
                  fusion reactor or as shown in FIG. 3, it may be mixed
                  with deuterium by drawing it through pipe 73 to the
                  pump 72. At the pump it is mixed with deuterium and is
                  then used to seed the liquid tin in chamber 61 as
                  noted hereinafter. </big></small></p>

                  the blanket is helped by this high temperature. When
                  the magnetic field is pulsed, bubbles of deuterium and
                  tritium trapped in the cavitation zone also will be
                  released and will float to the surface S-2 of the host
                  liquid chamber 61, where the gases above the liquid
                  are removed by pumping through pipe 74 to the pump 72.
                  From the pump a mixture of tritium and deuterium is

                  in connection with the embodiment in FIGS. 1 and 2 can
                  be employed to supply acoustic power to the cavitation

                  II CFR at an elevated ambient pressure, p.sub.ln *,
                  makes it possible to use single negative pressure

                  by introducing fissile material such as thorium or

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In a Type I CFR
                  thermonuclear fusion occurs mainly between H-isotopes
                  dissolved in the host liquid. During collapse of a
                  bubble both its contents and a thin shell of liquid
                  surrounding it are compressed adiabatically. When the
                  bubble reaches its minimum radius, the interface
                  remains essentially at rest for an interval of the
                  order of 10 picoseconds (10.sup.-11 sec.). In this
                  interval the bubble radiates an intense shock wave
                  that compresses the liquid shell a second time.
                  Temperatures and pressures in the liquid behind the
                  shock are high enough to cause thermonuclear fusion of
                  the H-isotopes dissolved in the liquid metal. This
                  liquid shell in which fusion takes place is called the
                  "fusion shell". In the fusion shell behind the
                  expanding shock, thermonuclear fusion adds enough
                  energy to the liquid to maintain the strength of the
                  shock as it encloses an increasing volume of liquid.
                  Because the strength of the shock remains constant,
                  the temperature and pressure are the same throughout
                  this volume and thermonuclear fusion occurs at a
                  constant rate throughout this expanding sphere. When
                  the interface starts to move appreciably, it generates
                  a rarefraction wave that eventually destroys the
                  shock. In this second interval (also of the order of
                  10 picoseconds), in which the rarefraction wave is
                  overtaking the shock, the fusion shell still
                  propagates outward with a uniform rate of energy
                  production per unit volume but with a decreasing
                  thickness. However, the decrease is small in 10
                  picosec. </big></small></p>

                  host liquid is lithium. The operating temperature is
                  1200 K., the ambient pressure is taken to be one bar,
                  and a pressure, p.sub.v *+p.sub.h *, of 0.127 bar is
                  maintained over the surface of the liquid lithium
                  vapor and H-isotopes. The dissolved mole fraction,
                  Y.sub.t, of tritium is 0.05 and the dissolved mole
                  fraction Y.sub.d, of deuterium is 0.05 in the steady

                  the seed of this size is an arbitrary, but convenient,
                  choice because the exact amount of H-isotopes
                  initially in the very small seeds used in a Type I CFR
                  is irrelevant to the subsequent motion of the bubble.
                  Whatever the content of the seed, the pressure of
                  vapor and gas in the expanding bubble quickly reaches
                  the equilibrium value, p.sub.v *+p.sub.h *, determined

                  temperature in the liquid at the interface is
                  3.5.times.10.sup.7 K. and the density of the liquid at
                  the interface is 2.59.times.10.sup.3 gm cm. .sup.-3.
                  As the intense shock wave propagates outward in the
                  liquid with a strength p.sub.m * =3.50.times.10.sup.12
                  bars, fusion reactions between tritium and deuterium
                  in the lithium produce an amount of energy equal to
                  43.85 joules in the time interval of 10 picoseconds.
                  Hence the gain in energy released as heat over
                  mechanical energy supplied to the bubble is 25.06.
                  Hence, approximately, the energy gain is 25, even
                  though the mechanical energy absorbed has only
                  doubled. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The rate of energy
                  production in fusion reactions depends on the square
                  of the density of the medium as well as being a
                  complicated function of temperature, and it is the
                  large increase in density within the fusion shell of
                  the host liquid that makes these net gains in energy
                  produced possible. In both calculations of the energy
                  gain from a Type I CFR, the time interval during which
                  thermonuclear fusion takes place in the fusion zone
                  was in all probability underestimated by a factor of
                  at least two. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Studies of tritium
                  "breeding" in blankets of Li or Li-Be show for that
                  each neutron produced in the (t,d) reaction there will
                  be on an average up to two tritium nuclei produced by
                  reactions of the fusion neutrons with Li or Be nuclei.
                  Hence a reasonable multiplication factor for tritium
                  in the host liquid for a Type I CFR is 1.5 tritium
                  nuclei per fusion nuclei. This factor means that the
                  tritium produced in the host liquid more than replaces
                  the tritium used as fuel in the reaction chamber and
                  that only deuterium need be added to keep the process
                  in operation. The tritium remains in solution in the
                  liquid lithium until it is consumed by thermonuclear
                  reactions in the fusion shell of a collapsed bubble. </big></small></p>

                  above where the applied negative pressure is +200

                  2.06.times.10.sup.13 tritium nuclei or
                  3.4.times.10.sup.-10 mols of tritium. This amount of
                  tritium produced by a single cavitation event is that
                  contained in a bubble with an equivalent radius of
                  R*=10.sup.-2 cm. (as compared with the initial seed
                  with R.sub.n * =2.times.10.sup.-5 cm.). As noted, this
                  tritium will be dispersed in the liquid lithium until
                  another cavitation event consumes it as fuel. </big></small></p>

                  but in liquid lithium containing a mole fraction,
                  Y.sub.d, of deuterium alone, it is found that energy
                  produced by fusion is less than the mechanical work
                  done on the bubble in the expansion-collapse cycle.
                  Thus, when a positive pressure of +200 bars is applied
                  at the start of collapse, the ratio of energy
                  generated to mechanical energy absorbed is only 0.48.
                  However, each such cavitation event causes the
                  thermonuclear fusion of 2.64.times.10.sup.11 deuterium
                  nuclei. There are two channels for the (d,d) reaction:

                  equal probability of occuring. Thus fusion of four
                  d-nuclei produce one tritium nucleus and a neutron, in
                  addition to a proton and a helium-3 nucleus. Hence a
                  multiplication factor of 1.5 yields 2.5 tritium nuclei
                  for every four d-nuclei that undergo fusion. In this

                  that an inventory of tritium sufficient for steady

                  rapidly by operation of the reactor with deutrium
                  alone as fuel in the start-up phase. It is assumed
                  above that the cavitation event takes place in a zero

                  Type I CFR, the amount of energy generated by
                  thermonuclear fusion within the bubble is always
                  negligible compared with that released in the fusion
                  zone surrounding the collapsed cavity. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In summary,
                  operation of a Type I CFR is such that: </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>a. When a useful
                  gain of energy results from a cavitation event in a
                  Type I CFR, the work, W.sub.o *, done by the negative
                  pressure in expanding the bubble to its maximum
                  radius, R.sub.o *, is much less than the mechanical
                  work, W.sub.c *, done by the positive pressure during
                  collapse. Typically, the ratio of work done on the
                  bubble during collapse to work done during expansion
                  is of the order of 100. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>b. In a Type I CFR,
                  the mechanical work, W.sub.o *, done in expanding a
                  bubble from its initial radius, R.sub.n *, controls
                  the maximum radius, R.sub.o *, that it reaches. The
                  work, W.sub.o *, is chosen so that R.sub.o * is of the
                  order of 10.sup.-1 cm. or less and the expansion
                  ratio, R.sub.o */R.sub.n *, is of the order of
                  10.sup.3 or 10.sup.4. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>c. In a Type I CFR,
                  for a specified value of R.sub.o *, the mechanical
                  work, W.sub.c *, done on the bubble in collapse
                  controls the maximum pressures and temperatures
                  reached in the host liquid and in the bubble and hence
                  controls in fusion energy, E*, released in the
                  cavitation event. </big></small></p>
            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>d. A Type I CFR is
                  an amplifier whose output of fusion energy, E*, for a
                  single cavitation event of specified R.sub.o * is a
                  non-linear function of the mechanical input work,
                  W.sub.c *, that increases more rapidly than the third
                  power of W.sub.c *. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In a Type II CFR,
                  relatively large seeds of H-isotopes are used.
                  Typically, their initial radii are 50 to 100 times
                  larger than those used in a Type I CFR, and their
                  volumes are consequently 10.sup.5 to 10.sup.6 greater.
                  Larger seeds are required because fusion reactions in
                  a Type II CFR takes place mainly between H-isotopes
                  within bubbles and not in the liquid. Hence the amount
                  of H-isotopes in a seed places an upper limit on the
                  amount of energy that may be released in fusion
                  reactions caused by a collapsing bubble in a Type II
                  CFR. </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In a Type II CFR
                  there is a transition from isothermal to adiabatic
                  compression of the bubble contents during collapse and
                  it is this adiabatic compression that raises the
                  temperature and pressure within the bubble to values
                  where thermonuclear fusion takes place. The
                  temperature rise in the liquid could cause only a
                  negligible number of fusion reactions of H-isotopes in
                  the liquid (whose mole fraction in any event is very
                  small). </big></small></p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The host liquid in
                  a Type II CFR is normally a gamma-metal such as tin,
                  indium, gallium or thallium, which neither dissolve or
                  react with hydrogen in the temperature range of
                  interest. In the example of the operation of a Type II
                  CFR described here, however, the host liquid is
                  aluminum because its equation-of-state data have been
                  established experimentally well into the megabar
                  region of pressure. Aluminum closely resembles a
                  gamma-metal except that hydrogen does dissolve in it
                  freely. In this calculation, it was assumed that
                  aluminum acts like gamma-metal in all respects. </big></small></p>

                  H-isotopes introduced into the cavitation zone will
                  remain there. Because the host metal is a gamma metal,
                  the seed will not dissolve and, in the absence of an
                  acoustic field, a distribution of seeds remains
                  relatively stationary both in space and time. Another
                  consequence is that the gas content of a bubble
                  remains constant throughout the expansion and collapse

                  disclosure, both the specification of a Type I CFR and
                  discussion of the stability of the interface of a
                  collapsing bubble have assumed that at its maximum
                  radius a bubble is spherical in shape. The interface
                  of a spherical bubble is stable during expansion, but
                  is unstable during collapse, in the sense that a small
                  perturbation of the interface may grow. Several
                  methods have been described for inhibiting the growth
                  of such instabilities through creation of a
                  zero-gravity field within the cavitation zone of a

                  prevent destruction of a collapsing bubble's interface

                  described in the context of a Type I CFR; but it is to
                  be understood that it will apply equally as well as to

            <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>1. Rotation of the
                  host liquid in a cavitation zone around a vertical
                  axis. The rotation of the liquid metal may be induced
                  by "motor" action of an imposed, time-varing magnetic
                  field. A bubble on the axis of rotation will assume a
                  quasi-cylindrical shape because the rotation generates
                  an inward force in the liquid at the interface that is
                  a maximum at the equatorial circumference and a
                  minimum at the poles. 2. Superposition of static,
                  horizontal, uniform magnetic fields on the cavitation
                  zone. Such magnetic fields generate a distribution of
                  forces that has the same net effect as that created by
                  rotation of the host liquid. The directions of the
                  magnetic fields are distributed symmetrically about a
                  vertical axis through the cavitation zone. Each
                  magnetic field interacts with a collapsing bubble so
                  as to induce eddy currents in the liquid metal at the
                  interface. These currents in turn interact with the
                  magnetic field so as to oppose the inward motion. When
                  a number of such equally spaced magnetic fields of
                  equal magnitude are superposed, the net "drag" force
                  opposing the inward motion will be a maximum at the
                  poles and a minimum at the equatorial circumference.
                  The difference between the maximum and the minimum
                  forces increases with the number of superposed fields.
                  Hence the collapsing bubble will move inwardly more
                  rapidly at the equatorial circumference and will
                  assume a quasi-cylindrical shape. 3. Superposition of
                  high-frequency acoustic pressure fields on the
                  cavitation zone. The desired result may be brought
                  about by standing wave fields, pulses or a combination
                  of the two. In the arrangement to be described, the
                  radiation pressure of high-frequency, high-intensity
                  pulse trains is employed in order to achieve the
                  necessary field geometry. When a plane wave is
                  incident on a completely reflecting surface, such as a
                  bubble interface, a force called the radiation
                  pressure is exerted on the bubble interface.
                  Intersecting beams of high-frequency (of the order of
                  1 MHz, for example) pulse trains are generated by
                  transducers arranged symmetrically on the vertical
                  wall of the reaction chamber around the cavitation
                  zone so as to approximate a uniform inward force on
                  the bubble. After a low-frequency pressure field in
                  its negative phase expands a seed to a maximum radius
                  R.sub.o, pulse trains are simultaneously emitted by
                  the circular array of transducers. The vertical and
                  horizontal widths of any one beam are of the order of
                  magnitude of the diameter of tshe cavitation zone. The
                  bubbles will then be subjected to a radiation pressure
                  that is a maximum on the equatorial circumferences and
                  a minimum at the poles of the bubbles. Under this
                  force geometry the contracting bubble will become a
                  quasi-cylinder. At the same time, the low frequency
                  field will exert a uniform positive pressure on the
                  bubble. </big></small></p>

                  Abstract: Sonoluminescence is an off-equilibrium
                  phenomenon in which the energy of a resonant sound
                  wave in a liquid is highly concentrated so as to
                  generate flashes of light. The conversion of sound to
                  light represents an energy amplification of eleven
                  orders of magnitude. The flashes which occur once per
                  cycle of the audible or ultrasonic sound fields can be
                  comprised of over one million photons and last for
                  less 100 picoseconds. The emission displays a
                  clocklike synchronicity; the jitter in time between
                  consecutive flashes is less than fifty picoseconds.
                  The emission is blue to the eye and has a broadband
                  spectrum increasing from 700 nanometers to 200
                  nanometers. The peak power is about 100 milliWatts.
                  The initial stage of the energy focusing is effected
                  by the nonlinear oscillations of a gas bubble trapped
                  in the liquid. For sufficiently high drive pressures
                  an imploding shock wave is launched into the gas by
                  the collapsing bubble. The reflection of the shock
                  from its focal point results in high temperatures and
                  pressures. The sonoluminescence light emission can be
                  sustained by sensing a characteristic of the emission
                  and feeding back changes into the driving mechanism.
                  The liquid is in a sealed container and the seeding of
                  the gas bubble is effected by locally heating the
                  liquid after sealing the container. Different energy
                  forms than light can be obtained from the converted
                  acoustic energy. When the gas contains deuterium and
                  tritium there is the feasibility of the other energy
                  form being fusion, namely including the generation of
                  neutrons.</big></small></p>

                  Abstract: Cavitation nuclear reactors generally have a
                  reaction chamber within which the cavitation nuclear
                  reactions take place. Cavitation nuclear reactions are
                  driven by acoustic energy. In order to generate the
                  necessary acoustic energy, drivers are connected to
                  the reaction chamber. This new and improved system
                  utilizes two independent circuits to increase the
                  efficiency of the cavitationn nuclear reactors. One
                  circuit serves to remove the energy from the interior
                  of the reaction chamber at as high a temperature as
                  possible. The other circuit acts to cool downs the
                  drivers so as to allow the drivers to operate within
                  the optimal operating temperature range. </big></small></p>

                  and/or timed oscillations from piezoelectric
                  transducer, a harmonic spherical acoustic wave pattern
                  centered within the reaction chamber is created. This
                  wave pattern is created near a desired frequency and
                  centered in the sphere. The wave pattern contains a
                  central gaseous ball of high-density, pressure, and
                  temperature that causes ionization and radiation to

                  This spherical laser pulse acting on high pressure
                  high-density of the central standing wave produces

                  fluid in the enclosure to induce an acoustic standing
                  wave in the fluid. The dissolved alpha emitters
                  nucleate bubble clusters in the fluid as the fluid is
                  driven by the generator. Neutrons, tritium and/or
                  gamma rays, are emitted from the fluid, without or

                  nuclear fusion reactor includes a structure for
                  placing at least a portion of a liquid into a tension
                  state, the tension state being below a cavitation
                  threshold of the liquid. The tension state imparts
                  stored energy into the liquid portion. A cavitation
                  initiation source provides energy to the liquid
                  portion sufficient to nucleate at least one bubble
                  having a bubble radius greater than a critical bubble
                  radius of the liquid. A structure for imploding the
                  bubbles produces imploded cavities. The temperature
                  generated by the implosion process can be sufficient
                  to induce a nuclear fusion reaction involving the
                  liquid. A method for providing nuclear fusion tensions
                  a liquid, cavitates the tensioned liquid to form at
                  least one bubble, then implodes the bubble, wherein a
                  resulting temperature is generated that is sufficent
                  to induce a nuclear fusion reaction involving the
                  liquid.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Bubble fusion, also
                known as sonofusion, is the non-technical name for a
                nuclear fusion reaction hypothesized to occur during
                sonoluminescence, an extreme form of acoustic
                cavitation. Officially, this reaction is termed acoustic
                inertial confinement fusion (AICF) (see ICF) since the
                inertia of the collapsing bubble wall confines the
                energy, causing an extreme rise in temperature. The high
                temperatures that sonoluminescence can produce raise the
                possibility that it might be a means to achieve
                thermonuclear fusion.[1]</big></small></p>

                issue of the peer-reviewed journal Science, Rusi P.
                Taleyarkhan and colleagues at the Oak Ridge National
                Laboratory (ORNL) reported that acoustic cavitation
                experiments conducted with deuterated acetone (C3D6O)
                showed measurements of tritium and neutron output that
                were consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The
                neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with
                the sonoluminescence pulse, a key indicator that its
                source was fusion caused by the sonoluminescence.[3]</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Shock wave
                simulations seem to indicate that the temperatures
                inside the collapsing bubbles may reach up to 10
                megakelvins, i.e. as hot as the center of the
                Sun.[4][5][6][7] Although the apparatus operates in a
                room temperature environment, this is not cold fusion
                (as commonly termed in the popular press) because the
                nuclear reactions would be occurring at the very high
                temperatures in the core of the imploding bubbles.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The researchers used
                a pulse of neutrons in order to nucleate ("seed") the
                tiny bubbles, whereas most previous experiments started
                with small air bubbles already in the liquid. Using this
                new method, the team was able to produce stable bubbles
                that could expand to nearly a millimeter in radius
                before collapsing. In this way, the researchers stated,
                they were able to create the conditions necessary to
                produce very high pressures and temperatures. The
                sensitivity of the fusion rate to temperature, which is
                in turn a function of how small the bubbles get when
                they collapse, in combination with the likely
                sensitivity of the latter to fine experimental details,
                may account for the fact that some research workers have
                reported to see an effect, while others have not.</big></small></p>

                or tritium production. Taleyarkhan claims his interest
                in bubble fusion began following a post-dinner chat with
                a friend, Dr. Mark Embrechts, in 1995.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>These experiments
                were repeated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by D.
                Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh but using more sophisticated
                neutron detection equipment. They reported that the
                neutron release was consistent with random
                coincidence.[8] A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other
                authors of the original report said that the Shapira and
                Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant
                differences in experimental setup, including over an
                inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the
                sonoluminescing acetone. Taleyarkhan et al. report that
                when these differences are properly considered, the
                Shapira and Saltmarsh results are consistent with
                fusion.[citation needed]</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In addition, Galonsky
                has shown that by Taleyarkhan's own detector calibration
                the observed neutrons are too high in energy to be from
                a deuterium-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In a
                rebuttal comment, Taleyarkhan says the energy is
                "reasonably close" to that which is expected.[9]</big></small></p>

                BBC documentary series Horizon commissioned a
                collaboration between two leading sonoluminescence
                researchers, Seth Putterman and Ken Suslick, to
                reproduce Taleyarkhan's work. Using similar acoustic
                parameters, deuterated acetone, similar bubble
                nucleation, and a much more sophisticated neutron
                detection device, the researchers could find no evidence
                of a fusion reaction. This work was reviewed by a team
                of four scientists, including an expert in
                sonoluminescence and an expert in neutron detection, who
                also concluded that no evidence of fusion could be
                observed.[10][11]</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In 2004, new reports
                of bubble fusion were published by the Taleyarkhan
                group, saying that the results of previous experiments
                have been replicated under more stringent experimental
                conditions.[12][13] These results differed from the
                original results in that fusion was occurring for a much
                longer time frame than previously reported. The original
                report only showed neutron emission from the initial
                bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas
                this report showed neutron emission many acoustic cycles
                later. The data, however, was less than stringent
                insofar as too large a window of measurement was used to
                determine a coincidence between neutron emission and
                sonoluminescent light emission. Furthermore, the energy
                of the detected neutrons was not consistent with
                neutrons produced from a fusion reaction.</big></small></p>

                Taleyarkhan's students at Purdue University published
                evidence confirming the previous result. They used the
                same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid
                and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report,
                no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted.
                Once again, the neutron energies measured were not
                consistent with those of neutrons produced by a d-d
                fusion reaction.[14][15]</big></small></p>

                the midst of charges leveled at Taleyarkhan as regards
                his research standards, Dr. Edward R. Forringer and
                undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of
                LeTourneau University presented two papers at the
                American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting that reported
                replication of neutron emission during a visit to the
                meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University.
                Their experimental setup was similar to the preceding
                experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated
                acetone, deuterated benzene, tetrachloroethylene and
                uranyl nitrate. Notably, however, it operated without an
                external neutron source and used two types of neutron
                detectors. They claimed a liquid scintillation detector
                measured neutron levels at 8 standard deviations above
                the background level, while plastic detectors measured
                levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background.
                These measurements were within one standard deviation
                for the same experiment with a non-deuterated control
                liquid, indicating that the neutron production had only
                occurred during cavitation of the deuterated
                liquid.[19][20][21]</big></small></p>

                Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los
                Angeles to the effect that spectrum measured in these
                sonofusion experiments is consistent with radioactive
                decay of the lab equipment and hence does not reliably

                this new technology is the most appropriate focus going
                forward."[26][27] In order to verify that the
                investigation was properly conducted, House

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>On July 18, 2008,
                Purdue University announced that a committee with
                members from five institutions has investigated 12
                allegations of research misconduct by Rusi Taleyarkhan.
                It concluded that two allegations were foundedthat
                Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his
                work when in reality the apparent confirmations were
                done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as
                "independent" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that
                Taleyarkhan had included an additional colleague's name
                on one of his papers who had not actually been involved
                in the research ("the sole apparent motivation for the
                addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to overcome a
                reviewer's criticism," the report concluded). [30][31]
                Purdue University had previously said, in a press
                release in July 2005, that Butt's replication was
                independent from Taleyarkhan[32]</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Taleyarkhan appealed
                the conclusions in the report, but this was rejected. He
                said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial
                administrative issues and had nothing to do with the
                discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying
                science, and that "all allegations of fraud and
                fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without
                merit  thereby supporting the underlying science and
                experimental data as being on solid ground". [33]</big></small></p>

                expand and collapse tiny bubbles, generating ultrahot
                temperatures. At temperatures hot enough, atoms can
                literally fuse and release even more energy than when
                they split in nuclear fission, now used in nuclear power
                plants and weapons. Furthermore, fusion is clean in that

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Bubble fusion is
                related to the field of sonoluminescence (SL) where high
                temperatures are generally thought to explain the
                visible light observed in the collapse of bubbles in
                water under ultrasound, the high temperatures claimed as
                utility in initiating nuclear reactions and enhancing
                chemical reactions in sonochemistry. In sonochemistry,
                temperatures from 5,000 to 15,000 degrees are claimed
                while in bubble fusion the temperatures claimed exceed 2
                million degrees.</big></small></p>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> <small><big> </big></small>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>However by Le
                Chatelier?s principle, the water vapor in collapsing
                bubbles takes the minimum energy path in response to the
                decreasing volume by condensing to liquid instead of
                taking the higher path by increasing in temperature and
                pressure, as would be the case in a collapsing air
                filled bubble. Except for a small non-equilibrium
                effect, the water vapor in bubble collapse condenses
                with less than about a 60 C rise in temperature, and
                therefore claims of 5,000 to 15,000 degrees in
                sonochemistry are just as ludicrous as claims of 2
                million degrees in bubble fusion.</big></small></p>

                ALLEGATION OF MISUSE OF $250,000 OF SONOFUSION FUNDS</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Recently,
                consequences of the USPTO granting patents on false
                prior art center on the Nature article (Vol. 442, pp.
                230-231, 20 July 2006) that suggested that $250,000 of
                DARPA funds were misused by Putterman and Taleyarkhan in
                sonofusion research based on erroneous reasoning that
                the collapse of vapor bubble produces high temperatures.
                However, far more money has been spent on sonofusion
                (bubble fusion) over the last decade, most funded by the
                US taxpayer. To make matters worse, proponents of
                sonofusion have criticized Nature because of the
                allegation of misused funds. See ?Reich or Wrong ?
                Nature on the attack?,
                http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/propaganda/taleyarkhan.html</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>But sonofusion
                proponents are in serious error. Indeed, the entire
                notion of bubble fusion is a fraud played on the US
                taxpayer. Perhaps the greatest hoax in the history of
                science should instead be funded from the pockets of
                bubble fusion proponents such as Putterman,Taleyarkhan,
                and others.</big></small></p>

                even after they have been issued. Of interest here is
                that third party inventors are to be directly involved
                and allowed to introduce appropriate evidence in the
                reexamination process. See "Patent Quality Improvement:
                Post-Grant Opposition, Hearing before the Subcommittee
                on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property<br>
                of the Committee on the Judiciary House of
                Representatives." -<br>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>However, the pending
                legislation is harmless because it requires a patent
                review be made not later than nine months after the
                grant of the patent or issuance or a reissue patent, and
                therefore patents issued by the USPTO over the last half
                century would still remain as false prior art.</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Since 1970, the USPTO
                by accepting the erroneous explanation that the SL light
                was caused by high temperatures has awarded US patent in
                sonochemistry and bubble fusion on false prior art.</big></small></p>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> <small><big> </big></small>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>For example, the
                USPTO issued bubble fusion patent to Hugh Flynn of the
                University of Rochester in 1970. See US 4,333,796:
                "Method of generating energy by acoustically induced
                cavitation fusion and reactor therefor." More recently,
                the USPTO awarded American Technologies Group researcher
                Shui-Yin Lo a bubble fusion patent in 1997. In the same
                year, the USPTO on claims of bubble temperatures of 100
                million degrees granted Seth Putterman of UCLA a patent
                for a bubble fusion. See US 5,659,173: Converting
                acoustic energy into useful other energy forms.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>In March 2006,
                allegations of fraud in bubble fusion research by
                Taleyarkhan at Purdue University were reported. See
                "Purdue to Review Bubble Fusion" ?
                http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200603/1142567086.html
                . Not widely reported, however, was that the US patent
                office (USPTO) rejected Taleyarkhan's bubble-fusion
                patent application filed at Oak Ridge in 2002 on behalf
                of the Department of Energy (DOE). See "A sound

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>On 20 June 2006,
                Purdue University concluded their investigation of fraud
                allegations against Taleyarkhan saying, the ?matter will
                be handled as a confidential internal affair.? See

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>However, the Purdue
                statement avoids the larger problem that the USPTO
                issued bubble fusion and sonochemistry patents that
                remain outstanding even though neutrons have never been
                found in bubble fusion and sonochemical and bubble
                fusion reactor walls have never melted at claimed
                temperatures of 5,000 to 2 million degrees, and
                therefore the issued patents remain on the USPTO record
                as prior art from which any patent application based on
                an alternative explanation of the SL light is summarily
                rejected.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>On 25 September 2002,
                a First Patent Application 10/179,641 titled ?Cavity QED
                Devices? was filed that claimed SL was produced at
                ambient temperature by cavity QED induced EM radiation.
                On 23 October 2003, the USPTO rejected the First
                Application on the grounds of prior art that SL was
                produced at high temperature.</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>Because of the
                fraudulent reasons for rejection, an FCA action was
                filed in the DC court on 4 March 2004. However, on 19
                April 2005, the FCA case was transferred to the
                Alexandria court for lack of venue.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>On 6 May 2004 while
                the FCA litigation was pending in the DC court, a Second
                Patent Application 10/839,831 titled ?Cavity QED Induced
                EM Radiation? that differed from the First Application
                in that the concept of the presence of particles, which
                limited the minimum size of the QED cavity could reach
                when collapsing, was modified. On 20 May 2005, the USPTO
                summarily rejected the Second Application on the same
                false grounds as the First.</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>On 16 June 2005, the
                Alexandria court dismissed the FCA complaint on the
                grounds the action was taken in the name of the US
                government against the USPTO - another government
                agency, and as such is an action against itself. The
                dismissal of the FCA complaint was not disputed.</big></small></p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The Alexandria court
                also denied the motion for leave to amend the FCA
                complaint with a Bivens action that would have allowed
                the USPTO to be sued for damages. However, the proposed
                Bivens complaint, which was critical in order for the
                court to rule properly on the motion, was never
                transferred from the DC court. The grounds for the
                Alexandria court denying the motion for leave to amend
                were that the USPTO acted in an official capacity when
                they rejected the First and Second patent applications.

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>What this means is
                due process was violated because the Alexandria court
                proceedings commenced without ever receiving the
                proposed Bivens complaint as this document was never
                transferred from the DC court to the Alexandria court.</big></small></p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><small><big>The USPTO
                administrative remedy was to appeal the rejection to the
                Patent Appeals Board, but this would have been futile
                because the USPTO Director, one of the FCA defendants,
                chaired the Patent Appeals Board. Thus, the
                administrative remedy was a conflict of interest in that
                the USPTO was required to rule against itself, and
                therefore the FCA complaint was filed.</big></small></p>
