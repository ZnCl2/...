      <p>This photon-proton DC plasma generator is the first building
        block and lab device that will eventually create a small system
        of power development that can solve at full swope [sic] a host
        of world dilemmas, save the environment of planet earth and free
        mankind from energy needs, pollution, war, slavery and
        starvation. I have given to the world a heavenly gift for all
        people. – Norman L. Kellogg, USA. </p>

      <p><b>Norman L. Kellogg</b> of Garden Grove says he has developed
        a self-energizing generator capable of the perpetual production
        of electricity through an ingenious application of Tesla theory
        alignment of protons and photons. </p>
      <p>He says the module he has made will fit into the ordinary bread
        box, service panel or electric meter nest in the average
        residence and could produce enough electrocity to provide all
        its needs. </p>
      <p>Kellogg described it as a photon-proton plasma engine, or
        generator, which he said could produce at least 100 kilowatts of
        direct current electricity, which in turn could be converted to
        alternating current power --- the kind used worldwide ---
        through a rectifier. </p>
      <p>He envisioned that it could be developed to such refinement
        that it would be transportable to an automobile, plane, boat,
        mobile home, mountain cabin or farm to pump water and perform
        other chores. </p>
      <p>It would produce so much energy that man could purify his
        water, air and total environment, Kellogg declared, as well as
        supply his own needs. </p>
      <p>In short, he said, it could guarantee mankind’s survival in a
        world increasingly short of energy sources and raw materials. </p>
      <p>Kellogg warned that the world must find new ways to supply its
        needs, or mankind will perish. He said he thinks his
        self-energizing generator may be the answer, bu he conceded the
        need for refinements. </p>
      <p>The Kellogg device is fueled by a one-time charge of radon gas
        in a closed-circuit system and by another system through which
        is pumped liquid hydrogen. </p>
      <p>“Generation of electricity will be accomplished by the
        impingement of a specifically aligned field force on a similarly
        aligned conductive material such as copper”, Kellogg explained.
      </p>
      <p>He said the generator would never need recharging, would last
        indefinitely and would never get hot like other conventional
        generators. </p>
      <p>It has no moving parts, only the subatomic particles are in
        constant, quiet and undetectable motion, capable of generating
        electricity in direct proportion to the designed output size of
        the static generator, he said. </p>
      <p>The first physical unit was made for Kellogg by Pre-Val Co.,
        Inc., of Garden Grove, a high-precision machine shop that also
        makes space components. </p>
      <p>Kellogg, who set up a so-called “think center” for engineers,
        physicists, researchers, and other scientists, said he expects
        to refine the first module and hopes to interest universities,
        colleges and high schools in tackling the same goal. </p>
      <p>Kellogg said he developed the generator as “a humanity concept
        for out planet”, wants “not one cent of return”, and offered it
        to the United Nations to benefit the world’s inhabitants. </p>
      <p>He explained that Dr Nikola Tesla, the world-renowned
        physicist, had predicted at the turn of the century that there
        must be a breakthrough to solve the world’s energy needs. </p>
      <p>Tesla, who invented and developed the alternating current (AC)
        meter, the practical transmission of electric power and the
        fundamental principle of radio, said at that time: </p>
      <p>“Ere many generations pass, out machinery will be driven by
        power obtainable at any point in the universe. Is this energy
        static or kinetic? If static, our hopes are in vain; if kinetic
        (and this we know for certain), then it is a mere question of
        time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the
        very wheelwork of nature”, which he described as “a source so
        practical that the machinery to harness it will last for 500
        years and so basic that it will undo existing theories. </p>
      <p>“The initial costs will be relatively big. After that, hardly
        anything and unlimited power for the asking”. </p>
