        <p style="text-align: left;">Pavel Imris was awarded a US patent
          in the 1970s. The patent is most interesting in that it
          describes a device which can have an output pwer which is more
          than nine times greater than the input power. He achieves this
          with a device that has two pointed electrodes enclosed in a
          quartz glass envelope which contains xenon gas under pressure
          (the higher the pressure, the greater the gain of the device)
          and a dielectric material... </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The results from Test No. 24 where
          the gas pressure is a very high 5,000 torr, that the input
          power for each 40-watt standard fluorescent tubes is 0.9 watts
          for full lmap poutput. In other words, each lamp is working to
          its full specification on less than one-fortieth of its rated
          input power. However, the power taken by the device in that
          test was 333.4 watts which with the 90 watts needed to run the
          100 lamps, gives a total input electrical power of 423.4 watts
          instead of the 4,000 watts which would have been needed
          without the device. that is an output power of more than nine
          times the input power. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">From the point of view of any
          individual lamp, without using this device, it requires 40
          watts of electrical input power to give 8.8 watts of light
          output which is an efficiency of about 22% (the rest of the
          input power being converted to heat). In test 24, the input
          power per lamp is 0.9 watts for the 8.8 watts of light
          produced, which is a lmap efficiency of more than 900%. the
          lamp used to need 40 watts of input pwer to perform correctly.
          With this device in the circuit, each lamp only needs 0.9
          watts of input power which is only 2.25% of the original
          power. Quite an impressive performance for so simple a device!

        <p style="text-align: left;">You might also be interested in
          knowing about the Imris' circuit (US Patent # 3,781,601). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;http://tinyurl.com/9fc9f </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"An optical generator of an
          electrostatic field at light frequencies for use in an
          electrical circuit, said generator having a pair of spaced
          apart electrodes in a gas-filled tube of quartz glass or
          similar material with at least one condenser cap or plate
          adjacent one electrode and a dielectric-filled container
          enclosing the tube, the generator substantially increasing the
          electrical efficiency of the electrical circuit. . . . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An optical electrostatic generator
          which is effective for producing high frequencies in the
          visible light range of about 10^14 to 10^23 Hz. . . . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present optical electrostatic
          generator does not perform in accordance with the accepted
          norms and standards of ordinary electromagnetic frequencies. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The device can be used in a
          flourescent lighting circuit, with motors, flash lamps, high
          speed controls, laser beams, high energy pulses, electrostatic
          particle precipitation, chemical synthesis (such as ozone
          generation), and charging means for high voltage generators of
          the VandeGraph type, as well as particle accelerators. . . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The device removes the component of
          electricity which produces heat." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For flourescent lighting, Imris
          shorted the pins on the ends of the tubes, indicating that the
          filaments are not used, or necessary. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At higher pressures, the device
          becomes Over Unity.&nbsp; For instance, with a Xenon filled
          tube at 5,000 torr in a series circuit with 100 40 Watt
          flouresent lamps (with a single wire going to each end of each
          lamp), the optical generator pulls 332 Watts, with each lamp
          pulling 9 tenths Watt (at 5 Volts) for 3,200 lumens output
          (8.8 Watts) per tube - giving a total for the circuit of 880
          Watts output for 442 Watts input. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Description of the Illustrated
            Embodiments</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring to the drawings and to
          Figure 1 in particular, a low voltage circuit utilizing an
          optical electrostatic generator in accordance with the present
          invention is shown. As shown in Figure 1, a source of
          alternating current electrical energy 10 is connected to a
          lighting circuit. Connected to one tap of the power source 10
          is a rectifier 12 for utilization when direct current is
          required. The illustrated circuit is [provided with a switch
          14 which may be opened or closed depending upon whether or not
          direct or alternating current is desired. A switch 16 is
          provided and closed when the circuit requires alternating
          current, in which case switch 14 is open. When switch 16 is
          open and 14 is closed, the circuit is operating as a direct
          current circuit. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Extending from the switches 14 and
          16 is a conductor 18 which is connected to an optical
          electrostatic generator 20 in accordance with the present
          invention. The conductor 18 is passed through an insulator 22
          and connected to an electrode 24. Spaced from the electrode 24
          is a second electrode 25. Enclosing the electrodes 24 and 25,
          which preferably are of tungsten metal or similar materials,
          is a quartz glass tube 26 which is filled with an ionizable
          gas 28 such as xenon. The gas may be of any other suitable
          ionizable gas such as argon, krypton, neon, nitrogen or
          hydrogen, as well as the vapor of metals such as mercury or
          sodium. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Surrounding each end of the tube 26
          and adjacent to each electrode 24 and 25 are condenser plates
          30 and 32 in the form of caps. A conductor is connected to
          electrode 25 and passed through a second insulator 34.
          Surrounding the tube, electrodes and condenser caps is a metal
          envelope in the form of a thin sheet of copper or other metal
          such as aluminum. The envelope 36 is spaced from the
          conductors leading into and out of the generator by means of
          the insulators 22 and 34. The envelope 36 is filled with a
          dielectric material such as transformer oil, highly purified
          distilled water, nitrobenzene or any other suitable liquid
          dielectric. In addition, the dielectric may be a solid such as
          ceramic material with relatively small molecules. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A conductor 40 is connected to
          electrode 25, passed through insulator 34 and then connected
          to a series of fluorescent lamps 42 which are arranged in
          series connection. It is the lamps 42 which will be the
          measure of the efficiency of the circuit containing the
          optical electrostatic generator 20. A conductor 44 completes
          the circuit from the fluorescent lamps to the tap of the
          source of the electrical energy 10. In addition, the circuit
          is connected to a ground 46 by means of another conductor 48.
          The envelope 36 is also grounded by lead 50 and in the
          illustrated diagram lead 50 is connected to the conductor 44.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The condenser caps or plates 30 and
          32 form what will be called in this specification a ‘relative
          condenser’ with the discharge tube. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There is an oscillation effect
          between the ionized gas in the discharge lamp and the metallic
          envelope 36 forming what shall be called an ‘absolute
          condenser’ in this specification. The oscillation effect
          between the ionized gas and the envelope 36 will be present if
          the condenser caps are eliminated but the efficiency of the
          electrostatic generator will substantially decreased. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The face of the electrode can be
          any desired shape. However, a conical point of 60 degrees has
          been found to be satisfactory and it is believed to have an
          influence on the efficiency of the generator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, the type of gas
          selected for use in the tube 26 as wall as the pressure of the
          gas in the tube also effect the efficiency of the generator,
          and, in turn, the efficiency of electrical circuit. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To demonstrate the increased
          efficiency of an electrical circuit utilizing the optical
          electrostatic generator of the present invention as well as
          the relationship between gas pressure and electrical
          efficiency, a circuit similar to that shown in Figure 1 may be
          used with 100 standard 40 watt, cool-white fluorescent lamps
          arranged in series. The optical electrostatic generator
          includes a quartz glass tube filled in with xenon, with series
          of different tubes being used because of the different
          pressures tested. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Set forth in Table I is the data
          obtained relating to the optical electrostatic generator. In
          Table II the lamp performance and efficiency for each of the
          tests set forth in Table I is shown. The following is a
          description of the data set forth in each of the columns of
          the Tables I and II. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The design of the tube construction
          for use in the optical electrostatic generator of the type
          used in Figure 1 may be accomplished by means of considering
          the radius of the tube, the length between the electrodes in
          the tube and the power across the tube. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If we let R be the minimum inside
          radius of the tube in centimeters, L the minimum length in
          centimeters between the electrodes, and W the power in watts
          across the lamp the following formula may be obtained from
          Table I: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">R =&nbsp; Current [A] / Current
          Density [ A / mm^2 ] / 3.14 </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">L = 8R </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">W = L ( V / cm ) A </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For example. For Test No. 18 in
          Table I, the current is 0.1818 A (column F), the current
          density 0.000353 A/mm^2 (column E), and the voltage
          distribution is 122.8 V/cm (column D); therefore </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">R = 0.1818A / 0.000353 A/mm^2 /
          3.14 </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">L = ( 12.80 mm ) ( 8 ) = 102.4 mm
          or 10.2 cm </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">W = ( 10.2 cm ) (122.8 V/cm ) (
          0.1818 A ) = 227.7 VA or 227.7 Watts </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The percent efficiency of operation
          of the fluorescent lamps in Test No. 18 can be calculated from
          the following equation: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">% Eff. = ( Output Energy ) / (
          Input Energy ) x ( 100 ) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Across a single fluorescent lamp,
          the voltage is 60 V and the current is 0.1818 A; therefore,
          the input energy to the lamp 42 is 10.90 W. The output of the
          fluorescent lamp is 3,200 lumens which represent 8.8 W power
          of light energy. Thus, one fluorescent lamp is operating
          at&nbsp; 80.7% efficiency under these conditions. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, when the optical generator
          is the same as described for Test No. 18 and there are 100
          fluorescent lamps in series in the circuit, the total power
          input is 227.7 watts for the optical electrostatic generator
          and 1.000 watts for 100 fluorescent lamps or a total of 1,318
          watts. The total power input normally to operate the 100
          fluorescent lamps in a normal circuit would be 40 watts tie
          100 or 4,000 watts. Thus, by using the optical generator in
          the circuit, about 2,680 watts of energy are saved. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Table I is an example of the
          functioning of this invention for a particular fluorescent
          lamp ( 40 watt, cool-white ), however, similar data can be
          obtained for other lighting applications by those skilled in
          the art. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Figure II a circuit is shown
          using an optical electrostatic generator 20a similar to
          generator 20 of Figure 1. In generator 20 only one condenser
          cap 32a is used and it is preferably of triangular
          cross-sectional design. In addition, the second electrode 25a
          is connected directly by a conductor back into the return
          conductor 52. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This arrangement is preferably for
          very high voltage circuits and the generator is particularly
          suited for direct current usage. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Figure 2, common elements have
          received the same number indicators as in Figure 1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Figure 3, still another
          embodiment of an optical electrostatic generator 20b is shown.
          This generator is particularly suited for use with alternating
          current circuits. In this embodiment the condenser plates 30b
          and 32b have flanges 54 and 56 extending outwardly towards the
          envelope 36. While the utilization of the optical
          electrostatic generator has been described in use in a
          fluorescent lighting circuit, it is to be understood that many
          other types of circuits may be used. For example, the high
          voltage embodiment may be useable in a variety of circuits
          such as flash lamps, high speed controls, laser beams, and
          high energy pulses. The generator is also particularly useable
          in a circuit including electrostatic particle precipitation in
          air pollution control devices, chemical synthesis in
          electrical discharge systems such as ozone generators, and
          charging means for high voltage generators of the Van de Graff
          type, as well as particle accelerators. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To those skilled in the art many
          other uses and circuits will be apparent. </p>
