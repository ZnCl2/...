        The invention refers to a process and an installation for
        increasing the burning energy of a natural fuel gas upon burning
        the same for domestic or industrial purposes. The process
        claimed by the invention for increasing the burning energy
        produced by the natural fuel gas is characterized in that it
        comprises the steps of supplying the natural gas into a
        treatment chamber confined by a <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">cylindrical-shaped wall made up of a diamagnetic
          material</span>, in front of which some <span

          a spiral shape</span>, of said electromagnetic units the
        terminal ones are diametrically opposed relatively to the
        longitudinal vertical axis of the chamber, to create a rotating
        magnetic field which acts on the gas with only one polarity, in
        the conditions in which a rotating thermal field created by the
        cores of the electromagnetic units maintained at a temperature
        between 31 DEG C ...; 65 DEG C acts simultaneously on the gas,
        thereby an energy transfer being ensured from the zero
        fluctuations of the vacuum towards the natural gas mass passing
        in an upward flow through the said chamber, before entering the
        chamber, the gas being pre-heated and having a temperature
        ranging between 18 DEG C ... 30 DEG C, and in the end, the gas
        thus treated is directed towards a burner.; Installation claimed
        by the invention, for applying the process used for increasing
        the burning energy produced by the natural gas, based on the
        action of a magnetic field upon the gas is characterized in that
        it consists of a reactor [A] equipped with some electromagnetic
        units (1) and with a heat circuit [B], the heat circuit [B]
        comprising a tank (R) for the oil used as a thermal medium which
        heats the natural gas, wherein a number of electric resistors
        are placed in order to heat the oil, a pump (P) for handling the
        oil, an oil cooler (E) and a circuit for the transport of the
        oil from the tank (R) to the electromagnetic units (1) of the
        reactor (A), as well as an electric panel [C] for the power
        supply of the reactor [A], and some conduits [D] for the
        transport of the natural gas.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br>
        <br>
        [0001] The invention refers to a process and an installation for
        increasing the burning energy of a natural fuel gas upon burning
        the same for domestic or industrial purposes.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] There are known a process and a device, as disclosed in
        the U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,183, for increasing the efficiency of
        the natural fuel gas. The process comprises supplying the
        natural gas into an inlet chamber, at the bottom of a first
        housing, passing the natural gas through a plurality of holes
        grouped within several spaced arrays on a distributor plate in
        the inlet chamber into a magnet chamber having a plurality of
        sets of vertically arranged magnets, placed in front of the hole
        arrays, each of them producing a magnetic flux which acts on the
        natural gas in order to magnetically treat the natural gas
        passing through the sets of magnets, thereafter, the natural gas
        is discharged from the magnet chamber at its upper side, and an
        inlet chamber located at the bottom of the second housing is
        supplied with this gas, said inlet chamber is located downstream
        from the first housing, wherein the natural gas passes, through
        a plurality of holes grouped within several spaced arrays on a
        distributor plate in the second housing, into another magnet
        chamber in the second housing which has a plurality of sets of
        vertically arranged magnets placed in front of the holes arrays,
        each of them producing a magnetic flux which acts on the natural
        gas passing upwards through the sets of magnets, and which has
        undergone a magnetic field treatment in the first magnet
        chamber, in the end, the natural gas thus treated is supplied to
        a burner wherein the combustion of the gas takes place.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] The device for increasing the efficiency of the fuel
        consisting of a natural gas comprises a natural gas source, a
        first housing containing a first inlet chamber at the lower side
        of the said first housing, the said natural gas source
        communicating with the first inlet chamber for supplying natural
        gas thereto, a first magnet chamber in the first housing being
        located downstream from the first inlet chamber, said magnet
        chamber having a plurality of sets of vertically arranged
        magnets for applying a magnetic flux to the natural gas flowing
        upwards through the magnets, said first inlet chamber and the
        first magnet chamber being separated from each other by a
        distributor plate having a plurality of spaced holes extending
        in a plurality of spaced arrays for supplying the natural gas
        into the first magnet chamber, a second housing being located
        downstream from the first housing and having a second inlet
        chamber communicating with the first chamber wherein the sets of
        magnets in the first housing are placed, so that the natural gas
        thus treated be supplied into the second housing, a second
        magnet chamber in the second housing being located downstream
        from the second inlet chamber, a plurality of sets of vertically
        arranged magnets being in this magnet chamber for generating a
        magnetic flux which is applied to the treated natural gas
        passing upwards therethrough, the second inlet chamber and the
        second magnet chamber being separated from each other by means
        of a distributor plate provided with a plurality of holes
        grouped in a plurality of spaced arrays and extending on the
        entire plate surface for supplying the second magnet chamber
        with the treated natural gas flowing through the sets of
        magnets, the treated gas being discharged from the second magnet
        chamber and directed towards a burner located downstream from
        the second magnet chamber, for combusting the treated natural
        gas.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The disadvantages of the process and the device consist
        in that each set of ring-shaped magnets generates a magnetic
        field producing an axial magnetic field resultant which
        determines a reduced action on the increase of the natural gas
        molecule energy, if the temperature of the natural gas passing
        through the sets of magnets is not correlated with the zero
        fluctuations of the vacuum, fact that determines the increase of
        the burning energy. As the gas energy increase is relatively
        low, several modules for the gas treatment in series have to be
        mounted, in order to ensure, under these circumstances, the
        correlation between the gas mass and the magnetic flux treating
        the natural gas.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] The technical problem solved by this invention consists
        in ensuring some optimum conditions for increasing the burning
        energy of the natural fuel gas under the circumstances of an
        optimum correlation between the physical-chemical factors which
        achieve this increase of energy, namely, between the magnetic
        field action and the thermal field action upon the moving
        natural gas molecule.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] According to the invention, the process eliminates the
        disadvantages shown before in that it comprises the steps of
        supplying the natural gas, which natural gas can preferably be
        methane, through a treatment chamber confined by a
        cylindrical-shaped wall made up of a diamagnetic material, in
        front of which some electromagnetic units are placed in a spiral
        shape, of said electromagnetic units the terminal ones are
        diametrically opposed relatively to the longitudinal vertical
        axis of the chamber, thereby creating a rotating magnetic field
        which acts on the gas with only one polarity, under the
        circumstances in which a rotating thermal field created by the
        cores of the electromagnetic units maintained at a temperature
        in a range between 31[deg.] C. and 65[deg.] C. acts
        simultaneously on the gas, thereby an energy transfer being
        ensured, from the zero fluctuations of the vacuum towards the
        mass of natural gas passing upwards through the said chamber,
        before entering the chamber, the gas being pre-heated and having
        a temperature between 18[deg.] C. . . . 30[deg.] C. and in the
        end, the gas thus treated is directed towards a burner.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] Within this process, the electromagnetic units can be
        supplied with electric power having the same intensity, if
        parallelly connected, or different intensities if serially
        connected, with decreasing values in the direction of the
        natural gas flow through the treatment chamber; situation in
        which <span style="font-weight: bold;">the value of the
          magnetic field ranges between 0.1 and 0.8 T</span>, each
        electromagnetic unit being maintained at the same temperature
        ranging between 31[deg.] C. and 65[deg.] C.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] According to the invention, characteristic to the process
        is also the fact that the magnetic flux provided by the core of
        each electromagnetic unit has a value ranging between<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> 0.03 W . . . 0.228 W</span>,
        irrespective of the connection in series or parallel of the
        electromagnetic units.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] According to the invention, the installation for
        increasing the burning energy produced by the natural fuel gas,
        wherein the said process is applied, comprises a reactor
        provided with some electromagnetic units and with a heating
        circuit which consists of a tank for storing the oil used as a
        thermal medium for heating the natural gas, in said tank there
        being placed a number of electric resistors for heating the oil,
        a pump for handling the oil, an oil cooler and a circuit for
        transporting the oil from the tank to the electromagnetic units
        of the reactor, as well as an electric panel for the power
        supply to the reactor and several natural gas transporting
        pipes.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] Another characteristic of the invention consists in that
        the electromagnetic units which are arranged about a pipe made
        up of a diamagnetic material have several metal cores in contact
        with the pipe wherethrough the pre-heated natural gas passes,
        said cores being arranged on stages each comprising three units,
        each stage being rotated relatively to the previous stage by an
        angle ranging between 70[deg.] and 73[deg.], so that a complete
        rotation of 360[deg.] between the first and the last stage be
        achieved, the electromagnetic units being positioned by their
        being inserted into a number of holes of a thermally insulating
        support.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] Another characteristic of the invention consists in that
        each electromagnetic unit has a metal core placed into an
        electric coil, a heat exchange tank having the role of
        maintaining the electromagnetic unit at a constant temperature,
        and a series of electrical connection ends.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] Another characteristic of the invention consists in the
        fact that, inside the heat exchange tank, the oil used as a
        thermal medium is introduced through a supply pipe and is taken
        over therefrom through a discharge pipe, said pipes having equal
        diameters, but the length of the supply pipe being longer than
        the length of the other pipe, the ratio between these lengths
        being in the range between 2 and 2.5, all the heat exchange
        tanks being serially connected through the supply pipe of one
        unit and the discharge pipe of the following unit.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] Another characteristic of the invention consists in that
        the ratio between the diameter of the pipe passing through the
        reactor and the conduit for the natural gas supply connected
        therewith is between 3 and 6.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] The process and the installation have the following
        advantages:<br>
        <br>
        they achieve the increase of the burning energy of the natural
        gas so that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">heat yield
          upon combusting the natural gas increases by minimum 12%</span>,
        without any further supply of fuel material;<br>
        <br>
        they <span style="font-weight: bold;">lower the quantity of
          noxious substance and of carbon monoxide</span> in the flue
        gases;<br>
        <br>
        the installation is highly reliable as it uses electromagnets;<br>
        <br>
        the installation is adaptable to any type of natural fuel gas
        consumer;<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">the ratio between the electric
          power consumed for operating the reactor and the supplementary
          energy extracted from the zero fluctuations of the vacuum is
          of maximum 1/24</span>;<br>
        <br>
        the installation has a compact structure.<br>
        <br>
        [0021] There is given hereinafter an example of carrying out the
        process and the installation claimed by the invention, in
        connection with the FIGS. 1-12, which represent:<br>

        [0034] The installation for increasing the burning energy
        produced by the natural gas comprises a reactor A and a heat
        circuit B. The heat circuit comprises a tank R for the oil used
        as a thermal medium which heats the natural gas, wherein there
        are placed a number of electric resistors, not shown in figures,
        for heating the oil, an oil cooler E; a pump P to push the oil,
        a circuit not shown in the figures for the transport of the oil
        from the tank R to a series of electromagnetic units 1 in the
        reactor A. There is also an electric panel C for the electric
        power supply of the pump P, and several conduits D for the
        transport of the natural gas.<br>
        <br>
        [0035] The reactor A comprises the units 1, which are preferably
        18 in number, being geometrically arranged three by three on a
        stage, situation in which each stage is rotated relatively to
        the previous stage by an angle of 72 degrees. The units 1 are
        arranged inside a thermally insulating support 3, preferably
        made up of wood, each being positioned in one of the holes 4.
        Each unit 1 has a metal core 6, whose surface is in direct
        contact with a vertical pipe 2 made up of a diamagnetic
        material, which confines a treatment chamber a.<br>
        <br>
        [0036] An electromagnetic unit 1 comprises a metal core 6, an
        electric coil 8 used as a source of generating a magnetic field.
        The coils 8 of the units 1 are power supplied through a number
        of connecting ends 11, preferably arranged on three rows,
        connected in parallel, to six coils 21 serially connected within
        the wiring diagram of the electric panel C. Each unit 1 is
        equipped with a heat exchange tank 7 having the role of
        maintaining the unit 1 at a constant temperature ranging between
        31[deg.] C. and 65[deg.] C. By maintaining the unit 1 at the
        working temperature, there is greatly increased the probability
        of connection between the magnetic field produced by the metal
        core 6 placed inside the coil 8, and the magnetic momentum of
        spin of the zero pairs. The oil used as a thermal medium flows
        inside the tank 7, being introduced thereinto through a supply
        pipe 9, and wherefrom it is taken over by a discharge pipe 10.<br>
        <br>
        [0037] The pipes 9 and 10 have equal diameters, but the pipe 9
        is longer than the discharge pipe 10, the ratio between their
        lengths being of 2-2.5, so as to have a swirling flow of oil
        inside the tank 7, fact that leads to a uniform heating or
        cooling of the electromagnetic unit 1. The oil takes over the
        heat in excess or brings a heat uptake in the case of a
        temperature lower than the working temperature, such operations
        being necessary for maintaining the unit 1 at the working
        temperature. The pipe 9 of a unit 1 is connected to the pipe 10
        of the following electromagnetic unit 1, in the succession of
        the 18 units 1, thereby achieving the series connection of all
        18 tanks 7, so that the oil pushed by the pump P could pass
        successively therethrough.<br>
        <br>
        [0038] The circuit B provides the heating of the oil through the
        heating resistors placed inside the tank R wherein the oil is
        stored. At the same time the cooling of the oil can also be
        carried out by its being passed through the oil radiator E. The
        pumping of the oil into the tanks 7 of the 18 units 1 is
        achieved by means of the pump P through the conduits D, which
        carry out both the oil supply of the electromagnetic units 1 and
        the transfer of the oil discharged therefrom.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] The oil transport circuit comprises thermally insulated
        conduits D which make the series connection of the tanks 7 in
        the 18 electromagnetic units 1 with the oil tank R by means of
        the pump P which carries out the oil flow in closed-circuit. The
        oil radiator E for cooling the oil is located within the oil
        transport circuit and is driven only when there is necessary to
        discharge the heat in excess, as a consequence of exceeding the
        working temperature.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] The electric panel C carries out the electric power
        supply by means of a rectifier 20 which supplies electric power
        at a required voltage for generating the magnetic field to all
        the 18 units 1. Also, the electric panel C provides the power
        supply of the electric resistors inside the tank R, as well as
        the power supply needed for driving a ventilating unit that the
        cooler E is equipped with, in order to cool the oil and to drive
        the pump P. In order to maintain the 18 electromagnetic units 1
        at an established working temperature, a thermocouple 17 for the
        oil and a thermocouple 18 for the units 1 are provided, together
        with a number of relays 16 for driving the pump P supplied with
        electric power from the electric panel C. From a central unit 14
        there are actuated the power supply and the disconnection of the
        relays 15 and 16, of the thermocouples 17, 18 and 19, and of the
        rectifier 20, in order to maintain the units 1 at the working
        temperature by correlating the values of the temperature
        parameters given by the thermocouple 17 for the oil and by the
        thermocouple 18 set in each electromagnetic unit 1. The central
        unit 14 also controls the power supply of the electric resistors
        in the tank R and the pump P when the temperature of the
        electromagnetic units 1 is lower than the temperature needed for
        the reactor A. Through these controls, the oil is heated in the
        tank R by means of the electric resistors, and circulated
        through the heat circuit by means of the pump P, thereby getting
        into the tanks 7 of the units 1, fact that leads to the heating
        of the metal core 6, which thus reaches the optimum temperature
        needed for the connection with the zero fluctuations of the
        vacuum for increasing the burning energy released upon the
        combustion of the gas treated in the reactor A. The central unit
        14 also controls the cooling of the units 1 by ceasing the power
        supply of the electric resistors when the thermocouple 18
        records a higher temperature than the temperature needed in the
        reactor A. By flowing the oil inside the cooler E and by
        starting-up the cooling ventilating unit, the oil is cooled,
        releasing the heat in excess taken over from the units 1 through
        the heat exchange tanks 7, outside the reactor A. Thus, the
        units 1 are cooled and their temperature is lowered up to
        reaching the working temperature of the reactor A, when the zero
        vacuum energy can be extracted for increasing the burning energy
        produced by the natural gas flowing through the reactor A. The
        heating and the cooling of the electromagnetic unit 1 is
        achieved in an optimum time interval when the heated or cooled
        oil, as the case may be, is introduced into each tank 7 through
        the pipe 9 and is discharged through the pipe 10, thereby
        achieving a swirling flow without high temperature gradients
        inside the electromagnetic unit 1.<br>
        <br>
        [0041] In the situation when the electromagnetic units 1 are
        supplied with electric power having the same or different
        intensities according to their being connected in series or in
        parallel, the decreasing values of the magnetic field can be
        ensured, in the flowing direction of the natural gas through the
        treatment chamber confined within the pipe 2, in said situation,
        the value of the magnetic field being between 0.1 . . . 0.8 T,
        each electromagnetic unit being maintained at the same
        temperature ranging between 31[deg.] C. . . . 65[deg.] C.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] In this situation, the magnetic flux is ensured by the
        core 6 of each electromagnetic unit 1, which has a value ranging
        between 0.030 . . . 0.228 Wb, irrespective of the connections in
        series or in parallel of the electromagnetic units 1.<br>
        <br>
        [0043] The series or parallel connections of the electromagnetic
        units 1 should preferably be carried out in series in hot
        weather (in summer, respectively), and in parallel in cold
        weather (in winter, respectively).<br>
        <br>
        [0044] The coil 8 provides, by means of the core 6, a continuous
        magnetic field outside thereof.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] This field is necessary for the operation of the
        electromagnetic unit 1 in order to balance, in the area adjacent
        to the diamagnetic pipe 2, the magnetic momentum of the zero
        pairs occurring upon the vacuum fluctuation. By providing the
        connection between the magnetic field of the electromagnetic
        unit 1 maintained at the working temperature of the reactor A,
        and the magnetic momentum of the zero vacuum pairs, there
        becomes possible the extraction of energy which is added to the
        energy of the natural gas molecule passing through the pipe 2.<br>
        <br>
        [0046] The natural gas path consists of a conduit crossing the
        oil tank R, which makes a pre-heating of the natural gas, the
        pipe 2 which passes axially through the reactor A, crossing a
        hole 5 cut in the support 3 for the electromagnetic units 1. The
        pipe 2 carries out the natural gas exposure to the physical
        action of the electromagnetic units 1, being in direct contact
        with the ends of the metal cores 6, and it is connected to the
        pre-heated gas conduit through a supply connection 12. A
        connection 13 for the outlet of the natural gas achieves the
        connection between the diamagnetic pipe 2 and the natural gas
        burners not shown in figures.<br>
        <br>
        [0047] For example, upon the combustion of the natural gas,
        there are obtained about 8125 Kcal/m&lt;3&gt;-heat in the
        conditions of an optimum air-gas mixture. By the extraction of a
        part of the zero vacuum energy in the reactor A, the heat
        obtained from the combustion can be increased up to 11375
        Kcal/m&lt;3&gt;, this increase implicitly leading to the
        reducing of the gas consumption.<br>
        <br>
        [0048] Due to the fact that the zero fluctuations of vacuum take
        place in a medium with a controlled constant thermal gradient,
        they have a duration tending towards the maximum possible
        duration, so that, within the vacuum, the existence of the
        particle-antiparticle pairs leads to the occurrence of a metric
        fluctuation to the effect that the distance between two points
        oscillates about a maximum external average value.<br>
        <br>
        [0049] The occurrence and the disappearing of the
        particle-antiparticle pairs lead to space oscillations. Because
        of this fact, there exists a metrics fluctuation at the quantum
        level of the space, to the effect that the distance between two
        points oscillates about an average value. According to the
        Heisenberg principle, these fluctuations have an extremely short
        existence.<br>
        <br>
        [0050] Within an atom having energy levels very well-established
        by the quantum mechanics formalism, the displacements of the
        energy levels of the electrons in the atom due to the zero
        fluctuation of the vacuum are emphasized by the Lamb effect.<br>
        <br>
        [0051] Formally, the fluctuation of the spatial metrics modifies
        the eigen values of the energy levels for the layers of
        electrons within the atoms, the Srodinger equation having in
        this case a dynamic aspect. These changes within the energy
        spectrum of the electrons inside the atoms last for an extremely
        short period of time, according to the life time of the zero
        fluctuations of the vacuum, the possible energy in excess
        released within an exothermal chemical reaction being
        imperceptible.<br>

        [0052] The electromagnetic units 1 produce a polarization of the
        zero vacuum pairs. The particle-antiparticle pairs occurring in
        vacuum according to the Heisenberg principle, have magnetic
        momentum of spin. By means of the action of the magnetic field
        produced, the electromagnetic units 1 cause the spin of these
        particle-antiparticle pairs to remain blocked in a spatial
        region coinciding with the diamagnetic pipe 2 wherethrough the
        natural gas passes. The heating of the electromagnetic units 1
        to the working temperature leads to achieving a powerful
        connection between the magnetic field of the electromagnetic
        units 1 and the spin of the zero pairs which occur within the
        vacuum fluctuations. By increasing the life time of the zero
        pairs in the conditions of maintaining a constant value of the
        temperature gradient, the metrics of the space is stabilized for
        a relatively long period of time, sufficient for the atoms
        comprised in the natural gas composition to modify their own
        levels of energy upon their passing through this zone. The
        natural gas molecule includes this energy in excess caused by
        the modification of the metrics inside the reactor A and carries
        the same onto the path inside the pipe 2, this energy in excess
        being released within the chemical reactions of combusting the
        natural gas.<br>
        <br>
        [0053] While applying the process within the installation
        claimed by the invention, in compliance with the relation (1),
        the energy balance is met by the conservation of the total
        energy during the operation of the installation:<br>
        <br>
        [0000]<br>
        Q(+)=E(vacuum)-B(u.e.m.)-e. (1)<br>
        <br>
        [0000] where:<br>
        Q(+) is the supplementary energy obtained relatively to the
        classical reaction of oxidizing the natural gas;<br>
        E (vacuum)-the energy consumed for making the vacuum to
        fluctuate This energy is spent at a cosmic scale;<br>
        B (u.e.m.)-the electric power consumed for obtaining the
        magnetic field within the electromagnetic units of the reactor;<br>
        e-the energy used by the installation for other operations:
        cooling the oil, heating the oil, setting the oil pump into
        operation and the like.<br>
        The ratio between the supplementary caloric energy obtained and
        the electric power consumed by the reactor is given by the
        relation (2)<br>
        <br>
        [0000]<br>
        Q(+)/{(B(u.e.m.)+e}=24/1. (2)<br>
        <br>
        [0058] An increase of the gas burning energy takes place in the
        reactor A, by the action of the 18 electromagnetic units 1 which
        are maintained during their operation at a certain working
        temperature. The natural gas is introduced into the installation
        through the gas conduit at a pressure within 2.5 . . . 3.5 bar,
        the conduit crosses the tank R, thereby achieving a pre-heating
        of the tank to the working temperature of the reactor A,
        thereafter it undergoes an expansion within the diamagnetic pipe
        2. The ratio between the diameter of the pipe 2 passing through
        the reactor A and the conduit D connected therewith for the
        natural gas supply ranges between 3 . . . 6. The natural gas
        slows down its transport speed inside the diamagnetic pipe 2,
        remaining for 1-2 seconds under the action of the 18
        electromagnetic units 1 which determine the modification of the
        quantum energy levels of the molecules. The electromagnetic
        units 1 are brought to the working temperature through the
        action of the heated oil passing through the tanks 7 and carry
        out the energetic addition within the gas molecule by freezing
        the space metrics at a quantum level and extracting the zero
        vacuum energy. After the gas gets out of the diamagnetic pipe 2,
        it is handled towards the burners, where the caloric excess
        caused by the extraction of a part of the zero energy of the
        vacuum is pointed out. By increasing the caloric power, the new
        quantity of gas to be burnt is smaller than in the situation
        when the natural gas does not include a part of the zero energy
        of the vacuum that is extracted in the reactor A.<br>
        <br>
        [0059] Thereby, the invention ensures an important economy of
        natural gas, leading to the substantial reduction of the energy
        expenses. The invention is liable of being standardized to the
        effect that it can be sized for any natural gas flow rate chosen
        for the technological heating processes. The gases resulting
        from the process of combusting the natural gas, when this is
        processed from a quantum point of view within the installation,
        have a small carbon monoxide content as compared to the usual
        processes of combustion in thermochemistry.<br>
        <br>
        [0060] The installation for increasing the caloric power of the
        natural gas employs the electric power to operate, consequently
        it is not electromagnetically polluting, it does not release
        noxious substances into the environment, it is carried out by
        using usual materials, it is secure and easy to use and to
        maintain. The ratio between the electric power consumed for
        operating the reactor A and the supplementary energy extracted
        from the zero fluctuations of the vacuum is 1/24. The
        large-scale application of the installation can lead to lowering
        the heating expenses for the population during the winter, fact
        that, from a social viewpoint, can be a real advantage. Its
        application in industry can lead to sensitive reductions of the
        energy expenses for the energy-consuming production sectors and
        implicitly to the reduction in price of certain products
        destined to the market.<br>
