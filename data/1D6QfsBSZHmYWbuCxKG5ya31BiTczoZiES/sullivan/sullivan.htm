        <p><b><font size="+1">Current Has Many Applications</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Previously, there were two types of currents used to deliver
        electrical power. Direct Current (DC) that comes from your
        battery in your automobile discovered by Ben Franklin in the
        1700’s and Alternating Current (AC) that was discovered by
        Nikola Tesla and is used to power your home. Clear Energy, Inc.,
        a small R&amp;D company in Baltimore, Maryland has been issued
        US Patent number 7,041,203 for a new electrical current. It has
        been over 100 years since the last patented electrical current
        was issued by the US Patent Office for Alternating Current (AC).
        Alternating current (AC) is described as electric current that
        flows for an interval of time in one direction and then in the
        opposite direction; that is, a current that flows in alternately
        reversed directions through or around a circuit. The polarities
        of electrodes or conductors are constantly swapping polarities
        when the current changes direction. Direct current (DC) is
        described as electrical current that flows in one direction, and
        does not reverse its polarities as alternating current does. The
        electricity produced in (DC) batteries is direct current. The
        Plus (+) and Minus (-) polarities of electrodes remain constant
        and never swap. But, what would happen if you have a polarity
        reversal within the (+) positive and (-) negative electrode
        without swapping the polarity of the supply voltage. The result
        is a new electrical current called Sully Direct Current or
        (SDC)™ named after its inventor John T. Sullivan. Sully Direct
        Current (SDC) ™ is described as electrical current that flows
        for an interval of time in one direction and then in the
        opposite direction; that is, two or more current paths flowing
        in alternately reversed directions within a constant (+) Anode
        and (-)Cathode circuit. The plus (+) and minus (-) supply
        polarities of electrodes remain constant same as a (DC) battery,
        the polarities within the electrodes of the circuit are
        reversing causing an alternating reversing multi-directional
        currents. Alternating Current (AC) and (SDC) ™ both have current
        reversal, (AC) changes (+) anode and (-) cathode supply polarity
        when it changes current direction (SDC) ™ changes current
        direction without swapping the (+) anode and (-) cathode supply
        lines. Sully Direct Current (SDC)™ can reverse currents at full
        voltage or zero volts to produce tuned counter EMF forces and
        magnetic field reversals. One limiting factor in efficient
        creation of hydrogen in electrolysis is the attraction created
        between Hydrogen and Oxygen gas bubbles to electrodes, “they
        stick like tiny magnets increasing resistance of electrodes”
        thus reducing gas production. As the SDC current changes
        direction within an inductive coil, the directions of the
        magnetic fields reverse creating multidirectional forces on the
        electrodes and ions. A tuned resonator circuit can creates
        vibrations on the electrodes; this action shakes the electrodes
        and significantly increases the release of the hydrogen bubbles
        resulting in more efficient production of pure Hydrogen and
        Oxygen. It would not be feasible to use (AC) to create this
        mechanical action; the gases would mix as polarities are swapped
        creating an unstable mixed gas. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract: </b>Multi-directional currents are generated in a

        and to increase the light output of a cold cathode light tube,
        to name just a few of the potential applications for the

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to multi-directional, reciprocating
        electrical currents. The invention also relates to an apparatus
        and method for generating the multi-directional currents, and to
        applications of the generating apparatus and method. </p>
      <p>The multi-directional currents of the invention are generated
        in a current carrying medium by cyclically reversing the
        direction of a conventional current applied to at least one of a
        plurality of electrodes, so that an electromotive force (EMF)
        pulse travels from one side of the at least one electrode to the
        other, changing the direction of current flowing through the
        medium between two or more electrodes. </p>
      <p>The multi-directional electric currents have the effect of
        accelerating processes that rely on interaction between a
        current and the medium that carries the current, and of
        eliminating asymmetries that can lead to scaling or premature
        wear in batteries and other electrolytic systems. The medium
        that carries the multi-dimensional currents may be an
        electrolyte, gas, gel, semiconductor, or any other medium
        capable of carrying current between two electrodes, and having
        at least two dimensions so as to enable variation in the current
        direction. </p>
      <p>By way of example and not limitation, the multi-directional
        electrical currents of the invention may be used to (i) increase
        the efficiency of hydrogen generation by electrolysis of water
        (while at the same time preventing scaling and purifying the
        water), (ii) extend the life of batteries such as nickel-metal
        hydride cells, and of capacitors, by symmetrically charging and
        discharging the batteries or capacitors, (iii) provide a power
        source for electromagnetic projectile weapons and similar
        devices, and (iv) increase the efficiency of plasma generation
        or light conversion in cold cathode systems. </p>
      <p>Other potential applications of the multi-directional electric
        currents of the invention, and of the apparatus and method for
        generating the currents, include computers, communications, drug
        and chemical development, medical treatment of cancers,
        anti-gravity experiments, transportation, energy, water
        treatment, genetic research in humans, plants, and animals, and
        aeronautical propulsion systems, as well as fuel cell and PEM
        electrolysis systems utilizing proton exchange membranes and
        catalyst materials. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of Related Art</b> </p>
      <p><b>A. Basic Principle of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The basic principle underlying the multi-directional currents
        of the invention may be understood from FIGS. 1A 1B. FIG. 1A
        shows the situation when electrode currents i.sub.E1 and
        i.sub.E2 in electrodes E1 and E2 are initially reversed,
        creating EMF or voltage pulses, edges, waves, or spikes that
        travel from left to right in the top electrode E1 and from right
        to left in the bottom electrode E2. The current i.sub.S between
        the electrodes flows from the top electrode E1 to E2, but
        changes direction as the current i.sub.S follows the respective
        EMF pulses or voltage spikes as they propagate from left to
        right through electrode E1 and from right to left through
        electrode E2. Eventually, as shown in FIG. 1B, the current flows
        from top right to bottom left, at which point the currents in
        the respective electrodes are again reversed to cause EMF or
        voltage pulses, waves, edges, or spikes to propagate in the
        opposite direction. As a result, the current i.sub.S can be
        caused to reciprocate or continuously change direction in an
        oscillating or cyclical manner within the current-carrying
        medium between the electrodes. If i.sub.E1 and i.sub.E2 are DC
        currents, the electrodes can be kept at a constant potential so
        that the net current direction remains constant even though the
        instantaneous current direction changes continuously or
        periodically, enabling the direction-changing current i.sub.S to
        be used in electrolytic processes that require direct current.
        Alternatively, i.sub.E1, and i.sub.E2 may be alternating
        currents, pulsed DC currents, or polarity-reversing DC currents.
        In addition, a similar but smaller variation in the direction of
        current will occur if the direction-reversing conventional
        current is applied to just one of the electrodes and the second
        electrode has a relatively small area. </p>
      <p>The invention may thus be characterized as a method and
        apparatus of generating multi-directional currents in a medium
        by reversing the direction of electron flow in at least one of a
        pair of electrodes. If the voltages applied to the electrodes
        are DC voltages, then the multi-directional currents have
        characteristics of DC currents, and if the voltages applied to
        the electrodes are two or three phase AC voltages, then the
        multi-directional currents have characteristics of AC currents.
        However, unlike conventional DC and AC currents, the currents
        generated by the method and apparatus of the invention move or
        rotate. If the electrodes are one-dimensional wires, then the
        currents rotate in two-directions. If the electrodes themselves
        move, or extend over two or three-dimensions, for example a
        plane or a curved plane, then the currents will move in
        three-dimensions. </p>
      <p><b><i>B. Conventional Electric Currents</i></b> </p>
      <p>There are two types of conventional electrical currents and
        corresponding voltages, neither of which changes direction in
        the manner of the present invention. The first, direct current
        (DC), was already well known when Benjamin Franklin performed
        his famous kite experiment in 1752 to prove that lighting was a
        form of electricity, while the second, alternating current, came
        into widespread use after Nikola Tesla invented the first
        alternating current motor in 1888 (U.S. Pat. No. 555,190). </p>
      <p>Both direct and alternating voltages can be applied to
        electrodes for the purpose of causing a current to flow through
        a medium between the electrodes. However, the voltages are
        conventionally applied across the electrodes so that the
        resulting inter-electrode current follows a fixed, albeit
        reversible, path between the electrodes, irrespective of the
        type of medium or geometry of the electrodes. This is clearly
        the case in systems having only a single terminal for each
        electrode, and in systems having multiple terminals but no
        switching circuit. </p>
      <p>It is of course possible to periodically reverse the polarity
        of currents applied to the electrodes in such a system, and a
        number of systems have been proposed for doing so, including the
        systems disclosed in the patents discussed below. However, none
        of the previously proposed systems involves changing the
        direction of current in a single one, or both, of the electrodes
        so as to vary the direction of current flowing between the
        electrodes by other than 180.degree.. </p>
      <p>The invention in its broadest form consists of the
        above-described multi-directional currents, and apparatus and
        methods for generating the currents. However, an important
        aspect of the invention is the numerous applications in which
        the unique properties of the multi-directional currents may be
        exploited. These applications include, but are not limited to,
        the following: </p>
      <p><b><i>C. Hydrogen Generation by Electrolysis of Water</i></b> </p>
      <p>One of the applications of the invention is electrolysis of
        water to generate hydrogen, or hydrogen and oxygen, for use in
        fuel cells and other essentially pollution-free hydrogen-driven
        power sources. This application is of particular importance
        because it offers a solution to the problem of generating,
        storing, and transporting the hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen fuel cells, in particular, have the potential to
        provide a completely non-polluting power source of electricity,
        not only for vehicles but also for electricity generation in
        general, but have been limited by lack of a safe distribution
        system for the hydrogen, and by the costs of generating the
        hydrogen in the first place. While it has long been known that
        hydrogen may be generated by applying a direct current to water,
        the rate of hydrogen generation is too low to provide a
        practical hydrogen source for mass distribution. As a result,
        hydrogen for mass consumption is currently produced from fossil
        fuels at relatively high energy costs relative to the energy
        value of the hydrogen produced. However, if sufficient hydrogen
        could be produced by water electrolysis to provide an on-board
        hydrogen generator for a vehicle or electric power plant, so as
        to generate just enough hydrogen to supply the fuel cells, then
        the need for a distribution system and hydrogen storage would be
        eliminated. </p>
      <p>Power or propulsion systems that use water electrolysis in
        combination with hydrogen fuel cells to generate the hydrogen
        necessary to power the fuel cells are known as regenerative
        electrochemical cell or systems, an example of which is
        disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2002/0051898.
        Despite their theoretical promise, however, similar systems have
        yet to offer a practical alternative to fossil fuels. It is
        believed that a regenerative system can only attain widespread
        acceptance if the efficiency of hydrogen production is
        increased. The multi-directional currents of the invention offer
        the potential for providing such an increase in water
        electrolysis efficiency. </p>
      <p>The way that the invention increases water electrolysis
        efficiency is by using the applied electric current to not only
        pull the water molecules apart at the cathode, as in a
        conventional electrolysis system, but to add a shearing force
        that helps break apart the ionic bonds between the oxygen and
        hydrogen atoms. The effect is similar to separating a pair of
        magnets by sliding them perpendicularly rather than pulling them
        apart. In conventional electrolysis, the water molecules tend to
        align with the positive and negative electrodes in the manner
        illustrated in FIG. 2, so that the ionic bonds are at a constant
        angle of 54.74.degree. relative to the direction of current
        flow. This is not the optimal angle for breaking the ionic bonds
        and disassociating the hydrogen atoms from the oxygen atoms. In
        the set-up illustrated in FIG. 3, on the other hand, the
        molecules are subject to a continuously changing current
        direction, which applies both tensile and shearing forces to the
        molecules, substantially increasing the rate of disassociation.
        In addition, the electrodes can be arranged in coils to add
        magnetic forces that further expedite disassociation. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the set-up illustrated in FIG. 2 does not
        reverse the polarities of the electrodes, which would only slow
        the electrolysis process due to energy lost in flipping the
        water molecules. The multi-directional currents are not
        alternating currents, but rather in this embodiment are direct
        currents. Systems that reverse the polarities of electrodes have
        previously been used in electrolysis, but the currents are
        uni-directional and the reversals are carried out at relatively
        long intervals so that the effect is that of a conventional DC
        current. The purpose of the reversals is to reduce scaling by
        switching between anodic and cathodic reactions at the
        respective electrodes. This can also be accomplished with the
        present invention, by reversing the polarities of the electrodes
        in addition to reversing current directions in the individual
        electrodes. Examples of electrolysis apparatus (though not
        necessarily a hydrogen generating water electrolysis apparatus)
        that reverse DC potential between two electrodes are disclosed
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,258,250, 6,174,419, and 1,402,986, and in
        U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2002/0074237. </p>
      <p>Periodic reversal of the polarities of electrodes has also been
        used in electrolytic water purification systems. The
        periodically reversed currents can be used to directly destroy
        bacteria as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,710, or to expedite the
        release of electrolytic reaction by-products such as metal ions,
        as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,241,861; 5,062,940; 4,908,109
        (entitled "Electrolytic Purification System Utilizing Rapid
        Reverse Current Plating Electrodes"); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,734,176;
        4,525,253; and 3,654,119. </p>
      <p>These systems are not to be confused with the system of the
        invention, which changes the direction of currents but does not
        necessarily change their polarity. However, the effects of the
        direction-reversing currents, and/or released ions, on bacteria
        and other micro-organisms can be utilized and even increased by
        the present invention, i.e., the currents of the present
        invention can be used not only for electrolysis of water to
        generate hydrogen, but also to purify the water. Unlike the
        currents disclosed in the water purification references, which
        cannot be used for hydrogen generation, the present invention
        combines generation of hydrogen with water purification so that,
        for example, a power plant that included hydrogen generation
        cells supplied with river water would also have the effect of
        cleaning the river water, serving as a source not only of
        electricity but also of potable water. </p>
      <p><b><i>D. Charging of Nickel-Metal Hydride Foam Batteries</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>Although especially useful for water electrolysis, the present
        invention is not limited to a particular electrolyte,
        electrolytic process, or electrolytic cell configuration. In
        another application of the invention, the multi direction
        currents of the invention are applied to the electrodes of a
        battery containing an electrolyte. This application of the
        invention takes advantage of the reversing currents in the
        electrodes to reduce the wear and tear of friction and heat
        caused in conventional batteries by current moving from one post
        down the length of the electrode. </p>
      <p>In the case of batteries containing nickel metal hydride, as
        disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,670, additional advantages of
        using the method and apparatus of the invention to charge the
        battery an increase in the hydrogen generated during the
        charging process, which may be captured by utilizing the
        principles of the gas capture system described in copending U.S.
        patent application Ser. No. 10/314,987 filed on Dec. 10, 2002 by
        the present inventor now U.S. Pat. No. 6,890,410. Furthermore,
        the use of multi-directional currents may improve the ability of
        the foam to absorb hydrogen through the hydride substrate in a
        manner analogous to shaking of a screen to expedite passage of
        granular materials. </p>
      <p><b><i>E. Capacitors</i></b> </p>
      <p>The apparatus and method of the invention can also be applied
        to capacitors and capacitive systems, which have similar
        fundamental problems of fast charging heat losses and discharge
        heat wear. </p>
      <p>An example of capacitive systems to which the principles of the
        invention may be applied are the thrust generating systems
        disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,317,310, 3,022,430, and 2,949,550,
        which use the electrostatic force between asymmetric capacitor
        plates to generate a thrust force. The EMF voltage spikes
        utilized by the present invention amplify the high voltage as
        the current changes direction to improve thrust performance. In
        addition, the magnetic field switching multi-directional high
        voltage currents may be computer controlled on the surface of
        the capacitor module's thrust plates or thrust tubes to change
        the direction and speed of the module, and the polarity of the
        currents may be controlled to change the direction of thrust.
        Thrust, pitch, roll, and yaw can be controlled by multiple such
        capacitor modules. </p>
      <p><b><i>F. Cold Cathode Light and Plasma Generators</i></b> </p>
      <p>The principles of the invention are not limited to electrolyte
        materials, but may be applied to any medium capable of carrying
        charges between a pair of electrodes, including not only
        electrolytes, but also gases, gels, and semi-conductors. For
        example, when applied to a cold cathode light, reversing the
        current direction in the electrodes to change the direction of
        the excitation current between the electrodes will cause the
        ionized gas to produce more electrons, and thereby produce a
        brighter glow. </p>
      <p>Similarly, in systems that generate plasma by passing a gas
        between electrodes, the multi-direction currents of the
        invention will increase the rate of plasma production relative
        to direct current systems, and those that use a single electrode
        polarity reversing switch applied to a single terminal on each
        of the electrodes of the plasma generator, as disclosed in U.S.
        Pat. No. 6,222,321. </p>
      <p><b><i>G. Electro-Magnetic Devices</i></b> </p>
      <p>According to Lenz's law, a changing electrical current
        generates a magnetic flux having a magnitude that is
        proportional to the rate of change of the current. In the
        present invention, which utilizes reversing direct currents in
        the electrodes, the energy resulting from the above-described
        EMF or voltage pulses, edges, waves, or spikes can also be
        utilized to generate a corresponding magnetic field, which in
        turn can be used to drive a projectile in an electromagnetic
        gun, or a piston. </p>
      <p>In addition, such systems can be made regenerative by capturing
        hydrogen generated during charging and using the hydrogen to
        power a fuel cell, which in turn charges a battery for
        accumulating energy to be supplied to the electrode coils when
        the weapon is fired or the piston is to be operated. </p>
      <p><b><i>H. Computing Devices</i></b> </p>
      <p>By adding two inputs and outputs to the conventional
        electrolytic cell, the apparatus of the invention may also be
        used in logic circuits and computing devices. U.S. Pat. No.
        3,172,083 discloses an electrolytic memory utilizing three
        electrodes, but each electrode only has a single input, and thus
        the resulting storage cell has no advantage over conventional
        silicon memory devices. </p>
      <p><b><i>I. Medical Devices</i></b> </p>
      <p>The multi-directional currents of the invention may also be
        applied to a variety of medical devices, including x-ray
        machines and various devices for treating tissues by electrical
        currents and/or magnetic fields. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is accordingly a first objective of the invention to provide
        an apparatus and method that utilizes electricity in a more
        efficient manner in order to conserve energy resources and
        protect the environment. </p>
      <p>It is a second objective of the invention to provide an
        improved electrical current generating apparatus and method
        which accelerate electrolytic and cathodic processes, including
        generation of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>It is a third objective of the invention to provide an improved
        electrical current generating apparatus and method capable of
        more efficiently sterilizing water. </p>
      <p>It is a fourth objective of the invention to provide an
        improved electrical current generating apparatus and method
        capable of more efficiently charging a battery. </p>
      <p>It is a fifth objective of the invention to provide an improved
        electromagnetic device capable of utilizing the counter-EMF
        generating upon reversal of an electric current. </p>
      <p>It is a sixth objective of the invention to provide a
        multi-dimensional electrical current having the property of
        changing direction as it flows from one electrode to the other,
        with or without changes in polarity. </p>
      <p>It is a seventh objective of the invention to provide a system
        and method for generating a direct current that changes current
        direction with at least two ground switching paths and two
        positive connections in a parallel switching relationship back
        and forth, in phase or out of phase. </p>
      <p>It is an eighth objective of the invention to provide a direct
        current that changes directions while the polarity of the
        electrodes changes back and forth. </p>
      <p>It is a ninth objective of the invention to provide an
        alternating current with a sine wave in a parallel relationship
        with earth ground or neutral which switches from one end to the
        other to control the direction of current from the ground or
        neutral. </p>
      <p>These objectives are achieved, in accordance with the
        principles of a preferred embodiment of the invention, by
        providing an apparatus having at least two spaced electrodes, a
        current carrying medium between the electrodes, and at least two
        terminals at each end of each of the electrodes, for a total of
        at least four terminals, to which a direction-reversing direct
        or alternating current is applied. </p>
      <p>The electrodes may have a variety of shapes, including wires,
        coils, planar, or curved structures. The direction reversal may
        be effected by an electromechanical switching network, solid
        state, photonic or mechanical switches, and so forth, including
        the current reversing circuitry disclosed in the above-cited
        patents. In addition, the currents applied to the electrodes may
        include alternating as well as direct currents, the present
        invention being distinguished in that the current reversing
        circuitry is applied to opposite ends of at least one, and
        preferably each, of the two electrodes, so that reversal of the
        currents occurs within the electrodes, as opposed to within the
        current carrying medium between the electrodes (although, as
        described below, the direction of the multidirectional current
        within the current carrying medium may also be reversed by
        switching the polarity of the electrodes in addition to reversal
        of the current within the electrodes). </p>
      <p>In the case of an electrolytic process, the multidirectional
        currents have the effect of substantially increasing the
        efficiency by which bonds in the electrolyte are broken, thereby
        providing an enhanced electrolysis method for producing
        hydrogen, oxygen, and other gases, and at the same can be
        arranged to purify the remaining electrolyte. </p>
      <p>When the electrodes are in the form of coils, then a magnetic
        field is generated that may further accelerate certain
        electrolytic processes such as the generation of hydrogen, with
        or without using the multi-directional currents. While the
        advantages of multi-directional currents apply to coil-shaped
        electrodes, advantages may also be obtained by operating
        electrolytic cells and other devices with coil-shaped electrodes
        in DC, pulsed DC, reversing polarity, and AC modes, in addition
        to various multi-directional current modes. </p>
      <p>The new types of currents and corresponding voltages can be
        used to power a new generation of batteries, capacitors, motors,
        light bulbs, and plasma generators, as well as for hydrogen and
        oxygen generation, and further may be applied to applications
        ranging from electroplating of metals and plastics to
        transportation, to name just a few of the potential
        applications. In the field of medicine, the currents can be used
        in x-ray machines, to destroy cancer cells by placing a patient
        inside a coil to which the currents are supplied at frequencies
        known to kill cancer cells without affecting non-cancerous
        tissue, and in other devices that involve application of
        electrical currents and/or magnetic fields to tissues. DNA
        electrophoresis can be performed by using ADC instead of DC by
        running DNA gel samples from both ends of the gel plate instead
        of one. 46% of the planet's population doesn't have electricity
        or fresh drinking water due to the cost of infrastructure
        required to supply power lines and water connections. The new
        clean and cheap voltages (which may be referred to as SULLY
        VOLTAGES.TM. after the Inventor, John Sullivan) will
        revolutionize third world countries by supplying cheap power and
        fresh drinking water without petroleum based fuel oil. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 4 </b>illustrates an apparatus 1 which utilizes the
        principles of the invention to generate hydrogen and oxygen
        according to a first preferred embodiment of the invention. The
        apparatus 1 includes a tank 2, water supply 3, two electrical
        conductors 4,5 which form electrodes corresponding to electrodes
        E1 and E2 of FIGS. 1A and 1B for an electrolysis process, two
        conventional DC current sources 6,7, and four switches SW1 SW4.
      </p>
      <p>The water 8 in this example may include a catalyst such as KOH,
        as is conventional, although the increased efficiency of the
        electrolysis process of the invention makes it possible to use
        ordinary tap water or water from rivers and lakes without adding
        additional catalysts. </p>
      <p>When switches SW1 and SW4 are closed and switches SW2 and SW3
        are open, current flows from the positive electrode of power
        source 6 through switch SW1 to conductor 4, and then is carried
        by ions in the water 8 to conductor 5, switch SW4, and the
        negative electrode of power source 7. On the other hand, when
        switches SW2 and SW3 are closed and switches SW1 and SW4 are
        open, current flows from the positive electrode of source 7
        through switch SW3 into conductor 4, and then is carried by ions
        in the water to conductor 5, through switch SW2, to the negative
        terminal of power source 6. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that there may be a delay between
        opening of switch pairs SW1,SW4 and closure of switch pairs
        SW2,SW3, although simultaneous switching is preferred. In
        addition, the power sources and switching circuitry is not
        limited to the illustrated batteries and switches, but rather
        may include any power sources and switching circuitry capable of
        effecting reversal of currents within the individual electrodes,
        including solid state switching circuitry and rectified AC power
        sources. The illustrated diodes 14 and 15 are not essential, and
        may be omitted or replaced by appropriate voltage regulation,
        filtering, or other circuit elements. </p>
      <p>The ionic current passing through the water from conductor 4 to
        conductor 5 causes disassociation of hydrogen from oxygen in the
        water according to the well-known process of electrolysis.
        Optionally, the oxygen (O.sub.2) produced in the process may be
        trapped by a membrane 10 encircling conductor 4 for collection
        through an outlet 11 and storage tank 12, while hydrogen
        (H.sub.2) is collected via an outlet 13. </p>
      <p>Variations in the direction of current passing through the
        water subjects the individual water molecules to shearing as
        well as tensile forces that expedite disassociation. In
        addition, different types of microorganisms are known to be
        sensitive to specific frequencies of electrical current, and
        therefore switching of the applied conventional currents at an
        appropriate frequency can have the effect of purifying the water
        remaining in the tank. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows the electrical currents present at various places
        in the apparatus of FIG. 4. Timing of the switches may be
        controlled by a clock pulse illustrated in FIG. 4(a). FIGS. 4(b)
        to 4(e) show the currents through switches SW1 SW4,
        respectively, while FIGS. 2(f) and 2(g) show the respective
        voltages at terminals E1 and E2 between switches SW1,SW4 and
        conductors 4,5. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows a variation of the electrolytic hydrogen generator
        of FIG. 4, in which the electrodes E1 and E2 are in the form of
        coils 16,17. According to the well-known right hand rule, a
        magnetic field is generated in the coils 16,17 having a
        direction corresponding to the direction of current input to the
        coils. These fields shift position as they follow the incoming
        and reversing currents, creating a magnetic vortex that further
        accelerates disassociation of the water molecules. As
        illustrated in FIG. 6, only hydrogen (H.sub.2) is collected,
        although of course oxygen may also be collected as necessary,
        for example by "bagging" one of both of the electrodes 16,17 in
        a membrane 10, in the manner illustrated in FIG. 4, or the
        electrodes may otherwise be separated by a porous barrier to
        prevent arcing and trap products of the anodic reaction.
        Alternatively, the coils 16',17' may be coaxially arranged, as
        illustrated in FIG. 7, so that the net magnetic fields will
        cancel out, even though the instantaneous magnetic fields will
        still change. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the magnetic fields generated in
        the embodiments of FIGS. 6 and 7 have advantages apart from the
        advantages resulting from reversal of the currents in the
        electrodes, and therefore the apparatus of this is embodiment is
        not intended to be limited to multi-directional current
        generation. Instead, it is within the scope of the invention to
        apply DC, pulsed DC, reversing polarity, and AC voltages, as
        well as various multi-directional currents, to the coiled
        electrodes, and to cause the magnetic fields to synchronously or
        non-synchronously reverse polarities and/or directions, with the
        fields either reinforcing each other or cancelling out. </p>
      <p>The magnetic fields generated by the coaxial coil electrolytic
        cell apparatus of FIG. 7 are capable of generating a substantial
        gas flow even when the medium between the coils 16',17' is
        ordinary tap or distilled water, at coil spacings of between
        0.005 and 0.500 inches, and preferably between 0.050 and 0.200
        inches. When a catalyst such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) is
        added to the water, the spacing between the two coils 16',17'
        may be between 0.032 and 6.000 inches, with the preferred
        spacing still being between 0.050 and 0.200 inches. In addition,
        the gap or spacing between adjacent coils 16',17' of each
        electrode may be between 0.001 and 0.500 inches, with a
        preferred gap of 0.032 to 0.100 inches. </p>
      <p>As in the non-coiled embodiments, the electrolytic reaction
        rate may be increased still further by applying light to the
        apparatus, so that the energy of the photons adds to the energy
        supplied by the electric fields between the electrodes and the
        magnetic fields within the electrodes. Either or both of the
        electrodes may be enclosed within a membrane bag, sack, or
        tubing, as also discussed above, and currents and/or fields may
        further be arranged to kill microorganisms. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 illustrates a variation of the switching system
        illustrated in FIG. 4, in which a single battery or cell is used
        to supply electricity to the two electrodes E1 and E2. In this
        system, closed switches SW5 and SW7 cause current in electrodes
        E1 and E2 to flow in a first direction when switches SW6 and SW8
        are open, while closed switches SW6 and SW8 and correspondingly
        open switches SW5 and SW7 cause current to reverse and flow in
        an opposite direction. The reversal affects the shearing and
        tensile force separation of the water molecules in the manner
        earlier described with respect to FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 illustrates a variation of the system of FIG. 7 in which
        AC current is applied to the at least one of the electrodes, and
        the direction of the AC current is reversed by alternately
        opening and closing the switches SW1,SW4 and SW2,SW3. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 illustrates a lighting system in which the electrolyte
        is replaced by a material 20 that emits light when excited by a
        reversing current generated by alternately opening and closing
        the switches SW1,SW4 and SW2,SW3. </p>
      <p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the
        multidirectional current generating apparatus of FIGS. 4 10 may
        also be connected together in various combinations. For example,
        FIG. 11 illustrates two electrolytic cells 22 and 23, each
        corresponding to the cell illustrated in FIG. 8, connected in
        parallel. FIG. 12 illustrates the same two electrolytic cells
        connected in series. In each case the current is reversed by
        alternately opening and closing the switches SW1,SW4 and
        SW2,SW3. </p>
      <p>FIG. 13 illustrates an apparatus corresponding to that of FIG.
        4, but with additional polarity reversal of the two electrodes
        4,5. In the apparatus of FIG. 13, switches SW5 to SW8 effect
        current reversal within the electrodes to generate a
        multidirectional current in the current carrying medium 8,
        illustrated as water, while switches SW1 to SW4 reverse the
        polarity of electrode 4 and switches SW9 to SW12 reverse the
        polarity of electrode 5. A corresponding timing diagram is
        illustrated in FIGS. 14(a) to 14(o). </p>
      <p>FIG. 15 shows a charging circuit for an electrolytic battery
        25, which may be a nickel metal hydride battery of the type
        described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,670, but which includes a
        current reversal circuit of the type illustrated in FIG. 4 for
        reversing the direction of currents in the positive electrodes
        26 and the negative electrodes 27. The illustrated current
        reversal prevents asymmetric accumulation of ions on the
        electrodes, and therefore reduces wear caused by excessive
        heating, while the multi-directional current in the electrolyte
        reduces buildup of electrolytic reactants on the terminals. In
        addition, in the case of a nickel metal hydride battery, the
        current reversal facilitates absorption of hydrogen by the
        nickel material. </p>
      <p>FIG. 16 illustrates an alternate switching circuit for
        batteries of the type illustrated in FIG. 15, with the
        electrodes 28 30 connected in series. </p>
      <p>Operation of the battery can be further improved by adding a
        current reversing discharge circuit to the current reversing
        charging circuit to prevent excess wear due to asymmetric
        discharge currents. As illustrated in FIG. 17, discharge of a
        battery 32 is synchronized to the phase of a motor 33 by means
        of a synchronizer control 34 and motor commutating switches SWA
        to SWD. In this embodiment, switches SW1 to SW4 operate in the
        same manner as the corresponding switches of the water
        electrolysis system or hydrogen generator illustrated in FIG. 4.
        A timing diagram for the synchronized charge and discharge of
        the battery of FIG. 17 is included in FIGS. 18(a) to 18(j). </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the principles of the invention may
        be applied to a variety of different types of batteries,
        including hydrogen batteries as well as the illustrated nickel
        metal hydride battery, and the invention is not to be limited to
        a particular type of battery. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate application of the principles of the
        invention to an electromagnetic device such as an
        electromagnetic projectile launcher 40 (FIG. 19) or a piston
        driver 50 (FIG. 20). In each of these devices, two electrodes 41
        and 42 are arranged coaxially and oppositely wound to generate a
        magnetic flux in a common direction. The reversing DC currents
        are supplied to the coils by a battery 43 of the type
        illustrated in FIG. 15 through switches SW1 to SW4, with oxygen
        and hydrogen being generated by electrolysis and separated by a
        membrane 44. The oxygen (O.sub.2) and hydrogen (H.sub.2) are
        discharged via respective outlets 45 and 46 to a fuel cell 47
        which generates electricity for use in charging the battery 43
        through charging circuit 48 when the devices are in a standby
        state, and for driving the projectile (PROJECTILE) shown in FIG.
        19 or piston (50) shown in FIG. 20 when the devices are active.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 21 shows details of a cold cathode light 52 having
        electrodes 53 56 alternately supplied with a high voltage AC
        current through switches SW1 to SW4. In this application, the
        current in the lighting medium (GAS) switches direction because
        it alternately flows between electrode pairs 53,55 and 54,56
        rather than because of current reversals within the electrodes.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 22 shows a plasma generator having a switching circuit
        identical to that shown in FIG. 4, but in which the current
        carrying medium is a gas, the current reversals in the
        electrodes 58 and 59 generating a multidirectional current in
        the gas that increases the rate and uniformity of plasma
        generation. </p>
      <p>In addition to the numerous different applications described
        above, the configuration and number of the electrodes may be
        varied in a variety of ways without departing from the scope of
        the invention. For example, more than two electrodes may be
        included, such as the three electrodes 60 62 shown in FIG. 23,
        or the electrodes may be interleaved as illustrated in FIGS. 24
        and 25. FIG. 25 shows the additional feature of an external
        light source 64 for further increasing the rate of gas
        production, as described in US Patent Published Patent
        Application No. 2002/0060161 (entitled Photo-Assisted
        Electrolysis) in an electrolysis cell 65 that can be used as
        part of, or to enhance, a regenerative solar electricity
        generating system, and that uses planar coiled electrodes 66 and
        67 arranged in a jelly roll configuration. FIG. 26 illustrates
        an alternate gas separation system in a multiple electrode
        electrolysis cell corresponding to the one illustrated in the
        above cited copending patent application, and that uses multiple
        membranes 68 housing or bagging alternate electrodes. </p>
      <p>The principles of the invention may also be applied to various
        capacitive systems, as illustrated in FIGS. 29 37, by using a
        material or structure 70 that permits passage of ions as a
        dielectric separator between the electrodes E1,E2 of the
        capacitor. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 29 and 30, the
        direction of currents between the two electrodes E1,E2 of a
        single capacitor, or the respective electrodes E1,E2 of multiple
        capacitors connected in series (FIG. 29) or parallel (FIG. 30),
        may be reversed using four or more switches SW1 SW8 in the same
        manner as described above in connection with FIG. 4. By
        symmetrically charging and discharging the capacitors,
        asymmetric heat build-up in the electrodes is prevented,
        improving performance and extending the life of the capacitors.
      </p>
      <p>The capacitors to which the principles of the invention are
        applied may take, of course, a variety of forms, and are not
        limited to a particular electrode geometric or specific
        electrode or dielectric materials. FIG. 31, for example, shows a
        jelly roll capacitor configuration similar to the jelly roll
        configuration of the electrodes in the electrolytic cell of FIG.
        25. </p>
      <p>As especially advantageous application of the principles of the
        invention to capacitive systems is the thrust module illustrated
        in FIGS. 32 and 33, which improves upon the thrust module
        described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,310 by varying the direction of
        currents applied to high voltage electrode plate 72, thereby
        enabling the thrust direction to be varied. In this
        configuration, the negative electrode 74 has switch terminals at
        each end, in a manner similar to the other embodiments of the
        invention, but the positive electrodes have additional switch
        terminals SW1 SW8 so as to enable the direction of current in
        the dielectric 76 to not only be reversed, but also to change
        angular position and thereby the thrust angle, depending on
        which pairs of switches are operated. </p>
      <p>FIG. 34 illustrates a variation of the thrust module of FIGS.
        32 and 33, in which current is supplied by a high voltage source
        84 to electrodes 80 and 81, which coaxially surround dielectric
        material 83, through current-direction reversing switches SW1
        SW4, and the resulting EMF pulses in electrodes 80 and 81 are
        captured by a coil 85 to produce a voltage when the current
        changes direction, thereby generating magnetic fields to create
        a thrust force. </p>
      <p>Capacitors or capacitor circuits of the type illustrated in
        FIGS. 29 33 may also be used in a variety of other capacitor
        circuits, such as the ones illustrated in FIGS. 35 37. FIG. 35
        shows an RLC circuit that charges when the direction of current
        is changed using switches SW1 and SW4, while FIG. 36 shows a
        tuner circuit for a transmitter in which the current change
        amplifies the transmitted signal on both the plus and minus
        sides of the circuit, and FIG. 37 shows an alternative capacitor
        construction and circuit in which the capacitance is controlled
        by the adjusted electrolyte 90 in which the capacitor electrodes
        91,92 are immersed. </p>
      <p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in any of the
        above-described embodiments and implementations of the
        invention, both the manner in which the current is caused to
        alternate direction in the electrodes, and the timing and
        magnitude of the EMF pulses, can be varied according to the
        principles of the invention. For example, FIGS. 27(a) 27(f) are
        timing diagrams of a variation of the preferred switching system
        in which opening and closing of switches SW1 and SW4 is delayed
        relative to closing and opening of switches SW2 and SW3. On the
        other hand, FIG. 28 illustrates a variation of the apparatus
        illustrated in FIG. 3, in which center taps and switches SW19
        and SW20 are added to enable manipulation or softening of the
        EMF pulses in the electrodes. </p>
      <p>In addition to the illustrated applications, other potential
        applications of the principles of the invention are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>The electrolytic cell illustrated in FIG. 4 or an analogous
        switched semiconductor device could also be used as a type of
        computing device in which sensors monitor the direction of
        current flow. Instead of using Boolean logic, the computer would
        use the current flow sensors to sense directions, with zero
        current to 0, and different current directions to +1, +2, +3,
        and so forth. In addition, the transistors that change the
        direction of the current may be part of a ladder logic equation
        and for setting the timing and logic expression, for example by
        performing a flip flop function timed with current flow. </p>
      <p>Another possible application is to use the currents to reduce
        radioactive waste of spent nuclear fuel by attaching the
        electron orbits of spent fuel in a multi-dimensional oscillating
        electric field, or a polarity reversing multi-dimensional
        electric field. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that one can build an electromagnetic
        generator that will produce multi-directional currents and
        corresponding voltages, rather than converting the currents or
        voltages from another DC or AC voltage. Also, mechanical cam
        switching can create multi-directional currents and
        corresponding voltages, and one can similarly build motor that
        will run on new the voltages. </p>
      <p>Finally, yet another possible application of the invention is
        to enhance dehydration of a porous material using
        electro-osmosis as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,117,295 and
        6,372,109. </p>
      <p>Having thus described a preferred embodiment of the invention
        in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make
        and use the invention, it will nevertheless be appreciated that
        numerous variations and modifications of the illustrated
        embodiment may be made without departing from the spirit of the
        invention, and it is intended that the invention not be limited
        by the above description or accompanying drawings, but that it
        be defined solely in accordance with the appended claims. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract: </b>An electrolysis conversion system for
        converting liquid to gas, such as water into hydrogen and
        oxygen, includes a housing in which are housed encapsulated and
        non-encapsulated electrodes in any one of side-by-side, rolled
        or folded relationship. The electrodes are immersed in an
        electrolyte, water or the like and are appropriately
        electrically connected to positive and negative sides of an
        energy source. The encapsulation material of the encapsulated
        electrodes can be substantially conductive or non-conductive to
        either ion flow or electron flow and either substantially
        non-porous or porous to gas bubbles with the option of utilizing
        spacers to prevent arcing and thereby generate hydrogen and
        oxygen from the water/electrolyte. The encapsulating media is
        either a folded flexible sheet heat sealed along three edges,
        two sheets heat sealed along four edges, a tube heat sealed
        along opposite axial edges or a coating dip-coated,
        electro-deposited, silk screen coated or similarly applied to
        the electrode which is preferably porous and can either be rigid
        or relatively bendable/flexible. </p>
