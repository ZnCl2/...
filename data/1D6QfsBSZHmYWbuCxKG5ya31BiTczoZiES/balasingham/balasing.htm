                  Growers</font></b><br>
              by <b>Jon Morgan</b> </p>
          </center>

        <p style="text-align: left;">POTENT INSTRUMENT: 'Sure, it will
          make me wealthy,' says Nathan Balasingham. 'But it will make
          everyone else wealthy too. Why can't we all be wealthy?' </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Nathan Balasingham's card reads:
          "Growers want a silver bullet. There was none in the market.
          So I invented Agrizest." Shy and retiring he is not. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He believes he has invented a
          product that boosts the growth, yield, colour and flavour of
          fruit crops - apples, kiwifruit, citrus and grapes have
          benefited so far - and of pasture. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He goes further and claims that it
          reduces pest, disease and environmental stress damage and
          further still in claiming that it will reduce our
          greenhouse-gas emissions. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It may sound like the fabled silver
          bullet, but is it? Mr Balasingham has a Master of Horticulture
          science degree, with first-class honours in biochemistry, from
          Massey University and 36 years experience as a researcher and
          in research and development management. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He says he has the trial results to
          prove many of these claims. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He estimates Agrizest's immediate
          value to the horticulture industry alone at $100 million in
          improved orchard returns, and has asked the Government to
          champion it in a public-private partnership. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His enthusiasm shines out of his
          face as he explains his invention and answers questions. "Of
          course you have scepticism," he says. "It's natural. But then
          you should say: 'I'm going to find out'. Don't dismiss me
          without doing that." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He urges doubters to test his
          product for themselves, saying it is made of natural
          ingredients that will not harm plants. It is seaweed-based
          with extracts from coconut, aloe, palm oil, lecithin and soy
          beans. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Growers who have tried Agrizest
          report positive results. Some are enthusiastic, while others
          are more cautious. In an industry where claims of wonder
          drugs, fertilisers and soil treatments proliferate largely
          unchallenged, they have learnt not to rush to try something
          new. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But scientists say they have
          concerns about the efficacy of Mr Balasingham's field trials
          and doubt that Agrizest is the panacea he claims it to be,
          though most would not speak on the record. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Mr Balasingham complains of
          "standoffishness" and obstruction by industry bodies and
          Crown-research institutes. He says this attitude is
          frustrating and partly because of "patch protection" in a
          competitive funding environment. "I've done all the work I
          need to prove Agrizest works. They're a bad bunch." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Malaysian-born Mr Balasingham first
          studied plants' responses to attack at Massey University in
          the 1970s, but it wasn't till the plant genome was published
          in 1996 that he was able to see the details of a defensive
          system that triggered the release of essential oils. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The oils, or metabolites, determine
          the colours in flowers, fruits, seeds and leaves and the
          flavour and bouquet in flowers and fruit. They strengthen the
          defence system against pest, disease and ultraviolet damage,
          repair damaged cells and help the plants take up nutrients for
          growth. They also harden cells, so fruit and vegetables are
          crunchier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In a search for a way to switch on
          these oils, Mr Balasingham remembered the teachings of his
          youth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His family followed Ayurvada, a Sri
          Lankan and South Indian culture that had at its heart a basic
          rule that said don't put on your skin anything that you would
          not put in your mouth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I started to see that the
          molecules I needed were in the food they talked about -
          different seaweeds and high- oil-content foods such as
          coconut. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I realised I could extract the
          molecules out of commodity products I could easily lay my
          hands on, and that wouldn't harm me." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The ingredients are commonly found
          in the food industry, except one which is used as a cosmetic,
          and are relatively cheap to buy in bulk overseas and to
          import. He mixes them in vats in his Pukekohe factory in
          different strengths. A lighter version is marketed as Nature's
          Curator for home-garden use. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Agrizest works by tricking plants
          into thinking they are under attack, he says. They respond by
          releasing their essential oils. "The result is a plant
          bursting with health." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Massey University professor of
          molecular genetics Barry Scott says Mr Balasingham's claims
          are plausible. "There are active components that may be
          present in a concoction of chemicals from a natural product.
          But let's see this written up somewhere so that it can be
          appropriately peer reviewed and a conclusion drawn about its
          effectiveness." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Mr Balasingham says Agrizest has
          been tested in trials on apples, kiwifruit and grapes. The
          results show a marked increase in tree and vine growth, a lift
          in fruit production and an enhanced ability to resist pests. A
          grape trial showed 10 per cent more flavour characteristics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But he admits the trials have not
          been published in science or trade journals, except in one
          case in an insert at his own expense. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I have done everything I can to
          show that what I say can be substantiated," he says. This is
          backed by packhouse data and grower testimony. "The quantum
          change is so huge that you don't need statistical analysis. It
          is too obvious." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His work on Agrizest has not been
          peer reviewed, either. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I am the inventor. I don't have
          peers," he says. "If I had peers, they would have invented it
          themselves." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His confidence in the value of
          Agrizest to the world is unbounded. He ranks it alongside the
          introduction of dwarf wheat varieties in the middle of the
          last century, which became known as the green revolution, and
          says it will lift New Zealand as a trading nation above its
          low-cost South American rivals. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Despite feeling frustrated at a
          negative reception by the science community, he has high hopes
          that Agrizest's potential will be fulfilled. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He took his case to Agriculture
          Minister David Carter this week, asking him to be bold and
          initiate a private-public coalition among the agriculture and
          horticulture industries to take up Agrizest nationwide. He
          says Mr Carter gave him a good hearing, but made no promises.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Agrizest's environmental abilities,
          if they can be proven, could be its biggest attraction. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Mr Balasingham says he has trials
          under way that will show Agrizest- treated pasture allows more
          efficient digestion in livestock, reduces methane emissions,
          lifts food-to-energy conversion and strengthens immunity to
          disease. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He has identified a group of
          essential oils enhanced by Agrizest that signal root systems
          to "ooze out" substrates to encourage proliferation of
          microflora. These microflora fix nitrogen and supply it to
          plants. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By converting nitrogen and other
          fertilisers to plant-available form and preventing leaching,
          farmers will be able to cut fertiliser use. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He is patenting his invention
          overseas and his vision is to sell the world rights - except
          for New Zealand - to a multinational company. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This would give New Zealand a head
          start, while the company developed the international market. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With a $300 billion potential world
          market - based on using four sprays a year on 1.5 billion
          hectares of managed cropland - he thinks he will get a high
          price for his invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At the same time, New Zealand
          should not miss out, if it takes up Agrizest. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Sure, it will make me wealthy," he
          says with a grin. "But it will make everyone else wealthy too.
          Why can't we all be wealthy?" </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">How does it work in the orchard? </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">APPLES: Hamilton grower Paul
          Christey's orchard was used for trials over the past three
          years and showed a 15 per cent increase in tree growth,
          particularly among young trees, a five-fold lift in apple
          production, a 50 to 86 per cent reduction in
          leaf-curling-midge damage, 82 per cent less mite damage and a
          marked improvement in colour intensity and fruit size. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He says he cannot understand the
          science, but is pleased with the result. "It makes the trees
          do all the things we want them to do. Rather than chucking on
          nitrogen for growth or potassium for lots of fruit, it seems
          to stimulate the different pathways within the plant so it
          gets all those critical process working better." The saving in
          miticide use was worth it alone. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After cautiously using Agrizest at
          first, he is now spraying it across "a big chunk" of his
          orchard, including export crops. The feedback from overseas
          buyers has been positive about the apples' colour, density and
          sugar content. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I wouldn't say it is a panacea for
          all things evil in the pipfruit industry, but it is a useful
          tool, and cheap enough," he says. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Pipfruit New Zealand chairman Ian
          Palmer is also trying Agrizest, but says it is too early to
          talk about results. He has talked to growers who have used it,
          however. "It sounds almost too good to be true, but it does
          work a bit. There are results, so that is encouraging." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Greytown grower Jamie Burns sprayed
          a row of 90 trees with Agrizest, missing out 10. "There's a
          huge difference between the two areas. The general tree health
          looks amazing." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">She then used it over all the
          orchard. "We were sceptical at first. There's a lot of snake
          oil in this industry. But it's surprisingly good, especially
          against mites, and it's cost-effective and eco-friendly, too."
          She believes Agrizest will take off, once word spreads. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">KIWIFRUIT: A Te Puke green and gold
          kiwifruit grower, Rob Bayly, has used Agrizest for three
          years. He says it has lifted undersized green fruit, improved
          his pack-out numbers and halved instances of a core disorder
          in gold kiwifruit. He finds it particularly useful in helping
          stressed vines. However, he questions Mr Balasingham's claims
          of a $4000-a-hectare lift in orchard-gate returns, saying that
          in his experience the rise and fall of returns can be caused
          by a variety of unspecified factors. He would like to see
          independent and thorough trials. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"But it has its uses," he says.
          "When you have something that is lacking, that's when it works
          best." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Tauranga kiwifruit grower Peter
          Hope says Agrizest saved one gold orchard he was managing.
          "The vines were very yellow and the leaves were small. We were
          advised to use Agrizest. Five days later, the plants were nice
          and green and the orchard was looking really good." He
          believes Agrizest is responsible for him receiving his first
          bonus for early fruit in four years. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">GRAPES: Mike Lane, of Clive River
          Vineyard, Hawke's Bay, who grows chardonnay and pinot-noir
          grapes for Montana, has noticed an improvement in his vine
          growth. The leaves are shinier and bigger and the grape yields
          and ripeness are marginally improved. "We're talking about 3
          to 4 per cent riper, which is significant, because a 0.1 per
          cent increase in brix [sugar content] can be worth $5 a
          tonne." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">CITRUS: Gisborne grapefruit,
          orange, tangelo and mandarin grower Guy Cumming says Agrizest
          does everything claimed about it. Old grapefruit trees that
          once produced juicing fruit now have supermarket- quality
          fresh fruit. His fruit grow with more vigour, their skins are
          cleaner, they taste better and they have improved colour. "The
          transformation has been quite remarkable. I'm scared not to
          use it now," he says. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">DAIRY: Opunake farmer Mike Walsh
          sees Agrizest as a useful tool as he moves gradually towards
          farming organically. He sprayed a couple of paddocks in June.
          "Man alive, did I see some results," he exclaims. Growth was
          up to 30kg of dry matter a day, compared with 10kg to 15kg
          normally. "The grass just took off. Everything grew, clovers
          and all. And the cows ate it all, right down and evenly across
          the paddock - even the urine and dung patches." The cows had
          been dried off, so a milk- production comparison was not done.

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The
          composition includes extracts from fast-growing plants
          (including seaweeds) mixed with phospholipids and a
          surfactant, presented at an acidic pH. It is sprayed on crop
          plants as a weak watery suspension to benefit plant growth and
          plant immunity/defense mechanisms indirectly. The level of
          natural defenses against pests and disease organisms is raised
          by included plant elicitors, effectors and stimulants. The
          ecological balance of soil bacteria is affected beneficially,
          contributing to the holistic effect. An arthropod knock-down
          effect is believed to be mediated through stimulation of
          commensal bacteria found on the epidermis of plants and of
          animals. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>FIELD</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0001] This invention relates to
          agricultural and/or horticultural additives of natural and
          sustainable origin, having an intended effect of promoting
          plant growth and of reducing the extent of parasitism such as
          by insects. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0002] In many agricultural sites,
          such as where intensive or relatively monocultural crops or
          livestock, or a combination, are raised, the farmer has a
          constant battle to suppress parasites such as insects, mites,
          fungi and microbes which attempt to consume his production
          before it can be marketed. Often, the preferred response to a
          particular problem has been a relatively specific "knockout"
          treatment such as use of an insecticide, vermicide, fungicide
          or similar; in accordance with the "magic bullet" since the
          time of Ehrlich with pharmacological therapeutics of synthetic
          or natural origins, and as exemplified with penicillin or a
          vaccine. Some of these have side effects of varying degrees of
          significance as well. Many agricultural problems arise from a
          desire to farm a single species all at the same phase of the
          life cycle, so that any pests that arrive can multiply rapidly
          if unchecked. Another problem is the desire of the market for
          totally unblemished products. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0003] There is growing interest in
          alternative strategies for pest control, particularly in
          plants; strategies that have a primary effect on the plant
          tissues rather than on the infectious agents. They might have
          a primary effect on soil micro-organism balances. This is
          often a less target-specific form of pest control. Holistic
          approaches have not enjoyed the same acceptance as "magic
          bullet" type products of directed research for various
          reasons. The holistic theme of the present invention is
          supported by current horticulture-related research, for
          example: a Department of Multitrophic Interactions has been
          started in the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (KNAW) at
          Maarssen. Their interests include interactions between plants,
          above-ground and below-ground herbivores, pathogens and their
          natural enemies. The British Society for Plant Pathology
          presidential address for 2003 was on "Survival, surfaces and
          susceptibility--the sensory biology of pathogens" (J A Lucas)
          which begins by stating that the study of plant disease caused
          by pathogenic micro-organisms is a science of interactions:
          pathogen vs host, and the influence of the environment on both
          partners as well as on the interaction itself. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0004] Example interaction means
          that are activated or increased when the host plant is under
          attack and experiencing stress and is activating cell repair
          include: [0005] a) secretion of volatile substances* some
          having antimicrobial and anti-herbivore activity; also items
          selected from the range of: elicitors, receptors, effector
          molecules, activators, gene silencers and other activity
          modifiers, cofactors and substrates, one action of which is to
          activate defense mechanisms in neighbouring host plants,
          *Knudsen J T et al (1993) Phytochemistry 33253-280 "Floral
          scents--a checklist of volatile compounds isolated by
          head-space techniques" and others report over 1000 low
          molecular weight volatile substances reported to be emitted
          from plants. extra-floral nectaries (such as on cotton) to
          attract parasitoids with specifically utilizable sugars. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0006] Some of these interaction
          means are relevant to ecologies below ground level. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0007] Depending on the
          characteristics and nature of the elicitor of the defense
          (immune) system), the primary response mechanism induces one
          of three immune systems: [0008] a) Systemic acquired
          resistance (SAR) which is induced by limited infection with a
          pathogen. Salicylic acid is the main signalling hormone and it
          is associated with expression of genes and release of disease
          preventing proteins. [0009] b) Induced systemic resistance
          (ISR) is activated by non-disease causing micro-organisms.
          Jasmonic acid and ethylene are examples of signalling hormones
          involved. This system does not involve disease-preventing
          proteins. Environmental factors also induce this system.
          [0010] c) Induced systemic resistance against chewing and
          biting insects is also dependent on jasmonic acid and
          ethylene, but requires increased levels of these regulators
          rather than an initial sensitivity to them as in (b).
          Induction of the synthesis of the insect attractants is a
          multistep biochemical chain involving jasmonic acid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0011] Plant extract treatments
          based partially or totally on seaweed extracts are well-known
          but appear to work after the added matter has been reduced to
          more or less elemental components, and these appear to work as
          fertilisers in the usual sense of upgrading an inorganic
          elemental limit to growth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0012] Other known plant or crop
          treatments used as preventatives rather than as "magic bullet"
          cures include growth promotants such as auxins (particularly
          cytokinins to promote root growth). Some bioremediation
          treatments include a cocktail of useful micro-organisms such
          as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This would also have considerable
          advantages for those who wish to avoid close contact with the
          agrichemical industry. At this time, the over-use of
          agrichemicals (along with other environmental pollutants) is
          suspected of contributing to statistically raised morbidity
          and mortality in the human population--such as in relation to
          depressed sperm counts and raised incidences of various types
          of cancer. </p>

          directly (such as through the change in ecology) and

        <p style="text-align: left;">[0014] Kulenkampff, in U.S. Pat.
          No. 5,093,124 describes a biodegradable pesticidal composition
          for curing damage from arthropod or fungal pests. The
          composition includes predominantly an alkali metal soap and a
          second component for amelioration of the inherent
          phytotoxicity of the soap, namely either lecithin
          (phosphatidyl choline), a seaweed extract, or a mixture of
          both. The mixture is applied at about preferably 0.25% by
          weight of active ingredients in water. Concentrations (as
          sprayed) are surfactant X 10, seaweed X 1.6, lecithin X 45 The
          application rate is given only as "to runoff". At col 3, line
          61, it is said that the fungicidal properties of the soap of
          the composition will deteriorate at lower concentrations.
          Although this composition appears at first sight similar to
          that of the present invention, the present invention is not an
          alkali metal-soap (it is acidified to about pH 3.8 with citric
          acid), is used at one tenth the minimum concentration of
          Kulenkampff, and is used mainly as a preventative for
          stimulating the plant's own defenses, while Kulankampff's
          invention is used as a treatment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>OBJECT</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0015] It is an object of this
          invention to provide a plant treatment; an holistic,
          preventative, bioremediation product, or at least to provide
          the public with a useful choice. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>STATEMENT OF INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0016] In a first broad aspect the
          invention provides a composition of the organic, bionutrient
          type for the holistic prevention of plant diseases and
          parasitism and general improvement of plant structures,
          wherein the composition includes four major components: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">an extract made from a selected
          quickly growing plant or seaweed, </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">a phospholipid (as an extract of
          plant origin), </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">an organic amine surfactant, and </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">an organic acid of a type found in
          plants, </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0017] the composition being
          applied to plants by spraying at a low concentration in an
          aqueous suspension, and the composition being capable when in
          use of improving at least one of: resistance of the sprayed
          plants to pathogens and parasites, the number of arthropods
          present on the plants, the growth rate of the plants, and the
          balance of soil micro-organisms so that it is more favourable
          to plant growth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0018] Preferably the relative
          proportions (as dry weight) of the ingredients are in the
          range of--extract: about 65%, phospholipid: about 1-5%,
          surfactant: about 15-30%, and organic acid: in an amount
          capable of rendering the pH of the composition to be applied
          in a range from pH=about 3.0 to pH=about 4.5. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0019] In one option the
          composition is supplied in a dry form: convenient for storage
          or transport. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0020] Alternatively the
          composition is supplied in a relatively concentrated aqueous
          suspension. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0021] In a first related aspect
          the extract included in the composition provides at least one
          functional material selected from the range of [growth
          stimulants, organic elicitors and effectors, and functional
          nutrients] so that in combination with the remaining
          components of the composition the extract is capable of
          stimulating growth, of stimulating systemic acquired
          resistance, of stimulating induced systemic resistance, of
          stimulating commensal micro-organisms, and of stimulating soil
          micro-organisms. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0022] Preferably the extract is
          obtained from a fast-growing seaweed, and more preferably the
          seaweed is of the species Ascophyllum nodosum, or optionally,
          kelps. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0023] In a second related aspect
          the phospholipid is a lecithin of soy bean origin although
          mixtures, such as phospholipid mixtures including linoleic
          acid, are acceptable: the phospholipid serving to enhance cell
          membrane restoration, so that in combination with the
          remaining components of the composition the composition
          enhances resistance to pathogenic fungi. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0024] In a third related aspect
          the surfactant is a coconut oil diethanolamine condensate and
          the surfactant assists in absorbtion of the composition over
          sprayed plant leaf surfaces. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0025] Preferably the pH of the
          mixture (as found in a dilute solution) is lowered to from
          typically about over 8 down to about 3.8 by the addition of a
          sufficient amount of citric acid or an equivalent
          plant-compatible organic acid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0026] In a second broad aspect,
          the composition provides means for reducing an arthropod
          parasite burden on farmed organisms (including plants and
          animals), the composition having an effect of encouraging the
          production of arthropod-adverse or arthrocidal compounds
          (including without limitation the type known as phytoalexins
          or other anti-biosis type compounds) by micro-organisms
          present on or near the farmed organisms, so that the farmed
          organisms exhibit additional growth at least some of which is
          a response to the reduced parasite burden. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0027] In a third broad aspect, the
          invention provides a method for applying a composition as
          previously described in this section for control of insect
          damage in plants of the cabbage family, wherein the method
          includes the steps of preparing an about 0.1% suspension (or
          more) of active ingredients in water and applying the
          suspension to the plants by spraying at a rate of about 0.5
          litre to 1 litre per hectare at weekly intervals while the
          plants are small, and then at fortnightly intervals. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0028] In a fourth broad aspect a
          reduction of molluscs adverse to plants (slugs and snails) has
          been noted but this may be a consequence of reduced algal
          growth, itself known to result from application of the
          composition. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0029] The description of the
          invention to be provided herein is given purely by way of
          example and is not to be taken in any way as limiting the
          scope or extent of the invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0030] Throughout this
          specification, unless the text requires otherwise, the word
          "comprise" and variations such as "comprising" or "comprises"
          will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer
          or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of
          any other integer or step or group of integers or steps. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0031] The inventor has largely
          based his invention on providing one or more exogenous
          substances that mimic the inducers (elicitors) of the defense
          (immune) systems of plants and thereby anticipate or amplify
          the natural response of the farmed crop. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0032] It appears to the inventor
          that there are benefits from applying treatments that "help
          the plants to help themselves" such as by promoting the
          plant's own biosynthesis and distribution of phytoalexins. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0033] It should be noted that
          total eradication of a particular pathogen is not a goal
          although that may be possible using the right agrochemical
          cures. Reduction of the pathogen burden to a low level is a
          goal. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0034] This invention relates to an
          ecosystem in which farmed organisms (plants) are farmed. A
          composition for bioremediation is provided, causing the
          promotion of plant growth and a reduction of insect burden. A
          preferred composition in overview includes: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">an extract from tissues of a
          fast-growing plant or seaweed (or as detailed below) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">a phospholipid, preferably
          lecithin, </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">and a surfactant. Preferably the
          surfactant is a coconut palm-derived amine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0035] Water is added to bring the
          composition as sold to be a dilute or a strong solution;
          otherwise the composition may be made on a dry basis for later
          mixing with water. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0036] A preferred rate of
          application is usually a 0.1% solution of dry active matter in
          water. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0037] The currently preferred
          seaweed extract (sold as "Acadian Seaplants Seaweed Extract",
          Acadian Seaplants Limited, Nova Scotia, Canada) is already
          sold by that company for use as a plant fertiliser, and the
          company summarises a number of field trials showing a positive
          effect of application onto a variety of commercial crops. The
          field trial summaries do not point out what component is/are
          supplemented if if there is another mechanism involved, but
          the company's web site suggests that short-chain
          carbohydrates, unusual amino acids (betaines), over 60
          chelated micro- and macro-nutrients, and other compounds, have
          some plant biostimulant effect and discourage sap-suckling
          insect attack.
          (http://www.acadianseaplants.com/technicalproducts.html,
          available on Nov. 12, 2004). The preferred raw material is the
          seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. The additives described in this
          invention are novel and in combination the mixture provides
          effects including at least some synergistic effect beyond
          their known effects if used separately. To the inventor's
          knowledge this company is the only one producing a soluble
          powder of good quality (as specified herein); other seaweed
          companies produce pulp or liquid. Other sources of seaweed
          extract may be suitable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Manufacturing Method, with
            Details of Our Understanding of the Purpose(S) of Various
            Components.</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0038] (Please note: Any attempts
          provided herein as "theory" by way of explanation of the
          observed results have been provided in good faith. Should it
          later be realised that a different explanation is more
          appropriate than the one offered, such a change must not be
          taken as invalidating the patent). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0039] 1. The base material is a
          water soluble extract powder of any plants that grow fast
          (&gt;0.5 m/day) in length e.g. seaplants (seaweed) such as
          Ascophyllum nodosum. Desert or arid plants that have potential
          to survive harsh conditions and grow fast when conditions
          allow, such as Yucca spp are an alternative. A desired amount
          of this material is placed in a mixing vessel capable of
          holding a further 35% (approximately) of dry or relatively dry
          material. All measures are given herein as weights. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0040] Alternatively, the invention
          may use liquid concentrated extracts obtained from similar
          type fast-growing plants including those plants that grow
          quickly in a desert after sporadic rain, or a mixture of land
          and sea origin plants. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Theory:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0041] This composition is made
          using plant extracts that are intended to correct areas of
          imbalance in any overtaxed eco-system. Benefits derived from
          this component appear at least in part to be that commensal
          micro-organisms existing in contact with the farmed organisms
          (animals or plants) are capable of being provoked or
          stimulated or otherwise caused to produce insecticidal
          compounds by the application of a composition according to the
          invention. Although the family of toxins produced by Bacillus
          thuringiensis (Bt) organisms may not one be of those involved
          they comprise an illustrative microbially and field-produced
          group of insecticides. Other benefits of the composition are
          that it is a crop-supporting plant extract, added as a
          cofactor and nutrient (and perhaps with further functions) to
          sustain the increased activities of the eco-system. Other
          plant extracts may be included to counter any possible side
          effects from the actions of the two main extracts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0042] Bio-availability enhancers
          are also added to expedite the transfer of the benefits of the
          formulation to the cellular components of the live ecosystem
          including the soil ecosystem. For example, these extracts may
          contain high level of enzymes or analogous substances and/or
          release substances which we call "the elicitors" from the
          fungal and bacterial cell walls. The elicitors diffuse through
          the animal and plant cells and may be or act like hormones
          (with the help of the coconut or other palm-derived amines,
          and the phospholipids). Elicitors then bind to specific
          receptors on the plant cell membranes and induce metabolism
          (phospholipids from lecithin, and nutrients from seaweed such
          as kelp may provide substrates) of (for example) phytoalexins
          On the other hand the extracts may act on the mechanisms
          involved in expression of genes. The composition also works by
          inducing microbial systems to release compounds that may have
          antibiosis-type effects. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">2. Add about 1%-5% of plant extract
          with a high phospholipids content to the contents of the
          mixing vessel. Lecithin (phosphatidyl choline) is a good
          source of phospholipids and one preferred commercial source of
          lecithin is soybean. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Theory: Benefits Derived from
            this Component--</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0043] The phospholipids appear to
          enhance cell repair and increase the fungicidal effect of the
          mixture. Many forms of this material also contain an
          antioxidant--omega 3 linolenic acid. The material acts as an
          emulsifier of the plant oils in the mixture. Free linolenic
          acid may act to increase suppleness of the cell wall. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0044] Choline, a closely related
          phospholipid, may help transport elicitors, nutrients and
          phytoalexins in and out of cells and may also be used. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0045] The materials may serve as
          natural preservatives and be substrates for production by the
          treated plants of phytoalexins. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">3. Add about 15% to 30% palm
          derived surfactants to the contents of the mixing vessel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0046] Coconut or palm-based,
          amine-rich products are preferred, such as coconut oil
          diethanolamine condensate or particularly the compound
          cocamide diethanolamine (CAS 68603-42-9), supplied as a
          viscous yellow liquid that is a non-ionic surfactant for use
          in part as a wetting agent. (Note: this is not a soap (an
          alkali metal salt with high pH). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Theory: Benefits Derived from
            this Component--</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0047] The component aids cells of
          the treated plants to absorb nutrients and other beneficial
          compounds. The amine in the palm-derived extract appears to
          act like other amine hormones that bind to receptors at the
          cell surface (largely cells within the microbial flora of the
          soil) and act through second messengers. Synthesis of the
          second messengers inside the cell is stimulated by binding of
          the hormone at the cell periphery. Accumulation of the second
          messenger evokes metabolic changes inside the cell. (See
          "BIOCHEMISTRY" Christopher K Mathews, K. E. Van Holde, et al.
          Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company 1999). One might question
          this theory by asking whether the same effects are seen in a
          sterile environment, where the composition could supply
          micro-nutrients and trace elements (at the usual rate of
          application) to the plants under treatment. The resulting
          composition has been found to be not significantly effective
          in a sterile environment. Its actions and benefits are derived
          from its stimulating action on microbial and other living
          components (such as higher plants) of the ecosystem. The
          product may influence production of phytoalexins. The product
          may influence production of lignin for healing of damaged
          plant tissues. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0048] 4. Add a compatible acid,
          such as citric acid or an equivalent, in order to stabilise
          the mixture by acidification. The preferred original seaweed
          extract typically has a pH of about 8-10. The final pH is
          preferably about 3.8. If water is not to be added to the
          mixture at this time the correct amount of citric acid to add
          in dry form--crystals or powder--is preferably determined by
          extrapolation from a trial on a small quantity. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">5. Water may or may not be added to
          the mixed materials,--depending on the concentration of raw
          material required: shipping, storage or packing factors, and
          the form in which the mixture is to be used. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Results</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0049] Various trials shall be
          described. [0050] 1. Marigolds. This experiment was not a
          commercially useful trial. Instead, it showed some mechanisms
          by which the invention (called "Agrizest") operates.
          Observation, after treatment: slow yellowing of the lower
          leaves and subsequent fall of the mature leaves. Explanation:
          The plant's innate hormones, including jasmonic acid, abscisic
          acid and ethylene have been produced in excess, accelerating
          the plant's senescence, through the Induced Systemic Response.
          Observation: at the apex of the plant the "witch's broom"
          syndrome, also seen when high doses of growth hormone are
          applied, indicates that the innate growth system of the plant
          has been over-stimulated. [0051] 2. Cabbages A trial in
          Australia of the "Italy" variety gave the following results:
          Control (no treatment) cabbage leaves at the time of
          harvesting were eaten back to skeletal components by
          insects--and hearts were infrequently harvestable. With two
          sprays in the first week and one spray 2 weeks later, the
          amount of damage was less: hearts were infrequent, most outer
          leaves had been eaten, and a third group, sprayed twice in the
          first week and every 2 weeks thereafter until harvest very
          little damage to the outer leaves and consistently good
          hearts. Photographs are striking but incompatible with
          reproduction in patent specifications. (Similar results
          observed on cauliflowers). [0052] 3. Fennel. Stimulation of
          growth and greater consistency of plant size in fennel
          seedlings three days after one treatment with "Agrizest" is
          demonstrated, as compared to other organic nutrient mixtures.
          [0053] 4. Grapes. (a Viogier and Pinot Noir varieties
          vineyard) [0054] a) Vine infested with blister mite. Every
          second row was treated with "Agrizest" and every other row was
          treated with a control treatment of sulphur, fish nutrient and
          seaweed sprays. Total leaf spots due to blister mite damage
          (Viognier variety) control: total spots 79 on 21 damaged
          leaves out of 50 randomly sampled leaves (average 3.8 spots
          per damaged leaf, leaf size 274.5 "Agrizest" treated plants:
          total spots 44 on 15 damaged leaves out of 50 (average 2.9
          spots per damaged leaf, leaf size 311.5--a 44% reduction in
          spots. [0055] b) Enhancement of growth. Treatment resulted in
          larger and greener leaves than for the control plants. Leaf
          width index: (Viognier variety) control: 7.0, "Agrizest" 7.6,
          an 8.6% increase. (Pinot Noir variety) control: 8.9,
          "Agrizest" 9.1, a 2.2% increase. [0056] c) Sugar content of
          crop. The Brix level of sugars in the grapes was control:
          19.8, 20.0, "Agrizest" 21.2. 20.7, a 7.1% 3.5% increase.
          [0057] 5. Cycad plants having insects on young leaves. [0058]
          a) One day after spraying the plant was free of insects and
          appeared to be invigorated by a change in gene expression
          within the cycad as a result of treatment. [0059] b) An adult
          scale infestation was treated with "Agrizest" weekly. The
          treated leaves were relatively free of crawler and juvenile
          scale, but an untreated (shaded from spray) leaf had a high
          level of infestation. [0060] 6. Courgette and cucumber plants.
          Older leaves had been destroyed by powdery mildew infection.
          Younger leaves that had been treated weekly with "Agrizest"
          were able to resist infection. The plants continued to flower
          and healthy courgettes were harvested. [0061] 7. Geranium
          plants. Attacks by caterpillar, slugs and snails were halted
          after weekly spraying with "Agrizest". The plants appeared to
          be invigorated and were greener. Reduced presence of slugs and
          snails has been noticed in gardens where "Agrizest" has been
          sprayed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0062] Knock-down effects in
          general. When treating insects on "row crops" with the usual
          application rate of about 0.5 l/ha of a 0.1% solution of the
          composition, an initial "knock down" of insects within a few
          minutes is noted. Observations indicate that several different
          mechanisms are involved. For example in the cabbages trial
          referred to previously, it was noted that the white fly larvae
          on the cabbage leaves soon fell off and were moving about, the
          same at the end of the day, and in three days time they were
          gone. It appeared that the leaf had become unpalatable. Such
          observations could not easily be explained by a physical
          effect of the composition on the insects (such as by the soap
          of the prior-art Kulenkampff: U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,124). The
          early phase is presumed to be an early metabolic response
          (comprising production of toxins) by commensal micro-organisms
          on the epidermal surfaces of the plant leaves. Later, further
          micro-organisms in the soil may also contribute. In a second
          phase (covering the three-day period), the plant vigour
          changes and this phase appears to involve the production of
          effective amounts of phytotoxins. The second phase has an
          onset of 1-2 days for seedlings and about 2-3 weeks for mature
          plants (such as grapes or tree crops). Users are advised to
          re-spray the composition at intervals of about 7-14 days for
          seedlings, and 14-21 days for mature plants. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0063] Livestock. At this time use
          of the knock-down aspect of the invention is less well
          developed and tested. The composition may be sprayed onto
          farmed animals (including birds) whereupon the effects that
          soon follow suggest that again commensal bacteria or other
          micro-organisms present on the epidermis and in the hair, far,
          scales or feathers are stimulated to produce some insecticidal
          substances that adversely affect parasitic arthropods present
          upon or about the farmed animals. These parasites include
          (without limitation) fleas, mites, ticks, keds, lice, and
          flies, and their larvae. Although the invention may not
          provide the dramatic results usually expected of a synthetic
          insecticide applied in an adequate concentration (or one
          including natural components such as pyrethroids) it does tilt
          the balance of the ecology of the animal's insect burden and
          has met the requirements for materials for use in organic
          fanning. Interestingly this example includes no plant or soil
          life forms and the nature of the composition may be altered
          from that given in relation to example 1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Variations</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0064] The invention may be
          extended to the provision of specific micro-organisms found to
          be compatible with applications of mixtures according to the
          invention, mixed with the invention or supplied separately for
          co-application. The mixture may be presented in a less acidic
          form if living material is included. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0065] The invention can be used on
          the surroundings of animals such as barns (holding straw and
          fertiliser) and in parts of fields such as around drinking
          troughs or sleeping areas. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0066] Fertilisers, micronutrients
          and trace elements may be added to the mixture as indicated,
          as long as they are compatible. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY AND
            ADVANTAGES</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0067] This includes notes relating
          to Industrial Applications. [0068] 1. Use 1:1000 dilution or,
          if required, a more concentrated form for crop and stock
          applications. (Most other nutrient and natural pesticide
          products are applied as a 1% solution). Rate: 0.5 litres per
          hectare for row crops, 1 litre per hectare for established
          plants (such as grapes, tree crops, etc). [0069] 2. Repeat
          every 7-21 days. [0070] 3. The diluted spray has a knock down
          effect on insect pests. (but not if used in vitro--in the
          absence of a living ecosystem) [0071] 4. Has fungicidal effect
          on plants and stock [0072] 5. Appears to build immunity to
          pests and disease. [0073] 6. Appears to reduce physical damage
          on crops and stock from insect, disease and environmental
          stresses. [0074] 7. Acts as a growth stimulant. [0075] 8.
          Reduced odour in the barns and other stock holding
          environments. [0076] 9. Speeds up healing of damaged plant
          tissue. [0077] 10. Has synergistic growth promoting effect
          when 1% fish nutrient is added to the diluted spray mix and
          applied to crops. [0078] 11. Toxicological tests show that the
          product when used as recommended has no adverse toxicological
          effect on marine life or animals and is benign in the
          environment. [0079] 12. The composition, being based on
          plants, minerals and extracts, all derived from sustainably
          harvested renewable resources, comprises a "Certified Organic
          Input" product to support intensive farming without voiding
          the organic status of the produce. The product has a broad
          seasonal relevant application time, and no "with-holding
          periods" are involved. It is a sustainably produced product.
          [0080] 13. The resulting composition comprises an organic
          nutrient that invigorates the ecosystem and enables production
          of clean and healthy crops and stock in intensive farming;
          also sustains intensive farm (including horticultural)
          production. [0081] 14. The resulting composition boosts the
          natural synergistic system that cleans, nourishes, protects
          and recycles materials to sustain an invigorated eco-system.
          [0082] 15. The resulting composition acts as a tonic that
          boosts immune, health, healing and digestive systems in crops
          and stock. [0083] 16. The resulting composition does not work
          like conventional pesticides or medicines which are usually
          single-purpose treatments although they may have deleterious
          side-effects. [0084] 17. Because the composition works through
          a system rather than on a single target it delivers a range of
          benefits in intensive farming. By working on the biological
          system as a whole rather than on "targets" the composition
          provides treatments that are environmentally benign, generally
          applicable (rather than specific to a particular disease) and
          non toxic. [0085] 18. The composition simulates the combined
          benefits of an insecticide, fungicide, growth regulator and
          fertiliser when applied within the ecosystem. [0086] 19. The
          composition is not effective in a sterile environment. Its
          actions and benefits are mainly derived from its stimulating
          action on microbial and other living components of the
          ecosystem. [0087] 20. The composition, when applied to plants
          or stock, also has an immediate reducing effect on the insect
          population (indirect knock down properties). Plants and
          animals appear to resist disease infection. They overcome
          environmental stress. The overall result is clean and healthy
          crops and stock. </p>
