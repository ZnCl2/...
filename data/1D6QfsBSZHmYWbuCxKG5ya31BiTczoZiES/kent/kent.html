      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      KISSCARE ULTRA creates a non-stick surface that seals and protects
      natural teeth and dentures from stains, sticky foods and plaque
      for up to six months.<br>
      <br>
      KISSCARE ULTRA, from WDR Scientific in the US, resists acid,
      reducing the damaging effects of dental caries. It has also been
      shown to seal newly bleached tooth surfaces while acting as a
      desensitiser, protecting teeth from sensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      KISSCARE ULTRA can easily be applied to natural or artificial
      teeth. It is a tasteless, non-toxic and non-flammable self-bonding
      polymer gel that works by turning the surface it is applied to
      into inert silicone. The gel can be applied without complicated
      tools or procedures on two full arches in less than ten minutes,
      using only a cotton swab, floss or a prophy cup. The product does
      not eliminate the need for normal oral hygiene.<br>

      <br>
      Polymer compositions and methods of making them are provided.
      Selected surface layers of the polymers, integral with the polymer
      body, possess pressure sensitive adhesive properties. The polymers
      are cured with the selected surfaces in contact with a
      cross-linking inhibition agent which controls the amount of
      cross-linking of the polymer taking place at the surface. The
      polymers are useful as, or in conjunction with, prosthetic
      appliances which are adhered to skin or other substrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to polymeric compositions and their
      preparation, which compositions when cured have an integral
      permanently tacky surface layer, and more particularly to
      self-adhering polymers used as prosthetic appliances.<br>
      <br>
      Our society places a heavy emphasis on physical attributes.
      Because of this, a person with a congenital, developmental, or
      acquired defect may be considered by some as socially unacceptable
      subconsciously, if not overtly. Such defects also affect a
      person's self-image. Since facial appearance and expression are
      both highly visible and a primary means of communication, defects
      of the head and neck areas are more socially traumatic than
      defects of other body parts. The preparation of maxillofacial
      prosthetics requires the use of both art and science in
      reconstructing defects using polymeric synthetic materials The
      goal of maxillofacial prosthetics is establishing function, fit,
      appearance, and physiology.<br>
      <br>
      There are two general categories of maxillofacial prosthetics,
      namely, intraoral and extraoral. Intraoral prostheses are usually
      fabricated in association with a partial or complete denture.
      Retention of intraoral prostheses usually pose few problems except
      in a completely edentulous patient having markedly resorbed
      ridges, poor quality bony or soft tissue undercuts, and a bulky or
      weighty obturator. Extraoral prostheses pose more retentive as
      well as aesthetic problems. A major problem for a patient wearing
      an extraoral prosthetic device is the potential for dislodgement,
      and concomitant patient embarassment during normal activity.<br>
      <br>
      A number of different types of polymeric materials have been
      utilized as base materials for prostheses. Principal among these
      polymers have been the silicone rubbers and polyurethanes. These
      elastomeric polymers are used for most extraoral prostheses
      because of the life-like qualities that can be imparted to them.
      These qualities include flexibility and the ability to be colored.
      This coloring is accomplished by adding fibers or pigment to the
      prepolymer or by tattooing the completed prostheses to conform
      them closely to the skin tones of the areas contiguous to the
      reconstructive site.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical inertness of these polymers once cured is a major
      factor in their popularity in maxillofacial prosthetic
      reconstruction. However, the same chemical inertness and
      inherently non-stick properties which makes polymers such as
      silicone rubbers desirable prosthetic materials also is the cause
      of the majority of difficulties in working with them. While in
      some cases the use of surgery to provide tissue undercuts to aid
      in mechanically retaining a prosthesis is possible, in many other
      cases adhesives alone, or in combination with other mechanical
      retention aids such as wires, elastics, or eyeglasses, must be
      used as the primary means for retention. For example, a prosthetic
      ear may have virtually no other means for retention than an
      adhesive. This is also true in most cases where the defect is
      large or cannot be surgically modified to provide mechanical
      retention.<br>
      <br>
      At the present time, we know of no completely satisfactory and
      medically safe adhesive for routinely securing, and regularly
      detaching for hygienic purposes, prosthetic devices. The problems
      of applying adhesives to and retaining them on inherently
      non-stick surfaces, such as silicone rubber, are readily apparent.
      These problems are compounded by the presence of surface
      contaminants such as dirt, oils, and dead skin on the tissue to
      which the prosthetic device is to be applied. Once cured, many
      adhesives no longer are sticky and will not bond again after
      removal. Also, many adhesives that have pressure sensitive
      properties lose their adherent properties once their surface has
      been contaminated.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the need exists in the art for medically acceptable
      polymer compositions suitable for use as prosthetic devices which
      possess permanently adherent, properties and which can be
      repetitively applied and detached from human skin or other
      surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention meets this need by providing polymer
      compositions, and methods for their preparation, with integral
      surface layers having permanently tacky, pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties and which are suitable for use as prosthetic
      appliances. Many polymeric materials are useful in the practice of
      the present invention, with preferred polymers being those which
      are cured or vulcanized by a crosslinking reaction of monomeric,
      prepolymeric, or unvulcanized polymeric components and mixtures
      thereof. Most preferred for use as prosthetic appliances are
      so-called "medical grade" compositions which are physiologically
      inert.<br>
      <br>
      We have found that an integral surface layer having
      pressure-sensitive adhesive properties may be formed on an
      otherwise fully cured polymeric body. This may be accomplished by
      applying a sufficient amount of a cross-linking inhibition agent
      to selected surfaces of a mold cavity prior to packing the cavity
      with uncured monomeric, prepolymeric, or unvulcanized polymeric
      material. The mold is then closed and the material cured. The
      cross-linking inhibition agent acts on the surface or surfaces of
      the polymer to prevent complete cross-linking thereof. The body of
      the polymer is otherwise completely cured and has the same
      properties as would be expected. Conventional additives such as
      fibers and fillers may be added to the uncured compound and have
      no effect on the integral surface layer which is formed.<br>
      <br>
      However, the surface or surfaces of the polymeric body which were
      cured in contact with the cross-linking inhibition agent remain
      tacky and possess pressure sensitive adhesive properties. We
      believe that these pressure sensitive adhesive properties result
      from the absence of complete cross-linking of the surface layer of
      the polymeric body. Thus, the surface of the body presents a
      multiplicity of elastomeric "fingers" or "hairs" which are an
      integral part of an otherwise completely cured polymeric body. We
      believe that it is the multiplicity of "fingers" or "hairs" and
      their chemical nature which, when placed in contact with a
      substrate, cause the polymeric body to adhere to the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric composition of the present invention has particular
      utility when used as a prosthetic appliance for attachment to
      human skin. The appliance can be repetitively applied and detached
      from skin, or other surfaces, without loss of effectiveness of its
      adhesive properties. Because the adhesive surface layer is
      integral with the body of the appliance, little or no adhesive
      will debond or leave a residue on the skin or other surface.
      Additionally, simple washing of the adhesive surface layer with
      soapy water or solvents such as acetone or alcohol will
      effectively remove any built-up contaminant layers of oils,
      greases, dirt, or undesirable biota. After drying, the original
      adhesive quality of the surface will be restored.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide
      apolymeric composition having an integral surface layer with
      pressure sensitive adhesive properties useful in prosthetic
      appliances. This and other objects and advantages of the invention
      will become apparent from the following detailed description and
      the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many polymeric materials may be applicable in the practice of the
      present invention. Examples of polymers previously used in or as
      prosthetic appliances include acrylics, polyurethanes, silicones,
      polyesters, polyolefins, polyacrylamides, and polyether-urethane
      copolymers. Other suitable, medically acceptable polymers are also
      well known to those skilled in the art. We have found that the
      surface of a polymeric material can be modified by the practice of
      the present invention to give that surface pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties even though the remainder of the body of the
      polymer exhibits no adhesive properties and may, in fact, exhibit
      so-called "nonstick" properties. Silicone rubbers are a prime
      example of this. The polymers presently preferred in the practice
      of the present invention are silicone elastomers and specifically
      polydimethylsiloxanes because of their ready availability and
      acceptance for medical applications.<br>
      <br>
      Without wishing to be limited to any specific theory or mechanism,
      we believe that the application of certain agents, which we will
      term cross-linking inhibition agents, to one or more selected
      surfaces of a mold cavity will inhibit the degree of cross-linking
      which occurs on the surface of the polymeric composition during a
      curing or vulcanization step. This results in a surface layer
      which presents a multiplicity of elastomeric polymer chains which
      at one end are integral with the body of the otherwise fully cured
      polymer but at the other end are free. We have found several
      suitable cross-linking inhibition agents including cyanoacrylate
      polymers and metal salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous
      octoate. Those skilled in the art may determine other suitable
      cross-linking inhibition agents by simple testing.<br>
      <br>
      The polymer compositions of the present invention are preferably
      cured or vulcanized in a mold to form a variety of shapes and
      prosthetic appliances. A preferred material for the mold is dental
      stone, although other mold materials such as metals or the like
      may be used. After fabrication of the mold, the cross-linking
      inhibition agent is applied to one or more selected surfaces of
      the mold cavity, namely those surfaces which correspond to
      surfaces on the finished polymer or prosthetic appliance for which
      a pressure-sensitive adhesive surface layer is desired. The
      cross-linking inhibition agent may be applied by any suitable
      means such as brushing or spraying and allowed to dry. In many
      instances, the ease of application of the cross-linking inhibition
      agent may be enhanced by the use of a solvent such as acetone or
      alcohol. The amount of cross-linking inhibition agent applied will
      affect the depth of the surface layer having pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties which is formed. By modifying the amount of
      cross-linking inhibition applied to the surface of the mold cavity
      one can control the surface adhesive properties on the cured
      polymer.<br>
      <br>
      After the cross-linking inhibition agent is dried, the monomeric,
      prepolymeric, or unvulcanized composition is packed into the mold
      cavity and the mold closed. <br>
      <br>
      Depending upon the particular composition utilized, vulcanization
      or curing is then carried out at temperatures and times sufficient
      for the body of the composition to cure completely. Curing times
      and temperatures for specific compositions are well-known to those
      skilled in the art. For example, if silicone rubber is being
      cured, it may be a room temperature vulcanizing rubber or one that
      requires the application of heat (e.g., 150 DEG-250 DEG F.).
      Conventional additives such as fibers or fillers may be premixed
      with the uncured composition.<br>
      <br>
      After curing has been completed, the mold is allowed to cool (if
      necessary) and the finished composition or prosthetic appliance is
      removed. The surface or surfaces of the polymer body which were
      cured in contact with the cross-linking inhibition agent will
      exhibit pressure sensitive adhesive properties, whereas the body
      of the polymer will otherwise exhibit those properties (i.e.,
      strength, tear resistance, etc.) which would be expected of a
      fully cured polymer.<br>
      <br>
      The surface layer of the polymer retains its pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties for the life of the polymer and remains
      integrally attached thereto. The surface layer may be secured to
      human skin or other substrates and repeatedly detached and
      reattached. If the surface layer becomes contaminated with oils,
      dirt, or undesirable biota, it may be readily cleaned and restored
      to its original state after drying by washing it with soapy water,
      acetone, or other suitable cleaning agents.<br>
      <br>
      In order that those skilled in the art can better understand how
      the present invention can be practised, the following nonlimiting
      examples are given by way of illustration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A mold was fabricated using air mixed dental stone (commercially
      available under the designation of Denstone from Columbus Dental
      Manufacturing Co., Columbus, Ohio) and a water/powder ratio of 30
      cc/100gm. Selected surfaces of the mold cavity were painted with a
      cross-linking inhibition agent comprising a mixture of stannous
      octoate and denatured alcohol (1:10 ratio) and allowed to air dry.
      The mold cavity was then packed with a catalyzed, deaerated
      silicone prepolymer designated MDX4-4210 and commercially
      available from Dow Corning Corp., Midland, Michigan. The silicone
      prepolymer is believed to be a polydimethylsiloxane based silicone
      elastomer. After the mold was closed, vulcanization was
      accelerated by heating the mold at 200 DEG-220 DEG F. for
      approximately 2 hours. After the mold was cooled, the resulting
      polymer body was removed.<br>
      <br>
      The silicone rubber body exhibited the expected physical
      properties of a fully cured material except for those surfaces
      which had been cured in contact with the cross-linking inhibition
      agent. Those surfaces exhibited tack and pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The surface of a dental stone mold (Denstone) was cleaned
      successively by application of soap and water, carbon
      tetrachloride, chloroform, and methanol and then air dried. A
      cyanoacrylate alpha-or iso-cyanoacrylate cross-linking inhibition
      agent was applied to selected surfaces of the mold and allowed to
      air dry. The mold cavity was then packed with a catalyzed,
      deaerated silicone prepolymer (MDX4-4210) and the mold closed. The
      silicone was vulcanized by heating the mold at 80 DEG C. for 24
      hours. After cooling, the polymer body was removed from the mold.
      The surfaces of the polymer which were cured in contact with the
      cross-linking inhibition agent were tacky and exhibited pressure
      sensitive adhesive properties.<br>
      <br>
      The same experiment was run under the same conditions as above
      with the exception that the mold was packed with the silicone
      prepolymer before the cross-linking inhibition agent had dried.
      After 24 hours, the polymer had not cured indicating that the
      cyanoacrylate should be allowed to dry before the mold is packed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The surface of a dental stone mold was cleaned as in Example 2
      above and dried. A cyanoacrylate (alpha- or iso-cyanoacrylate)
      cross-linking inhibition agent was applied to selected surfaces of
      the mold and allowed to air dry. The dry cyanoacrylate was then
      coated with the catalyst for MDX4-4210 and the catalyst allowed to
      dry. <br>
      <br>
      The mold was then packed with catalyzed, deaerated MDX4-4210
      silicone prepolymer and vulcanized as in Example 2. The resulting
      polymer surfaces which had cured in contact with the cross-linking
      inhibition agent and catalyst were tacky and exhibited pressure
      sensitive adhesive properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that a stannous
      octoate catalyst was applied over the dried cyanoacrylate and the
      silicone prepolymer packed in the mold was GE RTV11 (commercially
      available from the General Electric Co.). Again, the surfaces of
      the polymer body which had cured in contact with the cross-linking
      inhibition agent and catalyst were tacky and exhibited pressure
      sensitive adhesive properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that a stannous
      octoate catalyst was applied over the dried cyanoacrylate and the
      silicone prepolymer packed in the mold was Silastic 382
      (commercially available from Dow Corning Corp.). Once again, the
      surfaces of the polymer body which had cured in contact with the

          <b>Self-adhesive, drag reducing polymeric coating</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A self-adhering polymeric composition for use as a drag-reducing
      fouling-release coating and a method for making such composition.
      The composition, which is formed by&nbsp; mixing a base polymer
      with a curing catalyst and immediately adding trace amounts of a
      inhibitor modifier to the mixture, produces a high integrity
      coating with a surface extended network of differentially
      cross-linked chains that reach into and control the flow/adhesion
      properties in the liquid phase.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to polymeric compositions and, more
      particularly, if directed towards self-adhering polymeric
      composition for use as a drag reducing <br>
      coating.<br>
      <br>
      Various coatings have been developed for reducing drag between two
      surfaces in relative motion. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,937,976
      discloses a drag reducing gel for a razor blade and U.S. Pat. No.
      4,385,134 teaches use of a drag reducing, antifouling coating for
      boat hulls.<br>
      <br>
      The primary cause of drag on boat hulls is the growth of marine
      organisms on the hull. Generally, antiflouling coatings contain a
      toxicant agent which controls the growth of marine organisms. In
      such coatings it is necessary to control the amount of toxin
      delivered to the surface coating in order to prevent premature
      depletion of the antifouling agent. Other patents relating to drag
      reducing compositions for boat hulls include U.S. Pat. Nos.
      3,575,123; 3,896,753; and 3,990,381. A need has arisen for an
      improved drag reducing coating for marine use which does not
      require use of a toxicant agent.<br>
      <br>
      Also, there is a need for drag reducing composition which can be
      readily manufactured in form which can be easily applied to the
      surface of the object to be protected. Such a drag reducing
      composition should ideally be paintable or sprayable on the object
      surface and act to protect the underlying surface from degradation
      by bacterial decay, oxidation, water seepage and the like. Once
      such a drag reduction and/or protective coating is applied to an
      object surface, the coating should readily adhere to the surface,
      remain in such adherence, and itself be relatively inert to
      ambient sources of degradation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In accordance with the invention there is provided a mothod for
      producing a polymeric composition comprising the steps of: bulk
      mixing a base polymer forming material with a catalyst;
      immediately adding trace amounts of a cross-linking inhibitor to
      the bulk mixture; and curing and polymerizing the inhibited bulk
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The base polymer forming material preferably includes one or more
      of a monomer unit of a polymer, a prepolymer of polymer, or an
      unvulcanized form of the polymer which is preferably selected from
      the group of silicones, polyrethanes, polyacrylics, polyesters,
      polyolefins, polyacrylamides and polyether-urethane polymers.<br>
      <br>
      There is also provided a method for producing a drag reducing
      polymer composition comprising the steps of: selecting a base
      compound comprising polymer forming units bulk mixing the base
      compound with a catalyst in an amount sufficient to polymerize
      essentially all of the polymer forming units; and adding a cross
      linking inhibition agent to the bulk mixture. In one example, the
      cross linking inhibition agent is added immediately after the step
      of bulk mixing is carried out. The cross-linking inhibition agent
      is preferably added in an amount sufficient to inhibit
      cross-linking to a predetermined degree. The mixture is typically
      subjected to polymerization conditions, such as heating, mixing,
      solution in solvent and the like, for a predetermined amount of
      time sufficient to effect predetermined amount of polymerization <br>
      and cross-linking.<br>
      <br>
      The base compound typically includes unvulcanized silicon based
      polymers, and the inhibition agent is preferably added in a trace
      amount. The mixture of polymer forming material may be allowed to
      begin polymerizing, but only a slight degree, before the
      inhibition agent is added.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention there is also provided a blend of
      one or more of a selected monomer, a prepolymer of the monomer,
      and a polymer of the monomer; a catalyst for causing unpolymerized
      components of the blend to polymerize and cross-link with the
      catalyst being added to the blend in an amount sufficient to
      polymerize and cross-link essentially all of the unpolymerized
      components of the blend; and a trace amount of a modifier which
      inhibits cross-linking, wherein, in one embodiment, the modifier
      is added to the blend and the catalyst essentially immediately
      after the blend. The monomer preferably comprises a monomer unit
      of one or more of a silicone, polyurethane, acrylic, polyester,
      polyolefin, polycrylamide or polyether-urethane copolymer.<br>
      <br>
      An integral surface layer having pressure-sensitive adhesive
      properties may be formed on an otherwise fully cured polymeric
      body by applying a sufficient amount of a&nbsp; cross-linking
      inhibition agent to selected surfaces of a mold cavity prior to
      packing the cavity with uncured monomeric, prepolymeric, or
      unvulcanized polymeric material. The mold is then closed and the
      material cured. The cross-linking inhibition agent acts on the
      surface or surfaces of the polymer to prevent complete
      cross-linking thereof. The body of the polymer is otherwise
      completely cured and has the same properties as would be expected
      of a fully polymerized and cross-linked composition. Conventional
      additives such as fibers and fillers may be added to the uncured
      compound and have no effect on the integral surface layer which is
      formed. <br>
      <br>
      In applications where selected surfaces of a polymerized body are
      treated with inhibition agent, the surface or surfaces of the
      polymeric body which are cured in contact with the cross-linking
      inhibition agent remain tacky and possess pressure sensitive
      adhesive properties. The present invention deals with treatment of
      the bulk prepolymer rather then treatment of selected surfaces of
      the prepolymer.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      self-adhering polymeric composition for use as a drag reducing
      coating. Self-adhering as used in this application means that the
      composition will adhere to a surface to be coated without special
      treatment of the surface.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a
      self-adhering polymeric composition for use as a fouling release,
      drag reducing coating.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for
      forming a self-adhering composition for use as a drag reducing
      coating. The coating is produced by inhibiting and permanently
      arresting the process of curing of a polymer. The method of
      forming the polymeric composition includes the steps of mixing a
      base polymer with a catalyst, and adding trace amounts of a
      modifier to the mixture. Preferably, the resultant composition is
      heated to accelerate the polymerization process. The resulting
      composition is a high integrity coating with all the useful
      engineering features of the bulk polymer with a surface network of
      differential cross-linked chains that reach into and control the
      flow/adhesion properties in the liquid phase.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the
      following detailed description of preferred embodiments:<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The drag reducing polymer composition of the invention may be
      produced from a base polymer composition any one or more of a
      selected unvulcanized polymer, a prepolymer thereof, a monomer
      unit of the selected polymer or a mixture of one or more or all of
      the foregoing. The polymers, prepolymers thereof and monomer units
      of such polymers preferred for use in producing the drag reducing
      composition include silicones, polyurethanes, polyacrylics,
      polyesters, polyolefins, polyacrylamides and polyetherurethane
      copolymers. The polymers presently preferred in the practice of
      the present invention are silicone elastomers and specifically
      polydimethylsiloxanes because of their ready availability.<br>
      <br>
      The base polymer composition is mixed in bulk with a catalyst
      which catalyzes both straight chain polymerizaton and
      cross-linking. The catalyst selected is typically peculiar to
      catalysis of the selected monomer units of the polymers to be
      formed, and is preferably added in an amount sufficient to
      polymerize and/or cross-link essentially all of the polymer
      forming material of the base polymer composition. In the case, for
      example, where a silicone polymer composition is to be formed, the
      selected base polymer composition including catalyst may comprise
      one or more MDX-4-4210, SILGARD 194, AND SILGARD 196 silicone
      prepolymers commercially available from the Dow Corning Corp., GTE
      RTVII, a prepolymer commercially available from the General
      Electric Co. In the case of MDX-4-4210, one part of the catalyst
      is mixed with each ten parts by weight of the base material. The
      catalysts employed for polymerization of such base compositions,
      catalyze a condensation reaction between the silicon elements
      which are typically bonded to one or more hydroxy or halogeno
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      When the catalyst and base polymer forming units are mixed in
      bulk, a modifier, typically an inhibition agent, is added to the
      mixture. Preferably, the modifier is added to the mixture
      essentially immediately after the mixing of the catalyst and base
      polymer forming units. In one example, trace amounts of an
      inhibitor is added to the bulk mixture of the base polymer and
      catalyst. Where silicone prepolymer compositions are employed, the
      process is most preferably assisted by heating the base
      polymer/catalyst/modifier mixture to at least about 100 degrees
      Centigrade for at least about 20 minutes. Preferred modifiers,
      which are imcompatible with the normal polymerization process and
      permanently inhibit and arrest polymerization before it is
      completed, include metals salts of carboxylic acids, most
      preferably stannous <br>
      octoate.<br>
      <br>
      The consistency of the drag reducing polymer composition may be
      controlled by controlling the degree of polymerization. The degree
      of polymerization may be controlled by accelerating or
      decelerating the conditions favoring polymerization such as by
      increasing or decreasing temperature for longer or shorter periods
      of time, allowing the base composition to begin polymerization to
      some predetermined degree before adding an inhibition agent,
      increasing or decreasing the amount of catalyst and the like.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting drag reducing composition may range in consistency
      from a wax-like substance to a runny liquid depending upon the
      predetermined degree of polymerization allowed. Preferably the
      composition is produced in such a consistency that the resulting
      mixture may be directly painted on the surface of an object to be
      protected. <br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding the physical consistency of the resulting mixture,
      the mixture may be thinned, i.e., dissolved, in conventional
      organic solvents such as fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, ethers,
      ketones and the like, to any predetermined degree to aid in the
      ready application of the resulting drag reducing polymer
      composition. In any event, once the composition is inhibited,
      polymerization is permanently arrested. Application of additional
      catalysts, heat or other standard modalities will not cause
      further vulcanization of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      Without wishing to be limited to any specific theory or mechanism,
      we believe that the application of certain agents, which we will
      term permanent cross-linking inhibition agents, will permanently
      inhibit the degree of cross-linking of the polymeric composition
      which occurs during a curing or vulcanization step. This results
      in a multiplicity of elastomeric polymer chains. Several suitable
      cross-linking inhibition agents specific to prepolymers such as
      MDX4-4210 include metal salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous
      octoate. Prepolymers such as MDX4-4210; SILGARD 184 and 186; and
      SILASTIC 31-10, 31-12 and 31-20 are compatable with inhibitors
      such as chlorinated and butyl rubbers; most other room temperature
      vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubbers; sulphur containing solvents;
      plasticizers; and tin containing compounds. Prepolymer such as
      SILASTIC 382, General Electric RTV-11 are compatable with
      inhibitors such as oxidizing oils; linseed oils; putties; oil
      containing clays; and plastizers, specifically amine containing
      plasticizers. Those skilled in the art may determine other
      suitable cross-linking inhibition agents by simple testing.<br>
