            crisis</b></big></div>
      <b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mattoon, IL -- Ken Wiseley, high school dropout, one-time
      journeyman auto machnaic and now an inventor with 96 patents [ ?
      ], claims to have produced a prototype electromagnetic engine that
      could end the energy crisis.<br>
      <br>
      But Gerald Saletta, an assistant professor of electrical
      engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago,
      said Wiseley's engine is nothing but a new version of fabled
      perpetual motion machine that "violates all the principles of
      physics".<br>
      <br>
      Wiseley, 43, who works out of a tiny one-room wooden building in
      Mattoon, said his engine "is the end result of 30 years of
      mechanical tinkering."<br>
      <br>
      His 10-pound prototype engine "turns out 20 to 25 horsepower", he
      says. A 200-pounder could produce enough electricity to light the
      entire city of Mattoon, whose population is 19,800, he says.<br>
      <br>
      In design, Wiseley says, the engine is very like an internal
      combustion engine. It contains steel pistons inside aluminum
      cylinders.<br>
      <br>
      At the top of each cylinder is an electromagnet. The magnetic
      poles of the electromagnet are constantly reversed from positive
      to negative, and thus cause the pistons to go up and down.<br>
      <br>
      Once it gets going -- you start it with a 12-volt battery -- the
      engine is self-generating", Wiseley said. "It can be used in
      autos, in homes to run everything electrical, including heating
      them. The cost would be about $2000."<br>
      <br>
      Saletta said if Wiseley's machine actually does what he claims,
      "then he's really got a whiz-bang -- he's got something better
      than Commonwealth Edison."<br>
      <br>
      Wiseley apparently contemplates turning off the battery after he
      gets the engine started, Saletta said, and that would leave him
      with nothing to power his electromagnets, the heart of the system.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a basic law of physics that you can't get energy out without
      putting something in", Saletta said. "He may well have gotten a
      machine started that seems to work. But he won't get any more out
      of it than he puts in."<br>

      <br>
      A magnetic motor wherein a piston mounted magnet is reciprocated
      through a predetermined stroke in timed relation to polarity
      reversal of a pair of electro-magnetic assemblies at opposite
      axial ends of the piston cylinder. Polarity reversal and the
      intensity of the magnetic field is varied as a function of piston
      movement through a distributor to control the output of the motor.
      Hysteresis and flux leakage is reduced by an arrangement of
      permanent magnets and magnetic spheroids associated with one of
      the electro-magnetic assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to the conversion of electrical energy into
      mechanical energy and more particularly to a magnetic motor of the
      reciprocating type.<br>
      <br>
      Reciprocating types of magnetic motors wherein a magnetic piston
      is reciprocated relative to a varying magnetic field, is well
      known. Such magnetic motors have not performed efficiently and
      have not therefore been generally adopted for commercial or
      industrial purposes. One of the main drawbacks of such magnetic
      motors, has been the energy losses resulting from hysteresis and
      flux leakage. It is therefore an important object of the present
      invention to provide a more efficient magnetic motor of the
      reciprocating type which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks of
      prior art arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art of which applicant is aware, includes the
      disclosures in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,394,295, 3,444,402, 3,534,203,
      3,539,845 and 3,686,521.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, a permanent magnet
      secured to a reciprocating piston, is reciprocated through a
      predetermined stroke within a cylinder on which a pair of
      electro-magnetic devices are mounted adjacent opposite axial ends.
      The current conducted through the magnetic field producing
      windings associated with the electro-magnetic devices, is
      controlled through a distributor to both produce a reversal in
      polarity of the magnetic fields and to vary the magnitude of the
      magnetic fields between polarity reversals in order to maintain
      reciprocating movement of the piston by magnetic attraction and
      repulsion. In order to reduce hysteresis, and the energy losses
      incident thereto, a plurality of magnetic spheroids are immersed
      in a body of damping fluid enclosed within a cavity disposed in
      axial alignment with the flux emitting face associated with one of
      the electro-magnetic devices. Sector shaped permanent magnets
      angularly spaced in enclosing relation to the magnetic field
      producing winding together with axially spaced permanent bar
      magnets of opposite polarity, are mounted on the core associated
      with the aforementioned electro-magnetic device in order to
      concentrate magnetic flux through the reciprocating piston magnet
      to thereby reduce flux leakage.<br>
      <br>
      These together with other objects and advantages which will become
      subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and
      operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed,
      reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part
      hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>

      One form of a magnetic reciprocating motor constructed in
      accordance with the present invention, is shown in FIG. 1 and is
      generally denoted by reference numeral 10. The motor includes a
      base 12 to which a vertical, tubular housing or cylinder 14 is
      bolted by means of fasteners 16 extending through a flange 18
      formed at the lower end of the cylinder. A pair of electromagnetic
      assemblies 20 and 22 are mounted on the cylinder adjacent opposite
      axial ends. A rotating mechanical output is obtained from the
      motor through a power shaft extending horizontally from the base
      to which an output pulley wheel 24 may be connected. The pulley
      wheel may be drivingly connected to any desired mechanical load or
      to an electrical generator.<br>
      <br>
      As diagrammatically shown in FIG. 9, energy may be supplied to the
      motor 10 from an electrical source 26 through a speed control
      device 28 and a distributor 30. A driving connection 32 is
      provided between the output of the motor and the distributor 30 in
      order to control the supply of electrical energy to the motor as a
      function of the mechanical movement produced by the motor.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 3 in particular, the base 12 and cylinder 14
      are preferably made of a non-ferrous metal such as aluminum. The
      cylinder is internally provided with guide rails 34 to guide
      slidable reciprocating movement of a piston member 36 to which an
      elongated cylindrical shaped permanent magnet 38 of smaller
      diameter is threadedly connected by means of the threaded
      connector 40. Keyway slots 35 are formed in the piston member 36
      for slidably receiving the guide rails 34. The radial clearance
      between the cylinder 14 and the magnet 38 will form a cooling
      passage for air circulation during reciprocation of the magnet to
      help maintain the proper temperature, as more clearly seen in FIG.
      5. The piston member 36 is connected by means of a wrist pin 42 to
      a connecting rod 44 which extends into the base 12 from the
      cylinder. The connecting rod is connected by means of a crankpin
      46 to a crank 48 to which the output shaft of the motor is
      connected. The piston member 36, and the connecting rod 44 are
      made of non-magnetic materials such as stainless steel. Thus, the
      flux path for the magnetic field generated by the electro-magnetic
      devices 20 and 22 is mostly confined to paths extending axially
      through the reciprocating permanent magnet 38 connected to the
      piston member.<br>
      <br>
      The electro-magnetic assembly 20 includes a core made of aluminum
      and generally referred to by reference numeral 50. The core 50
      includes a cylindrical portion 52 which extends from a flux
      emitting face 53 closing the upper end of the cylinder 14 and an
      annular spool portion 54 to which the upper flange 56 of the
      cylinder is connected by fasteners 58. A magnetic field producing
      winding 60 is mounted within the spool portion 54 of the core 50
      and is electrically connected to the source of electrical energy
      26 as aforementioned through the distributor 30 as will be
      explained in detail hereafter. The other electromagnetic assembly
      22 also includes a core 62 made of aluminum and secured to the
      cylinder 14 adjacent the lower end. The core 62 also includes a
      spool portion 64 on which a magnetic field producing winding 66 is
      mounted, the winding 66 also being connected to the source of
      electrical energy through the distributor 30. A protective flange
      68 extends from the core 62 in parallel spaced relationship to the
      spool portion 64.<br>
      <br>
      The direction of current and the magnitude of current is
      controlled through the distributor in order to maintain a smooth
      and continuous reciprocating movement of the magnet 38 by magnetic
      attraction and repulsion. Toward that end, the electrical source
      26 such as a battery as illustrated in FIG. 8, is connected
      through a rheostat type of speed control 28 to the rotating wiper
      arms associated with variable resistors 70, 72, 74 and 76. The
      resistors or distributor coils 70 and 72 are interconnected in
      series with the electromagnetic winding 60 so as to vary the
      resistance connected in series therewith as an inverse function of
      wiper arm movement. The rheostat winding 70 is therefore wound so
      that its coil spacing increases in the direction of wiper arm
      movement during a phase somewhat less than 180 DEG during which
      current, decreasing at a rate proportional to movement of magnet
      38 is conducted through winding 60 to generate a magnetically
      attractive force between magnet 38 and magnetic assembly 20.
      During the next 180 DEG phase, current is directed in the opposite
      direction through winding 60 by wiper contact with rheostat
      winding 72 to generate a repelling force between magnet 38 and the
      assembly 20. The rheostat windings 74 and 76 operate in a similar
      fashion but are synchronized so that current is conducted through
      winding 66 to generate a magnetic force opposite to the force
      generated by current in winding 60. The resistor wiper arms are
      drivingly connected in any suitable fashion to the mechanical
      output of the motor in order to synchronize the reciprocating
      movement of the piston with the change in the resistances
      connected in series with the electro-magnetic windings 60 and 66.
      The energizing circuit through the windings 60 and 66 in series
      with the resistances is completed through polarity reversing
      switch devices 78 and 80 which are also rotated by the driving
      connection 32. By means of the foregoing arrangement, the
      variation in the intensity of the magnetic field and the polarity
      of the magnetic field established by the electro-magnetic
      assemblies 20 and 22 will be varied in proper relation to the
      reciprocating motion of the piston to yield a smooth, continuous
      power output without undue jarring of the piston magnet 38. The
      speed of the motor output and the associated torque, may be varied
      by controlling the magnitude of the current conducted through the
      electro-magnetic coils and toward that end, the speed controlling
      rheostat 28 is adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      In order to concentrate the energy associated with the magnetic
      fields produced by the electro-magnetic assemblies, each of the
      electro-magnetic assemblies is provided with a plurality of
      sector-shaped, permanent magnets 82. As more clearly seen in FIG.
      7, each of the magnets 82 includes parallel spaced plate portions
      84 interconnected by a radially outer arcuate connector portion 86
      that converge outwardly to an edge 88. The magnets 82 have pole
      faces along the radially inner edges 90. The permanent magnets 82
      are positioned on the spool portions 54 and 64 of the
      electro-magnetic cores in angularly spaced relationship to each
      other as more clearly seen in FIGS. 2 and 4 to thereby embrace the
      electro-magnetic windings 60 and 66 mounted within the spool
      portions of the cores. The sector-shaped magnets 82 are retained
      in position by pairs of annular retainer rings 92 engaging the
      arcuate portions 86 of the magnets above and below the edges 88,
      each pair of retainer rings 92 being interconnected by fastener
      assemblies 94 as more clearly seen in FIG. 3. Furthermore, the
      permanent magnets 82 are of opposite polarity adjacent to each
      other as indicated in FIGS. 2 and 4. According to one theory, the
      permanent magnets 82 confine the energy of the electro-magnetic
      fields produced by current in the windings to smaller orbits about
      the coils of the windings. Further, the alternate polarity of the
      permanent magnets 82 will augment the energy confining effect of
      the magnets by virtue of their physical relationship to the
      electro-magnetic windings.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent escape of magnetic energy or flux leakage,
      radially positioned bar magnets 96 are positioned in axially
      spaced relationship to each other within cylindrical bores 98
      formed in the core 50 as more clearly seen in FIGS. 4 and 6. The
      bar magnets 96 are retained in the bores 98 by threaded caps 100.
      The axially spaced bar magnets are of opposite polarity in order
      to form closed magnetic flux paths that will entrap any magnetic
      flux energy attempting to escape from the upper axial end of the
      electro-magnetic assembly 20.<br>
      <br>
      In order to reduce the energy losses that otherwise occur from
      magnetic hysteresis, a cavity 102 is formed in the core 50
      associated with the electro-magnetic device 20 as more clearly
      seen in FIGS. 3 and 6, the cavity being closed by a threaded end
      cap 104. The cavity is filled with a damping fluid 106 in which a
      plurality of magnetic spheroids 108 are immersed. These magnetic
      spheroids are soft iron spherical balls that are nickel or
      chromium plated. Upon collapsing of the electro-magnetic field
      produced by the electro-magnetic assemblies, the spheroids will
      have a tendency to rotate 90 DEG and align their weak poles with
      each other. Upon reversal of polarity, the poles will swing on
      additional 90 DEG to align themselves with the prevailing polarity
      of the magnetic field in order to concentrate flux lines from the
      flux emitting face 53. Over travel of the balls as a result of the
      polarity reversals, is prevented by the damping fluid 106.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles
      of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and
      changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not
      desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and
      operation shown and described, and accordingly all suitable
      modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within
      the scope of the invention.<br>
