        <p><b>HDVB</b> <br>
          <b>High Density Vertical BioReactor</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Holy Grail in the renewable energy sector has been to
        create a clean, green process which uses only light, water and
        air to create fuel. Valcent's HDVB algae-to-biofuel technology
        mass produces algae, vegetable oil which is suitable for
        refining into a cost-effective, non-polluting biodiesel. The
        algae derived fuel will be an energy efficient replacement for
        fossil fuels and can be used in any diesel powered vehicle or
        machinery. In addition, 90% by weight of the algae is captured
        carbon dioxide, which is "sequestered" by this process and so
        contributes significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases.
        Valcent has commissioned the world's first commercial-scale
        bioreactor pilot project at its test facility in El Paso, Texas.
      </p>
      <p>Current data projects high yields of algae biomass, which will
        be harvested and processed into algal oil for biofuel feedstock
        and ingredients in food, pharmaceutical, and health and beauty
        products at a significantly lower cost than comparable
        oil-producing crops such as palm and soyabean (soybean). </p>
      <p>The HDVB technology was developed by Valcent in recognition and
        response to a huge unsatisfied demand for vegetable oil
        feedstock by Biodiesel refiners and marketers. Biodiesel, in
        2000, was the only alternative fuel in the United States to have
        successfully completed the Environmental Protection Agency
        required Tier I and Tier II health effects testing under the
        Clean Air Act. These tests conclusively demonstrated Biodiesel's
        significant reduction of virtually all regulated emissions. A
        U.S. Department of Energy study has shown that the production
        and use of Biodiesel, compared to petroleum diesel, resulted in
        a 78.5% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. </p>
      <p>Algae, like all plants, require carbon dioxide, water with
        nutrients and sunlight for growth. The HDVB bioreactor
        technology is ideal for location adjacent to heavy producers of
        carbon dioxide such as coal fired power plants, refineries or
        manufacturing facilities, as the absorption of CO2 by the algae
        significantly reduces greenhouse gases. These reductions
        represent value in the form of Certified Emission Reduction
        credits, so-called carbon credits, in jurisdictions that are
        signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Although the carbon credit
        market is still small, it is growing fast, valued in 2005 at
        $6.6 Billion in the European Union and projected to increase to
        $77 Billion if the United States accepts a similar national
        cap-and-trade program. </p>
      <p>Valcent's HDVB bioreactor system can be deployed on non-arable
        land, requires very little water due to its closed circuit
        process, does not incur significant labor costs and does not
        employ fossil fuel burning equipment, unlike traditional
        food/biofuel crops, like soy and palm oil. They require large
        agricultural acreage, huge volumes of water and chemicals, and
        traditional farm equipment and labor. They are also much less
        productive than the HDVB process: soybean, palm oil and
        conventional pond-grown algae typically yield 48 gallons, 635
        gallons and 10,000 gallons per acre per year respectively. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Algae: 'The Ultimate in Renewable Energy'</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Miles O'Brien</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp; (1&nbsp; April , 2008 ) ANTHONY, Texas (CNN) -- Texas
        may be best known for "Big Oil." But the oil that could some day
        make a dent in the country's use of fossil fuels is small.
        Microscopic, in fact: algae. Literally and figuratively, this is
        green fuel. </p>
      <p>Plant physiologist Glen Kertz believes algae can some day be
        competitive as a source for biofuel. </p>
      <p>"Algae is the ultimate in renewable energy," Glen Kertz,
        president and CEO of Valcent Products, told CNN while conducting
        a tour of his algae greenhouse on the outskirts of El Paso. </p>
      <p>Kertz, a plant physiologist and entrepreneur, holds about 20
        patents. And he is psyched about the potential algae holds, both
        as an energy source and as a way to deal with global warming. </p>
      <p>"We are a giant solar collecting system. We get the bulk of our
        energy from the sunshine," said Kertz. </p>
      <p>Algae are among the fastest growing plants in the world, and
        about 50 percent of their weight is oil. That lipid oil can be
        used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes.&nbsp;
        Watch how pond scum can be turned into fuel » </p>
      <p>Most people know algae as "pond scum." And until recently, most
        energy research and development projects used ponds to grow it.
      </p>
      <p>But instead of ponds, Valcent uses a closed, vertical system,
        growing the algae in long rows of moving plastic bags. The
        patented system is called Vertigro, a joint venture with
        Canadian alternative energy company Global Green Solutions. The
        companies have invested about $5 million in the Texas facility.
      </p>
      <p>"A pond has a limited amount of surface area for solar
        absorption," said Kertz. </p>
      <p>"By going vertical, you can get a lot more surface area to
        expose cells to the sunlight. It keeps the algae hanging in the
        sunlight just long enough to pick up the solar energy they need
        to produce, to go through photosynthesis," he said. </p>
      <p>Kertz said he can produce about 100,000 gallons of algae oil a
        year per acre, compared to about 30 gallons per acre from corn;
        50 gallons from soybeans. </p>
      <p>Using algae as an alternative fuel is not a new idea. The U.S.
        Department of Energy studied it for about 18 years, from 1978 to
        1996. But according to Al Darzins of the DOE's National
        Renewable Energy Lab, in 1996 the feds decided that algae oil
        could never compete economically with fossil fuels. </p>
      <p>The price of a barrel of oil in 1996? About 20 bucks! </p>
      <p>Government scientists experimented with algae in open ponds in
        California, Hawaii, and in Roswell, New Mexico. </p>
      <p>But that involved a lot of land area, with inherent problems of
        evaporation and contamination from other plant species and
        various flying and swimming critters. Darzins said NREL switched
        from algae research to focus on cellulosic ethanol. That's
        ethanol made from plants like switchgrass and plant stover --
        the leaves and stalks left after a harvest -- but not edible
        crops such as corn and soybeans. </p>
      <p>Valcent research scientist Aga Pinowska said there are about
        65,000 known algae species, with perhaps hundreds of thousands
        more still to be identified. </p>
      <p>A big part of the research at the west Texas facility involves
        determining what type of algae produces what type of fuel. One
        species may be best suited for jet fuel, while the oil content
        of another may be more efficient for truck diesel. </p>
      <p>In the Vertigro lab, Pinowska studies the care and feeding of
        algae for just such specifics. She said even small changes in
        the nutrients that certain algae get can help create a more
        efficient oil content. </p>
      <p>And she said a knowledge of algae's virtues goes way back. </p>
      <p>"Even the Aztecs knew it was beneficial; they used it as a high
        protein food," said Pinowska. </p>
      <p>The other common commercial use of algae today is as a health
        food drink, usually sold as "Spirulina." </p>
      <p><b>I'm too sexy for my pond</b> </p>
      <p>And who knew that single celled plants could be such "hotties"
        when it comes to sex? Kertz said it's a real "algae orgy" under
        the microscope. </p>
      <p>Some algae reproduce sexually, some asexually, while many
        combine both modes. In some green algae the type of reproduction
        may be altered if there are changes in environmental conditions,
        such as lack of moisture or nutrients. </p>
      <p>Intriguing details like that keep Kertz and other scientists
        searching for more and different algae. While dusty west Texas
        may not be the best hunting grounds, he said he is always on the
        lookout for samples in puddles, streams or ponds. </p>
      <p>Locating algae processing plants intelligently can add to their
        efficiency. Locating algae facilities next to carbon producing
        power plants, or manufacturing plants, for instance, the plants
        could sequester the C02 they create and use those emissions to
        help grow the algae, which need the C02 for photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>And after more than a decade hiatus, the U.S. government is
        back in the algae game. The 2007 Energy Security and
        Independence Act includes language promoting the use of algae
        for biofuels. From the Pentagon to Minnesota to New Zealand,
        both governments and private companies are exploring the use of
        algae to produce fuel. </p>
      <p>But Al Darzins of the National Renewable Energy Lab said the
        world is still probably 5 to 10 years away from any substantial
        use of biofuels. </p>
      <p>"There's not any one system that anyone has chosen yet.
        Whatever it is has to be dirt, dirt cheap," said Darzins. </p>

        An automated system for growing plant material includes an first
        length of membrane material having a plurality of open growing
        chambers and a second length of membrane material having a
        plurality of growing chambers filled with the plant material. A
        media preparation unit mixes measured amounts of individual
        stock solutions for dispensing media into the open growing
        chambers by a fill unit. A fill check scanner unit determines
        that a sufficient amount of media has been dispensed within each
        growing chamber. A sterilization unit sterilizes the media
        filled open growing chambers which then pass to a cooling and
        storage unit for cooling and storing the media-filled open
        growing chambers until ready for planting with plant material.
        The second length of plant-filled growing chambers are housed in
        a plant culture room where the plant material is permitted to
        grow. A growth detection scanner determines the extent of growth
        of the plant material. Upon the plant material reaching a
        predetermined growth, the plant-filled growing chambers pass to
        a surface sterilization unit for surface sterilizing the
        plant-filled growing chambers. A cutting opens the growing
        chambers and the plant material is removed. The removed plant
        material is passed through a cutting unit where the plant
        material is cut into pieces. Each piece of plant material is
        then planted into a media-filled open growing chamber from the
        cooling and storing unit. A heat sealer closes the open end of
        the newly plant-filled growing chambers. The newly plant-filled
        growing chambers are then transported back to the culture room.
        A tractor feed apparatus transports the lengths of growing
        chambers throughout the automated system and a control system

        media preparation unit mixes stock solutions for dispensing into
        the growing chambers by a fill unit. A scanner unit determines
        that a sufficient amount of media has been dispensed within each
        chamber. A sterilization unit sterilizes the chambers which then
        pass to a cooling and storage unit until ready for planting with
        plant material. The second length of plant-filled growing
        chambers are housed in a plant culture room where the plant
        material is permitted to grow. A scanner determines the extent
        of growth of the plant material. Upon the material reaching a
        predetermined growth, the growing chambers pass to a surface
        sterilization unit. A cutting unit opens the chambers and the
        plant material is removed. The material is passed through a
        cutting unit where the material is cut into pieces. Each piece
        of material is then planted into a media-filled chamber from the
        cooling and storing unit. A heat sealer closes the open end of
        the newly plant-filled growing chambers. The newly plant-filled
        growing chambers are then transported back to the culture room.
        A tractor feed apparatus transports the lengths of growing
        chambers throughout the automated system and a control system
        controls the operation of each of the units and tractor feed
        apparatus. </p>

        <b>WO9015527</b> <br>
        <b>1990-12-27</b> <br>
        Disclosed is an integument (10) having a gas-permeable outer
        membrane (12) which is contaminant and liquid impermeable, and
        which includes one or more internal containers (1). The internal
        containers (1) can be opened from the outside of the integument
        (10), to release their contents, without opening the integument
        outer membrane (12) or breaching the integrity thereof. The
        system is designed so that the outer membrane (12) houses a
        biological product and the inner containers (1) house a bacteria
        media, or other product which has an effect on the biological
        product when the inner container (1) is opened. In an alternate
        system, the biological product is housed in the inner container
        (1) and the outer membrane (12) holds a product which affects
        that biological product. The system can be advantageously
        employed in micropropagation, seed growth or inoculation of
        plant material, bacterial culturing, or crystal growth, as well
        as in many other applications. </p>
