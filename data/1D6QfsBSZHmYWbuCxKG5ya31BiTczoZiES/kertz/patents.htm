      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a new and improved growing
        room and more particularly to an automated greenhouse for
        growing plantlets. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Seeds and plantlets are individually planted in a soil medium
        and housed in a greenhouse for germination and hardening. During
        this process, the seeds or plantlets are planted in a soil
        medium contained in small plastic liners which are placed in a
        flat. These flats are then stored in the greenhouse, often on
        wooden supports such as tables or benches on the greenhouse
        floor. The plantlets are typically placed side by side at a
        common elevation in the greenhouse to form a mat of plants
        extending across the greenhouse on a common plane. By placing
        the plantlets together as described in the prior art, the
        plantlets tend to reduce the light that is available to adjacent
        plants and also cause dead air spaces adjacent the plants, thus
        inhibiting growth. Further, the liners, flats or pots are opaque
        and therefore do not transmit any available light therethrough.
      </p>
      <p>A further disadvantage of prior art systems is that the liners
        must be manually moved from one location to another. In
        particular, to remove plantlets from the liners, the liners
        either need to be removed from the greenhouse or the laborer
        must work at the location of the liner. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention includes an automatic growing room. The
        growing room includes a closed loop track suspended above the
        floor and extending throughout the room. A plurality of racks
        are movably supported on the track by a motorized mover system.
        The racks include a frame for supporting a plurality of growing
        sheets for supporting and growing the plants. The growing sheets
        are made of a translucent material and include a plurality of
        growing cells formed by affixing a plurality of lengths of
        membrane material to the sheet at predetermined locations. The
        growing cells are gas permeable, liquid impermeable, and
        translucent. </p>

      <p><b>FIG. 11</b> is an alternative embodiment of the growing cell
        shown in FIG. 2 of the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a growing sheet
        10 made of a support material 16 having attached thereto a
        plurality of lengths of membrane material 18 affixed to support
        material 16 at predetermined locations to form a plurality of
        horizontal rows of growing cells 12. The rows of growing cells
        12 are separated by horizontal growing spaces 14. Growing cells
        12 are adapted to grow and support plants to be grown within
        cells 12. The growing cell 12 provides the root zone for the
        plant and the growing space 14 provides the foliage area for the
        plant as the plant grows. Attachment means 20 is provided at the
        top of growing sheet 10 for supporting the growing sheet 10 on a
        frame 22 shown in FIG. 5. The attachment means 20 includes
        folding over the upper edge of support material 16 and heat
        sealing the adjacent sheets together at 24 to form an elongated
        loop 26 for receiving a portion of the frame 22 as hereinafter
        described. </p>
      <p>The growing sheet 10 is sized to accommodate the variety of
        plants being grown in the growing cells 12 and for ease in
        material handling. The growing cells 12, illustrated in FIG. 1,
        are used primarily for seed germination and production. In such
        an application, one preferred size of growing sheet 10 is a
        growing sheet 2 feet wide and 3 feet high. Growing cells 12 for
        seed germination and production are approximately 1/4 inch in
        diameter and 1/2 inch to 1 inch high. The horizontal growing
        spaces 14 preferably have a height approximately the same as
        that of the growing cells 12, i.e. 1/2 inch to 1 inch high.
        Growing sheets having dimensions greater than 2 feet by 3 feet
        cause a material handling problem due to the physical size of
        the growing sheet and weight of the seeds and growth media, such
        as soil, in the growing cells 12. A growing sheet 10 with the
        preferred size of 2 feet by 3 feet would accommodate
        approximately 35 rows of cells with approximately 175 cells per
        row thus, each growing sheet would accommodate approximately
        6125 growing cells. However, as discussed previously, the
        capacity of the growing sheet 10 will vary substantially
        depending upon the stage of plant production and the size and
        variety of the seed or plantlet. </p>
      <p>Each growing cell 12 provides a container or pouch for
        maintaining the growing media and plant material. Typically, the
        plant material may include seeds, cuttings, plant tissue, or
        plantlets. The growing media is typically soil but may be other
        types of growing media such as growing foam. The growing medium
        of soil is typically a peat moss-based mix with a controlled pH.
        The soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the pouch and then
        wetted. Additional soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the
        cell until the growing cell 12 is filled with the growing media.
        A plant material is then planted into the soil. Typical
        applications of the growing cells for seed germination include
        germination of petunia, marigold, and pansy seeds. The planting
        of root cuttings might include azaleas and African violets. A
        typical tissue cutting planted in the soil might be a syngonium
        (Devil's Point Ivy). </p>
      <p>After a predetermined amount of foliage has grown from the
        growing cell 12 adjacent the foliage area 14, the plug is
        removed from the growing cell and transplanted into a larger
        growing cell of another growing sheet 10. Obviously, larger
        cuttings or larger plants require larger growing cells 12. Also,
        the growing cells 12 may be indexed so that an automatic seeder
        may be used to plant the seeds into the growing cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, each growing cell 12 forms a
        container or pouch 30 for containing the growing media and plant
        material. The growing cells 12 are formed by heat sealing the
        length of membrane material 18 at predetermined vertical
        locations 32, 34 to form a generally semi-circular
        cross-sectional area through the growing cell 12. The billowing
        of the open end 44 causes the growing cell 12 to always be in
        the open and receiving position for the insertion of the growing
        media and plant material. The bottom of the growing cell 12 is
        folded against the support sheet 16 such that the excess
        material at 36, 38 is evenly folded outward with the lower edge
        of growing cell 12 being heat sealed at 40. The folding of the
        lower edge of growing cell 12 is important because other folding
        patterns may well cause the opening 44 of growing cell 12 to be
        unduly restricted or completely collapsed so as to make it
        extremely difficult to introduce growing media into the pouch
        30. A puncture or slit is provided at the bottom of growing cell
        12 to form a drainage or weep hole 42 to allow excess water to
        drain from pouch 30. </p>
      <p>FIG. 11 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the growing
        cell. Growing cell 160 is formed by heat sealing the length of
        membrane material 18 at a 10 degree angle with vertical, such as
        at 162, to form a cross-sectional area in the shape of a
        truncated cone. The upper end 164 is open for receiving the
        growing media and plant material. The bottom 166 of growing cell
        160 may be heat sealed or reduced in size or restricted so as to
        be open but prevent the growing media from escaping from within
        growing cell 160. By allowing the bottom 166 to be open, upon
        completed growth, the plant may be popped out of cell 160 by
        pushing the plant and growing media from the bottom by accessing
        the opening at bottom 166 of cell 160. An open bottom also
        allows drainage of excess moisture from the pouch formed by cell
        160. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are preferably
        made of high-density polyethylene film and more preferably
        Chevron HiD 9650. Chevron HiD 9650 is described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 dated Mar. 13, 1990, U.S. patent application Ser. No.
        07/207,405 filed Jun. 14, 1988, and U.S. patent application Ser.
        No. 07/365,585 filed Jun. 13, 1989, all of which are
        incorporated herein by reference. The support material 16 and
        membrane material 18 may have varying film thicknesses but are
        preferably 1.25 mils. It is also preferred that the support
        material 16 and membrane material 18 be a starch-loaded film and
        thus degradable. It is preferred that the film degrade in a
        relatively short period of time. Thus, a reground or recyclable
        polyethylene might also be used. Since the gas exchange rate at
        the root zone is important, a low density polyethylene with a
        greater gas exchange rate might be used in place of high density
        polyethylene for the membrane material 18. Such a low density
        polyethylene would have a greater thickness such as 2.0 mils.
        Low density polyethylene also has the advantage in that it is
        cheaper than high density polyethylene. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are gas
        permeable, liquid impermeable, and translucent. A greater growth
        rate is achieved at the root zone if the gas exchange rate
        through material 16, 18 is high. Although the weep hole 42
        allows the release of excess water, the material 16, 18 are
        liquid impermeable to hold and maintain the moisture in the
        growing medium. Also, the material 16, 18 are translucent to
        allow light to reach the root zone but, more importantly, to
        allow the light to pass through adjacent growing sheets 10 to
        reach plant material at various heights and locations within the
        growing enclosure 100, hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The weep hole 42 only need to be small enough so that the
        growing medium will not pass through the bottom of growing cell
        12. A larger weep hole 42 has the advantage of permitting the
        plug to be removed by pushing the plug of soil and plant
        material up through the open end 44 of growing cell 12 by
        pushing from the bottom through the weep hole 42. </p>
      <p>Certain variations may be made to the growing cell 12 to
        accommodate particular types of plants. For example, the
        membrane material 18 forming the outer shell of the growing cell
        12 may be of a thinner plastic film to achieve greater gas
        exchange. Little structural support is required by the membrane
        material 18 and thus a thinner material produces a reduction in
        cost. Also, the support material 16 and/or the membrane material
        18 may be opaque to maintain the root zone of particular plants
        within an opaque enclosure. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, frame 22 is a generally rectangular
        rigid member preferably made of metal such as angle iron.
        Although frame 22 may vary in dimension, it is preferred that
        frame 22 have a width of approximately 5 feet and a height of
        approximately 10 feet. Frame 22 includes a top bar 46, a bottom
        bar 48, two side bars 50, 52 and a center bar 54. Frame 22
        further includes three pairs of support rods 56, 58. Support
        rods 56, 58 are hinged at one end 60, 62 and are supported at
        the other end 64, 66 by support hooks 68, 70. A clevis 84 is
        mounted at the center of top bar 46 of frame 22 for attachment
        to a track 90 hereinafter described with respect to FIG. 8. For
        an alternative frame, see FIGS. 15 and 16 of U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 5, six growing sheets 72, 74, 76, 78,
        80, and 82 are supported by the three pairs of support rods 56,
        58 on frame 22. To support growing sheets 72-82 on rods 56, 58,
        support rods 56, 58 are unlatched from hooks 68, 70 and swung
        outward on hinges 60, 62 so that rods 56, 58 may be received by
        loop 26 at the top of the growing sheets 72-82. After support
        rods 56, 58 are inserted in loop 26, the ends of rods 56, 58 are
        again latched to hooks 68, 70. The lower free ends of growing
        sheets 72-82 are allowed to sway or swing on support rods 56,
        58. The three pairs of support rods 56, 58 are located on frame
        22 such that growing sheets 72-82 clear side bars 50, 52 and
        center bar 54 by a few inches on each side thereof and the
        bottom of growing sheets 72-82 are from 5 to 6 inches above any
        lower and adjacent growing sheet such as growing sheets 76, 78
        and 80, 82. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, growing sheets 10 and frames 22
        with growing media and plant material are housed in an enclosure
        or growing room 100. Growing room 100 may be a greenhouse using
        ambient light or an enclosed structure such as a warehouse with
        artificial lighting as hereinafter described. Further, the size
        of the growing room 100 may vary. A typical greenhouse is shown
        in FIGS. 6 and 7 as growing room 100. For purposes of
        illustration, the growing room shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 is
        approximately 40 feet wide and has a length or run of
        approximately 100 feet. The vertical walls 102 forming the
        perimeter of the growing room 100 are shown to be 12 feet high
        with an arching roof 104 having a height of approximately 18
        feet at its peak. The roof 104 may be made of various materials
        which allow the passage of ambient light. The floor may be the
        ground or made of any well known construction material. See also
        the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,505 incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 of the present invention includes a closed
        loop 110 of track 90. As illustrated in FIG. 7, closed loop 110
        may have a serpentine pattern within growing room 110. With the
        growing room dimensions as described, loop 110 may include eight
        rows of track 112 having a plurality of U-turn loops 114
        attaching adjacent track rows and an end loop 116. End loop 116
        passes through a head end 118 of growing room 100. Head end 118
        is typically the working area of growing room 100 for the
        planting and handling of the growing media and plant material in
        growing sheets 10. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 6, each frame 22 with growing
        sheets 72-82 is suspended from track 90 by a support mechanism
        92. As shown in FIG. 8, track 90 is a tubular pipe supported
        within growing room 100 in the serpentine fashion shown in FIG.
        7. Support mechanism 92 includes a generally C-shaped support
        member 94 having a pair of rollers 96 on one end and another end
        98 received by clevis 84 of rack 22. Rack 22 is mounted on
        support mechanism 92 by a pin 99 passing through aligned
        apertures 86 and clevis 84 and support member 94. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 7, a plurality of racks supporting a plurality
        of growing sheets 10 are suspended from the serpentine track 90
        within growing room 100. A motorized mover system, not shown,
        similar to conveyor Model N-610-L manufactured by White
        Conveyor, Inc. of Kenilworth, N.J. or conveyor Model EU-920 of
        Saratoga Conveyor of Lithian Springs, Ga., manufactured by K. P.
        Fabrication, Inc., is provided in growing room 100 to move racks
        22 with growing sheets 10 through the growing room 100. Such is
        shown schematically in FIG. 7. Adjacent racks 22 are spaced from
        each other by spacers, not shown, mounted on mechanism 92 for
        contacting the mechanisms 92 of adjacent racks 22. The length of
        these spacers can be varied to vary the distance between
        adjacent racks. Preferably, the racks are maintained a matter of
        inches, such as 2 to 3 inches apart so as to maximize the
        capacity of growing room 100 to house the growing plants. The
        clearance between racks is preferably 4 to 6 inches. Although a
        single track 90 is shown, a multiple track may be used. A single
        track has the advantage that no alignment is required. </p>
      <p>The racks 22 with growing sheets 10 are propelled along track
        90 at a rate preferably less than 1 foot per second and
        preferably approximately 10 feet per minute. This movement
        throughout the growing room 100 permits the plant material of an
        individual growing sheet 10 to pass through all of the zones of
        the growing room 100. The temperature, humidity and lighting in
        a given area or zone of the growing room 100 may vary from
        another. Movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through
        the growing room 100 permits a more even growth of all plant
        material. Further, the movement of the growing sheets 10 through
        the room 100 has the additional affect of creating air movement.
        As the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 move through growing room
        100, the growing sheets 10 sway on racks 22 causing an air
        movement. The growing sheets 10, therefore, act as paddles
        against the air causing a mixing pattern of air movement
        throughout the growing room 100. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, it is necessary at the head end 118 of
        growing room 100 to expand the distance 120 between adjacent
        racks 22 so that workers may have better access to individual
        growing cells 12 on a particular growing sheet 10. To provide
        this expanded distance 120, track 90 includes a screw section
        122 having a thread 124 extending spirally around the track. The
        spiraling threads 124 of screw section 122 are closer together
        at the ends 126, 128 of pipe section 122 and are further apart
        at the midportion 131 of section 122. As the racks 22 move onto
        screw section 122, the rollers 96 are engaged by spiraling
        thread 124. As the spaces between adjacent threads 124 becomes
        greater near midportion 130, adjacent racks 22 become separated
        a greater distance 120. The motorized system can be stopped at
        any time to then allow a worker to pass between adjacent racks
        22 and have access to individual growing sheets 10 and growing
        cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIGS. 6 and 7, one or more misters 130, such
        as Model Maximiser manufactured by Canaan Industries, Inc., of
        Dothan, Ala., are provided at spaced intervals along track 90
        for misting the growing plant material as the motorized system
        moves the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through the growing
        room 100. Mister 130 includes a wand 132 with a plurality of
        misting nozzles 134. Wand 132 is mounted on a track 136
        extending below a row of racks 22. The speed of the moving racks
        is such as to allow the wand 132 to travel between adjacent
        racks 22 and mist the plants growing on individual growing
        sheets 72-82. The wand 132 will mist one rack of growing sheets
        10 as it travels to the end of track 136 and then mists another
        rack of passing sheets as it moves back to the other end of
        track 136. Thus, wand 132 will mist two racks of growing sheets
        in its full cycle of moving out and back on track 136 of mister
        130. </p>
      <p>The solution of the mister 130 will depend upon the plant
        variety as well as the climate of the ambient environment of
        growing room 100. The solution applied by mister 130 may include
        various additives such as fertilizer, fungicides, and
        insecticides. An injection feed system, well known in the art,
        meters these additives into the water which is then applied to
        the growing sheets 10 by the passing wand 132. The solution is
        sprayed onto the support sheet 16 of growing sheet 10 and is
        allowed to run down the face of support sheet 16 and into the
        growing cells 12. Excess solution will run and drip onto the
        floor of the growing room 100 to be collected in a catch basin
        either to be recycled or disposed. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6, 7 and 10, the present invention
        includes means for providing air movement within the growing
        room 100 at a preferred rate and temperature. The growing room
        100 includes cooling pads 140 mounted on one end wall 103 of
        growing room 100. A plurality of exhaust fans 142 are mounted in
        the opposite end wall 105 of growing room 100. A flexible air
        conduit 144 extends the length of growing room 100 between
        cooling pads 140 and exhaust fans 142. A deflector shield 147 is
        provided on the interior side of cooling pad 140 to direct the
        fresh cool air through the cooling pad 140 and into the open end
        of tube 144. The exhaust fan 142 connects with the other end and
        pulls the air from the cooling pad 140 through the tube 144 and
        exits the growing room 100. Tube 144 includes a plurality of
        apertures 146 directed to a particular row of racks 22 and
        growing sheets 10 so as to blow cooled air onto the plant
        material. It is preferable that the air movement is
        approximately 100 feet per minute such that the air within the
        growing room 100 is exchanged once very minute. The purpose of
        the fresh air is to kill any anaerobic fungus on the plant
        material. </p>
      <p>During the winter months, the exterior shutters, not shown, on
        the cooling pads 140 and the tubes 144 are affixed to heaters
        148 which blow hot air through tubes 144 and out apertures 146
        to heat the plant material. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 may further provide a fogging system, such
        as the System 1000 MicroMist System manufactured by Baumac
        International of Mentone, Calif., mounted in the ceiling thereof
        to maintain the humidity levels within the growing room 100 to
        approximately 80% or more. The fog is permitted to filter down
        between the racks 22 to maintain the humidity of the seedlings.
      </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is a greenhouse, the ambient light
        will be sufficient to provide the necessary lighting for the
        plant material. The movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets
        10 through the growing room 100 will also insure that the plant
        material has sufficient light. It is also possible that the
        individual growing sheets 72-82 may be rotated on rack 22 to
        insure that the plant material on the lower sheets 80, 82
        receive as much light as those on the upper growing sheets 72,
        74. </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is an enclosed structure such as a
        warehouse, artificial lighting will be provided along the
        ceiling and floor. Further, the interior of the growing room 100
        would be painted a reflective color, such as white or aluminum.
        If necessary, a plurality of floor lights 150 may be disposed
        between adjacent tracks of racks 22 as shown in FIG. 7 to
        provide additional light. Where lights 150 are provided, such
        lighting would also become a primary heat source thereby
        reducing the need for heaters 148. </p>
      <p>In the prior art, approximately 648 plugs are planted per tray.
        Each tray is approximately 11 inches by 22 inches. However, the
        trays are opaque and do not permit the passage of light. Thus,
        only one level of trays can be used throughout the greenhouse.
        This only allows approximately 400 plugs per square foot of
        growing room. However, the present invention includes
        approximately 5400 plants per rack, i.e. thirty-five rows at
        fifty plantlets with three growing sheets per foot of rack. If
        six racks can be spaced per foot, then over 32,000 plugs may be
        grown per square foot using the present invention as compared to
        400 in the prior art. </p>
      <p>While this invention has been described fully and completely
        with emphasis on the preferred embodiment, it should be
        understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the
        invention may be practiced otherwise and as specifically
        described and shown herein. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a new and improved growing
        room and more articularly to an automated greenhouse for growing
        plantlets. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Seeds and plantlets are individually planted in a soil medium
        and housed in a greenhouse for germination and hardening. During
        this process, the seeds or plantlets are planted in a soil
        medium contained in small plastic liners which are placed in a
        flat. These flats are then stored in the greenhouse, often on
        wooden supports such as tables or benches on the greenhouse
        floor. The plantlets are typically placed side by side at a
        common elevation in the greenhouse to form a mat of plants
        extending across the greenhouse on a common plane. By placing
        the plantlets together as described in the prior art, the
        plantlets tend to reduce the light that is available to adjacent
        plants and also cause dead air spaces adjacent the plants, thus
        inhibiting growth. Further, the liners, flats or pots are opaque
        and therefore do not transmit any available light therethrough.
      </p>
      <p>A further disadvantage of prior art systems is that the liners
        must be manually moved from one location to another. In
        particular, to remove plantlets from the liners, the liners
        either need to be removed from the greenhouse or the laborer
        must work at the location of the liner. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention includes an automatic growing room. The
        growing room includes a closed loop track suspended above the
        floor and extending throughout the room. A plurality of racks
        are movably supported on the track by a motorized mover system.
        The racks include a frame for supporting a plurality of growing
        sheets for supporting and growing the plants. The growing sheets
        are made of a translucent material and include a plurality of
        growing cells formed by affixing a plurality of lengths of
        membrane material to the sheet at predetermined locations. The
        growing cells are gas permeable, liquid impermeable, and
        translucent. </p>

        shown in FIG. 2 of the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a growing sheet
        10 made of a support material 16 having attached thereto a
        plurality of lengths of membrane material 18 affixed to support
        material 16 at predetermined locations to form a plurality of
        horizontal rows of growing cells 12. The rows of growing cells
        12 are separated by horizontal growing spaces 14. Growing cells
        12 are adapted to grow and support plants to be grown within
        cells 12. The growing cell 12 provides the root zone for the
        plant and the growing space 14 provides the foliage area for the
        plant as the plant grows. Attachment means 20 is provided at the
        top of growing sheet 10 for supporting the growing sheet 10 on a
        frame 22 shown in FIG. 5. The attachment means 20 includes
        folding over the upper edge of support material 16 and heat
        sealing the adjacent sheets together at 24 to form an elongated
        loop 26 for receiving a portion of the frame 22 as hereinafter
        described. </p>
      <p>The growing sheet 10 is sized to accommodate the variety of
        plants being grown in the growing cells 12 and for ease in
        material handling. The growing cells 12, illustrated in FIG. 1,
        are used primarily for seed germination and production. In such
        an application, one preferred size of growing sheet 10 is a
        growing sheet 2 feet wide and 3 feet high. Growing cells 12 for
        seed germination and production are approximately 1/4 inch in
        diameter and 1/2 inch to 1 inch high. The horizontal growing
        spaces 14 preferably have a height approximately the same as
        that of the growing cells 12, i.e. 1/2 inch to 1 inch high.
        Growing sheets having dimensions greater than 2 feet by 3 feet
        cause a material handling problem due to the physical size of
        the growing sheet and weight of the seeds and growth media, such
        as soil, in the growing cells 12. A growing sheet 10 with the
        preferred size of 2 feet by 3 feet would accommodate
        approximately 35 rows of cells with approximately 175 cells per
        row thus, each growing sheet would accommodate approximately
        6125 growing cells. However, as discussed previously, the
        capacity of the growing sheet 10 will vary substantially
        depending upon the stage of plant production and the size and
        variety of the seed or plantlet. </p>
      <p>Each growing cell 12 provides a container or pouch for
        maintaining the growing media and plant material. Typically, the
        plant material may include seeds, cuttings, plant tissue, or
        plantlets. The growing media is typically soil but may be other
        types of growing media such as growing foam. The growing medium
        of soil is typically a peat moss-based mix with a controlled pH.
        The soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the pouch and then
        wetted. Additional soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the
        cell until the growing cell 12 is filled with the growing media.
        A plant material is then planted into the soil. Typical
        applications of the growing cells for seed germination include
        germination of petunia, marigold, and pansy seeds. The planting
        of root cuttings might include azaleas and African violets. A
        typical tissue cutting planted in the soil might be a syngonium
        (Devil's Point Ivy). </p>
      <p>After a predetermined amount of foliage has grown from the
        growing cell 12 adjacent the foliage area 14, the plug is
        removed from the growing cell and transplanted into a larger
        growing cell of another growing sheet 10. Obviously, larger
        cuttings or larger plants require larger growing cells 12. Also,
        the growing cells 12 may be indexed so that an automatic seeder
        may be used to plant the seeds into the growing cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, each growing cell 12 forms a
        container or pouch 30 for containing the growing media and plant
        material. The growing cells 12 are formed by heat sealing the
        length of membrane material 18 at predetermined vertical
        locations 32, 34 to form a generally semi-circular
        cross-sectional area through the growing cell 12. The billowing
        of the open end 44 causes the growing cell 12 to always be in
        the open and receiving position for the insertion of the growing
        media and plant material. The bottom of the growing cell 12 is
        folded against the support sheet 16 such that the excess
        material at 36, 38 is evenly folded outward with the lower edge
        of growing cell 12 being heat sealed at 40. The folding of the
        lower edge of growing cell 12 is important because other folding
        patterns may well cause the opening 44 of growing cell 12 to be
        unduly restricted or completely collapsed so as to make it
        extremely difficult to introduce growing media into the pouch
        30. A puncture or slit is provided at the bottom of growing cell
        12 to form a drainage or weep hole 42 to allow excess water to
        drain from pouch 30. </p>
      <p>FIG. 11 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the growing
        cell. Growing cell 160 is formed by heat sealing the length of
        membrane material 18 at a 10 degree angle with vertical, such as
        at 162, to form a cross-sectional area in the shape of a
        truncated cone. The upper end 164 is open for receiving the
        growing media and plant material. The bottom 166 of growing cell
        160 may be heat sealed or reduced in size or restricted so as to
        be open but prevent the growing media from escaping from within
        growing cell 160. By allowing the bottom 166 to be open, upon
        completed growth, the plant may be popped out of cell 160 by
        pushing the plant and growing media from the bottom by accessing
        the opening at bottom 166 of cell 160. An open bottom also
        allows drainage of excess moisture from the pouch formed by cell
        160. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are preferably
        made of high-density polyethylene film and more preferably
        Chevron HiD 9650. Chevron HiD 9650 is described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 dated Mar. 13, 1990, U.S. patent application Ser. No.
        07/207,405 filed Jun. 14, 1988, and U.S. patent application Ser.
        No. 07/365,585 filed Jun. 13, 1989, all of which are
        incorporated herein by reference. The support material 16 and
        membrane material 18 may have varying film thicknesses but are
        preferably 1.25 mils. It is also preferred that the support
        material 16 and membrane material 18 be a starch-loaded film and
        thus degradable. It is preferred that the film degrade in a
        relatively short period of time. Thus, a reground or recyclable
        polyethylene might also be used. Since the gas exchange rate at
        the root zone is important, a low density polyethylene with a
        greater gas exchange rate might be used in place of high density
        polyethylene for the membrane material 18. Such a low density
        polyethylene would have a greater thickness such as 2.0 mils.
        Low density polyethylene also has the advantage in that it is
        cheaper than high density polyethylene. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are gas
        permeable, liquid impermeable, and translucent. A greater growth
        rate is achieved at the root zone if the gas exchange rate
        through material 16, 18 is high. Although the weep hole 42
        allows the release of excess water, the material 16, 18 are
        liquid impermeable to hold and maintain the moisture in the
        growing medium. Also, the material 16, 18 are translucent to
        allow light to reach the root zone but, more importantly, to
        allow the light to pass through adjacent growing sheets 10 to
        reach plant material at various heights and locations within the
        growing enclosure 100, hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The weep hole 42 only need to be small enough so that the
        growing medium will not pass through the bottom of growing cell
        12. A larger weep hole 42 has the advantage of permitting the
        plug to be removed by pushing the plug of soil and plant
        material up through the open end 44 of growing cell 12 by
        pushing from the bottom through the weep hole 42. </p>
      <p>Certain variations may be made to the growing cell 12 to
        accommodate particular types of plants. For example, the
        membrane material 18 forming the outer shell of the growing cell
        12 may be of a thinner plastic film to achieve greater gas
        exchange. Little structural support is required by the membrane
        material 18 and thus a thinner material produces a reduction in
        cost. Also, the support material 16 and/or the membrane material
        18 may be opaque to maintain the root zone of particular plants
        within an opaque enclosure. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, frame 22 is a generally rectangular
        rigid member preferably made of metal such as angle iron.
        Although frame 22 may vary in dimension, it is preferred that
        frame 22 have a width of approximately 5 feet and a height of
        approximately 10 feet. Frame 22 includes a top bar 46, a bottom
        bar 48, two side bars 50, 52 are a center bar 54. Frame 22
        further includes three pairs of support rods 56, 58. Support
        rods 56, 58 are hinged at one end 60, 62 and are supported at
        the other end 64, 66 by support hooks 68, 70. A clevis 84 is
        mounted at the center of top bar 46 of frame 22 for attachment
        to a track 90 hereinafter described with respect to FIG. 8. For
        an alternative frame, see FIGS. 15 and 16 of U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 5, six growing sheets 72, 74, 76, 78,
        80, and 82 are supported by the three pairs of support rods 56,
        58 on frame 22. To support growing sheets 72-82 on rods 56, 58,
        support rods 56, 58 are unlatched from hooks 68, 70 and swung
        outward on hinges 60, 62 so that rods 56, 58 may be received by
        loop 26 at the top of the growing sheets 72-82. After support
        rods 56, 58 are inserted in loop 26, the ends of rods 56, 58 are
        again latched to hooks 68, 70. The lower free ends of growing
        sheets 72-82 are allowed to sway or swing on support rods 56,
        58. The three pairs of support rods 56, 58 are located on frame
        22 such that growing sheets 72-82 clear side bars 50, 52 and
        center bar 54 by a few inches on each side thereof and the
        bottom of growing sheets 72-82 are from 5 to 6 inches above any
        lower and adjacent growing sheet such as growing sheets 76, 78
        and 80, 82. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, growing sheets 10 and frames 22
        with growing media and plant material are housed in an enclosure
        or growing room 100. Growing room 100 may be a greenhouse using
        ambient light or an enclosed structure such as a warehouse with
        artificial lighting as hereinafter described. Further, the size
        of the growing room 100 may vary. A typical greenhouse is shown
        in FIGS. 6 and 7 as growing room 100. For </p>
      <p>purposes of illustration, the growing room shown in FIGS. 6 and
        7 is approximately 40 feet wide and has a length or run of
        approximately 100 feet. The vertical walls 102 forming the
        perimeter of the growing room 100 are shown to be 12 feet high
        with an arching roof 104 having a height of approximately 18
        feet at its peak. The roof 104 may be made of various materials
        which allow the passage of ambient light. The floor may be the
        ground or made of any well known construction material. See also
        the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,505 incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 of the present invention includes a closed
        loop 110 of track 90. As illustrated in FIG. 7, closed loop 110
        may have a serpentine pattern within growing room 110. With the
        growing room dimensions as described, loop 110 may include eight
        rows of track 112 having a plurality of U-turn loops 114
        attaching adjacent track rows and an end loop 116. End loop 116
        passes through a head end 118 of growing room 100. Head end 118
        is typically the working area of growing room 100 for the
        planting and handling of the growing media and plant material in
        growing sheets 10. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 6, each frame 22 with growing
        sheets 72-82 is suspended from track 90 by a support mechanism
        92. As shown in FIG. 8, track 90 is a tubular pipe supported
        within growing room 100 in the serpentine fashion shown in FIG.
        7. Support mechanism 92 includes a generally C-shaped support
        member 94 having a pair of rollers 96 on one end and another end
        98 received by clevis 84 of rack 22. Rack 22 is mounted on
        support mechanism 92 by a pin 99 passing through aligned
        apertures 86 and clevis 84 and support member 94. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 7, a plurality of racks supporting a plurality
        of growing sheets 10 are suspended from the serpentine track 90
        with a growing room 100. A motorized mover system, not shown,
        similar to conveyor Model N-610-L manufactured by White
        Conveyor, Inc. of Kenilworth, N.J. or conveyor Model EU-920 of
        Saratoga Conveyor of Lithian Springs, Ga., manufactured by K. P.
        Fabrication, Inc., is provided in growing room 100 to move racks
        22 with growing sheets 10 through the growing room 100. Such is
        shown schematically in FIG. 7. Adjacent racks 22 are spaced from
        each other by spacers, not shown, mounted on mechanism 92 for
        contacting the mechanisms 92 of adjacent racks 22. The length of
        these spacers can be varied to vary the distance between
        adjacent racks. Preferably, the racks are maintained a matter of
        inches, such as 2 to 3 inches apart so as to maximize the
        capacity of growing room 100 to house the growing plants. The
        clearance between racks is preferably 4 to 6 inches. Although a
        single track 90 is shown, a multiple track may be used. A single
        track has the advantage that no alignment is required. </p>
      <p>The racks 22 with growing sheets 10 are propelled along track
        90 at a rate preferably less than 1 foot per second and
        preferably approximately 10 feet per minute. This movement
        throughout the growing room 100 permits the plant material of an
        individual growing sheet 10 to pass through all of the zones of
        the growing room 100. The temperature, humidity and lighting in
        a given area or zone of the growing room 100 may vary from
        another. Movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through
        the growing room 100 permits a more even growth of all plant
        material. Further, the movement of the growing sheets 10 through
        the room 100 has the additional affect of creating air movement.
        As the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 move through growing room
        100, the growing sheets 10 sway on racks 22 causing an air
        movement. The growing sheets 10, therefore, act as paddles
        against the air causing a mixing pattern of air movement
        throughout the growing room 100. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, it is necessary at the head end 118 of
        growing room 100 to expand the distance 120 between adjacent
        racks 22 so that workers may have better access to individual
        growing cells 12 on a particular growing sheet 10. To provide
        this expanded distance 120, track 90 includes a screw section
        122 having a thread 124 extending spirally around the track. The
        spiraling threads 124 of screw section 122 are closer together
        at the ends 126, 128 of pipe section 122 and are further apart
        at the midportion 131 of section 122. As the racks 22 move onto
        screw section 122, the rollers 96 are engaged by spiraling
        thread 124. As the spaces between adjacent threads 124 becomes
        greater near midportion 130, adjacent racks 22 become separated
        a greater distance 120. The motorized system can be stopped at
        any time to then allow a worker to pass between adjacent racks
        22 and have access to individual growing sheets 10 and growing
        cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIGS. 6 and 7, one or more misters 130, such
        as Model Maximiser manufactured by Canaan Industries, Inc., of
        Dothan, Ala., are provided at spaced intervals along track 90
        for misting the growing plant material as the motorized system
        moves the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through the growing
        room 100. Mister 130 includes a wand 132 with a plurality of
        misting nozzles 134. Wand 132 is mounted on a track 136
        extending below a row of racks 22. The speed of the moving racks
        is such as to allow the wand 132 to travel between adjacent
        racks 22 and mist the plants growing on individual growing
        sheets 72-82. The wand 132 will mist one rack of growing sheets
        10 as it travels to the end of track 136 and then mists another
        rack of passing sheets as it moves back to the other end of
        track 136. Thus, wand 132 will mist two racks of growing sheets
        in its full cycle of moving out and back on track 136 of mister
        130. </p>
      <p>The solution of the mister 130 will depend upon the plant
        variety as well as the climate of the ambient environment of
        growing room 100. The solution applied by mister 130 may include
        various additives such as fertilizer, fungicides, and
        insecticides. An injection feed system, well known in the art,
        meters these additives into the water which is then applied to
        the growing sheets 10 by the passing wand 132. The solution is
        sprayed onto the support sheet 16 of growing sheet 10 and is
        allowed to run down the face of support sheet 16 and into the
        growing cells 12. Excess solution will run and drip onto the
        floor of the growing room 100 to be collected in a catch basin
        either to be recycled or disposed. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6, 7 and 10, the present invention
        includes means for providing air movement within the growing
        room 100 at a preferred rate and temperature. The growing room
        100 includes cooling pads 140 mounted on one end wall 103 of
        growing room 100. A plurality of exhaust fans 142 are mounted in
        the opposite end wall 105 of growing room 100. A flexible air
        conduit 144 extends the length of growing room 100 between
        cooling pads 140 and exhaust fans 142. A deflector shield 146 is
        provided on the interior side of cooling pad 140 to direct the
        fresh cool air through the cooling pad 140 and into the open end
        of tube 144. The exhaust fan 142 connects with the other end and
        pulls the air from the cooling pad 140 through the tube 144 and
        exits the growing room 100. Tube 144 includes a plurality of
        apertures 146 directed to a particular row of racks 22 and
        growing sheets 10 so as to blow cooled air onto the plant
        material. It is preferable that the air movement is
        approximately 100 feet per minute such that the air within the
        growing room 100 is exchanged once very minute. The purpose of
        the fresh air is to kill any anaerobic fungus on the plant
        material. </p>
      <p>During the winter months, the exterior shutters, not shown, on
        the cooling paces 140 and the tubes 144 are affixed to heaters
        148 which blow hot air through tubes 144 and out apertures 146
        to heat the plant material. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 may further provide a fogging system, such
        as the System 1000 MicroMist System manufactured by Baumac
        International of Mentone, Calif., mounted in the ceiling thereof
        to maintain the humidity levels within the growing room 100 to
        approximately 80% or more. The fog is permitted to filter down
        between the racks 22 to maintain the humidity of the seedlings.
      </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is a greenhouse, the ambient light
        will be sufficient to provide the necessary lighting for the
        plant material. The movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets
        10 through the growing room 100 will also insure that the plant
        material has sufficient light. It is also possible that the
        individual growing sheets 72-82 may be rotated on rack 22 to
        insure that the plant material on the lower sheets 80, 82
        receive as much light as those on the upper growing sheets 72,
        74. </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is an enclosed structure such as a
        warehouse, artificial lighting will be provided along the
        ceiling and floor. Further, the interior of the growing room 100
        would be painted a reflective color, such as white or aluminum.
        If necessary, a plurality of floor lights 150 may be disposed
        between adjacent tracks of racks 22 as shown in FIG. 7 to
        provide additional light. Where lights 150 are provided, such
        lighting would also become a primary heat source thereby
        reducing the need for heaters 148. </p>
      <p>In the prior art, approximately 648 plugs are planted per tray.
        Each tray is approximately 11 inches by 22 inches. However, the
        trays are opaque and do not permit the passage of light. Thus,
        only one level of trays can be used throughout the greenhouse.
        This only allows approximately 400 plugs per square foot of
        growing room. However, the present invention includes
        approximately 5400 plants per rack, i.e. thirty-five rows at
        fifty plantlets with three growing sheets per foot of rack. If
        six racks can be spaced per foot, then over 32,000 plugs may be
        grown per square foot using the present invention as compared to
        400 in the prior art. </p>
      <p>While this invention has been described fully and completely
        with emphasis on the preferred embodiment, it should be
        understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the
        invention may be practiced otherwise and as specifically
        described and shown herein. </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a new and improved growing
        room and more particularly to an automated greenhouse for
        growing plantlets. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Seeds and plantlets are individually planted in a soil medium
        and housed in a greenhouse for germination and hardening. During
        this process, the seeds or plantlets are planted in a soil
        medium contained in small plastic liners which are placed in a
        flat. These flats are then stored in the greenhouse, often on
        wooden supports such as tables or benches on the greenhouse
        floor. The plantlets are typically placed side by side at a
        common elevation in the greenhouse to form a mat of plants
        extending across the greenhouse on a common plane. By placing
        the plantlets together as described in the prior art, the
        plantlets tend to reduce the light that is available to adjacent
        plants and also cause dead air spaces adjacent the plants, thus
        inhibiting growth. Further, the liners, flats or pots are opaque
        and therefore do not transmit any available light therethrough.
      </p>
      <p>A further disadvantage of prior art systems is that the liners
        must be manually moved from one location to another. In
        particular, to remove plantlets from the liners, the liners
        either need to be removed from the greenhouse or the laborer
        must work at the location of the liner. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention includes an automatic growing room. The
        growing room includes a closed loop track suspended above the
        floor and extending throughout the room. A plurality of racks
        are movably supported on the track by a motorized mover system.
        The racks include a frame for supporting a plurality of growing
        sheets for supporting and growing the plants. The growing sheets
        are made of a translucent material and include a plurality of
        growing cells formed by affixing a plurality of lengths of
        membrane material to the sheet at predetermined locations. The
        growing cells are gas permeable, liquid impermeable, and
        translucent. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a growing sheet
        10 made of a support material 16 having attached thereto a
        plurality of lengths of membrane material 18 affixed to support
        material 16 at predetermined locations to form a plurality of
        horizontal rows of growing cells 12. The rows of growing cells
        12 are separated by horizontal growing spaces 14. Growing cells
        12 are adapted to grow and support plants to be grown within
        cells 12. The growing cell 12 provides the root zone for the
        plant and the growing space 14 provides the foliage area for the
        plant as the plant grows. Attachment means 20 is provided at the
        top of growing sheet 10 for supporting the growing sheet 10 on a
        frame 22 shown in FIG. 5. The attachment means 20 includes
        folding over the upper edge of support material 16 and heat
        sealing the adjacent sheets together at 24 to form an elongated
        loop 26 for receiving a portion of the frame 22 as hereinafter
        described. </p>
      <p>The growing sheet 10 is sized to accommodate the variety of
        plants being grown in the growing cells 12 and for ease in
        material handling. The growing cells 12, illustrated in FIG. 1,
        are used primarily for seed germination and production. In such
        an application, one preferred size of growing sheet 10 is a
        growing sheet 2 feet wide and 3 feet high. Growing cells 12 for
        seed germination and production are approximately 1/4 inch in
        diameter and 1/2 inch to 1 inch high. The horizontal growing
        spaces 14 preferably have a height approximately the same as
        that of the growing cells 12, i.e. 1/2 inch to 1 inch high.
        Growing sheets having dimensions greater than 2 feet by 3 feet
        cause a material handling problem due to the physical size of
        the growing sheet and weight of the seeds and growth media, such
        as soil, in the growing cells 12. A growing sheet 10 with the
        preferred size of 2 feet by 3 feet would-accommodate
        approximately 35 rows of cells with approximately 175 cells per
        row thus, each growing sheet would accommodate approximately
        6125 growing cells. However, as discussed previously, the
        capacity of the growing sheet 10 will vary substantially
        depending upon the stage of plant production and the size and
        variety of the seed or plantlet. </p>
      <p>Each growing cell 12 provides a container or pouch for
        maintaining the growing media and plant material. Typically, the
        plant material may include seeds, cuttings, plant tissue, or
        plantlets. The growing media is typically soil but may be other
        types of growing media such as growing foam. The growing medium
        of soil is typically a peat moss-based mix with a controlled pH.
        The soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the pouch and then
        wetted. Additional soil is blown, dropped or pushed into the
        cell until the growing cell 12 is filled with the growing media.
        A plant material is then planted into the soil. Typical
        applications of the growing cells for seed germination include
        germination of petunia, marigold, and pansy seeds. The planting
        of root cuttings might include azaleas and African violets. A
        typical tissue cutting planted in the soil might be a syngonium
        (Devil's Point Ivy). </p>
      <p>After a predetermined amount of foliage has grown from the
        growing cell 12 adjacent the foliage area 14, the plug is
        removed from the growing cell and transplanted into a larger
        growing cell of another growing sheet 10. Obviously, larger
        cuttings or larger plants require larger growing cells 12. Also,
        the growing cells 12 may be indexed so that an automatic seeder
        may be used to plant the seeds into the growing cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, each growing cell 12 forms a
        container or pouch 30 for containing the growing media and plant
        material. The growing cells 12 are formed by heat sealing the
        length of membrane material 18 at predetermined vertical
        locations 32, 34 to form a generally semi-circular
        cross-sectional area through the growing cell 12. The billowing
        of the open end 44 causes the growing cell 12 to always be in
        the open and receiving position for the insertion of the growing
        media and plant material. The bottom of the growing cell 12 is
        folded against the support sheet 16 such that the excess
        material at 36, 38 is evenly folded outward with the lower edge
        of growing cell 12 being heat sealed at 40. The folding of the
        lower edge of growing cell 12 is important because other folding
        patterns may well cause the opening 44 of growing cell 12 to be
        unduly restricted or completely collapsed so as to make it
        extremely difficult to introduce growing media into the pouch
        30. A puncture or slit is provided at the bottom of growing cell
        12 to form a drainage or weep hole 42 to allow excess water to
        drain from pouch 30. </p>
      <p>FIG. 11 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the growing
        cell. Growing cell 160 is formed by heat sealing the length of
        membrane material 18 at a 10 degree angle with vertical, such as
        at 162, to form a cross-sectional area in the shape of a
        truncated cone. The upper end 164 is open for receiving the
        growing media and plant material. The bottom 166 of growing cell
        160 may be heat sealed or reduced in size or restricted so as to
        be open but prevent the growing media from escaping from within
        growing cell 160. By allowing the bottom 166 to be open, upon
        completed growth, the plant may be popped out of cell 160 by
        pushing the plant and growing media from the bottom by accessing
        the opening at bottom 166 of cell 160. An open bottom also
        allows drainage of excess moisture from the pouch formed by cell
        160. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are preferably
        made of high-density polyethylene film and more preferably
        Chevron HiD 9650. Chevron HiD 9650 is described in U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 dated Mar. 13, 1990, U.S. patent application Ser. No.
        07/207,405 filed Jun. 14, 1988, and U.S. patent application Ser.
        No. 07/365,585 filed Jun. 13, 1989, all of which are
        incorporated herein by reference. The support material 16 and
        membrane material 18 may have varying film thicknesses but are
        preferably 1.25 mils. It is also preferred that the support
        material 16 and membrane material 18 be a starch-loaded film and
        thus degradable. It is preferred that the film degrade in a
        relatively short period of time. Thus, a reground or recyclable
        polyethylene might also be used. Since the gas exchange rate at
        the root zone is important, a low density polyethylene with a
        greater gas exchange rate might be used in place of high density
        polyethylene for the membrane material 18. Such a low density
        polyethylene would have a greater thickness such as 2.0 mils.
        Low density polyethylene also has the advantage in that it is
        cheaper than high density polyethylene. </p>
      <p>The support material 16 and membrane material 18 are gas
        permeable, liquid impermeable, and translucent. A greater growth
        rate is achieved at the root zone if the gas exchange rate
        through material 16, 18 is high. Although the weep hole 42
        allows the release of excess water, the material 16, 18 are
        liquid impermeable to hold and maintain the moisture in the
        growing medium. Also, the material 16, 18 are translucent to
        allow light to reach the root zone but, more importantly, to
        allow the light to pass through adjacent growing sheets 10 to
        reach plant material at various heights and locations within the
        growing enclosure 100, hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The weep hole 42 only need to be small enough so that the
        growing medium will not pass through the bottom of growing cell
        12. A larger weep hole 42 has the advantage of permitting the
        plug to be removed by pushing the plug of soil and plant
        material up through the open end 44 of growing cell 12 by
        pushing from the bottom through the weep hole 42. </p>
      <p>Certain variations may be made to the growing cell 12 to
        accommodate particular types of plants. For example, the
        membrane material 18 forming the outer shell of the growing cell
        12 may be of a thinner plastic film to achieve greater gas
        exchange. Little structural support is required by the membrane
        material 18 and thus a thinner material produces a reduction in
        cost. Also, the support material 16 and/or the membrane material
        18 may be opaque to maintain the root zone of particular plants
        within an opaque enclosure. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, frame 22 is a generally rectangular
        rigid member preferably made of metal such as angle iron.
        Although frame 22 may vary in dimension, it is preferred that
        frame 22 have a width of approximately 5 feet and a height of
        approximately 10 feet. Frame 22 includes a top bar 46, a bottom
        bar 48, two side bars 50, 52 and a center bar 54. Frame 22
        further includes three pairs of support rods 56, 58. Support
        rods 56, 58 are hinged at one end 60, 62 and are supported at
        the other end 64, 66 by support hooks 68, 70. A clevis 84 is
        mounted at the center of top bar 46 of frame 22 for attachment
        to a track 90 hereinafter described with respect to FIG. 8. For
        an alternative frame, see FIGS. 15 and 16 of U.S. Pat. No.
        4,908,315 incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 5, six growing sheets 72, 74, 76, 78,
        80, and 82 are supported by the three pairs of support rods 56,
        58 on frame 22. Growing sheets 72-82 are each preferably
        constructed in the manner described above with respect to
        growing sheet 10. To support growing sheets 72-82 on rods 56,
        58, support rods 56, 58 are unlatched from hooks 68, 70 and
        swung outward on hinges 60, 62 so that rods 56, 58 may be
        received by loop 26 at the top of the growing sheets 72-82.
        After support rods 56, 58 are inserted in loop 26, the ends of
        rods 56, 58 are again latched to hooks 68, 70. The lower free
        ends of growing sheets 72-82 are allowed to sway or swing on
        support rods 56, 58. The three pairs of support rods 56, 58 are
        located on frame 22 such that growing sheets 72-82 clear side
        bars 50, 52 and center bar 54 by a few inches on each side
        thereof and the bottom of growing sheets 72-82 are from 5 to 6
        inches above any lower and adjacent growing sheet such as
        growing sheets 76, 78 and 80, 82. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, growing sheets 10 and frames 22
        with growing media and plant material are housed in an enclosure
        or growing room 100. Growing room 100 may be a greenhouse using
        ambient light or an enclosed structure such as a warehouse with
        artificial lighting as hereinafter described. Further, the size
        of the growing room 100 may vary. A typical greenhouse is shown
        in FIGS. 6 and 7 as growing room 100. For purposes of
        illustration, the growing room shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 is
        approximately 40 feet wide and has a length or run of
        approximately 100 feet. The vertical walls 102 forming the
        perimeter of the growing room 100 are shown to be 12 feet high
        with an arching roof 104 having a height of approximately 18
        feet at its peak. The roof 104 may be made of various materials
        which allow the passage of ambient light. The floor may be the
        ground or made of any well known construction material. See also
        the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,505 incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 of the present invention includes a closed
        loop 110 of track 90. As illustrated in FIG. 7, closed loop 110
        may have a serpentine pattern within growing room 110. With the
        growing room dimensions as described, loop 110 may include eight
        rows of track 112 having a plurality of U-turn loops 114
        attaching adjacent track rows and an end loop 116. End loop 116
        passes through a head end 118 of growing room 100. Head end 118
        is typically the working area of growing room 100 for the
        planting and handling of the growing media and plant material in
        growing sheets 10. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 6, each frame 22 with growing
        sheets 72-82 is suspended from track 90 by a support mechanism
        92. As shown in FIG. 8, track 90 is a tubular pipe supported
        within growing room 100 in the serpentine fashion shown in FIG.
        7. Support mechanism 92 includes a generally C-shaped support
        member 94 having a pair of rollers 96 on one end and another end
        98 received by clevis 84 of rack 22. Rack 22 is mounted on
        support mechanism 92 by a pin 99 passing through aligned
        apertures 86 and clevis 84 and support member 94. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 7, a plurality of racks 22 supporting a
        plurality of growing sheets 10 (FIG. 1) are suspended from the
        serpentine track 90 within growing room 100. A motorized mover
        system, not shown, similar to conveyor Model N-610-L
        manufactured by White Conveyor, Inc. of Kenilworth, N.J. or
        conveyor Model EU-920 of Saratoga Conveyor of Lithian Springs,
        Ga., manufactured by K. P. Fabrication, Inc., is provided in
        growing room 100 to move racks 22 with growing sheets 10 through
        the growing room 100. Such is shown schematically in FIG. 7.
        Adjacent racks 22 are spaced from each other by spacers, not
        shown, mounted on mechanism 92 for contacting the mechanisms 92
        of adjacent racks 22. The length of these spacers can be varied
        to vary the distance between adjacent racks. Preferably, the
        racks are maintained a matter of inches, such as 2 to 3 inches
        apart so as to maximize the capacity of growing room 100 to
        house the growing plants. The clearance between racks is
        preferably 4 to 6 inches. Although a single track 90 is shown, a
        multiple track may be used. A single track has the advantage
        that no alignment is required. </p>
      <p>The racks 22 with growing sheets 10 are propelled along track
        90 at a rate preferably less than 1 foot per second and
        preferably approximately 10 feet per minute. This movement
        throughout the growing room 100 permits the plant material of an
        individual growing sheet 10 to pass through all of the zones of
        the growing room 100. The temperature, humidity and lighting in
        a given area or zone of the growing room 100 may vary from
        another. Movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through
        the growing room 100 permits a more even growth of all plant
        material. Further, the movement of the growing sheets 10 through
        the room 100 has the additional affect of creating air movement.
        As the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 move through growing room
        100, the growing sheets 10 sway on racks 22 causing an air
        movement. The growing sheets 10, therefore, act as paddles
        against the air causing a mixing pattern of air movement
        throughout the growing room 100. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, it is necessary at the head end 118 of
        growing room 100 to expand the distance 120 between adjacent
        racks 22 so that workers may have better access to individual
        growing cells 12 on a particular growing sheet 10. To provide
        this expanded distance 120, track 90 includes a screw section
        122 having a thread 124 extending spirally around the track. The
        spiraling threads 124 of screw section 122 are closer together
        at the ends 126, 128 of pipe section 122 and are further apart
        at the midportion 131 of section 122. As the racks 22 move onto
        screw section 122, the rollers 96 are engaged by spiraling
        thread 124. As the spaces between adjacent threads 124 becomes
        greater near midportion 130, adjacent racks 22 become separated
        a greater distance 120. The motorized system can be stopped at
        any time to then allow a worker to pass between adjacent racks
        22 and have access to individual growing sheets 10 and growing
        cells 12. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIGS. 6 and 7, one or more misters 130, such
        as Model Maximiser manufactured by Canaan Industries, Inc., of
        Dothan, Ala., are provided at spaced intervals along track 90
        for misting the growing plant material as the motorized system
        moves the racks 22 and growing sheets 10 through the growing
        room 100. Mister 130 includes a wand 132 with a plurality of
        misting nozzles 134. Wand 132 is mounted on a track 136
        extending below a row of racks 22. The speed of the moving racks
        is such as to allow the wand 132 to travel between adjacent
        racks 22 and mist the plants growing on individual growing
        sheets 72-82. The wand 132 will mist one rack of growing sheets
        10 as it travels to the end of track 136 and then mists another
        rack of passing sheets as it moves back to the other end of
        track 136. Thus, wand 132 will mist two racks of growing sheets
        in its full cycle of moving out and back on track 136 of mister
        130. </p>
      <p>The solution of the mister 130 will depend upon the plant
        variety as well as the climate of the ambient environment of
        growing room 100. The solution applied by mister 130 may include
        various additives such as fertilizer, fungicides, and
        insecticides. An injection feed system, well known in the art,
        meters these additives into the water which is then applied to
        the growing sheets 10 by the passing wand 132. The solution is
        sprayed onto the support sheet 16 of growing sheet 10 and is
        allowed to run down the face of support sheet 16 and into the
        growing cells 12. Excess solution will run and drip onto the
        floor of the growing room 100 to be collected in a catch basin
        either to be recycled or disposed. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6, 7 and 10, the present invention
        includes means for providing air movement within the growing
        room 100 at a preferred rate and temperature. The growing room
        100 includes cooling pads 140 mounted on one end wall 103 of
        growing room 100. A plurality of exhaust fans 142 are mounted in
        the opposite end wall 105 of growing room 100. A flexible air
        conduit 144 extends the length of growing room 100 between
        cooling pads 140 and exhaust fans 142. A deflector shield 147 is
        provided on the interior side of cooling pad 140 to direct the
        fresh cool air through the cooling pad 140 and into the open end
        of tube 144. The exhaust fan 142 connects with the other end and
        pulls the air from the cooling pad 140 through the tube 144 and
        exits the growing room 100. Tube 144 includes a plurality of
        apertures 146 directed to a particular row of racks 22 and
        growing sheets 10 so as to blow cooled air onto the plant
        material. It is preferable that the air movement is
        approximately 100 feet per minute such that the air within the
        growing room 100 is exchanged once very minute. The purpose of
        the fresh air is to kill any anaerobic fungus on the plant
        material. </p>
      <p>During the winter months, the exterior shutters, not shown, on
        the cooling pads 140 and the tubes 144 are affixed to heaters
        148 which blow hot air through tubes 144 and out apertures 146
        to heat the plant material. </p>
      <p>The growing room 100 may further provide a fogging system, such
        as the System 1000 MicroMist System manufactured by Baumac
        International of Mentone, Calif., mounted in the ceiling thereof
        to maintain the humidity levels within the growing room 100 to
        approximately 80% or more. The fog is permitted to filter down
        between the racks 22 to maintain the humidity of the seedlings.
      </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is a greenhouse, the ambient light
        will be sufficient to provide the necessary lighting for the
        plant material. The movement of the racks 22 and growing sheets
        10 through the growing room 100 will also insure that the plant
        material has sufficient light. It is also possible that the
        individual growing sheets 72-82 may be rotated on rack 22 to
        insure that the plant material on the lower sheets 80, 82
        receive as much light as those on the upper growing sheets 72,
        74. </p>
      <p>Where the growing room 100 is an enclosed structure such as a
        warehouse, artificial lighting will be provided along the
        ceiling and floor. Further, the interior of the growing room 100
        would be painted a reflective color, such as white or aluminum.
        If necessary, a plurality of floor lights 150 may be disposed
        between adjacent tracks of racks 22 as shown in FIG. 7 to
        provide additional light. Where lights 150 are provided, such
        lighting would also become a primary heat source thereby
        reducing the need for heaters 148. </p>
      <p>In the prior art, approximately 648 plugs are planted per tray.
        Each tray is approximately 11 inches by 22 inches. However, the
        trays are opaque and do not permit the passage of light. Thus,
        only one level of trays can be used throughout the greenhouse.
        This only allows approximately 400 plugs per square foot of
        growing room. However, the present invention includes
        approximately 5400 plants per rack, i.e. thirty-five rows at
        fifty plantlets with three growing sheets per foot of rack. If
        six racks can be spaced per foot, then over 32,000 plugs may be
        grown per square foot using the present invention as compared to
        400 in the prior art. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>A. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to the electronic stimulation of plant
        development. More particularly, it relates to the stimulation of
        plant development through electrifying the environment in and
        around a plant or part of a plant using an electrical field,

        handling, shipping, marketing and enjoyment of cut flowers. </p>
      <p><b>B. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>For the past forty years there has been a steady growth of the
        consumer horticultural industry in the United States and its
        growth continues to out pace all other major farm sectors.
        Overall, the industry had an estimated 44 billion dollars in
        1992 sales. Potted foliage plants, cut flowers, potted flowering
        plants, bedding plants and cut live trees represented an
        estimated 6.7 billion of this figure up from 4.4 billion in 1989
        at a growth rate averaging 3-5 percent per year. In this highly
        competitive marketplace, premiums are placed on freshness of the
        product. </p>
      <p>This industry consists of thousands of growers and retailers
        and in recent years, foreign imports have dramatically increased
        the competition in the industry. Growers and retailers are faced
        with ever increasing demands to produce and market quality
        products at reasonable prices. </p>
      <p>The highly competitive market place has forced both grower and
        retailer to incorporate technological advances into their
        business in order to maintain competitiveness. Most of the
        technological developments in the industry have been production
        oriented and have offered few advances for the retailer. These
        technological advances for the most part have been limited to
        the commercial portion of the industry and have not been
        available to the consumer public. </p>
      <p><b>Electrical Potential in Plant Cell Membranes</b> </p>
      <p>A relationship exists between electrical potential and membrane
        activity in plants. This electrical potential is commonly
        referred to as the action ("resting") potential of all cells.
        Action potential plays a critical role in the uptake and
        movement of nutrients in the plant. Resting electrical
        potentials between the intercellular and extracellular material
        of plant cells are known. Blinks, L. R., "Some Electrical
        Properties of Large Plant Cells," in Electrochemistry in Biology
        and Medicine, Shedlovsky, ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York,
        1955, pp. 187-212. The resting potential can range from
        approximately 10-200 millivolts and may be partly responsible
        for active transport in plants. Active transport allows the
        movement of materials such as potassium and calcium across cell
        membranes against a concentration gradient. </p>
      <p>The intercellular charge is almost always negative when
        measured against extracellular material. The difference in
        potential and the potential's ability to facilitate movement
        across a membrane is referred to as electroendosmosis. Blinks,
        L. R. 1940, "The Relation of the Bioelectric Phenomena to Ionic
        Permeability and to Metabolism in Large Plants, "Cold Spring
        Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 8:204-215, 1940. </p>
      <p>Damage to the membrane structure of a plant cell (such as
        during harvesting of the plant) allows for the leakage of
        certain salts such as potassium causing the membrane to return
        to a neutral resting potential. For instance, potassium leakage
        was observed when Halicystis cells were placed under anaerobic
        conditions. The cells were incapable of producing sufficient
        aerobic metabolic energy to maintain their resting potential.
        Blinks, L. R., "The Source of the Bioelectric Potential in Large
        Plant Cells," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 35:566-575, 1949. </p>
      <p>Plants are also known to take up certain salts such as
        potassium, calcium, magnesium and nitrate through the root hairs
        of the plant. These salts all play a role in the growth process
        of the plant. From the root hair cells, the salts are moved to
        the xylem ducts against a concentration gradient, possibly
        utilizing the active transport system, and are then distributed
        throughout the plant. High osmotic pressures develop as a result
        of this transport and are partly responsible for maintaining
        turgor pressure throughout the plant. When this transport system
        is interrupted the plant wilts and ultimately dies from lack of
        nutrient and fluid uptake. Biddulph, O., "Translocation of
        Inorganic Solutes," in Plant Physiology. A treatise., Stewart,
        ed., Academic Press, New York, Vol. 2 pp. 553-603, 1959. </p>
      <p>In excitable plant cells such as those of Mimosa, direct
        electrical or mechanical stimulation produces a dramatic change
        in the action potential of the membrane and produces an
        electrical wave that ultimately effects turgor pressure.
        Sibaoka, T., "Excitable Cells in Mimosa," Science 137:226, 1962.
        Similar changes in action potential have also been demonstrated
        in Nitella cells. Osterhout, W. J. V., "Electrical Potential in
        Large Plant Cells," Physiol. Rev. 16:216-237, 1936. Cells of
        Nitella show that a refractory or rest period is required before
        the action response can be triggered by stimuli. The membrane
        must have a rest period before an ionic flux in the membrane can
        be further stimulated. This refractory period can last from
        seconds to hours depending on the stimuli or damage inflicted on
        the cell. Blinks, L. R., "Some Electrical Properties of Large
        Plant Cells," in Electrochemistry in Biology and Medicine,
        Shedlovsky, ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 187-212,
        1955. Action potentials in excitable plant cells have also been
        shown to be more than mere current flow in a conductive medium.
        The speed of the electrical wave is much slower than a typical
        electrical current as the membranes must have time to adjust to
        the stimuli. Osterhout and Hill, 1929-30 J. Gen. Physiol.
        13:548. </p>
      <p>While the exact nature of the active membrane transport system
        of plants is not fully understood, electrical potential of
        membranes plays a role. Further, affecting changes in the ionic
        potential of a membrane will alter its function and affect its
        ability to take up salts and fluids. </p>
      <p><b>Enhancing Plant Growth with Electrical Current</b> </p>
      <p>Electricity has been used for the enhanced growth of plants by
        application of constant current. In some cases, very high levels
        of current have been used as a direct heating method for the
        soil and to promote growth (U.S. Pat. No. 1,874,207). U.S. Pat.
        No. 784,346 relates to a method of cultivating plants by
        electricity. The claimed invention was for a process of
        electroculture which consisted of subjecting adjacent parallel
        sections of soil in a field to the action of galvanic currents.
        The current is achieved in opposite directions between buried
        plates of dissimilar metals connected by overhead conductors. </p>
      <p>Electrical currents have also been applied to receptacles
        (pots) containing plants. U.S. Pat. No. 882,699 relates to means
        for subjecting the roots of a plant in a receptacle to a
        constant electrical and magnetic action. U.S. Pat. No. 1,331,261
        relates to a pot for growing flowers which incorporates in the
        mass of the pot forming material, a substance such as ground
        carbon, metallic zinc or lead. In the pot mass, there are also
        incorporated certain salts such as chloride salts. The invention
        proposes that when the pot so constituted is subjected to
        moisture in the natural use thereof, a chemical reaction will be
        set up between the carbon and zinc or lead, through the action
        of the salts, causing electrochemical effects which will
        stimulate plant growth. </p>
      <p><b>The Effects of Magnetism on Plants</b> </p>
      <p>It is also known that magnetism has a profound effect on the
        growth of plants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,575 relates to a apparatus
        for raising garden plants utilizing magnetism, particularly an
        apparatus utilizing magnetism to promote the uptake of
        fertilizer in the plant. Apparently, when plants are subjected
        to magnetism, the germination of seeds is affected, the growth
        of the plants is hastened, leaf color is darkened, and the
        plants resist damage by disease and pests. See, e.g., Japanese
        Patent Publication No. 52-5716 (disclosing a magnet for plant
        growth in which a powdered strongly magnetic material, an
        aqueous caking substance and a deliquescent substance are mixed,
        compression molded and then magnetized) and Japanese Patent
        Publication No. 40-11328 (disclosing a method of increasing the
        growth of a plant by utilizing magnetic energy). </p>
      <p><b>Marketing Harvested Plants</b> </p>
      <p>The physiology of the flower once it is removed from the parent
        plant is referred to as post harvest physiology. Flowering
        plants are complex living organisms made up of roots, stems,
        leaves, flowers and a host of intricate subsystems supporting
        these organs. The chief subsystem connecting all these plant
        parts is the complex vascular system of each plant. This
        vascular system allows for the transfer of a variety of fluids
        throughout the plant. Sap is the fluid constituent of the
        vascular system and it consists of primarily water. There are
        also nutrients and other chemicals in the sap necessary to the
        plant's existence. </p>
      <p>The root system of a plant serves two major functions. First,
        it serves as the support system, anchoring the plant to the
        subsurface. The second function is the uptake of water and
        nutrients. This uptake is chiefly accomplished through the
        process of osmosis. This process is selective and is responsible
        for the plant's ability to concentrate selected molecules. </p>
      <p>Once water and nutrients have been absorbed by the plants
        roots, these substances are translocated to the stems of the
        plant. This translocation occurs due to a variety of processes.
        They include osmosis and capillary action. The vascular system
        of the plant is designed to facilitate the movement of fluids
        due to capillary action. </p>
      <p>Leaves (and the structures derived from leaf tissue such as
        sepals, petals and flower parts) are the primary location of two
        means of fluid loss in plants. This loss occurs chiefly due to
        transpiration and evaporation. Typically, on the underside of a
        leaf specialized cells organized into specific organs called
        stomata are found. These organs function as gates that allow the
        control of fluids in the plant. During hot dry periods, these
        gates are closed restricting the loss of fluid and restricting
        the flow of fluids through the plant. When water is plentiful
        and the temperature is not excessively hot, these organs open to
        allow evaporation of water. This evaporative process is believed
        to complete the translocation of water through a plant. </p>
      <p>Plants maintain their erect position under natural conditions
        by turgor pressure. This pressure is that of the individual
        plant cells (intercellular) and in the compartments of the plant
        vascular system (vascular). When the primary fluid flow of the
        plant is interrupted, loss of turgor pressure ensues. This is
        normally seen as wilting of the plant. If the fluid flow is not
        reestablished in a given period of time, the plant enters
        terminal wilt. Once this time limit is reached, the plant looses
        its ability to take up water or other fluids and it dies. </p>
      <p>When a flower is cut from the parent plant, it is separated
        from this complex fluid delivery system. Immediately, it begins
        to loose fluids. The losses occur in two forms, evaporation
        through the leaves and loss through the wound site created by
        severing the parent plant and flower stem. Many plants have a
        wound response which attempts to seal the wound both in the
        severed flower stem and in the parent plant. This is most easily
        seen in the latex bearing plants which upon wounding, exude a
        sticky latex sealant to cover the wound site. </p>
      <p>Thus, there are a large number of post-harvest factors that may
        affect the useful life of a cut flower including: initial
        growing conditions of the flowering plant; method of harvesting
        and immediate post-harvest treatment; duration and method of
        shipping; quality of water used for storage; bacterial load of
        the parent plant and flower; temperature and humidity of the
        air; quantity and quality of available light; and presence or
        absence of ethylene gas. </p>
      <p><b>Prior Art Approaches for Maintaining Cut Flower Freshness</b>
      </p>
      <p>In flower harvesting, sometimes the grower will artificially
        seal the wound site to help prevent water loss. Additionally,
        harvested flowers are routinely stored in cool damp conditions
        to further reduce water loss through evaporation. Storage in
        water during shipping is usually impractical and raises the risk
        of microbial damage to the harvested product. </p>
      <p>Consumers are usually instructed to recut the flower stems in
        order to reestablish a fresh wound thus causing fluid flow to be
        reinitiated. This approach does extend the useful life of the
        flower but provides only a limited uptake of fluids. Loss or
        withering of petals, weakening of the stem, and rotting or
        spoilage of the leaves, and premature senescence are among the
        symptoms which may make a cut flower lose its freshness or
        viability. </p>
      <p>Currently to minimize the deterioration of flowers in transit
        from the field to the customer, they are maintained in water
        where possible. It is known that maintaining the stems of cut
        flowers in water can prolong their freshness by allowing the
        flower to absorb water and replace the moisture lost through
        transpiration. It is also known that as the relative humidity of
        the environment in which the flowers are maintained decreases,
        transpiration increases, causing the flowers to wither sooner.
        Finally, it is known that refrigeration extends the flowers'
        span of viability by slowing the organic processes associated
        with the flowers' respiration. It is generally preferred to
        refrigerate cut flowers at temperatures of approximately
        34.degree.-38.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Procedures exist for the maintenance of flowers in
        refrigerated, humidity-controlled environments, which may
        eliminate the need for keeping the stems in water, thereby
        minimizing water-borne diseases. Preferably the relative
        humidity in such environments is 90-92%. Higher levels of
        humidity can promote decay, while lower levels allow the flower
        to dry out. Humidity-controlled environments are costly to
        provide, and as access to the flowers takes place, some exchange
        with the ambient atmosphere may occur, increasing the volume of
        air which must be climate-controlled. </p>
      <p>Flower handling, storage, and shipment methods discussed above
        have been used with respect to flowers for sale with varying
        degrees of success. Due to the high cost of flower stock and the
        cost and inconvenience of the various methods of minimizing
        flower deterioration, it is desired to improve the state of the
        art. In particular, methods and apparatus are needed which (1)
        promote the development of plants or maintain the freshness of
        plant parts without the need for refrigeration or (2) improve
        the freshness of plant parts utilizing refrigeration over that
        of prior art approaches requiring refrigeration. Preferably,
        such methods and apparatus should be applicable to various
        stages of post-harvest handling and should be readily utilizable
        by consumers as well. The present invention overcomes certain of
        the deficiencies of the prior art methods and apparatus. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>

        art by providing methods and apparatus which promote the
        development or maintain the freshness of plants or plant parts.

      <p>The plant stimulator of the present invention includes a

        bottom of the container for the plant or plant part with the
        positive electrode disposed near the surface of the plant
        development medium. In another method, the negative electrode
        may be placed in a medium for a plant part with the positive
        electrode being affixed to the stem at another location of the
        plant part. </p>
      <p>Thus, the present invention relates generally to methods and
        apparatus for electronically stimulating and enhancing the
        active membrane transport system in plant material by the
        application of constant or discrete pulses of electrical energy.
        By so doing, the method results in promoting growth and
        maintaining cellular activity in harvested material. This method
        may be applied to any plant or plant part including plants
        growing in soil or other medium (such as hydroponic solution),
        cut flowers, harvested fruits and vegetables and field grown
        crops. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p><b>Apparatus</b> </p>
      <p>In certain embodiments, the apparatus comprises a pulse
        generator further comprised of a printed circuit board that is
        controlled by an integrated circuit that serves as a negative
        wave generator and as the timing apparatus for the cyclic
        production of the pulse. Power for the pulse generator can be
        supplied by battery, line current, solar power or any other
        method of generating an electrical charge of sufficient quantity
        to power the pulse generator. Electrodes are attached to the
        pulse generator by insulated wire. </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a preferred
        embodiment of an apparatus for practicing the methods of the
        present invention. The apparatus of FIG. 1 is a plant stimulator
        10 including a positive electrode 12 and a negative electrode 14
        electrically connected to a pulse generator 16 powered by a
        power source 18. An LED 20 may be connected between positive
        electrode 12 and pulse generator 16. Positive electrode 12 is
        electrically connected to LED 20 by an electrical conduit 22. An
        electrical conduit 24 electrically connects light emitting diode
        (LED) 20 to the positive terminal 26 of pulse generator 16.
        Negative electrode 14 is electrically connected by electrical
        conduit 28 to negative terminal 30 on pulse generator 16. Power
        supply 18 is electrically connected to pulse generator 16 by
        positive electrical conduit 32 and ground 34. </p>
      <p>The positive electrode 12 is preferably made of tungsten and
        the negative electrode 14 is preferably made of copper. However,
        it can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other
        metals or conductive materials may be used as electrodes
        depending upon the method of application. Additionally, the size
        and shape of the electrodes will vary depending upon the
        application. </p>
      <p>The pulse generator 16 provides a controlled self-repeating
        generation of a timed negative pulse wave and is a
        self-resetting negative pulse generator. The trigger timing and
        reset values of pulse generator 16 are controlled by the value
        of the capacitors and resistors used in the circuitry,
        hereinafter described in further detail. The pulse generator 16
        preferably has low energy consumption for general operation and
        can be triggered by as little as -0.3 volts with a maximum
        voltage input of 18 volts. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, the electrical circuit of the pulse
        generator 16 is shown. Pulse generator 16 includes an Archer
        TLC555 Timer 36 wired to a printed circuit board in an astable
        mode. Timer 36 may be an IC (integrated circuit) model/#TLC555
        manufactured by Radio Shack.TM., a division of Tandy
        Corporation, from Fort Worth, Tex. The TLC555 is a monolithic
        timing circuit using the LIN-CMOS.TM. process. Timer 36 is a
        standard 8 pin integrated circuit package and is connected to
        support electronics hereinafter described. Pulse generator 16
        produces an oscillating output which is thereby connected to
        positive electrode 12 (FIG. 1) to conduct a pulsating current
        through a plant development medium or plant part. </p>
      <p>Timer 36 includes a reset terminal 38 and a supply terminal 40
        which are both electrically connected to the positive conduit 32
        of power source 18 (FIG. 1). The circuit of pulse generator 16
        includes a variable resistor 50, a non-variable resistor 60, and
        a capacitor 70. The variable resistor 50 includes a first
        terminal 42 electrically connected to the positive conduit 32 of
        power supply 18 and another terminal 44 electrically connected
        to a discharge terminal 46 of timer 36. Non-variable resistor 60
        is also electrically connected to discharge terminal 46 via
        terminal 44. The other terminal 48 is electrically connected to
        terminal 52. Terminal 52 is electrically connected to trigger
        terminal 54 and threshold terminal 56 of timer 36. Threshold
        terminal 56 is electrically connected to trigger terminal 54. </p>
      <p>The anode of the timing capacitor 70 is electrically connected
        to the terminals 48 and 52 and thus trigger terminal 54 of timer
        36. The cathode of capacitor 70 is electrically connected to the
        negative electrical conduit 34 of power source 18 via terminal
        58. The ground terminal 62 of timer 36 is also connected to
        negative electrical conduit 34 via terminal 58 and thus to
        ground 64. Output terminal 66 of timer 36 is electrically
        connected to the anode of LED 20. LED 20 is connected between
        output terminal 66 and positive electrode 12 to serve as a
        visible signal that pulse generator 16 is working properly and
        pulsating current is being produced. A control terminal (not
        shown) of timer 36 is not electrically connected. </p>
      <p>Variable resistor 50 and non-variable resistor 60 together with
        timing capacitor 70 are connected in parallel so as to act as a
        timing circuit. Starting from an initial uncharged state, timing
        capacitor 70 begins to store an electrical potential as current
        is sourced through resistors 50, 60. The capacitor voltage is
        monitored at threshold 56 and trigger terminal 54. When the
        voltage increases above a predetermined trigger level
        established by the internal circuitry of timer 36, output
        terminal 62 of timer 36 changes potential to a high voltage
        level. The internal circuitry of timer 36 thus produces a
        negative feedback to the discharge terminal 46 and pulls the
        terminal 46 to a low voltage state. The voltage potential stored
        on capacitor 70 begins to discharge to a low voltage level
        through the path established by resistor 60. As capacitor 70
        discharges and the capacitor potential falls below the
        predetermined trigger level, the output terminal 62 of timer 36
        changes state to a low voltage level and the discharge terminal
        46 will change to a high voltage level. Current will then begin
        to flow through resistors 50, 60, and capacitor 70 will again
        begin to store a potential. This process of storing and
        discharging continues so long as power is supplied to the
        circuit by power source 18 (FIG. 1). </p>
      <p>Output terminal 62 will oscillate between a low voltage and
        high voltage levels, at a frequency determined by the values of
        resistors 50, 60 and capacitor 70. Non-variable resistor 60 has
        a constant value of 1000 ohms. The variable resistor 50 has a
        variable resistance between 10,000 and 1,000,000 ohms. Timing
        capacitor 70 has values which range from 0.22 to 0.068
        microfarads. Power source 18 (FIG. 1) generates a voltage which
        may be changed between negative 0.0001 and positive 5 volts. In
        the preferred embodiment, the variable resistor 50 is 1,000,000
        ohms, non-variable resistor 60 is 1,000 ohms, capacitor 70 is
        0.068 microfarads, and the voltage supplied by power source 18
        (FIG. 1) is 5 volts. The combination of the preferred embodiment
        produces an output frequency of 20 hertz. </p>
      <p>In operation, the plant stimulator 10 is utilized in one of
        several preferred methods of the present invention. Positive and
        negative electrodes 12, 14 are adapted for use with varying
        methods of plant stimulation of the present invention.
        Electrodes 12, 14 may be placed in an electrically conductive
        media with a plant disposed therebetween to induce a current
        through the media to stimulate the uptake of fluids in the
        plant. In a variation of this method, negative electrode 14 may
        be placed adjacent the bottom of the container containing the
        plant or plant part and media with the positive electrode 12
        being disposed adjacent the surface of the media so as to
        conduct electrical current through the media to enhance the
        uptake of fluids into the plant. In another method of use, the
        negative electrode may be placed in a container of media with
        one end of the plant disposed on the media and the positive
        electrode attached to another part of the plant such that the
        electric current is conducted through the media and through the
        plant to induce plant stimulation. In still another application
        of plant stimulator 10, the electrodes may be placed opposite
        plant growing areas to conduct electrical current through the
        soil or other media. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIGS. 3-8 a variety of configurations of the
        apparatus 10 may be seen. In each case, the positive electrode
        14 is constructed in a manner to allow a conductive surface of
        that electrode to easily contact the plant development medium 76
        or a distal portion of the plant or plant part vascular system.
        In each case, the negative electrode 14 is constructed in a
        manner to allow a conductive surface of that electrode to easily
        contact the plant development medium 76. In each case, both the
        positive electrode 12 and the negative electrode 14 are operably
        connected through lead wires 22 and 28, respectively, to the
        pulse generator 16 which is in turn operably connected to an
        electrical power source 18. In each case, the positive electrode
        12 and negative electrode 14 are spatially separated. FIGS. 6
        and 7 additionally illustrate separation by non-conductive
        materials between the spaced electrodes 12, 14. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3-5, FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate
        positioning a plant 72, as shown in FIG. 3, or a plurality of
        plants 74, as shown in FIG. 4, between positive electrode 12 and
        negative electrode 14. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, electrodes 12,
        14 are positioned along the side of the plant submerged in a
        media 76 housed in a container 78 or 80. In FIG. 5, the negative
        electrode 14 is disposed adjacent the bottom 82 of container 78
        with positive electrode 12 being disposed adjacent the surface
        of media 76. Negative electrode 14 is below the roots 84 while
        the positive electrode 12 is more adjacent to the stem 86. Lead
        wires 22, 28 extend to pulse generator 16 (not shown in FIGS.
        3-5) from electrodes 12, 14, respectively. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, the plant stimulator 16 is shown
        housed within the wall 90 and bottom 92 of container 88.
        Positive electrode 12 is disposed within the upper portion of
        wall 90 and exposed to the interior of container 88 so that it
        is in electrical engagement with the media 76 such as soil.
        Electrical lead 22 extends through the wall 90 to the bottom 92
        for connection to pulse generator 16 housed within the bottom 92
        of container 88. The power source 18 is electrically connected
        to pulse generator 16. The negative electrode 14 is disposed
        within the floor 94 of container 88 with electrical lead 28
        being connected to pulse generator 16. Power source 18 would be
        a small battery such as a watch battery. A drain hole 96 would
        be provided through floor 94 and bottom 92 to allow drainage
        from container 88. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a probe or wand 100
        housing both electrodes 12, 14. Wand 100 is made of a
        non-conductive material with positive electrode 12 disposed
        within the non-conductive material adjacent the upper end of
        wand 100 and negative electrode 14 is housed within the
        non-conductive material adjacent the lower end of wand 100. A
        conduit 102 extends down through the non-conductive material of
        wand 100 with lead wire 22 being electrically connected to
        positive electrode 12 and lead wire 28 being electrically
        connected to negative electrode 14. In this embodiment, as
        distinguished from the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3-5, the
        electrodes 12, 14 are housed in a single housing such as wand
        100 which may be submerged into the media 76 for generating
        current through the media 76 in a container of plant or plant
        parts such as are illustrated in FIG. 15 hereinafter described
        in further detail. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 17, a wand 100 as described above is
        depicted wherein the power supply 18 further comprises a
        self-contained battery within wand 100. A two-piece housing 202,
        204 is provided which may be extended in order to variably
        position the positive electrode 12 at increasingly greater
        distances from negative electrode 14. A water-tight joint 206
        joins the two-piece housing 202, 204 at a washer 190. Negative
        electrode 14 is operably connected to a power supply such as a
        watch battery 18 through leads 32 and 34. Threaded cap 194
        allows access to power supply 18 and serves to complete the
        circuit between electrode 14 and generator 16 through lead 32
        and contact 196. Washer 192 provides for a water-tight seal for
        cap 194. Power supply 18 is supported by flange 198. Flange 198
        also supports generator 16 as does flange 200. In this
        embodiment lead 24 is a coiled wire allowing extension of the
        housings 202, 204. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 8, the plant stimulator 10 is shown
        having the positive electrode 12 affixed directly to the plant
        part or Christmas tree 104. Positive electrode 12 is shown
        attached to the stem of the upper portion of the tree 104. Such
        attachment may be made by a screw which penetrates the stem of
        the tree 104 and operably completes the circuit between the
        positive electrode 12 and negative electrode 14 through the
        tree's vascular system. The negative electrode 14 is shown
        housed within a container 106 for tree 104 which contains a
        media 107 for the tree. Lead wires 22, 28 extend to pulse
        generator 16 and power supply 18. </p>
      <p>As can be appreciated, electrodes 12, 14 may take various forms
        and may be positioned at various locations to induce a current
        either through the media 76 or plant part 72 to accomplish plant
        stimulation in accordance with the present invention.
        Additionally, a plurality of apparatus may be applied to a
        single plant or plant part in certain embodiments. </p>
      <p><b>Methods</b> </p>
      <p>Thus, in one embodiment, electronic apparatus 10 delivers a
        predetermined discrete pulse of current to the plant, plant part
        or the medium that the plant is being grown or stored in. The
        electrodes 12, 14 are placed in a growing medium 76 such as
        soil, hydroponic solution, or the support medium for harvested
        plant pans, such as the culture medium for tissue culture or
        water used to store cut flowers. For instance, one pair of
        electrodes 12, 14 is used for container grown crops while
        multiple electrode pairs are used for field grown crops.
        Composition and design of the electrodes 13, 14 is also
        dependent on the nature of the application. For instance, in
        applying current to cut flowers, a looped coil copper electrode
        serves well for the negative electrode 14 while a one-half inch
        straight tungsten electrode serves best as the positive
        electrode 12. In potted plants, straight copper electrodes serve
        well for both electrodes 12, 14. In other applications, it may
        be best to use gold plated electrodes. </p>
      <p>In growing plants the electrodes 12, 14 are placed in a manner
        so that the root zone occupies the space between the electrodes
        12, 14 thus allowing for maximum exposure to the current. This
        method can be accomplished in container grown plants or in field
        grown crops. When pulsed current is applied in this manner,
        accelerated growth rates and enhanced plant color development
        are obtained. </p>
      <p>In the storage of cut flowers, the negative electrode 14 is
        placed adjacent the bottom of the storage container and the
        positive electrode is preferably immersed in the upper one inch
        of the growth medium (water). This provides the maximum exposure
        of the plant material to the current. </p>
      <p>In the preservation of live cut Christmas trees, the negative
        electrode 14 is placed in the Christmas tree stand water and the
        positive electrode 12 is attached to the upper portion of the
        tree using any method that allows the penetration of the
        electrode through the bark so that contact is made with the
        vascular system of the tree such as with a metallic screw. By
        using the methods and apparatus of the invention, trees remain
        fresh for a longer period than by prior art methods of treatment
        and there is a reduction in needle drop associated with the
        death of the tree. </p>
      <p>In certain embodiments, the application of electrical current
        to the apparatus 10 produces a negative pulsed charge that is
        propagated through whatever medium 76 the plant or plant part is
        grown or stored in, thus completing the circuit between the
        negative and positive electrodes 12, 14. The resistance of the
        growing or storage medium 76 will effect the total current
        available to the plant or plant part. For instance, water is
        much more conductive to current flow than semi dry soil and
        water containing fertilizer is more conductive than tap water.
        The apparatus 10 must therefore allow adjustment of the current
        output to the electrodes as well as controlling the pulse rate
        of the current. </p>
      <p>In certain embodiments, the pulse of the current is important
        as it is proposed that by timing the application of the current
        to the plant or plant parts, a cyclic flux in the ionic state of
        the plant membranes is accomplished. It is further proposed that
        this cyclic flux aids in the uptake of nutrients and the
        movement of fluids through the plant by stimulating the active
        transport system of the plant. Further, it is proposed that the
        current flux produces ionic changes in certain salts such as
        potassium, calcium and nitrate, and possible a polarity shift in
        water that make those essential items more permeable to the
        plant's membrane system. The invention promotes growth in living
        plants and extends the life functions of harvested plant
        material by discrete application of electrical current. Pulsed
        currents create ionic flux in the membrane system of the plant
        and alter the ionic state of certain salts and fluids external
        to the plant making them easier for the plant to assimilate. </p>
      <p>The methods and apparatus of the invention utilize the natural
        negative charge of plants and cut flowers. It is believed that
        the use of the apparatus 10 establishes an electron flow through
        the vascular system of the plant or flower and creates a
        condition known as electroosmosis aiding in the movement of
        molecules through the plant's vascular system. This movement
        helps the cut flower or plant to enhance or reestablish the
        movement of water and other molecules throughout the plant.
        Initial studies indicate that the method will extend the usable
        shelf life of fresh cut flowers 3-5 days over conventional
        storage. These results will be further discussed in the examples
        to follow. </p>
      <p>It is also proposed that bacterial growth in the storage
        containers is reduced or restricted during the application of
        the current. This reduction of the bacteria in the vase water
        delays the decomposition of the stems normally seen in
        conventional storage methods. </p>
      <p><b>Growth Media</b> </p>
      <p>The invention uses two or more spaced electrodes 12, 14 in a
        conducting medium to complete a circuit. This conducting medium
        can be any medium in which a plant or plant part may be grown or
        stored. For the purposes of the invention, this can include any
        of the following. </p>
      <p><b>1. Fluids.</b> </p>
      <p>The electrical properties of water are dependent on a number of
        factors. Laboratory produced ultra pure water is a very poor
        conductive medium. However as ions or impurities are added or
        dissolved in the water, the conductivity increases. Most
        naturally occurring water is a fairly good electrical conductor
        due to the dissolved salts such as iron, sodium, copper, and
        zinc, that are found in the water. Water used by plants also
        carries a wide range of dissolved salts. These salts are used as
        nutrients by the plant to carry out life functions. </p>
      <p>Plants can be grown by using only a nutrient loaded water
        solution. This is commonly referred to as hydroponics. This
        process consists of applying the nutrient water solution to the
        root zone of the plant by either constantly submerging the roots
        or by the intermittent application of the fluid by spraying or
        flooding. The practice is widely used in the production of plant
        crops ranging from lettuce to roses. The process allows a very
        precise control of the nutrient levels that are available to the
        plant and thus gives some control on the growth rate and
        production cycle that is not present in field grown crops. </p>
      <p>Tap water is typically used for the storage of plant parts such
        as cut flowers. This water normally has good conductivity but
        will vary greatly from source to source. </p>
      <p>Cut flowers are typically harvested and placed in large
        containers of tap water and in coolers shortly after harvest.
        They remain in the water until they are shipped. After shipping
        they are again placed in water where they remain in water for
        the duration of their useful life. </p>
      <p><b>2. Soils.</b> </p>
      <p>By far the largest portion of all plants are produced in some
        type of soil. This includes all field grown crops as well as
        greenhouse crops. Soils can be described as any number of
        aggregate compositions consisting of sands, clays and organic
        compost such as peat moss that is suitable for growing plants. </p>
      <p>One of the critical factors in determining the quality of a
        material or aggregate mixture to serve as a soil is its ability
        to hold and release water. This is typically dependent on the
        size of the particles of the soil and the ratio mix of sand,
        clay and organic compost in the mix. Typically, the finer the
        mix of particle size the greater the water retention of the mix.
        This is a result of capillary action and surface tension of
        water between the individual particles. The larger the
        individual particles and the greater the space between the
        particles, the faster water will drain through the mix. For
        example, soil with a high ratio of large grain sand will drain
        water at a much faster rate that a soil than contains a high
        ratio of clay. Another property of soils is their ability to
        release desired nutrients into the water that the plants use for
        growth. </p>
      <p>In common usage today are a number of soil substitutes such as
        vermiculite, perlite, pure peat moss, and artificially produced
        foams that are used to grow plants. Most of these artificial
        soils do not supply any nutrient value but merely provide a
        support for the root system of the plant. Plants grown in these
        artificial soils are dependent on the application of fertilizers
        for their nutrients. In many cases these artificial soils are
        used as additives to conventional soil to increase the soil's
        ability to handle water in the desired manner. Whatever its
        constituency, so long as the soil acting as a growth medium can
        conduct a current, it is included within the definition of such
        media. </p>
      <p>Under conditions in which tissue culture plants are grown or
        stored in a solid or semi-solid material, typical practice
        involves removing a selected part from the parent plant and
        placing it on a solid or semi-solid support medium that contains
        the necessary nutrients and sugars that the plant requires for
        life support. This solid or semi-solid support material can be
        made by adding agar, gelatin or any other gelling agent to a
        nutrient loaded, water-based solution. This gelled medium
        provides a solid support for the tissue while providing the
        water and nutrients that the tissue requires for growth. </p>
      <p><b>Particular Methods for Using the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>As has been discussed, most of the methods that are utilized
        for the growth or storage of plants or plant parts require the
        presence of water. Using water as a conductive agent, the
        current invention applies a pulsed current to the plant or plant
        parts being grown or stored in any fluid, soil, solid or
        semi-solid. Various applications envisioned are: </p>
      <p><b>1. Hydroponic application for plant growth.</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3-5, The current invention may be used
        in the hydroponic production of plants by placing two or more
        electrodes 12, 14, one positive and one negative, in the
        nutrient solution 76 in which the plant 72 is grown. The plant
        72 may be placed in a position in the solution 76 that is
        between the electrodes 12, 14 thus allowing the plant 72 to be
        in the direct line of current flow as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
        The size or shape of the electrode 12, 14 that may be used will
        vary with the size of the container 78 and ionic strength of the
        solution 76. Electrodes 12, 14 may be produced which accommodate
        large scale operations where many plants 74 can occupy the space
        between two electrodes 12, 14 as shown in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, in hydroponic applications where the
        nutrient solution is only applied intermittently, the electrode
        configuration would be slightly different. In that case, the
        electrodes 12, 14 would be placed in a manner where the root
        system 110 of the plant 74 is in direct contact with at least
        one of the electrodes 12, 14, preferably the negative electrode
        14. The positive electrode 12 would be positioned in a manner
        that would allow a completed circuit to be formed as the run off
        from the spray solution, provided by spray heads 112 onto the
        plants 74 supported by plant support 114, simultaneously
        contacted both the plant and the plant development medium. </p>
      <p>Importantly, the current invention may be practiced to allow
        for different electrical potentials that are presented in
        different nutrient solutions 76, differently sized and shaped
        growing areas and methods associated with hydroponic plant
        production. Where necessary, the electrodes 12, 14 used in the
        applications in hydroponics would be constructed of conductive
        material that would not degrade in the presence of the nutrient
        solution or the current. </p>
      <p><b>2. Pot grown crops.</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 10, the present invention may also be
        used in the culture of pot grown plants 72. This is accomplished
        by the placement of two or more electrodes 12, 14 in the pot 116
        used for growing. The electrodes 12, 14 are positioned in a
        manner that allows for maximum exposure of the root zone 118 to
        the flow of current between the electrodes 12, 14. The
        electrodes 12, 14 may also be positioned on the probe or wand
        100, shown in FIG. 7, where they are separated by a
        non-conductive material. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 11, for large scale production in pots, a
        plurality of pots 116 may be positioned on a capillary mat 120
        that is connected to the electrodes 12, 14 thus providing
        multiple pots with current flow. Similarly, individual pots may
        be produced in a manner that incorporates the entire apparatus
        in the construction of the pot, where the pot may include the
        electrodes 12, 14, power supply 18 and pulse generator 16. This
        construction eliminates any visible, external sign of the
        apparatus (see FIG. 6). </p>
      <p><b>3. Field grown crops.</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, the present invention may
        also be applied to field grown crops by the appropriate spacing
        of the electrodes 12, 14 in the field. Electrodes 12, 14 are
        placed at appropriate spaces throughout the growing area 122.
        They are positioned in such a manner as to provide maximum
        exposure to the root zone of the growing plants. Power for these
        electrodes 12, 14 may be supplied by conventional line sources
        such as battery or line current or by solar, wind or other power
        sources in the field. FIG. 13 illustrates the use of solar
        collectors 124 and solar panels 126 for power source 18. This
        embodiment may also be used by the home gardener, including uses
        in flower beds, vegetable gardens, individual trees and lawn
        areas. </p>
      <p><b>4. Storage of Fresh Flowers and Other Harvested Plant Parts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15, the present invention is
        particularly useful when used to extend the shelf life of fresh
        cut flowers and other plant parts 130. This is accomplished by
        placing two or more electrodes 12, 14 in a vase or container 78
        in which the flowers 130 are stored. The electrodes 12, 14 are
        positioned in a manner that allows for maximum exposure of the
        stems 132 of the flowers 130 to be exposed to the current. The
        electrodes 12, 14 may also be placed on the probe or wand 100
        shown in FIG. 7 where they are separated by some non-conductive
        material. </p>
      <p>Individual vases or containers 88 may also be produced in a
        manner that incorporates the entire apparatus in the
        construction of the container. (see, FIG. 6) Such a design would
        include the electrodes 12, 14, power source 18 and pulse
        generator 16. This construction also eliminates any visible
        external sign of the apparatus 10. </p>
      <p>The entire apparatus 10 may be fashioned in a manner that
        allows it to be dropped into a vase or other container 78 as
        shown in FIG. 7 or 17. This embodiment is water proof and may
        have an internal power source such as a battery. In this
        embodiment of the invention, the electrodes 12, 14 and separated
        by a non-conductive material such as plastic. The design varies
        depending on the nature of the containment vessel 78 in which it
        is to be used. The apparatus 10 of the invention may also be
        designed in a manner that will allow several containers to be
        provided with current from one power/pulse source. This would
        allow multiple electrodes to be driven from one power source
        while providing current to several independent containers. </p>
      <p>The present invention may also be used to prolong the freshness
        of fruits or vegetables. This is accomplished by positioning the
        electrodes 12, 14 in a manner that exposes the plant material to
        the maximum flow of current. For example, the storage and
        marketing of leaf lettuce has particular usefulness. The
        electrodes 12, 14 are positioned in a bed of very wet ice and
        the lettuce is displayed on top of this ice bed. The melt water
        provides both the moisture for the lettuce and the conductive
        material 76 for the current. </p>
      <p>The present invention may also be used to prolong the freshness
        of cut trees 104 such as Christmas Trees, such as shown in FIG.
        8. This is accomplished by placing the negative electrode 14 of
        the invention in the water reservoir 107 of the tree stand 108
        and attaching the positive electrode 12 to the upper part 109 of
        the tree 104. </p>
      <p>Thus, the present invention relates to methods of promoting the
        development of a plant 72 or a part of a plant 130. As used
        herein, development of a plant or a part of a plant means the
        natural progression found at any stage of a plant's life cycle
        as it would occur without the stimulus of an electrifying
        current. Where whole plants develop from seed to plantlet, to
        mature plant, to flowering and finally to senescence,
        development of the plant along any portion of this life cycle
        may be one which is promoted using the methods of the invention.
        For instance, in certain embodiments, a pulsed electrical field
        may be applied to a plant development medium which contains
        seeds in order to promote the development of these seeds into
        plantlets with rudimentary shoots and roots. Similarly, where
        pre-flowering plants are treated by the pulsed field methods of
        the invention, the promotion of flower development including
        budding, pollen set, opening and fruit or seed development is
        achieved. </p>
      <p>The present invention also relates to methods for maintaining
        the freshness of plants or parts of plants. As used herein,
        freshness of a plant or plant part refers to normally understood
        indicia of fresh produce and cut flowers. A plant or plant part
        is understood herein to lose its freshness when certain indicia
        are demonstrated such as the loss or withering of leaves,
        petioles, petals, sepals and the like. It may also be indicative
        of loss of freshness when a plant or plant part exhibits a
        weakness in a stem portion due to a loss in the turgor pressure
        of the stem portion. In the more advanced stages of loss of
        freshness, rotting or spoilage of the plant or plant part is
        observed. </p>
      <p>One general embodiment relates to methods of promoting
        development or maintaining freshness and is the same in each
        case, whether it is applied to plants or their parts alone.
        These methods comprise creating a pulsed electrical field in a
        plant development medium, where the medium is capable of
        conducting electricity and then contacting the plant or plant
        part with the medium. </p>
      <p>For the purposes of the invention, a pulsed electrical field is
        one in which a discontinuous current is applied to the plant
        development medium. Contrastingly, the plant development medium
        in certain embodiments may also be subjected to a continuous
        electrical field. The pulsed electrical field can be varied as
        to the frequency of the pulses of electricity by modifying the
        electrical circuit which generates the field. A slower pulse
        rate provides a longer time for recovery of the electrical
        potential of the plant cellular membranes across which
        translocation is occurring. A faster pulse rate reduces such
        recovery time. Thus, for different plants and plant parts, it is
        possible to adjust the pulse rate necessary to maximize
        translocation across the plant membranes. </p>
      <p>The plant development medium of the invention is defined as any
        medium which is capable of conducting a current and supporting
        the development of a plant or plant part. Such a medium may
        consist of any of the circuit completing media discussed above
        including water, nutrient solution, sprays, soils, soil
        substitutes, and tissue culture media. In the case of initially
        non-aqueous media, such as soil and soil substitutes, the
        addition of sufficient water or nutrient aqueous solutions to
        allow the soil or soil substitute to conduct an electrical
        current will suffice as a plant development medium for purposes
        of the invention. </p>
      <p>For the purposes of the invention, the ability of a plant
        development medium to conduct electricity may be continuous as
        in the case of a vase of water or nutrient solution. However, a
        plant development medium may be capable of conducting a current
        of electricity at some times and not at others. Such cases may
        occur when a soil cycles through various levels of hydration as
        when a potted plant may be fully capable of conducting a current
        initially after a thorough watering of the plant in the pot and
        may thereafter dry out and lose its ability to carry the
        current. In any case, the capability of carrying the current may
        be reinitiated simply by rehydrating. Similarly, soils such as
        in flower beds, vegetable patches, and field grown crops may
        undergo cycles of hydration. Hydroponic applications where
        discontinuous spraying takes place may also be subjected to
        cycles of hydration. In all such cases, these plant development
        media regain their ability to conduct a current and are
        therefore included within the definition of media capable of
        conducting electricity. </p>
      <p>One embodiment relates to a method which requires contacting
        the plant or part of a plant with the medium in order to expose
        the plant or plant part to the electrical field. In certain
        embodiments the contacting of the plant or plant part with the
        medium will comprise actual insertion of the plant or plant part
        into the medium. For instance, seeds may be fully immersed in a
        wetted soil as a plant development medium through which a pulsed
        current is passed. Alternatively, the plant or plant part may
        only contact the medium along a portion of the plant or plant
        part. For instance, cuttings which require rooting may be placed
        in a wetted vermiculite and subjected to the electrical filed.
        In a preferred embodiment, cut flowers and greens may be placed
        in a vase with water as the plant development medium and
        subjected to the electrical fields of the invention. Also, as
        described above, the contact of the plant or plant part with the
        medium may itself be intermittent such as where cycles of
        wetting and drying take place or where hydroponic spraying is
        utilized. In any case, the required contact step is achieved
        when contact of the plant or plant part or a portion of either
        is exposed to a completed circuit comprising the electrical
        field in the plant development medium. </p>
      <p>As discussed above, in certain embodiments the method is
        carried out where the medium further comprises water. The
        aqueous plant development medium is necessarily one which will
        conduct a current of electricity, thus there must be at least
        some dissolved ions. Most sources of water readily available to
        growers contain enough dissolved ions to conduct a current. When
        water is the plant development medium, it may be utilized as a
        part of a solution further comprising a horticultural
        preservative. A wide variety of such preservatives are available
        and known well to those of skill in the horticultural arts such
        as silver thiosulfate, copper sulfate, heavy metal solutions and
        other anti-microbial compounds. </p>
      <p>As described above, the methods of the invention may be carded
        out on parts of plants such as a plant stem 132. Of particular
        interest in this regard are applications of the methods of the
        invention to plant stems 132 further having flowers. Similarly,
        the plant part may further comprise an evergreen tree trunk
        separated from its root portion, such as a Christmas tree 104. </p>
      <p>Where the methods are applied to stems 132 comprising flowers,
        it will be understood by the skilled artisan that a flowering
        stem may be one which has a fully developed bloom. However, of
        particular advantage in the present invention is the use of
        stems comprising buds of flowers yet to develop. Surprisingly,
        when the methods of the invention are applied to early bud
        stems, the buds respond to the electrical fields by continuing
        to develop approximately as they would if the stem remained
        connected to the parent plant, at least for a period of time in
        excess of that without the electrical stimulus. </p>
      <p>A method of promoting the development or maintaining the
        freshness of plant parts is also described which comprises the
        steps of creating a continuous electrical field in a plant
        development medium capable of conducting electricity and then
        contacting the plant part with the medium. In certain instances,
        it may be preferable to expose a plant part such as a stem in an
        aqueous plant development medium to continuous electrical fields
        rather than to pulsed electrical fields. </p>
      <p>Similarly, it is possible to utilize the methods of promoting
        the development or maintaining the freshness of a plant or a
        part thereof without the necessity of contacting the plant or
        plant part with a plant development medium. In this embodiment,
        as depicted in FIGS. 16A and B, the pulsed electrical field from
        the pulse generator 16 is established by directly using the
        plant or plant part to complete the circuit between positive
        electrode 12 and its lead 10 and negative electrode 14 and its
        lead 28. For instance, if a flowering stem is to be treated by
        this method, a negative electrode 14 may be inserted using probe
        162 in a portion proximal to the cut end and a positive
        electrode 12 may be placed at a position distal to the cut end
        using probe 164. So long as the vascular systems of the plant
        are capable of completing the electrical circuit between the two
        electrodes, an electrical field may be generated without the
        need for a plant development medium. An attachment 160 may be
        finally fitted on the plant part to secure the apparatus
        thereto. </p>
      <p>Methods of particular utility are provided by the present
        invention which reduce or eliminate the need for refrigeration
        of plant parts in order to maintain freshness. While in
        preferred embodiments, both refrigeration and the methods and
        apparatus of the invention are utilized jointly to maximize the
        viable life of flowering stems, there are numerous situations as
        described above where there is little if any availability to
        refrigeration. Typically, bucket vendors and other
        non-traditional flower markets such as department stores will
        not have nor desire the additional expense of refrigeration to
        maximize cut flower viability. In those instances, the methods
        and apparatus of the present invention may be used with little
        or no refrigeration in order to attain maximum freshness for
        extended periods. Methods of promoting the development or
        maintaining the freshness of a plant part from a harvest site to
        a marketing site are also provided where the methods comprise:
        harvesting the plant part at the harvest site; contacting the
        plant part with a plant development medium capable of conducting
        electricity; creating an electrical field in the medium; and,
        transporting the plant part in the medium thus electrified to
        the marketing site. In other embodiments, where it is not
        feasible to maintain the contact of the plant part with the
        medium during transit, methods are provide which directly
        contact the electrical current source to the vascular system of
        the plant part. </p>
      <p>Apparatus 10 for creating pulsed electrical fields in plant
        development media capable of conducting electricity are also
        provided. These apparatus 10 generally comprise a first and
        second electrode 12, 14 and an electrical pulsed current
        generator 16 which is operably linked to the electrodes 12, 14.
        The apparatus 10 may take a large number of forms so long as the
        basic elements as described are included. Thus, as described
        herein, the apparatus 10 may be a compact unit suitable for use
        on small vases and pots 78. Alternatively, where it is necessary
        to treat large numbers of plants 72 or parts of plants 130
        simultaneously, the apparatus 10 may be of a more substantial
        size as necessitated by the power source, the electrode surface
        area required, or the necessity to reach multiple plants or
        plant parts with a single apparatus. </p>
      <p>The apparatus 10 of the invention are in certain embodiments
        capable of delivering a pulsed current of electricity into a
        conductive material 76. In a general embodiment the electrical
        field of the invention is one which the electrical current
        generator preferably supplies no greater than about 5 volts in
        order to avoid shocking a user. Where the current is pulsed, the
        electrical current generator 16 pulses at a range of rates of
        about 10-30 hertz and preferably 14-20 hertz. In certain
        embodiments practiced with cut flowers and potted plants, about
        20 hertz is preferred. In other embodiments practiced with cut
        Christmas trees 104, about 14 hertz is preferred. When current
        is measured in the plant development medium or in the plant part
        as generated using the apparatus, results vary according to the
        resistance afforded by each circuit. Thus, plant development
        media comprised chiefly of water, were observed to support a
        current of less than 1 amp, typically in the 30-70 milliamp
        range. When plant parts (i.e., stems) were tested, various types
        of stems supported currents of generally less than 2 milliamps,
        typically in the 0.02-2.0 milliamp range. </p>
      <p>Where a continuous electrical field is required, the apparatus
        10 of the invention are similar to that described above except
        there is no need for the electrical current generator 16 to be
        one which delivers a pulsed field. Where no plant development
        medium is used to complete the required circuit, the apparatus
        10 of the invention are applied directly to the plant 72. </p>
      <p>Regardless of the method which is selected from those described
        above to produce a plant 72 or plant part 130, the resulting
        plant 72 or part 130 thereof may be produced by the selected
        method. Such plants 72 or plant parts 130 are claimed when
        produced using the methods of the invention. Thus, where the
        methods of the invention are used at a retail level to promote
        the development of a plant or plant part or to maintain the
        freshness of a plant part 130, these products of the methods are
        claimed herein. The present invention is, therefore, not limited
        to a particular point of application during the traverse from
        harvest to ultimate consumer nor at which point the methods are
        applied. </p>
      <p>The present invention also relates to methods and apparatus for
        handling, shipping and marketing flowers and greens that have
        been cut at peak viability so that optimum freshness is
        achieved. The method begins with the handling of the flowers
        immediately following cutting and ends with preparation of the
        flowers for display and retail sale. As flowers are typically
        grown in locations that are geographically remote from their
        ultimate sale destinations, the present method addresses the
        handling of flowers to minimize the deterioration of the flowers
        during shipment and marketing. </p>
      <p>At the flower farm, the stems of the cut flowers may be placed
        in preservative solutions for a period of time. During this
        time, the methods and apparatus of the invention may be applied.
        Preferably, this and all subsequent treatment on the farm occurs
        under refrigeration. Following removal of the stems from the
        preservative, the flowers are typically bulk packed in shipping
        boxes. Alternatively, the flowers may be "precooled" for
        approximately thirty minutes before shipping. Throughout the
        processing period from the grower to the processing facilities,
        the flowers are kept refrigerated when possible. </p>
      <p>Once the flowers arrive at the processing facilities, they are
        unpacked. The stems of flowers that are not damaged are cut,
        preferably under water to prevent the formation of air bubbles
        on the end of the cut stem, and preferably with a sharp blade,
        to avoid crushing the stem end. This represents another stage at
        which the apparatus and methods of the invention may be used. </p>
      <p>Typically following recutting, the freshly cut flower stems are
        placed in a hydration solution at room temperature. An example
        of a hydration solution is made by using HydroFlor.TM.
        (Floralife, Inc. of Burr Ridge, Ill.). The stems are left in the
        hydration solution for a period of time. This represents another
        stage at which the methods and apparatus of the present
        invention may be applied. Following treatment with the hydration
        solution, the flower stems may be transferred to preservative
        solutions which again represent stages at which the apparatus
        and methods of the invention may be applied. Of course, after
        delivery to the final retailer and consumer, the methods and
        apparatus of the invention can be used as described above. </p>
      <p>Kits for promoting the development or maintaining the freshness
        of a plant 72 or a plant part 130 are also provided. These kits
        comprise apparatus for creating pulsed or continuous electrical
        fields in plant development media, sources for supplying
        electrical current to the apparatus 10, plant development media
        76 or recipes therefor and, instructions for creating the field
        in the medium using the apparatus 10. Where the methods of the
        invention are used to treat plant parts 130, kits are provided
        which may utilize a continuous source of electrical current.
        Certainly, combination kits may be achieved where the user may
        select from a continuous versus a pulsed electrical field. In
        another embodiment, kits are provided which do not require plant
        development media 76 where the purpose of the kit is to directly
        treat the plant 72 or plant part 130 without an additional
        element in the circuit. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p><b>Example I</b> </p>
      <p><b>Seedlings</b> </p>
      <p>Seeds of marigolds, tomatoes, lettuce, coleus, poppy, and
        impatiens were obtained. Each seed package was randomly divided
        into two equal groups of seeds. Twelve covered planting trays
        were then prepared using a peat moss/perlite potting mix. The
        trays were filled to a depth of one and one half inches with the
        mix and then moistened with tap water. In six of the trays,
        electrodes 12, 14 connected to a pulse generator 16 were
        inserted to a depth of one inch on opposite ends of the tray.
        The negative electrode 14 on each tray consisted of a three and
        one half inch piece of ten gauge copper wire. The positive
        electrodes 12 each consisted of a three and one half inch by one
        eighth inch tungsten rod. These were connected to the pulse
        generator 16 by twenty-two gauge insulated copper wire. </p>
      <p>One set of seeds were planted in the trays containing no
        electrodes and the corresponding seeds were planted in the trays
        containing the electrodes. The trays were moistened again to
        assure good soil to seed contact. </p>
      <p>The trays were then placed under standard cool white florescent
        lights at a distance of one foot. Lights were operated on a
        cycle of fourteen hours on and ten hours off. </p>
      <p>Each tray was covered with a clear plastic cover to retain
        moisture and increase the internal temperature. A constant day
        temperature of 76.degree. F. and a night temperature of
        71.degree. F. was maintained. The covers were removed after ten
        days and the trays were watered with a dilute 14-12-14
        fertilizer solution prepared according to manufacturer's
        directions. Additional water and fertilizer was added to all
        trays in equal volume and at the same time for the duration of
        the experiment based on the plants' requirements. </p>
      <p>In each case, the trays containing the electrodes 12, 14 were
        connected to a pulse generator 16 supplying 1.3 volt pulsed at
        the electrical voltage source at a rate of 20 hertz. This source
        voltage was applied for the duration of the experiment. The
        actual current in the trays was recorded as 450 millivolts. </p>
      <p>No differences in the rate of germination were noted between
        control seeds and the treated seeds. However, greater numbers of
        seeds germinated in the treated as compared to the control group
        of seeds. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>No noticeable difference occurred in the seedlings development
        during the first few days of growth. As the seedlings began to
        develop their secondary leaves, however, noticeable differences
        began to appear. The seedlings in the trays with the electrodes
        developed a darker green than those in the control trays. This
        differential greening intensified as the plants continued to
        develop. </p>
      <p>By the end of the second week of growth, other developmental
        differences were observed. All of the seedlings in the control
        group were noticeably shorter than the corresponding seedlings
        in the treated group receiving current. Additionally, treated
        seedlings developed thicker stems and greater leaf spans than
        the controls seedlings. These increases in height, stem
        thickness, color intensification, and leaf span continued for
        the duration of the experiment. </p>
      <p>At the end of sixty days, the experiment was terminated and
        various measurement and observations were recorded. Averages for
        plant height and leaf span were taken on all plants as well as
        general observations on stem thickness, color and root
        development. </p>

      <p>All plants responded in some manner to the application of
        current to the root zone. The poppies showed the least response.
        It is believed that the growing temperature was higher than
        optimum for their growth. All the other plants responded in a
        positive manner. </p>
      <p><b>Example II</b> </p>
      <p><b>Mature Plants</b> </p>
      <p>Six pots of African violets of the same size and variety were
        selected. Three of six pots were fitted treated with the methods
        of the present invention and with electrodes, one positive 12
        and one negative 14. The negative electrodes 14 consisted of a 2
        inch, ten gauge copper wire and the positive electrodes 12
        consisted of a two inch by 1/8 inch tungsten rod. These
        electrodes 12, 14 were positioned opposite each other in the
        pots. The treated pots containing the electrodes and the control
        pots without current were placed under cool white florescent
        lights at a distance of one foot from the light source. A 12
        hour day and ten hour night was maintained for the duration of
        the experiment. Day temperatures were maintained at 76.degree.
        F. with a night temperature of 71.degree. F. The pots were
        placed in separate water proof trays which were used to water
        the potted plants. The treated pots containing the electrodes
        12, 14 were connected to a pulse generator 16 with twenty-two
        gauge insulated copper wire 22, 28 and a current at 1.3 volts at
        the source and 20 hertz. The actual current in the pots was
        recorded at 540 millivolts. This current was maintained for the
        duration of the experiment. </p>
      <p>The plants were put on the same watering and fertilizer
        schedule. They were fed once a week with a dilute 14-12-14
        fertilizer and watered as required. All existing blooms and buds
        were removed from all plants at the beginning of the experiment.
        After ninety days the experiment was terminated and observations
        were made. </p>
      <p>Again, treated plants receiving current darkened considerably
        in relation to the control plants. The treated plants also
        produced a greater number of blooms and buds than the control
        group. </p>

      <p><b>Example III</b> </p>
      <p><b>Cut Flowers</b> </p>
      <p>In order to determine the effectiveness of the present
        invention on extending the shelf life of cut flowers, the
        following sets of experiments were conducted. </p>
      <p>Tests were conducted on roses, carnations, chrysanthemums and
        gladioli. Flowers were purchased in bunches and separated into
        random groups. Roses were purchased in bunches of twenty five
        and separated into two groups of twelve, as were carnations.
        Gladioli were purchased in bunches of twenty giving two groups
        of ten as were mums. All flowers were pretreated by removing the
        lower 2 inches of the stem with a sharp knife. These cuts were
        made at an acute angle to the stem allowing for the maximum
        exposure of the cut surface to the water. </p>
      <p>One group of flowers was then placed in a vase according to the
        methods of the invention containing the device of the invention
        and the other group was placed in an identical vase without the
        apparatus. Equal quantities of water were added to both vases.
        Water was added as needed but was never completely changed for
        the duration of the experiment. Both treated and control groups
        were placed under identical environmental conditions. </p>
      <p>Qualitative observations including the length of time that the
        flowers remained fresh, the quality of the water, and the rate
        of bloom drop or shatter (in those flowers that exhibit this
        response) were made throughout the experiment. Tests were run as
        long as the flowers were considered aesthetically attractive and
        marketable. </p>
      <p>One measure of the effectiveness of the methods and apparatus
        of the invention was in measuring the shatter effect that many
        flowers exhibit after harvest. This effect is observed when the
        flower bloom sheds its petals. It is a normal post-harvest
        response in the development process of many cut flowers. Roses
        are especially prone to this response and it is not uncommon for
        cut roses to begin to exhibit this response within the first two
        days after harvest. Large flowered mums will also exhibit this
        response although they typically hold their petals longer than
        roses. </p>
      <p><b>a. Shatter Results</b> </p>
      <p>Twenty-six tests on roses were conducted. All of the roses
        treated by the methods of the present invention suffered little
        or no bloom shatter. All the control roses on the other hand,
        exhibited normal shatter and by the end of each experiment all
        control stems lost at least a portion of their petals. Amount of
        loss varied from moderate to complete, leaving may stems with no
        petals. </p>
      <p>Twenty-six tests were also conducted on mums and similar
        results were noted. All mums treated by the methods of the
        invention exhibited very little petal loss while the controls
        showed normal loss. The loss (shatter) was not as extreme in
        mums as in roses. Most of the control flowers retained as least
        a portion of their petals. </p>
      <p><b>b. Maintaining Freshness</b> </p>
      <p>The following results were recorded concerning the total number
        of days the flowers were fresh. The following results were
        recorded on twenty sets of tests. Results are recorded as days
        of usable vase life or freshness. </p>

      </p>
      <p>All flowers treated by the methods of the invention show marked
        improvement of shelf life freshness over control flowers. </p>
      <p>Six experiments conducted are not included in the tabulated
        data above. This was a result of the failure of all the flowers
        in both groups. These general failures were attributable to the
        age of the flowers when they were purchased. This points out the
        fact that the effectiveness of the apparatus is dependent on the
        freshness of the flowers. Flowers that are harvested and keep in
        cold storage for extended periods of time suffer massive tissue
        death and do not respond to any form of preservation technique.
      </p>
      <p><b>c. Current</b> </p>
      <p>Tests were conducted to determine the current existing in plant
        development media and in plant parts (i.e., stems). Maximum
        current was determined by contacting the leads of a multimeter
        to one another utilizing three different power sources. Next, a
        plant development medium was placed in the circuit. Finally,
        three types of stems (rose, gladiolus, pine tree) were placed in
        the circuit. Multimeter readings of current through each such
        circuit were measured and reported in in amps/milliamps as shown
        in the table below: </p>

      <p><b>Water Quality</b> </p>
      <p>Water used for cut flowers should be changed a minimum of every
        48 hours, but in practice, few consumers find this to be
        convenient. As a result of not changing the water, bacteria
        quickly begin to grow therein. The result of this bacterial
        growth is the fouling of the water and the clogging of the
        vascular system of the plant. After several days, the water can
        become odorous. </p>
      <p>It was noted in the tests conducted on all cut flower varieties
        that the water in the treated cut flowers in vases containing
        the apparatus 10 of the invention remained "sweet" for the
        duration of the experiment as compared to control cut flowers.
        No water changes occurred during the experiments. While the
        water in all vases showed some discoloration, less was noted in
        the treated vases containing the apparatus. It is unknown if
        this reduction in odor-producing bacteria was a result of a
        reduction of fluids coming from the flower stems that may serve
        as a nutrient source for the bacteria, a direct effect of the
        apparatus on the growth rates of bacteria, some chemical
        reaction that suppresses the production of certain noticeable
        odors, or other phenomenon. </p>
      <p><b>Example IV</b> </p>
      <p><b>Christmas Trees</b> </p>
      <p>Scotch pine, fir, and pine trees 104 were selected for these
        tests. For each variety, two trees of similar size, shape and
        general condition were selected. Each tree was pre-treated by
        removing the lower 2 inches of the trunk of the tree. Each tree
        was then placed in a supporting stand that also served as a
        water reservoir for the tree. One of each variety of the trees
        was fitted with the apparatus 10 of the invention. The negative
        electrode 14 was placed in the water reservoir and the positive
        electrode was attached by a brass screw to a position
        approximate eight inches from the top of the tree and fixedly
        inserted into the vascular system of the trunk. Current level at
        the source was measured at 1.5 volts and the pulse rate on all
        trees was set at 20 hertz. The treated and controlled trees were
        all placed under the same environmental conditions. The tests
        were conducted for a period of sixty days. Of interest in these
        tests were the observable freshness of the trees and the rate of
        needle drop. </p>
      <p>At the end of thirty days, the control trees showed visible
        signs of dryness in the upper portions of the tree and some
        needle drop was noted. This needle drop of the control trees
        thereafter increased on a daily basis for the duration of the
        experiment. The treated trees exposed to the apparatus of the
        invention were still fresh at the end of the thirty days and had
        little needle drop. At the end of the sixty days both the
        control trees and the treated trees were dry and losing some
        needles. </p>
      <p>At the end of sixty days, all trees were removed from their
        support containers and placed on an appropriate surface and
        shaken. The needles were collected from each tree and were
        measured comparatively by volume (cubic inches). </p>
      <p>______________________________________ Scotch Pine Fir Pine
        ______________________________________ Treated 3.5 5.8 5.0
        Control 10.9 14.6 14.7 ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>The degree of freshness as compared by cubic volumes of needles
        displaced by shaking was 30-40% better in treated than in
        control trees. The trees treated by the method of the invention
        also retained their needles much longer than the control trees.
      </p>
      <p><b>Example V</b> </p>
      <p><b>Bacterial Growth</b> </p>
      <p>In order to test the effect of the current invention on the
        growth of bacteria, the following test will be preformed. Two
        liquid cultures of nutrient medium will be prepared and both
        will be inoculated with a bacterial colony. Into one solution,
        two electrodes 12, 14 of the apparatus will be introduced. The
        electrodes will be positioned in a manner to provide the maximum
        current flow through the nutrient medium 76. Both cultures will
        be maintained under suitable conditions to promote bacterial
        growth. On a daily basis samples will be removed from both
        containers and a standard bacteriological count will be
        conducted to determine if any noticeable differences are present
        in the growth rates of the two cultures. This test will be
        repeated with different species of bacteria typically found
        growing in vase water, with different current amounts and
        different pulse rates. Additionally, these tests will be
        conducted on solid agar based media. </p>
      <p>It is expected that a reduction in the growth of certain
        bacteria will be noticed when treated by the methods of the
        invention. There may also be differences in the way
        Gram-negative bacteria respond compared to the way Gram-positive
        bacteria respond to the methods of the invention. </p>
      <p><b>Example VI</b> </p>
      <p><b>Additional Testing of the Methods of the Invention on Plant
          Development and Freshness</b> </p>
      <p>Additional test will be conducted to determine the exact
        response of plants to the effects of the current invention. Some
        of these tests are discussed below. </p>
      <p><b>a. Seedling Growth</b> </p>
      <p>To determine the effects of the current invention at various
        current levels and pulse rates, a number of tests will be
        conducted. This will involve planting a number of trays of a
        given species of seed. An apparatus delivering a different
        current level and a different pulse rate will be attached to
        each tray. All trays will be treated to the same environmental
        conditions. Results will be recorded as growth rates. These
        tests will be repeated with different species of plants. </p>
      <p>It is expected that different species will respond differently
        to slight differences in current level and pulse rate. This is
        thought to be a result of the different naturally occurring
        cellular resistance noted in different species of plants. </p>
      <p><b>b. Open Field, Plot, Bed Tests</b> </p>
      <p>Tests will be conducted using multiple probes implanted in the
        soil at different positions to determine the effective range of
        the apparatus 10 on the growth of plants. This test will be
        repeated on different species and at different current and pulse
        rates. </p>
      <p>It is expected that altering the position of electrodes 12, 14
        in field application of the current invention will alter its
        effectiveness on the growth of plants. It is also expected that
        different current levels and pulse rates will affect different
        species of plants differently. </p>
      <p><b>c. Cut Flower Vase Life</b> </p>
      <p>In order to determine the effectiveness of the current
        invention on commercially used flowers, tests will be conducted
        on all major species of commercial cut flowers. These test will
        be comparative test to determining vase life of the flowers
        under normal use conditions. Tests will also be conducted using
        different current levels and pulse rates to determine if
        differences occur in the vase storage of different varieties of
        cut flowers. </p>
      <p>It is expected that different species of flowers will respond
        differently to the application of the methods of the present
        invention. It is also expected that different species will
        respond to different current levels and pulse rates. This is
        thought to be a result of the naturally occurring cellular
        resistance found in plants. </p>
      <p><b>d. Cut Flower Shipping Methods</b> </p>
      <p>Tests will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the
        current invention on the shipping of fresh cut flowers. The
        flowers to be tested will be wrapped in a moistened sheet of
        conductive material. One end of this material will be connected
        to the positive electrode of the current invention and the other
        end will be connected to the negative electrode. The test will
        measure the maintenance of the freshness of flowers under normal
        shipping conditions and the quality of flowers after shipping. </p>
      <p>It is expected that flowers treated by the methods of the
        invention will be able to tolerate lower shipping temperatures
        and will remain fresher after shipment than flowers shipped
        under conventional methods. </p>
      <p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention has been described in terms of particular
        embodiments which comprise preferred modes for the practice of
        the invention. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the
        art that, in light of the present disclosure, numerous
        modifications and changes can be made in the particular
        embodiments exemplified without departing from the intended
        scope of the invention. For example, one of skill will recognize
        that the ability to promote the development and maintain the
        freshness of plant or plant parts will be useful in handling
        other forms of plant tissue as well. Certain fungi with vascular
        systems which transport nutrients and fluid throughout the
        fungus may be amenable to the apparatus, and methods of the
        invention. In another example, stems containing fruits could be
        treated with such electrodes in solutions with beneficial
        results. Unripe fruits could be stored and shipped with
        electrodes in solutions and then exposed to ethylene gas at a
        desired time, which gas would then ripen the fruit. All such
        modifications are intended to be included within the scope of
        the appended claims. </p>

      <p><b>&nbsp;Description</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a new and improved integument
        and method for micropropagation, tissue culturing and the
        culturing of other organic material. More particularly, the
        invention relates to a new and improved integument and method
        for enhancing the growth and reproduction of plant and animal
        cells and tissue, bacteria and other microorganisms, and for
        preventing contamination from occurring in the cultures. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Micropropagation is the process of growing new generation
        plants from a single tissue sample that has been excised from a
        carefully selected parent plant or cultivar. This process
        permits the mass reproduction of plants having certain desirable
        traits since substantially all of the new generation plants
        produced are genetically identical to and have all the desirable
        traits of the parent. </p>
      <p>Tissue culturing is the process of growing cells in vitro and
        is used to grow both plant and animal cells. Tissue culturing
        techniques are commonly used in the early stages of the plant
        micropropagation process where it is desirable to rapidly
        produce plant cells. Improvements in tissue culturing techniques
        also have applications beyond the micropropagation of plants.
        Essentially the same culturing process is used to culture animal
        and even human tissue, such tissue being used in the fields of
        animal agriculture and human and veterinary medicine. Culturing
        of organic material other than plant and animal cells and
        tissue, such as bacteria, viruses and algeas, is also performed
        in vitro for both research and commercial purposes. Improvements
        in the procedures and apparatus used to reproduce and maintain
        these organisms would be beneficial, for example, to researchers
        and industry who require a large or steady supply of such
        material. </p>
      <p>There are problems associated with the prior art culturing
        apparatus and processes One of the primary problems is
        contamination. Any of a wide variety of microorganisms,
        including viruses, bacteria, fungus, molds, yeast and single
        cell algae, can ruin the cultures during any of the various
        stages. The smallest of these biological contaminants are the
        viruses, the largest are the single cell algae. A virus
        typically ranges in size from 0.1 to 0.45 micrometers although
        it is suspected that portions of the virus which are as small as
        0.01 micrometers may separate from the virus and alone cause
        contamination. Bacteria typically range in size from 5 to 100
        micrometers, while fungi and molds are usually larger than 100
        micrometers. Yeast is larger than bacteria, with single cell
        algae, the largest of these biological contaminants, being
        larger than yeast. </p>
      <p>The prior art sterilized glass or plastic culture containers
        such as test tubes, flasks or bottles, utilized in conventional
        culturing technology have serious drawbacks. For example, since
        plants require both carbon dioxide and oxygen to live and grow,
        these containers must provide a means for gas exchange. The
        walls of these traditional glass and plastic containers,
        however, do not permit the required gaseous interchange. Thus,
        rubber stoppers having cotton packing or some similar filter
        material, loosely fitting caps, or baffled plastic caps have
        been employed to allow an adequate exchange of gas between the
        tissue or plant and the ambient atmosphere and environment.
        However, such devices restrict the amount and rate of gas which
        can be exchanged. Further, such caps and stoppers do not totally
        protect the plant from contamination by microorganisms such as
        viruses, bacteria and fungi. Thus, it has been of paramount
        importance that the tissue culture room and laboratory be kept
        extremely clean and their atmospheres filtered. Further, precise
        temperature, humidity, and light conditions must be maintained
        in the culture room. Gas exchange is also required for culturing
        animal cells and for certain other microorganisms. Traditional
        flasks, petrie dishes and the like, while allowing for a certain
        degree of gas exchange, also allow contamination to occur. </p>
      <p>The original cost of the traditional glass or plastic culture
        containers; the labor and equipment cost to maintain the
        sterility of the containers; and the added cost of the
        facilities, equipment, and related conditions required to
        maintain a sterile growing environment, all represent major cost
        factors associated with the use of such containers in
        conventional culturing processes. </p>
      <p>The present invention overcomes many of the deficiencies of the
        prior art techniques of culturing by having the following
        advantages: </p>
      <p>(1) enhanced protection from contamination; </p>
      <p>(2) increased growth rates; </p>
      <p>(3) no requirement for a sterile culture room; </p>
      <p>(4) no requirement for expensive glass containers or the
        incurrence of replacement costs due to breakage; </p>
      <p>(5) no labor cost associated with cleaning and sterilizing
        containers for reuse; </p>
      <p>(6) an increase in the number of plantlets from a culture; </p>
      <p>(7) a reduction by approximately one-half the amount of media
        required in each plant culture; </p>
      <p>(8) the elimination of the requirement of strict humidity
        control in the culture room; </p>
      <p>(9) an increase in the number of cultures which can be produced
        in the same size culture room; </p>
      <p>(10) a reduction in the size of the media preparation area and
        in the size of the autoclave; and </p>
      <p>(11) an increase in the number of new cultures which can be
        established by a laboratory technician. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention includes a new integument and related
        process for micropropagation, tissue culturing and for the
        culturing of other organic material. The integument is made of a
        semipermeable and translucent membrane which allows light
        transmission and gas exchange but seals out the biological
        contaminants in the ambient environment. The membrane forms a
        plurality of cellules which contain the organic samples and
        media. The cellules are sealed so as to completely enclose and
        seal off the cultures from the ambient environment. The most
        preferred membrane is a high density polyethylene material. </p>
      <p>One of the principal advantages of the present invention is
        that biological contaminants in the ambient atmosphere cannot
        penetrate the membrane of the integument and thereby contaminate
        the culture. Yet, the semipermeable membrane ensures enhanced
        gas exchange, gas exchange being necessary for plant and animal
        cells and many microorganisms to live and reproduce. Because the
        integuments are contaminant impermeable, organic material
        contained therein need not be cultured in a sterile environment,
        and the costs and problems associated therewith are eliminated.
        Similarly, because the integument will not allow bacteria,
        viruses, and other microorganisms from the ambient environment
        to penetrate the membrane, the integument may also be used to
        culture a specific microorganism. The integument prevents the
        microorganisms grown or maintained therein from escaping the
        integument and possibly infecting laboratory personnel and, at
        the same time, prevents microorganisms in the ambient
        environment from contaminating the culture of the desired
        microorganisms contained in the integument. </p>
      <p>The integument of the present invention is also liquid
        impermeable so that the media, typically a liquid or semisolid
        which sustains the tissue, organism, or plant's growth while in
        the integument, cannot escape and dry out. Thus, using the
        present invention, it is also unnecessary to maintain a precise
        humidity level in the culture room which would again require
        special and costly equipment. </p>
      <p>A completely unexpected benefit of using the semipermeable
        integument is that tissue and plantlet growth rates are
        dramatically increased. This increase is believed to occur
        because oxygen and carbon dioxide, which are needed for plant
        respiration and photosynthesis and for sustaining certain
        bacteria, are available in greater quantities than when the
        process is carried out in prior art glass and plastic containers
        where the loose fitting lids, rubber stoppers, caps and filters,
        which are required to prevent the entrance of contaminants,
        impede gas exchange. </p>
      <p>A preferred embodiment of this integument is formed from heat
        sealed high density polyethylene. This material has been found
        impermeable to contaminants and, because it is completely sealed
        once the organic sample is in place, the entire outer surface
        can be thoroughly decontaminated by emersion prior to opening
        the integument which exposes the culture to possible
        contamination. There are virtually no areas on the integument
        where contaminants can accumulate and avoid decontamination. </p>
      <p>With the preferred embodiment of the invention, the costs of
        micropropagation and culturing are greatly reduced since the
        cost of the integument of the present invention is much less
        than the cost of prior art containers. The preferred integuments
        are, unlike glass test tubes, essentially unbreakable. Their low
        cost makes them completely disposable, eliminating the costs
        associated with washing and the often-less-than sterile product
        which results. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of the invention has other applications other
        than the culturing of tissue and microorganisms. For example,
        improvements in growth rates were observed when the integuments
        were used in growing plants from seeds. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, there is shown the
        integument 10 of the present invention for containing and
        culturing organic material, such as, plant and animal tissue and
        cells and microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungus,
        molds and single cell algae. Integument 10 comprises membrane 12
        which, in the preferred embodiment, encloses plant tissue from a
        parent plant or cultivar during the first three stages of
        micropropagation. However, it should be understood that the
        integument of the present invention may be used for culturing
        any type of organic material. When sealed, membrane 12
        completely and entirely surrounds and encloses the culture from
        the ambient environment. </p>
      <p>The integument 10 is made by folding membrane 12 over at 14
        such that two sides 16, 18 are formed. Sides 16, 18 are heat
        sealed at 24, 26 along the entire length thereof and adjacent to
        longitudinal edges 20, 22 of membrane 12 so as to form an
        envelope. The envelope shaped integument 10 includes a cellule
        30 forming an expandable chamber for containing the plant tissue
        and growth medium. The cellule 30 has an approximate average
        volume of 50 ml for most varieties of plants. As can be
        appreciated, the size and volume of the chamber of cellule 30
        can be varied to host the particular tissue or plantlet
        contained therein. Thus, cellule 30 may be of various sizes. The
        cellule 30 has at least initially, an open end 28 formed by the
        terminal edges 32, 34 of membrane 12. End 28 serves as a port of
        entry of cellule 30 for receiving the plant tissue and media. As
        can also be appreciated, rather than being made of a single
        folded membrane 12, integument 10 may be made of two individual
        and separate pieces of material such as a base material and a
        frontal material. In this embodiment, the bottom of cellule 30
        is formed by heat sealing the frontal material to the base
        material near the lower terminal edges thereof as distinguished
        from the fold at 14 where a single piece of material is used as
        described with respect to FIGS. 1-3. Composite integuments may
        be formed to take advantage of the strength of one material and
        the permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide of the other, as
        an example. </p>
      <p>The membrane 12 is a polyethylene material which is pliable and
        collapsible such that it can be stored and shipped in rolls.
        Further, the polyethylene is so inexpensive as to be disposable
        upon completion of any particular stage of the micropropagation
        process. Preferably, the membrane 12 is made of high density
        polyethylene. Such polyethylene typically has a density of from
        0.94 to 0.96 gm/cc density polyethylene. The material for
        membrane 12 should withstand sterilization in an autoclave which
        may reach temperatures of 250.degree. F. at 15 p.s.i., for
        example. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 4 to 6, the integument 10 is shown in
        each of the first three stages of micropropagation. As is shown,
        after the plant tissue and media have been received by cellule
        30, the port of entry at open end 28 is heat sealed at 36 along
        the entire length thereof and adjacent to the terminal edges 32,
        34 of membrane 12 to close and seal cellule 30 containing the
        plant tissue and media therein. At this time the plant tissue is
        completely and entirely encapsulated from the ambient
        environment and sealed from biological contaminants in the
        ambient environment. FIGS. 4 to 6 schematically illustrate the
        integuments 10A, B and C investing the plant tissue and media in
        each of the first three stages of micropropagation. FIG. 4
        depicts the meristematic tissue 38 from a parent plant or
        cultivar invested within integument 10A together with suitable
        media 40 such as Murashige Minimal Organic Medium manufactured
        by Carolina Biological Supply Company. FIG. 5 illustrates the
        use of another integument 10B during the second stage of tissue
        culturing. The initial tissue culture 42 from Stage 1, or a
        portion of such tissue, is transferred to cellule 30B containing
        a suitable Stage 2 medium 44 such as Murashige Shoot
        Multiplication Mediums A, B and C manufactured by Carolina
        Biological Supply Company. FIG. 6 shows an individual plantlet
        46 grown in Stage 2 enclosed by another integument 10C and
        placed in a medium 48 such as Murashige Pretransplant Medium
        manufactured by Carolina Biological Supply Company to stimulate
        cell differentiation and the growth of individual plantlets such
        as 46, each plantlet 46 developing roots 47 and foliage 49. </p>
      <p>Although the integument 10 has been shown and described as
        providing a single cellule 30 for enveloping an individual
        culture, it is preferred that the integument form a plurality of
        cellules. Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown an integument
        pack 50. Integument pack 50 is made of membrane 12 and is formed
        similarly to integument 10 of FIG. 1. For most culture
        investments, the integument pack 50 has dimensions of
        approximately 12 inches wide and 6 inches high. Integument pack
        50 is formed by folding membrane 12 over at 52 so as to form
        sides 54, 56. As distinguished from integument 10, sides 54, 56
        are heat sealed along the entire longitudinal length thereof at
        58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68 and 70 to form six individual cellules
        72. Individual tissue samples 74 and media 76 are shown invested
        in each of the cellules 72. The plant tissue and media may be
        for any of the first three stages of micropropagation as
        represented in FIGS. 4 to 6. The ports of entry at the upper end
        78 have been heat sealed at 80 along the entire length of
        integument pack 50 to close cellules 72 after the tissue 74 and
        media 76 are inserted into the cellules 72. An upper flap or
        band 82 may be formed at the upper ends 78 of membrane 12 for
        the purpose of suspending integument pack 50 in the vertical
        position. Suitable connection means such as apertures 84, 86 may
        be provided through band 80 for attachment means such as drapery
        hooks or S-hooks to suspend integument pack 50 vertically.
        Suspending the growing tissue and plants vertically at different
        elevations markedly reduces the amount of space required in the
        growing areas. The suspension of cultures above others is
        allowed because of the translucency of integument packs 50.
        Further, the vertical suspension of integument packs 50 at
        different elevations will also enhance air movement within the
        growing area. Many conventional growing area layouts concentrate
        the tissue cultures or plants at a given elevation within the
        growing area, such as on countertops or working surfaces, such
        that there is a limited movement of air between the plants.
        Thus, by increasing light transmission and the availability of
        air for gas exchange by suspending integument packs 50, growth
        of the tissue and plants is enhanced and the growing area
        requirements are reduced. </p>
      <p>The cellule, and thus the integument, is sized in accordance
        with the culture to be grown. Referring now to FIGS. 8 to 13,
        there is shown another embodiment of the integument shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 7 that is adapted and sized for the micropropagation
        of lettuce, spinach or other leafy vegetables. The integument 90
        for enclosing the tissue for a leafy vegetable is made of a
        membrane 92, membrane 92 being like that of membrane 12 for
        integument 10 or integument pack 50 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 7
        respectively. </p>
      <p>Integument 90 is made by membrane 92 being extruded in tubular
        form having a circumference of approximately 24 inches. The
        tubular membrane 92 is folded into quarter panels 94, 95, 96, 97
        and one eighth panels 98, 100 and 102, 104, best shown in FIGS.
        8, 11 and 13. One eighth panels 98, 100 and 102, 104 are formed
        by folding quarter panels 95 and 97 at 106 and 108,
        respectively. Quarter panels 94, 95, 96 and 97 were formed by
        folding tubular membrane 92 into quarter lengths, at folds 110,
        112, 114, 116. Folds 106, 108 are directed inwardly as shown in
        FIG. 13 and one end 118 of tubular membrane 92 is heat sealed at
        120 in the folded position as shown in FIG. 12 to produce a
        cellule 122 to house the leafy vegetable tissue and media. The
        cellule 122 has a volume of approximately 1000 ml which can be
        varied according to the particular leafy vegetable plant tissue
        grown therein. The other end 124 of tubular membrane 92 is
        initially left open as a port of entry 126 to receive the leafy
        vegetable tissue and media. </p>
      <p>Cellule 122 preferably includes a foliage chamber 130 and a
        root chamber 132 with an open neck 134 therebetween, best shown
        in FIG. 10. Chambers 130, 132 and neck 134 are formed by heat
        sealing portions of one eighth panels 100 and 104 to quarter
        panel 96 at 136 and 138 and by heat sealing portions of one
        eighth panels 98 and 102 to quarter panel 94 at 140 and 142.
        Additionally, upon expanding integument 90, heat seals 136, 138
        and 140, 142 create creases at 106, 108 and 146 shown in FIGS. 8
        and 9 to form root chamber 132. </p>
      <p>The foliage chamber 130 and root chamber 132 of cellule 122
        permit a separation of the foliage from the root system during
        growth and more particularly to separate the foliage from the
        media. A plantlet is positioned within cellule 122 such that the
        foliage grows within foliage chamber 130 and the root system
        extends from the foliage chamber 130 down through neck 134 and
        into the root chamber 132 where the media is disposed. Given a
        cellule 122 with a volume of approximately 1000 ml, the root
        chamber 132 is sized to contain approximately 50 ml of media. By
        maintaining the integument 92 in the vertical position, all
        media will flow downward into root chamber 132. This downward
        flow is facilitated by the angular heat sealing at 136 and 138.
        Thus, the media is thereby kept separate from the foliage. This
        permits the foliage to be kept clean of media and to permit the
        leafy vegetable to grow in a preferred and desirable symmetric
        shape. Without the division of cellule 122 into a foliage and a
        root chamber, the leafy vegetable would grow in a haphazard form
        losing its symmetry. Further, with the reduced neck portion 134
        separating cellule 122 into a root chamber 132 and foliage
        chamber 130, the media is retained in the root chamber 132 and
        its flow into the foliage chamber 130 is prevented or retarded
        when the integument 90 is tipped or inverted since the media
        will tend to flow into the upper angular portions 139 of root
        chamber 132 instead of flowing through neck position 132.
        Additionally, the reduced neck portion 134 tends to secure a
        mature plant in position within cellule 122 since the plant's
        roots will grow into a mass having a size larger than the cross
        sectional area of neck portion 134. This growth of root mass
        also acts to impede the flow of media into the foliage chamber
        130. </p>
      <p>The material for membrane 12 of integuments 10, 50 and for
        membrane 92 of integument 90 is critical to providing the
        desired environment for the tissue and plantlet during the first
        three stages of micropropagation and in particular enhancing
        growth by permitting optimum gas exchange and light
        transmission. Gas exchange, for example, is needed for the
        necessary biochemical actions required for culture growth.
        Understanding the role of the gases and gas exchange requires an
        explanation of the utilization of each gas individually. </p>
      <p>Two functions of green plant growth are photosynthesis and
        respiration. Photosynthesis is the biochemical process where
        green plants convert carbon dioxide and water into complex
        carbohydrates in the presence of light of a given wave length
        and intensity for a given period of time. The process is
        affected by a number of environmental factors including quality
        of light, availability of water, availability of carbon dioxide,
        temperature, leaf age and chlorophyll content of the tissue.
        Photosynthesis is also referred to as a carbon dioxide fixation.
        The exact chemistry of the process is complex but in essence,
        chlorophyll in the presence of carbon dioxide, water and light
        converts the carbon dioxide and water into complex carbohydrates
        that are in turn converted into sugars and utilized by the plant
        as a food source. </p>
      <p>One of the by-products of this process is the production of
        free oxygen. Fixation of carbon dioxide by plants accounts for a
        large portion of their carbon content and subsequent weight
        increase during growth. The exact uptake of carbon dioxide by
        plants varies from species to species. However, a range between
        eight and eighty milligrams of carbon dioxide per hour for 100
        cubic centimeters of tissue surface can be used as an
        approximation of the carbon dioxide intake for most plants
        exposed to good environmental conditions. This intake can be
        directly related to the dry weight of plant tissue. At an uptake
        rate of 25 milligrams of carbon dioxide per hour for 100 cubic
        centimeters of tissue surface, an increase of 5% of the original
        weight of the tissue can be realized in a one hour period. From
        this overview of photosynthesis and carbon dioxide fixation, it
        is clear that among the critical factors affecting plant growth
        is the availability of carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>The other function relating to the gases of interest is
        respiration. This process is essentially an oxidation reduction
        reaction where oxygen serves as the oxidizer to the
        carbohydrates and sugars formed during the process of
        photosynthesis. Again, the exact chemistry involved is very
        complicated. However, the end result is a release of chemical
        energy necessary for continued growth of the plant. As in
        photosynthesis, or carbon dioxide fixation, a number of
        environmental factors affect the uptake of oxygen for the
        respiratory process. These include temperature, light, tissue
        starvation, availability of oxygen and tissue age. While
        respiration is believed to take place at all times in plant
        tissue, there is a noted increase in this activity in the
        absence of light. This is believed to be a result of the
        decreased creb cycle activity in the absence of light. </p>
      <p>Oxygen uptake for use in respiration varies from species to
        species and while no generally accepted range has been
        established for plants in ideal environmental conditions, uptake
        of up to 350 microliters to 1,480 microliters per gram of fresh
        tissue has been recorded. There has been no direct correlation
        of fresh weight to oxygen uptake. There is also a difference in
        oxygen uptake from tissue to tissue within a given plant. Woody
        tissue and starch storage organs have the lowest uptake, while
        root tips and other regions containing meristematic cells have
        the highest uptake rate. This can be directly related to the
        activity of growth in a given area of the plant where the most
        active areas require the greatest energy production and consume
        the greatest amount of oxygen. From this, it is clearly defined
        that the presence of available carbon dioxide and oxygen is
        essential to the continued growth of green plant tissue. </p>
      <p>In prior art micropropagation procedures, the exchange of
        oxygen and carbon dioxide between the plant tissue disposed
        within a glass or plastic container for protection from
        contamination has been severely limited in that the gas exchange
        must take place through the cotton packing disposed in the bore
        of the rubber stopper, between the loose fit of the top and the
        container and a plastic lid or top, or through the slits in the
        baffled plastic top. This curtailment of gas exchange has
        limited the growth of the plant tissue. The material of
        membranes 12, 92 provides a marked enhancement of permitted gas
        exchange as compared to the prior art glass or plastic
        containers. </p>
      <p>The membranes 12, 92 are made of a translucent and
        semipermeable material. The preferred material for membrane 12,
        92 is a high density polyethylene, material no. HiD-9650,
        manufactured by the Chevron Chemical Company of Orange, Tex.
        Preferably, the material for membrane 12, 92 should be from 1.0
        to 2.0 mils thick, and it is preferred that the material of
        membrane 12, 92 have a thickness of 1.25 mils. If the membrane
        material is much thinner than 1.0 mil, handling the integument
        packs 50, and especially opening cellules 72, is made more
        difficult, as the opposing surfaces of the material of membranes
        12, 92 tend to adhere to each other when formed in such thin
        films. </p>
      <p>Other materials which have the desired light translucency, gas
        permeability and contaminant impermeability are also available
        for membranes 12, 92. For example, certain translucent low
        density polyethylene is suitable and even allows greater gas
        permeability than the preferred high density polyethylene;
        however, such low density polyethylene cannot withstand the high
        temperatures of the autoclave (250.degree. at 15 p.s.i. for
        example) and the material melts or is otherwise deformed in the
        process. Accordingly, if such materials are used for membranes
        12, 92, they and must be sterilized through other means. </p>
      <p>Other polymeric materials may be used which have greater
        permeability than the preferred high density polyethylene;
        however, if the permeability is too great, the media drys out as
        the water in the media solution vaporizes and passes through
        membrane 12, 92 and out of the integument. Thus, the moisture
        vapor transmission rate (MVTR) is an important factor in the
        selection of materials for membranes 12, 92. It is preferred
        that membranes 12, 92 have a MVTR of from 0.2 to 0.684 gm/100
        sq. in./24 hrs @ 1 atm. The preferred material, Chevron
        HiD-9650, in the preferred thickness of 1.25 mils, has a MVTR of
        0.3 gm/100 sq. in./24 hours @ 1 atm. Membranes 12, 92 of other
        materials, thicknesses, and permeabilities can be used depending
        upon the length of time the plant material is to be grown in
        that integument. For example, the longer the growing period
        required for the particular plant material, the lower the MVTR
        of the material should be so as to prevent the media from drying
        out to a degree that it will not be conducive to growth. </p>
      <p>The high density polyethylene at a thickness of 1.25 mils forms
        a molecular structure during the extrusion process which is
        especially useful as a membrane for integuments. The high
        density polyethylene is made from linear crystalline polymers of
        suitable molecular weight with high tensile strength and
        extension modulus, a high degree of symmetry, strong
        intermolecular forces and a controlled degree of cross-linking
        between layers. The cross-links between adjacent layers of
        polymers are introduced to prevent the polymeric chains from
        slipping under applied stress. The lightly cross-linked adjacent
        uniform layers of polymers of the high density polyethylene for
        membranes 12, 92 form interstices therebetween which allow the
        preferred diffusion and osmosis therethrough for the desirable
        gas exchange and light transmission between the ambient
        environment and the plant tissue. These interstices are smaller
        than 0.01 micrometers so as to preclude the passage therethrough
        of even the smallest microorganisms, such as viruses. It also
        provides rigidity to facilitate the transfer and handling of the
        cultures. Upon sealing off the cellule, the culture is
        completely enveloped and enclosed from the ambient atmosphere
        and environment, as distinguished from prior art containers, so
        as to prevent any introduction of contaminants. </p>
      <p>The necessary gas exchange between the culture and the
        atmosphere of the ambient environment due to the production of
        the by-product oxygen by the plant during photosynthesis and the
        oxygen uptake of the plant during respiration takes place by
        osmosis. The gases diffuse or propagate through the
        semipermeable membrane 12, 92, which separates the miscible
        gases in the ambient atmosphere and within the cellule, in
        moving to equalize their concentrations. The osmotic pressure or
        unbalanced pressure between the ambient atmosphere and cellule
        gives rise to the diffusion and osmosis causing an interaction
        or interchange of gases by mutual gas penetration through the
        separating semipermeable membrane 12, 92. Thus, the inventive
        membrane of the integument permits the tissue to breathe by
        osmosis and air to diffuse through the semipermeable membrane
        and yet prevent the passage of biological contaminants. </p>
      <p>The gas permeability of the material of membrane 12, 92 is thus
        also important. For practicing the invention described herein,
        it is preferred that the membrane material have a permeability
        to CO.sub.2 of from 200 to 1190 cc/100 sq. in./24 hours at 1
        atm. and a permeability to O.sub.2 of from 100 to 424 cc/100 sq.
        in./24 hours at 1 atm. Chevron HiD-9650, the preferred material
        for membrane 12, 92, in the preferred 1.25 mil thickness has a
        permeability to CO.sub.2 of approximately 450 cc/100 sq. in./24
        hours at 1 atm. and a permeability to O.sub.2 of approximately
        190 cc/100 sq. in./24 hrs. at 1 atm. </p>
      <p>The material of membranes 12, 92 is translucent and allows the
        passage and diffusion therethrough of light rays having at least
        the wavelengths of 400 to 750 nanometers. Individual wavelengths
        of light in the range of 400 to 750 nanometers are required by
        individual photosynthetic agents, such as the chlorophylls, in
        green tissue plants to provide the reactions necessary for life
        and growth. The reduced thickness of the material for membranes
        12, 92 and the uniformity of molecular structure formed in part
        by the extrusion process for the material for membranes 12, 92
        permits greater light transmission to the tissue sample enclosed
        by the integuments than has previously been allowed by the glass
        and plastic of prior art containers. The approximate 1.25 mil
        thickness of the material for membrane 12, 92 as compared to the
        much thicker prior art glass or plastic containers,
        substantially enhances the amount of light and the various
        individual wavelengths of light which are received by the tissue
        culture. It is important that each wavelength of light necessary
        for each photosynthetic agent to react pass through the
        integument. The uniformity and light cross-linking of the
        molecular structure of the material for membranes 12, 92
        provides a pathway of lesser resistance for light. The molecular
        structure of glass and plastic of the prior art containers is
        more complicated and thus creates a more complex pathway through
        the glass or plastic through which the light must pass to
        ultimately reach the plant tissue. Thus the thicker and more
        complex molecular structure of the prior art glass and plastic
        containers inhibits light passage and may filter out certain
        wavelengths of light necessary for the photosynthetic agents of
        green tissue plants. </p>
      <p>As stated, the preferred material for membranes 12, 92 is a
        high density polyethylene manufactured by the Chevron Chemical
        Company of Orange, Tex., Material No. HiD-9650. Published
        specifications for this polyethylene discloses it has a Melt
        Index of 0.3 (gms/10 min), Density of 0.950 (gms/cc); Dart
        Impact of 90 (gms/mil at 26"); Tensile strength at break of 7400
        (psi); Elongation of 460%; Elmendorf Tear MD/TD of 16/400
        (gms/mil); and a Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) of 0.35
        (gms/100 sq. in./24 hr./mil). </p>
      <p>Tests conducted at Applicant's direction demonstrate the
        transmission rates of water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide for
        various thicknesses of the preferred high density polyethylene
        (Chevron HiD-9650); another high density polyethylene
        (Chevron-9506); and a low density polyethylene (Chevron-PE5754).
        The results of these tests are included in FIGS. 14, 15, and 16.
        The results are also shown in tabular form in Table IV. As can
        be seen, the thinner the membrane, the greater its transmission
        rates for these gases. In addition, it can be seen that for the
        three membrane materials tested, the low density material
        (Chevron PE-5754) has the highest transmission rate for each of
        these gases. Although gas exchange is important to the growth of
        plants within integument 10, Applicant's preferred membrane made
        from Chevron's HiD-9650, has a lower transmission rate than the
        other materials tested as shown in FIGS. 14-16. As noted above,
        if the gas transmission rates are too great, the media in the
        integument 10 will dry out too quickly and the plant material
        will desiclate and die, possibly before it can complete a stage
        of development in the micropropagation process. </p>
      <p>Table III illustrates plant growth rates where various
        thicknesses and types of materials were used as membranes 12,
        92. As shown in Table III, growth rates were recorded when
        membranes of high density polyethylene (Chevron HiD-9650,
        Chevron-9506, Dupont-550) and low density polyethylene
        (Chevron-PE-5754) were used in an integument pack 50. To conduct
        this test, fifty integument packs 50 were obtained in each mil
        thickness shown in Table III for each of the four membrane
        materials (excluding 1.0 mil and 1.75 mil thicknesses of
        Chevron-PE-5754 which were not available). Under a laminar flow
        hood, equal amounts of media were placed in the cellules of each
        sterilized integument pack 50. Each cellule was then invested
        with a sample of plant tissue and the integument pack 50 was
        then sealed to prevent the introduction of contaminants.
        Integument packs 50 were then placed in the culture area of the
        laboratory. At thirty day intervals, each integument pack 50 was
        weighed, and an average weight of an integument was calculated
        for each of the fifty samples of the same membrane material and
        the same mil thickness. This data was recorded and is reproduced
        in Table III. After one hundred eighty days of the experiment,
        the thirty day average weight was subtracted from the last
        recorded weight and the difference was recorded in Table III
        below the one hundred eighty day weight. As can be seen, the
        preferred membrane 12, 92 of Chevron high density polyethylene
        HiD-9650 enabled plant material to grow at greater rates and for
        longer periods of time than the other materials tested. </p>
      <p>The new and improved integument of the present invention
        permits the utilization of a new and improved process for
        micropropagation. This process includes four stages as
        hereinafter described. </p>

      <p><b>STAGE 1</b> </p>
      <p><b>Initial Tissue Culturing</b> </p>
      <p>The cultivars or parent plants to be micropropagated are
        maintained under carefully controlled greenhouse conditions in
        an attempt to yield plant tissue which minimizes the growth of
        microorganisms and particularly any biological contaminants.
        After selection of the optimal parent, an area of the plant with
        meristematic (undifferentiated) tissue is identified, and a bulk
        sample, which includes the meristematic tissue, is removed from
        the parent plant. This area is usually where active growth takes
        place, such as at the tips of stems or at lateral buds (between
        the leaf apex and the connection to the stem). </p>
      <p>To prevent contamination of the culture by biological
        contaminants, the meristematic tissue is excised from the bulk
        sample and transferred to the growing medium under a laminar
        flow hood which removes airborne contaminants. Prior to the
        placement of the meristematic tissue sample into cellules 72 of
        integument pack 50, five ml of a suitable media (as
        distinguished from 10 ml in the prior art tissue culturing
        process) such as Murashige Minimal Organic Medium manufactured
        by Carolina Biological Supply Company is inserted into cellules
        72. This medium is an agar-based substance containing all the
        required nutrients for tissue growth. Integument pack 50,
        containing the media therein, is then rolled and sterilized in
        an autoclave. This procedure tends to close the open upper side
        78 of cellules 72. See FIG. 7. Later, under the laminar flow
        hood, the integument packs 50 are unrolled and its cellules 72
        opened one at a time prior to tissue placement. A meristematic
        tissue sample, typically a 0.2 to 1.0 mm cube, is then placed
        into an individual cellule 72 of integument pack 50, a single
        cellule being shown in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>After tissue placement, the ports of entry into cellules 72
        again tend to immediately close, reducing the length of time
        that the samples are exposed to the environment and that
        contaminants can enter. Thereafter, the upper ends 78 of
        cellules 72 are heat sealed at 80, thereby forming a complete
        investment and envelope around the plant tissue. In this state,
        the plant tissue is completely impermeable to contaminants as
        distinguished from the prior art containers. </p>
      <p>The integument packs 50 are then exposed to approximately
        300-500 foot-candles of light during this first stage. </p>
      <p>Using the present inventive process, precise temperature and
        humidity conditions need not be maintained in the culture room.
        In the prior art process, as temperature changes occurred,
        atmosphere would be drawn into and expelled around the tops of
        the glass containers containing the tissue cultures, thereby
        increasing the risk of contaminations from airborne contaminants
        which had not been removed by the prior art air filtration
        system. Further, the 80% humidity level was typically maintained
        in the prior art in order to prevent the media from drying out
        through evaporation. Such is not critical in the inventive
        process. Furthermore, and importantly, the inventive process, as
        distinguished from the prior art process, can be carried out in
        an environment which does not require a sterile, filtered
        air-flow since each cellule 72 of the integument pack 50 is
        contaminant impermeable. </p>
      <p>Once the tissue culture has been established, and it is growing
        in the initial culture and has been certified contaminant-free,
        it is ready for Stage 2. </p>
      <p><b>STAGE 2</b> </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Culture Multiplication</b> </p>
      <p>During Stage 2, the initial tissue culture resulting from Stage
        1 is multiplied. Under the laminar flow hood, the cellules 72 of
        the integument packs 50 of Stage 1 are opened with a sharp
        sterilized knife and the tissue samples, or portions thereof,
        are transferred to a second set of unused integument packs 50,
        an individual integument pack being shown in FIG. 7.
        Multiplication of the tissue culture occurs by using a different
        media. The media used for Stage 2 cultures differs from that
        used in Stage 1 culturing and includes hormones to induce rapid
        growth and multiplication of the tissue. Suitable Stage 2 media
        include Murashige Shoot Multiplication Mediums A, B, and C,
        available from the Carolina Biological Supply Company. Again,
        only 5 ml of media are required as compared to the 10 ml in the
        conventional prior art process. The integument packs 50 of Stage
        2 are then heat sealed and suitably disposed on a rack within a
        culture room. About 300 to 500 foot-candles of light are
        provided. During this period, Stage 2 growth yields primarily
        non-differentiated tissue growth. The cells in each tissue
        sample multiply rapidly during Stage 2 to form a cluster of
        primarily undifferentiated tissue cells, the size of which
        depends upon the plant variety. The desired cell multiplication
        takes approximately 20 to 45 days, again depending upon the
        plant variety. </p>
      <p>After each Stage 2 cycle, the integument packs containing the
        cultures are immersed in a solution of sodium hypochloride,
        rinsed, returned to the laminar flow hood, opened, and the
        tissue is removed. The tissue is then subdivided by cutting into
        a number of small pieces, each of which will then be cultured.
        Each time the tissue samples are divided, the individual smaller
        tissue samples are inserted into cellules 72 of unused
        integument packs 50. All of these steps are performed in the
        laboratory under a laminar flow hood. </p>
      <p>Each culture is grown and divided in a 20 to 45 day cycle until
        a sufficient number of tissue samples have been produced to meet
        production goals. As an example, if each tissue culture emerging
        from Stage 1 produces a cluster of tissue which in turn yields
        five tissue samples capable of culturing, over 15,000 cultures
        will have been produced at the end of seven months of Stage 2
        multiplication. With the exception of a few naturally occurring
        mutations or "sports," each of these resulting cultures of Stage
        2 can then be grown into an individual plant which will be
        genetically identical to the parent plant. Thus, when the
        desired number of cultures have been produced in Stage 2, the
        tissue cultures then are ready for Stage 3 production. </p>
      <p><b>STAGE 3</b> </p>
      <p><b>Differentiation and Plant Formation</b> </p>
      <p>During Stage 3, the cellules 72 of the integument packs 50 of
        Stage 2 are opened and tissue samples therein are divided and
        transferred to a third set of unused integument packs 50 as
        shown in FIG. 7. Although a single plant tissue growing into a
        plantlet is shown disposed within each individual cellule 72 in
        FIG. 7, during Stage 3, a plurality of plant tissues may be
        disposed within an individual cellule if desired. This may be
        done to save additional space. However, in the inventive
        process, the plantlets may be grown separately in the new
        integument packs 50, eliminating the need for plant separation
        and the damage associated with untangling roots and foliage of
        several individual plants. </p>
      <p>During Stage 3, the individual tissue samples grown in Stage 2
        are placed in a media which stimulates cell differentiation and
        the growth of individual plantlets, each plantlet developing
        roots and foliage. Suitable Stage 3 media includes Murashige
        Pre-Transplant Mediums, available from the Carolina Biological
        Supply Company. The purpose of Stage 3 is to grow individual
        plantlets and prepare them for greenhouse culture. As
        distinguished from the prior art process, during Stage 3, the
        same size or a larger size integument pack 50 can be used.
        Initially in Stage 3, the plants are still grown in the culture
        room during this phase of development, but they are placed under
        increased light conditions so as to promote photosynthesis and
        growth. Approximately 2000 foot-candles of light are provided.
        The differentiation and growth process of Stage 3 requires
        between 20 and 45 days depending upon the plant variety. Because
        the integument packs 50 are contaminant impermeable, once
        individual plantlets have formed, the plantlets can be removed
        to the greenhouse to harden during the later portions of Stage 3
        and need not be housed in a culture room for the entire Stage 3
        period. This can significantly reduce the time normally required
        for the hardening process and reduce the size of the culture
        room. </p>
      <p>Some commercial growers will purchase their plants upon
        completion of Stage 3. Many, however, will wait until the plants
        have completed Stage 4, the final production stage. If purchased
        at the end of Stage 3, the plants produced by the inventive
        process need not be immediately planted. They may be maintained
        for up to one month simply by keeping the plantlets in their
        integument packs under conditions of reasonable temperature and
        light. This is advantageous in commercial production where the
        Stage 3 plants are sometime shipped directly to the grower, who
        may lack the time to plant them immediately. In the prior art,
        since the plantlets have been removed from the sterile
        environment of the culture room, the commercial grower must
        immediately remove the plantlets from the shipping containers,
        rinse them to remove the media in which the contaminants can
        thrive, and then plant the plantlets immediately. Because the
        plantlets purchased by growers at the end of Stage 3 are shipped
        and maintained in the integument packs 50, they are contaminant
        impermeable and, therefore, without the danger of contamination.
        The advantage in the new process is that the grower does not
        have to plant immediately. When the grower is ready to plant, he
        can simply slit the Stage 3 integument open, rinse and deposit
        the plantlet into the soil medium. </p>
      <p><b>STAGE 4</b> </p>
      <p><b>Greenhouse Culture and Hardening</b> </p>
      <p>At Stage 4, the plantlets are removed from the integument packs
        50 of Stage 3 and are transferred to a greenhouse where they are
        individually planted in a soil medium. The plant's tolerance to
        light must be increased so that the plant can adapt to its
        natural environment. This process is called "hardening" the
        plant. The plant's tolerance to light is gradually increased in
        Stages 3 and 4. During Stage 4, the plants are exposed to up to
        8,000 foot-candles in the greenhouse where growth and hardening
        is to take place. The exposure of the foliage of the plant
        directly to the atmosphere permits the plantlet to later grow in
        its natural environment without the protection of the
        integuments used in Stages 1 to 3. </p>
      <p>The soil used in Stage 4 is typically a pre-sterilized peat
        moss mix. Depending upon the type of plant, most commercial
        plants remain in the greenhouse 30 to 90 days before they are
        shipped to the grower. </p>
      <p>Use of the inventive process permits all stages of the
        micropropagation process to be less time consuming than their
        prior art counterparts, because the new and improved integuments
        are more easily and quickly handled. Thus, more tissue culture
        samples can be processed per day. Further, because the
        integuments consume less space than prior art containers, the
        costs associated with the culture room and the greenhouse are
        reduced. </p>
      <p><b>TABLES 1 AND 2</b> </p>
      <p>Table 1 compares the contamination rate using the inventive
        integuments and related process versus the prior art process and
        containers, in this instance test tubes, using different plants
        in an environment without sterile filtered air. The tissue
        samples were cultured for 28 days in each stage under identical
        conditions, except that 10 ml of media was used with the prior
        art containers, and 5 ml was used with each of the cellules 72
        of the integument packs 50. </p>

        These tests were conducted using available tissue samples from a

        3 using Murashige Minimal Organic in all cases. (2) Plants were
        grown for 28 days in Stage 2 using Murashige Fern Multiplication
        in all cases except for the Alocasia Lindanii, where Murashige
        Shoot Multiplication A was used. </p>
      <p>Tables 1 and 2 illustrate a reduction in contamination and an
        increase in growth rate and in the number of new tissue cultures
        and plantlets produced from an individual meristematic tissue of
        a cultivar using the inventive integuments and related process.
        For example, the Alocasia Lindanii of Table 1 shows that the
        prior art container and process had 172 contaminated tissue
        cultures per 600 cultures while the integument and process of
        the present invention had only 25 contaminated cultures. Thus,
        the present invention reduced contaminated cultures by
        approximately 85%. Table 2 shows that the growth of the Alocasia
        Lindanii culture using the integument and process of the present
        invention had an increase in average weight of approximately 4.5
        times over the prior art process during Stage 1, an increase of
        approximately 4.4 times over the prior art process during Stage
        2, and an increase of approximately 3.6 times over the prior art
        process during Stage 3. Over the three stages, the inventive
        integument and process produced a growth rate approximately 4
        times greater than that of the prior art containers and process.
      </p>
      <p>The following are further examples of the use of the new and
        improved integument and culturing process. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE I</b> </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Culture of Nephrolepis Exaltata Whitmanii</b> </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted for the micropropagation of the
        fern Nephrolepis Exaltata Whitmanii, wherein the results of
        employing the integument and process of the present invention
        were compared with those obtained using the prior art containers
        and process. Stages 1 to 4 where utilizing the inventive
        integument and process are described first, followed by a
        description of the prior art containers and process. </p>
      <p><b>Inventive Integument and Process</b> </p>
      <p>In preparing the media for Stage 1, 4.4 grams of pre-mixed
        Murashige Minimal Organic medium and 30 grams sucrose were added
        to 500 ml of distilled water. The solution was stirred until the
        ingredients had dissolved. Additional distilled water was then
        added to bring the final volume of the solution to 1000 ml. The
        pH of the solution was then adjusted to 5.5. 8 grams of agar
        were then added and the mixture was heated until the agar
        dissolved. 5 ml of the media was then transferred to each of 200
        cellules 72 of the integument packs 50. The unsealed ports of
        entry of the cellules were then covered with nonabsorbent paper
        towelling and the integument packs were autoclaved for fifteen
        minutes at 15 psi. The integuments were removed from the
        autoclave while still warm and placed under a laminar flow hood
        to complete cooling. </p>
      <p>In preparing the meristematic tissue, 250 stolons of the fern
        were removed from the preselected parent plant and were wrapped
        in a sterile gauze. This gauze packet containing the stolons was
        then soaked with 500 ml of sterile distilled water to which two
        drops of wetting agent, such as Palmolive Green manufactured by
        Procter &amp; Gamble of Cinncinati, Ohio, had been added. </p>
      <p>This packet was sonicated for three minutes. The packet was
        then placed in a sterile container and covered with 500 ml of a
        10% sodium hypochloride solution to which two drops of a wetting
        agent had been added. The container was covered with a tight
        fitting lid and vigorously shaken by hand for one minute. The
        container was then placed in the ultrasonic cleaner and
        sonicated for ten minutes, after which it was then removed and
        sprayed with a 90% isopropyl alcohol solution and placed in the
        laminar flow hood to air dry. The lid was removed and the 10%
        sodium hypochloride solution was drained off. </p>
      <p>The gauze packet containing the stolons was then rinsed three
        times with sterile distilled water (approximately three minutes
        for each rinse). The packet was removed from the container, laid
        on a sterile work surface under the laminar flow hood, and the
        gauze packet was opened. The clean stolons were separated and
        approximately one inch of the active growing end was removed
        from each stolon. One active end was placed in each of the
        cellules 72 containing media. </p>
      <p>The top of each cellule was heat sealed using a wire sealer at
        300.degree. F. for ten seconds. The integument pack was then
        labeled and the process was repeated until all the tissue had
        been so placed. </p>
      <p>The integument packs were placed in the culture room, which was
        maintained at 80.degree. F. with sixteen hours of light and
        eight hours of darkness per twenty-four hour period. The
        cultures were examined every twenty-four hours for contamination
        and growth. </p>
      <p>During the first five days of Stage 1, twenty-six of the 200
        cultures contaminated. At the end of ten days, some initial
        growth was observed in all of the remaining cultures. Some frond
        development was noted in all cultures by the end of the
        twentieth day, and the cultures were ready for Stage 2
        multiplication by the end of the twenty-eighth day. </p>
      <p>To prepare the media for Stage 2, 4.6 grams of premixed
        Murashige Fern Multiplication Medium and 30 grams of sucrose
        were added to 500 ml of distilled water. This was stirred until
        a solution was formed. Additional distilled water was added to
        bring the volume to 1000 ml. The pH was adjusted to 5.3. 8 grams
        of agar was then added to the solution and the solution was
        heated until the agar had dissolved. 5 ml of the solution was
        then added to each of 200 unused cellules 72 of integument packs
        50. The open ports of entry of the cellules were covered with
        nonabsorbant paper towels and the integument packs were
        autoclaved for fifteen minutes at 15 psi. While still warm, the
        integument packs were moved to the laminar flow hood and allowed
        to cool. </p>
      <p>To prepare the tissue cultures from Stage 1, the integument
        packs containing active clean cultures from Stage 1 were first
        completely immersed in a 10% sodium hypochloride solution for
        three minutes, then removed and rinsed with sterile water. The
        integument packs were dried with a sterile paper towel and laid
        on a sterile work surface under the laminar flow hood. </p>
      <p>One cellule was opened at a time, using a sterlized No. 11
        scalpel, by making a lengthwise cut down the center of the
        cellule. The tissue samples were removed with sterilized
        instruments and placed on a sterile work surface. If more than
        one active growing point was present on the removed tissue
        sample, the sample was divided into individual growing points.
        These individual growing points were then planted in the
        prepared cellule containing the Stage 2 multiplication media.
        After the cellules were filled, they were sealed using the
        above-described wire heat sealer. </p>
      <p>The Stage 2 integument packs were then labeled and moved to the
        culture room, which was maintained at 80.degree. F. with sixteen
        hours of light and eight hours of darkness per twenty-four
        hours. The cultures were checked every 24 hours for
        contamination and growth. </p>
      <p>During the 28 day test period no contamination was noted in any
        of the cultures. During the first ten days, accelerated growth
        was noted in all cultures. At the end of twenty-eight days, the
        cultures were ready for stage 3. </p>
      <p>In preparing the media for Stage 3, 4.4 grams of pre-mixed
        pretransplant medium was mixed with 30 grams of sucrose and
        added to 500 ml of distilled water. This was then stirred until
        the ingredients had dissolved. Additional distilled water was
        added to bring the volume to 1000 ml. The pH was then adjusted
        to 5.5. 8 grams of agar was added, and the solution was heated
        until the agar had dissolved. 5 ml of the media was placed in
        each unused Stage 3 cellule 72 of integument pack 50. The
        unsealed ports of entry of the Stage 3 cellules were then
        covered with non-absorbant paper towelling and the integument
        packs were autoclaved for fifteen minutes at 15 psi. While still
        warm, the integument packs were removed from the autoclave and
        placed in the laminar flow hood to finish cooling. </p>
      <p>The tissue samples emerging from the Stage 2 cellules were used
        as the Stage 3 source materials. The Stage 2 integument packs
        were first immersed in 10% sodium hypochloride solution for
        three minutes, and then rinsed in distilled water. The
        integument packs were dried with sterile paper towelling and
        placed on a sterile work surface under the laminar flow hood.
        Each cellule of the integument pack was opened by cutting
        lengthwise down its center with a sterile scalpel. The tissue
        was removed, placed on a sterile work surface, and then rinsed
        with sterile water and blotted dry with sterile paper towelling.
        Each tissue sample was then weighed. The average weight per
        sample was 4.5 grams. </p>
      <p>The tissue emerging from Stage 2 was then subdivided into as
        many pieces of active growing tissue as could feasibly support
        good Stage 3 growth. Each division was then placed in a cellule
        72 of an unused integument pack 50 which was sealed using the
        wire sealer at 300.degree. F. for ten seconds. </p>
      <p>The integument packs were then labeled and moved to the culture
        room maintained at 80.degree. F. with sixteen hours of light and
        eight hours of darkness per each twenty-four hours. The cultures
        were checked every twenty-four hours for contamination and
        growth. </p>
      <p>During the twenty-eight day test of Stage 3, no contamination
        was observed in any culture. Root development was noted at the
        end of the first week and good frond development appeared by the
        end of the second week. </p>
      <p>After twenty-eight days, the resulting plantlets were ready to
        enter Stage 4. Under the laminar flow hood, the plantlets were
        removed from the integument packs, rinsed with distilled water,
        blotted dry and weighed. The average weight was 5.4 grams per
        tissue sample. </p>
      <p><b>The Prior Art Process</b> </p>
      <p>The media preparation for the prior art process was the same as
        described above, except that twice as much media was prepared,
        and, rather than being placed into the integuments of the
        present invention, 10 ml of media was placed into each of 200
        25.times.150 mm sterilized test tubes. The tubes were capped
        with conventional plastic caps. </p>
      <p>The tissue preparation for the Nephrolepis Exaltata Whitmanii
        was also the same as described above. However, the results
        obtained following Stage 1 were dramatically different. Twenty
        cultures became contaminated during the first 5 days, and an
        additional 26 were lost during the 28 day Stage 1 period. It was
        not until the 15th day that all tissue samples showed some
        growth, and by the 20th day only one half of the samples showed
        frond development. </p>
      <p>The Stage 2 media was the same as that described above, except
        that, once again, twice as much was prepared and placed into
        each Stage 2 test tube. The Stage 1 test tubes could not be
        immersed in the sodium hypochloride solution because there would
        be leakage through the caps. Instead, under the laminar flow
        hood, their outer surfaces were sterilized by spraying with a
        90% isopropyl alcohol solution before the tissue samples were
        removed from their Stage 1 test tubes and placed into Stage 2
        containers. </p>
      <p>During the first 5 days of Stage 2 growth, 18 cultures became
        contaminated, and an additional 38 samples were lost to
        contamination between the 14th and 28th days. It was not until
        the 10th day that accelerated growth in the samples was
        observed. The average weight per sample at the completion of the
        28 day Stage 2 was only 1.03 grams as compared to 4.5 grams
        using the inventive integument and process. </p>
      <p>For Stage 3, once again twice as much media as that used with
        the inventive process was prepared and placed into each Stage 3
        test tube. Again, rather than immersing the Stage 2 test tubes
        in sodium hypochloride solution, the outer surface was sprayed
        with the alcohol solution while under the laminar flow hood. </p>
      <p>During the first 5 days of Stage 3 growth, 18 cultures became
        contaminated, and an additional 35 samples were lost to
        contamination between the 14th and 28th days. Root development
        did not appear on the majority of samples until the 14th day,
        and minimal frond development did not appear until the 24th day.
        The average weight per sample at the completion of the 28 day
        Stage 3 was only 1.3 grams as compared to 5.4 grams using the
        inventive integument and process. At this point, the majority of
        the samples were not ready for transfer to Stage 4. It is
        estimated that such samples would have required approximately 45
        days of Stage 3 growth to achieve the size and maturity
        necessary for transfer to Stage 4. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE II</b> </p>
      <p><b>Lettuce Production From Tissue Culturing</b> </p>
      <p>Lettuce was produced in tissue culture using the inventive
        integument and process, as described below. </p>
      <p>The Stage 1 media preparation was the same as that described
        above for the Nephrolepis Exaltata Whitmanii. </p>
      <p>A non-heading lettuce variety known as butter leaf was
        selected. This variety has a normal production time from seed of
        45 to 50 days. Tissue was first removed from the apical dome of
        thirty greenhouse-raised plants. The leaves were stripped, and
        the roots were removed exposing the stem, which was rinsed in
        running water. The apical dome was then removed. </p>
      <p>The apical dome was placed in a clean container and covered
        with 10% sodium hypochloride solution to which two drops of a
        wetting agent had been added. This was sonicated for ten minutes
        and the tissue was rinsed three times in sterile distilled
        water. </p>
      <p>Under the laminar flow hood, final tissue samples, which were
        still covered with leaf, were excised from the primary apical
        dome of the plant and subdivided three to four times to yield
        100 tissue samples. Each individual tissue sample was placed in
        the cellule 72 of an integument pack 50, already each containing
        5 ml of Stage 1 media. Each cellule was then sealed using a wire
        sealer at 300.degree. F. for ten seconds. The integument packs
        were labelled and moved to the culture room which was maintained
        at the same temperature and light conditions as described with
        respect to Example I. The cultures were examined every
        twenty-four hours for growth and contamination. </p>
      <p>During the first five days, thirty-five cultures contaminated,
        but no further contamination occurred. On the fifth day, good
        root development was noted in all the remaining cultures, and by
        the end of the seventh day, all cultures had developed leaves
        and were actively growing. A tremendous increase in tissue mass
        was noted by the end of the tenth day, at which time a majority
        of the cultures had developed one inch long leaves. By the
        twenty-eighth day, the average leaf size was three inches, and
        all cultures were ready for Stage 2. </p>
      <p>In preparing the media for Stage 2, 4.8 grams of Murashige
        Premixed Multiplication Medium A and 30 grams of sucrose were
        added to 500 ml of water. This was stirred until the ingredients
        had dissolved and distilled water was added to make the final
        volume 1000 ml. The pH was adjusted to 5.5. 8 grams of agar was
        then added to the solution, and it was heated until the agar had
        dissolved. 5 ml of media was put into each cellule 72 of
        integument packs 50. The open ports of entry of the cellules
        were covered with nonabsorbent paper towelling and the
        integument packs were autoclaved for fifteen minutes at 15 psi.
        While still warm, the integument packs were placed in the
        laminar flow hood to complete cooling. </p>
      <p>The tissue samples emerging from Stage 1 were used for Stage 2
        cultures. </p>
      <p>The Stage 1 integument packs were completely immersed in a 10%
        sodium hypochloride solution for three minutes to effect surface
        sterilization. They were then rinsed in sterile water and dried
        with sterile paper towelling. Under the laminar flow hood, the
        cellules were individually opened by cutting lengthwise down the
        center, and the tissue was removed and placed in a sterile work
        surface under the laminar flow hood. All roots and leaves were
        removed from the tissue and, where possible, the remaining
        tissue was subdivided. The subdivided tissue samples were then
        placed into the unused Stage 2 integument packs, one tissue
        sample per cellule. After each cellule was filled, it was heat
        sealed with the wire sealer. </p>
      <p>All integument packs were labelled and placed in the culture
        room, maintained at the light and temperature conditions as
        described with respect to Example I. The cultures were examined
        every twenty-four hours for growth and contamination. </p>
      <p>No Stage 2 cultures were lost to contamination. By the end of
        the fifth day, there was a substantial increase in the tissue
        mass. By the tenth day, there was good root development along
        with primary leaf development. By the end of the fifteenth day,
        clearly defined plantlets were visible in locations which
        indicated that lateral buds had developed. The lateral buds
        continued to grow until the end of the twenty-eight day test
        period. By this time, well-developed plantlets were ready for
        additional subculture. </p>
      <p>To prepare the media for Stage 3, 4.4 grams of premixed
        transplant medium and 30 grams of sucrose were added to 500 ml
        of distilled water. The solution was stirred until the
        ingredients were dissolved. Additional distilled water was added
        to make the final volume 1000 ml. The pH was adjusted to 5.5. </p>
      <p>50 ml of this media was dispensed into the alternative
        integument embodiment 90 specially designed to promote the
        growth of leafy vegetables. The integument employed was twelve
        inches long with a three inch long root chamber at the base. </p>
      <p>The open ports of entry of the cellules 122 of integument 90
        were folded over and closed with paper clips and the integuments
        90 were then autoclaved for fifteen minutes at 15 psi. While
        still warm, the integuments were moved to the laminar flow hood
        to finish cooling. </p>
      <p>The active tissue samples from Stage 2 were used as source
        materials. The Stage 2 integuments were immersed in a 10% sodium
        hypochloride solution for three minutes to effect surface
        sterilization, then rinsed in sterile water, dried with sterile
        paper towels, and laid on a sterile work surface under the
        laminar flow hood. The cellules 122 of the integuments 90 were
        opened by cutting lengthwise down their centers, after which the
        tissue was removed and placed on the sterile work surface. </p>
      <p>Individual plantlets were then removed from the primary tissue
        mass, and were placed in the center of each of the integuments
        90 specially designed for leafy vegetable growth. The top of
        each integument 90 was then sealed with the wire sealer at
        300.degree. F. for twenty seconds. The integuments were labeled
        and moved to the culture room which was maintained at the light
        and temperature conditions as described with respect to Example
        I. </p>
      <p>No contamination was noted in any of the cultures. By the end
        of the fifth day, all cultures showed good root development.
        Leaf development was noted on the sixth day, and it progressed
        very rapidly. Leaves three inches long were observed in all
        cultures by the fifteenth day, and full leaf development was
        noted on the thirtieth day. Complete lettuce plants were
        harvested on the thirty-fifth day. All had well-developed leaves
        suitable for consumption. The plants averaged seven inches in
        length, this measurement being taken from the bottom of the
        lowest leaf to the top of the plant. The plants also had
        well-developed interiors with densely packed leaves. Normally,
        this type of lettuce is nonheading and it takes 45-50 days to
        produce a similar sized plant from seed. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE III</b> </p>
      <p><b>Lettuce Production from Seed</b> </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to determine whether the use of the
        integument and method of the present invention enhanced lettuce
        growth when lettuce was grown from seed. The experiment was
        conducted as described below. </p>
      <p>The media used was Murashige Minimal Organic, with 30 grams of
        sucrose and 8 grams of agar dissolved therein by the techniques
        described above for Nephrolepis Exaltata Whitmanii. The final pH
        was adjusted to 5.5. 5 ml of the media was then placed into the
        cellules 72 of integument packs 50 depicted in FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>Black-seeded Simpson lettuce was used. Two hundred commercially
        obtained seeds were wrapped in gauze and surface sterilized by
        sonicating for ten minutes in a 10% sodium hypochloride solution
        to which two drops of a wetting agent had been added. The gauze
        packet was then removed and rinsed three times in sterile
        distilled water, with each rinse lasting for three minutes. The
        gauze packet was then placed on a sterile work surface under a
        laminar flow hood and the seeds were separated into two equal
        groups of 100 each. One hundred of the seeds were planted in the
        cellules 72 of integument packs 50 with one seed per cellule 72.
      </p>
      <p>After each cellule 72 was filled, it was sealed, labeled and
        placed in the culture room where it was checked daily for growth
        and contamination. </p>
      <p>The other 100 seeds were planted in a seed starting mix
        consisting of peat moss, pearlite and vermiculite. The seed was
        sown on the top of the pre-moistened mix, and pressed into the
        soil. The flat was labeled and placed in the culture room under
        the same light and temperature conditions as the seeds planted
        in the integuments, the same conditions described in Example I.
      </p>
      <p>In the first five days, three cultures in the integuments were
        lost to contamination. Root development was noted in all
        cellules by the end of the third day, and primary leaf
        development was noted on the fourth day. Well-developed
        seedlings were observed in the integuments on the fifth day. </p>
      <p>By the end of the seventh day, no growth was noted in the
        planted seeds, and a problem was suspected. A microscopic
        observation revealed evidence of fungal attack on all the seeds.
        It is suspected that the surface sterilization of the seed
        removed some natural fungal defense mechanism. The experiment
        was terminated at this point and repeated as described below. </p>
      <p>200 seeds of the black seeded Simpson were obtained as
        described above. This time, however, only the 100 seeds which
        were intended for planting in the integuments were treated with
        the sodium hypochloride solution and sonicated as described
        above. These 100 seeds were planted in cellules 72 of integument
        packs 50 containing the same media described above. </p>
      <p>The other 100 untreated seeds were pressed into the freshly
        prepared pre-moistened soil mix described above. Both the
        integument packs 50 and the flats with the untreated seeds were
        then placed into the culture room, which was maintained an
        80.degree. F. with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness per
        day. Both the integument packs and flats were checked daily for
        contamination and germination. The soil in the flats was misted
        daily to moisten the soil. </p>
      <p>During the first five days, two cultures in the integument
        packs were lost to contamination. Root development was noted in
        the third day with primary leaf development occurring on the
        fourth day. Well-developed seedlings were observed on the fifth
        day. By the end of the tenth day, the seedlings in the
        integument packs had grown to over one inch in length and had
        well-developed root systems. At the end of the twenty day test
        period, these seedlings had filled the cellules of the
        integument packs with well-developed leaves. 98% of the seeds in
        the integument packs germinated. </p>
      <p>Only 30% of the seeds planted in the soil mix first showed
        primary leaf development on the seventh day. By the end of the
        eighth day, only 68 of the 100 seeds had germinated. Root
        development was not observable as the roots were beneath the
        soil. The final resultant seedlings averaged only one inch in
        height with one to two secondary leaves. Eight additional
        seedlings were lost. At the end of the test, only 60% of the
        starting seeds originally planted in soil had produced
        seedlings. </p>
      <p>While this experiment was conducted through the use of
        integument packs 50 such as illustrated in FIG. 7, given the
        high germination rates of the seeds grown using the inventive
        process, it is preferable to grow lettuce from seed in an
        integument 90 such that the plantlets produced would not have to
        be transferred from an integument pack 50 to an integument 90.
        Due to the low cost of the integument 90 and the seed itself,
        any integument 90 containing a seed which fails to germinate can
        easily be identified and disposed of. Further, eliminating the
        steps of transferring plantlets from integument packs 50 to
        integuments 90 would eliminate the significant labor costs
        otherwise incurred. </p>
      <p><b>Example IV</b> </p>
      <p><b>Fungal and Bacterial Production and Culture Storage</b> </p>
      <p>Tests were conducted to determine if the integument and method
        of the present invention would allow for the growth, isolation
        and storage of bacterial and fungal cultures. The tests were
        performed in the manner described below: </p>
      <p><b>Fungal Cultures</b> </p>
      <p>A semisolid Minimal Organic Media with 30 grams of sucrose and
        8 grams agar was prepared by techniques described above for
        Nephrolepis Exalata Whitmanii. The final ph was adjusted to 5.5.
        5 ml of the media was then placed into cellules 72 of integument
        packs 50 depicted in FIG. 7. The integument packs 50 were then
        autoclaved for 15 minutes at 250.degree. F. at 15 p.s.i. They
        were then placed in the laminar flowhood and allowed to cool.
        Several cellules 72 of integument packs 50 were innoculated with
        Rhizoctonia solani. This was done by inserting a sterile
        inoculation loop into a pure culture of Rhizoctonia solani,
        removing it and then inserting it into a cellule 72 of
        integument pack 50. The innoculant loop was placed in the center
        of the cellule and moved down until contact was made with the
        media. The loop was then resterilized and the process repeated
        until all cellules 72 of integument pack 50 had been
        innoculated. The integument packs 50 were heat sealed, labeled
        and placed in the culture room. This process was repeated using
        pure cultures of Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicillium italicum on
        several integument packs 50. </p>
      <p>To determine if cross contamination would occur between
        cellules 72 of integument pack 50, several integument packs were
        innoculated in the following manner. The first, third and fifth
        cellule 72 of the integument pack 50 was innoculated with
        Rhizoctonia solani, Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicilliym italicum
        respectively, leaving cellule 2 and 4 containing only sterile
        media. The integument packs were sealed and each cellule
        containing an innoculant was labeled. The integument packs were
        placed in the culture room. </p>
      <p>After 5 days all cultures were checked by visual observation
        for growth of fungus. All innoculated cultures showed positive
        growth and no growth was observed on those cellules that were
        not innoculated. The cultures were checked several times during
        a six month period. While fungal growth slowed as the media was
        consumed, the cultures remained viable. Little or no drying of
        the media was noted. Further, the resulting fungal cultures
        appeared to be pure, i.e., uncontaminated from outside
        microorganisms or from the other fungal cultures. </p>
      <p><b>Bacterial Culture</b> </p>
      <p>Several integument packs 50 were innoculated with the bacteria
        Serratia marcescens, obtained from a pure culture in the method
        described above for fungal cultures. </p>
      <p>The cultures were checked by visual observation after 5 days
        and several times after that during a 6 month period. All
        innoculated cellules of the integuments showed positive growth
        of Serratina marcescens. It was observed for certain bacterial
        cultures that the bacteria migrated towards the inner surfaces
        of the integument membrane where the gas exchange with the
        ambient atmosphere was greatest. There was no bacterial growth
        or contamination of the cellules of the integuments that were
        not innoculated, and those that were innoculated appeared pure.
        At the end of a 6 month period all cultures were viable with
        little or no loss of media due to drying. </p>
      <p>Certain microorganisms live and grow anaerobically Although no
        such experiments have yet been conducted, the integument for
        culturing these microorganisms can be made from less permeable
        materials than the polyethylene of the preferred embodiment so
        as to preclude a gaseous interchange between the ambient
        environment and the organic material. Similarly, some
        microorganisms prefer or require the absence of light. When
        culturing such microorganisms, an opaque material can be used
        for the membrane. </p>
      <p>Examples I-III above demonstrate that the integument and method
        of the present invention yields dramatic improvements in plant
        micropropagation and tissue culturing. These same improvements
        will follow irrespective of whether the plants cultured are
        horticultural, agricultural or even aquatic in variety. It is
        believed that the invention will yield dramatic improvements in
        animal and human tissue culturing as well. Example IV
        demonstrates the ability of the integument and method described
        herein for culturing microorganisms, such as viruses, single
        celled algea, fungus and bacteria, and in preventing the
        cultured microorganisms from escaping from the integument and
        contaminating or infecting others. </p>
      <p>The Examples and embodiments described are exemplary only and
        not limiting. Many variations and modifications of the processes
        and the integuments are possible, and are within the scope of
        the invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not
        limited by the above description but only by the claims which
        follow, and that scope includes all equivalents of the subject
        matter of the claims. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An automated system for growing plant material includes an
        first length of membrane material having a plurality of open
        growing chambers and a second length of membrane material having
        a plurality of growing chambers filled with the plant material.
        A media preparation unit mixes measured amounts of individual
        stock solutions for dispensing media into the open growing
        chambers by a fill unit. A fill check scanner unit determines
        that a sufficient amount of media has been dispensed within each
        growing chamber. A sterilization unit sterilizes the media
        filled open growing chambers which then pass to a cooling and
        storage unit for cooling and storing the media-filled open
        growing chambers until ready for planting with plant material.
        The second length of plant-filled growing chambers are housed in
        a plant culture room where the plant material is permitted to
        grow. A growth detection scanner determines the extent of growth
        of the plant material. Upon the plant material reaching a
        predetermined growth, the plant-filled growing chambers pass to
        a surface sterilization unit for surface sterilizing the
        plant-filled growing chambers. A cutting opens the growing
        chambers and the plant material is removed. The removed plant
        material is passed through a cutting unit where the plant
        material is cut into pieces. Each piece of plant material is
        then planted into a media-filled open growing chamber from the
        cooling and storing unit. A heat sealer closes the open end of
        the newly plant-filled growing chambers. The newly plant-filled
        growing chambers are then transported back to the culture room.
        A tractor feed apparatus transports the lengths of growing
        chambers throughout the automated system and a control system
        synchronizes and controls the operation of each of the units and
        tractor feed apparatus. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to the field of
        automated apparatus and processes for micropropagation and
        culturing organic material. More particularly, the invention
        relates to automated apparatus and processes for
        micropropagation and tissue culturing of plants. Still more
        particularly, the invention relates to a new and automated
        system for performing micropropagation and tissue culturing of
        horticultural and agricultural plants using integuments. </p>
      <p><b>MICROPROPAGATION AND TISSUE CULTURING</b> </p>
      <p>Micropropagation is the process of mass producing new
        generation plants from a single tissue sample taken from a
        carefully selected parent plant or cultivar. Micropropagation
        retains the advantages common to all types of vegetative
        propagation, i.e., identity of progeny and the ability to
        propagate non-seed producing plants, while having the additional
        advantage that only a small piece of tissue from the cultivar or
        parent plant is required. Micropropagation thus eliminates the
        disadvantages associated with the other forms of vegetative
        propagation. </p>
      <p>Tissue culturing is the process of growing cells in vitro and
        is used to grow both plant and animal cells. Tissue culturing
        techniques are commonly used in the early stages of plant
        micropropagation process where it is desirable to rapidly
        produce plant cells. </p>
      <p>Improvements in tissue culturing techniques also have
        applications beyond the micropropagation of plants. Essentially
        the same culturing process is used to culture animal and even
        human tissue, such tissue being used in the fields of animal
        agriculture and human and veterinary medicine. Culturing of
        organic material other than plant and animal cells and tissue,
        such as bacteria, viruses and algeas, is also performed in vitro
        for both research and commercial purposes. Improvements in the
        procedures and apparatus used to reproduce and maintain these
        organisms would be beneficial, for example, to researchers and
        industry who require a large or steady supply of such material.
        Further, the automated system of the present invention can be
        adapted for use with germinating seeds and growing plants
        therefrom. </p>
      <p><b>DEFICIENCIES IN PRIOR ART MICROPROPAGATION TECHNIQUES</b> </p>
      <p>The prior art micropropagation process is described in detail
        in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 021,408, page 5, line 3
        through page 11, line 9, the entire disclosure of which is
        hereby incorporated by reference. Despite the advantages
        conventional micropropagation techniques offer the commercial
        grower, there are problems associated with the prior art
        culturing apparatus and processes. One of the primary problems
        is contamination. Any of a variety of microorganisms, including
        viruses, bacteria, fungus, molds, yeast and single cell algae,
        can ruin the cultures during any of the various stages of
        micropropagation. </p>
      <p>The prior at sterilized glass or plastic culture containers
        such as test tubes, flasks or bottles have serious drawbacks.
        For example, since plants require both carbon dioxide and oxygen
        to live and grow, these containers must provide a means for gas
        exchange. The walls of these traditional glass and plastic
        containers, however, do not permit the required gaseous
        interchange. Thus, rubber stoppers having cotton packing or some
        similar filter material, loosely fitting caps, or baffled
        plastic caps have been employed to allow an adequate exchange of
        gas between the tissue or plant and the ambient atmosphere and
        environment. However, such devices restrict the amount and rate
        of gas which can be exchanged. Further, such caps and stoppers
        do not totally protect the plant from contamination by
        microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Thus, it has
        been of paramount importance that the tissue culture room and
        laboratory be maintained under aseptic conditions, i.e. kept
        extremely clean and their atmospheres entirely filtered.
        Further, precise temperature, humidity, and light conditions
        must also be maintained in the culture room when using
        traditional micropropagation techniques and apparatus. Gas
        exchange is also required for culturing animal cells and for
        certain other microorganisms. Traditional flasks, petrie dishes
        and the like, while allowing for a certain degree of gas
        exchange, also allow contamination to occur. </p>
      <p>The original cost of the traditional glass or plastic culture
        containers; the labor and equipment cost to maintain the
        sterility of the containers; and the added cost of the
        facilities, equipment, and related conditions required to
        maintain a sterile growing environment, all represent major cost
        factors associated with the use of such container in
        conventional culturing processes. </p>
      <p>A further significant disadvantage of the prior art
        micropropagation process and apparatus is the fact that the
        conventional culturing containers do not lend themselves to use
        in an automated system. Currently, each step of the
        micropropagation process must be performed by time consuming and
        laborious manual operations. For example, when a tissue sample
        which has survived stage one and has grown to a size that it is
        ready for multiplication, the culture container, a glass test
        tube, for example, must be carried from the culture room to the
        laboratory and placed under a laminar flow hood. There, a
        technician sitting in front of the hood, will typically spray
        the container with a solution of alcohol to kill microorganisms
        which might be on or near the entrance of the container and
        contaminate the culture during the tissue manipulation. Next,
        the technician must grasp the test tube in one hand, remove the
        cotton filled rubber stopper (in this example), remove the
        tissue sample with sterilized forceps and place it on a
        sterilized working surface. The technician must then cut the
        tissue sample into a number of individual samples each of which
        will then be placed in a sterile container with fresh media. </p>
      <p>The containers and media to be used in this next stage will
        themselves have already been manually prepared. Typically, a
        measured amount of prepared media is placed in each test tube,
        with the test tubes being held vertically in a conventional test
        tube rack. The racks of media-filled test tubes are then
        sterilized and transferred to the laminar hood for the
        technician's use in the next tissue manipulation. Similarly,
        culture container lids and stoppers must also be cleaned,
        sterilized and placed under the laminar flow hood for the
        technician's use. Once cooled, the technician will grasp a clean
        and sterilized test tube in one hand and will insert one portion
        of the newly divided tissue sample into the sterilized media
        with the other hand, and then place a cotton filled and
        sterilized stopper on the test tube and replace the test tube in
        the rack. Once the tissue manipulations are completed, the racks
        containing the new cultures are then transported back to the
        culture room. </p>
      <p>As can be appreciated, the number of cultures which can be
        produced is directly related to the efforts and abilities of the
        technicians and more particularly to the manual dexterity of the
        technicians. Furthermore, the extensive manual operation and
        human involvement in the process creates a tremendous potential
        for contamination, even despite the precautions currently taken,
        such as requiring the technicians to wear surgical gloves and
        masks. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the remaining steps in the micropropagation
        process must be carried out manually. Test tubes are manually
        loaded and unloaded into washing apparatus and frequently
        require a manual washing to completely remove media or residue
        from a container which had a contaminated culture. Likewise, it
        is time consuming to manually mix medias and fill the test tubes
        or culture containers with the prepared media in measured
        quantities. Culture vessels or containers are also manually
        loaded into autoclaves for sterilization. As explained above,
        before opening a culture container, its sides are typically
        manually sprayed with a solution of alcohol or chlorine solution
        to kill microorganisms which might contaminate the culture once
        the container is opened. </p>
      <p>It is also currently left to technicians to visually inspect
        the growing cultures for signs of contamination and growth and
        take the appropriate action depending upon their observation.
        For example, when tissue or plantlets have reached their desired
        size, technicians must manually transfer the culture containers
        from the culture room to the laboratory in order to perform the
        next manipulation. When a culture is contaminated, it is also
        manually removed from the culture room and transported to a
        station for disposal and for container cleaning and
        sterilization. </p>
      <p>Current micropropagation techniques also lack the ability to
        monitor inventory through automatic means. Instead, inventories
        are controlled by maintaining physical separation between the
        cultures of the various plants being grown and by simply
        counting the number of culture containers and the cultures
        contained therein. </p>
      <p>As can be appreciated, the conventional micropropagation
        process is extremely labor intensive and costly. In addition,
        the level of production is limited by the number and abilities
        of the technicians involved. A well qualified technician, using
        conventional culturing apparatus and procedures can establish
        approximately 350 cultures per day. Using a laminar flow hood to
        its maximum efficiency by employing three technicians, each
        working eight hours in a 24 hour day, the maximum number of
        cultures which can be established by well trained technicians in
        a day is approximately 1050. Accordingly, there is a need in the
        art for an automated system for performing micropropagation and
        the culturing of organic material. It is desirable that such a
        system eliminate the time consuming and extremely expensive
        manual steps currently employed, including tissue manipulation,
        container cleaning and sterilization, culture transportation,
        media preparation, and filling. In addition, it is desirable
        that such a system have the capability of automatically
        detecting culture containers which have been unfilled or
        underfilled with media, cultures which have become contaminated,
        and tissue samples of plantlets which are ready for the next
        stage of micropropagation. An automated system also having the
        capability of tracking a culture throughout the micropropagation
        process and automatically computing the inventory of the various
        plants or materials being cultured would also be a great advance
        over the traditional culturing apparatus and processes. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The automated system for growing plant material includes a
        length of membrane material having a plurality of open growing
        chambers. The preferred membrane material is a high density
        polyethylene sealed together at predetermined locations to form
        a plurality of growing chambers having an open end for the
        insertion of media and plant material. A media preparation unit
        mixes measured amounts of individual stock solutions to prepare
        a selected growing media for the plant material. A fill unit
        dispenses the media into the open growing chambers of the length
        of membrane material. A fill check scanner unit scans the
        media-filled open growing chambers to insure that each of the
        growing chambers has been filled with a predetermined amount of
        media. The media-filled growing chambers then pass to a
        sterilization unit for sterilization. A cooling and storage unit
        cools and stores the media-filled open growing chambers until it
        is time for the insertion of plant material. </p>
      <p>Sealed growing chambers, previously filled with media and plant
        material, are housed in a plant culture room where the plant
        material has been permitted to grow in another length of
        membrane material. The length of plant-filled growing chambers
        is periodically passed through a growth detection scanner unit
        to scan the plant material to determine the extent of plant
        growth. Upon the plant material having reached sufficient
        growth, the length of plant-filled growing chambers is
        transported from the culture room to a surface sterilization
        unit for surface sterilizing the exterior of the growing
        chambers. A cutting unit opens the plant-filled growing chambers
        in preparation for the removal of the plant material. The plant
        material is removed from the plant-filled growing chambers by
        the injection of sterilized water into the closed end of the
        growing chamber to wash the plant material out of the opposite
        open end of the growing chamber which had been opened by the
        cutting unit. A rotating tissue containment device receives the
        plant material for transporting the plant material to the plant
        cutting unit. The plant material is extracted from the tissue
        containment unit and pushed against a reciprocating blade which
        cuts the plant material into individual pieces. A planting unit
        inserts individual pieces of the cut plant material into the
        media-filled open growing chambers previously stored in the
        cooling and storage unit. After the media-filled open growing
        chambers have been planted with a piece of plant material, the
        open end of the growing chambers is closed by heat sealing. The
        newly plant-filled growing chambers are then transported back to
        the culture room for new growth. </p>
      <p>A tractor feed apparatus transports the lengths of growing
        chambers throughout the automated system. A control system
        synchronizes and controls the timing, sequence and operation of
        each of the units and tractor feed apparatus. Bar coding units
        uniquely identify each growing chamber to track each growing
        chamber as it progresses through the operations of the automated
        system. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p><b>System 10 Overview</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a schematic
        illustration of the automated apparatus 10 for performing
        micropropagation and tissue culturing of plant tissue. The
        apparatus of the present invention is employed to automatically
        perform micropropagation and tissue culturing procedures through
        the use of the integument, a new pliable growing container
        described in co-pending applications Ser. No. 207,405 filed June
        14, 1988 and Ser. No. 021,408 filed Mar. 4, 1987, both
        incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>In general, an integument is a growing or culture container
        formed from a translucent membrane that is liquid and
        contaminant impermeable, but which allows necessary gas exchange
        and light transmission between the living tissue being cultured
        and the ambient environment. The membrane is formed into an
        envelope or cellule for containing the tissue and growth medium.
        Once the tissue and growth medium are placed in the cellule of
        the integument, the cellule is sealed and thus closed to the
        ambient environment. As described in co-pending applications
        Ser. No. 207,405 filed June 14, 1988 and Ser. No. 021,408 filed
        Mar. 4, 1987, an integument pack includes a number of individual
        cellules which are pliant and collapsible such that they may be
        rolled. For use with the apparatus and method of the present
        invention, it is preferred that an integument roll 20, described
        in more detail below, be employed. Integument roll 20 comprises
        a plurality of integuments 22 attached at adjacent edges forming
        a continuous ribbon-like sheet or length 24 of integuments 22
        loosely rolled onto a spool 26. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, the integument roll 20 is housed in
        an integument storage unit 28. In operation, cellules 30 of
        integuments 22 from integument roll 20 are transported as a
        continuous length 24 by a tractor feed mechanism 50 throughout
        the automated system 10. After leaving storage unit 28, the
        cellules 30 move, first to the media fill apparatus 70. A media
        preparation unit 80 automatically mixes the ingredients and
        proportions thereof needed to form the growth medium used for
        particular plants in the various stages of micropropagation.
        Once the cellules 30 are appropriately positioned within the
        media fill apparatus 70, media fill apparatus 70 injects media
        92 from media preparation unit 80 into the individual cellules
        30 of the continuous length 24 of integuments 22 as it is
        unrolled from the integument roll 20. Once filled with the
        measured quantity of the growth medium 92, a bar code indicating
        the type media is placed on the outside surface of cellules 30
        by bar coding means 93. Cellules 30 are then transported to a
        fill-check scanner 90 to insure the appropriate amount of growth
        medium 92 has been inserted into the cellules 30. The cellules
        30 with growth medium 92 are then transported to the
        sterilization unit 100 where they are heated under pressure to
        kill any microorganisms in or on the cellules 30 or the prepared
        media 92. From the sterilization unit 100, the sterilized
        cellules are transported to the cooling and storage unit 110.
        The sterilized cellules with media are stored in the cooling and
        storage unit 110 until plant tissue growing in other cellules,
        as hereinafter described, are ready for transplanting into the
        sterilized cellules stored in unit 110. For transplanting, the
        cellules are transported from unit 110 on to the tissue
        manipulation unit 120. </p>
      <p>All the required tissue manipulations of the micropropagation
        process are carried out within the tissue manipulation unit 120.
        The sterilized cellules and growth media are therein invested
        with tissue samples 122 and then closed by heat sealing in
        sealing unit 310 to prevent contamination. The invested cellules
        are then coded by bar coding means 311 with a bar code
        indicating the type of plant and the date the culture was
        established. </p>
      <p>The coded cellules 30 with plant tissue are then transported to
        and through the culture room 130 where they are exposed to a
        growing environment conducive to the particular variety of plant
        being grown and the stage of micropropagation. After the culture
        has been in the culture room 130 for the appropriate time period
        and grown to the desired stage of development, the cellules 30
        containing the cultures are transported through a growth
        detection scanner 140, which detects the growth of the plant
        material or tissue, and through a bar code reader 141. If the
        culture is ready for the next stage of micropropagation, the
        cellules containing the cultures are transported back into the
        tissue manipulation unit 120 where the cellules are surface
        sterilized and washed in surface sterilization unit 320 and
        opened in cellule cutting unit 280. The tissue samples 122 are
        then removed and cut into smaller tissue samples for
        transplanting or investment in new sterile cellules with growth
        media from cooling and storage unit 110 in tissue planting unit
        290. The cellules with new tissue samples are then sealed in
        sealing unit 310 and transported back into the culture room 130.
        Once the appropriate number of tissue multiplications have been
        performed and the desired number of plantlets have been
        produced, the cellules containing the plantlets are transported
        from the culture room 130 to the packaging system 160 where the
        still sealed cellules are boxed for shipping. </p>
      <p>The entire process is controlled and monitored by control
        system 150. </p>
      <p><b>Integument Roll 20</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown an integument roll 20
        generally comprising a continuous ribbon-like sheet or length 24
        of individual cellules 30 wrapped loosely around a spool 26. One
        portion of the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 is depicted
        in FIG. 3 and, as depicted, comprises individual cellules 30a,
        30b, and 30c. As best shown in FIG. 4, an individual cellule 30
        is formed by a front membrane 32 and back membrane 34 which are
        attached at their lower extremities by a wide heat-sealed lower
        band 36. It is preferred that lower band 36 be approximately
        one-half inch wide. While a narrower heat seal will suffice to
        prevent contamination, the wider heat-sealed band adds an extra
        measure of protection against the introduction of microorganisms
        and allows for lower tractor perforations 42 in lower band 36
        which, as described below, are used in conjunction with the
        tractor feed apparatus 50 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIGS. 3 and 4, front membrane 32 and back
        membrane 34 are also heat sealed along lines perpendicular to
        band 36 as shown at 38a, 38b, 38c, and 38d, thereby forming
        individual cellules 30a, 30b, and 30c. Preferably, heat seals 38
        do not extend the entire width of membranes 32 and 34, but
        instead stop approximately one-half inch short of the upper
        edges of membranes 32 and 34, thereby leaving upper front and
        back bands 46 and 48 respectively, unattached. In this
        configuration, cellule 30 is defined by heat seals 38 and lower
        heat seal band 36 leaving initially an open end 52 which serves
        as an entry port into cellule 30 for receiving plant tissue and
        growth media. Lower tractor perforations or apertures 42 are
        formed in lower heat seal band 36 and upper tractor perforations
        44, such a 44a and 44b, are formed in upper bands 46 and 48 at
        uniform distances along the entire continuous length 24 of
        integument roll 20. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a manufacturing process
        for the integument roll 20. Although it is anticipated that the
        integument 22 will be manufactured separately from the
        micropropagation process, the manufacturing process may be a
        part of the automated system 10. The integument roll 20 is
        manufactured by the melt blowing of a polyolefin film such as
        polyethylene. In manufacture, the film is blown into a large
        bubble which is drawn upward to obtain the desired film
        thickness and is then cooled. The blown film is then drawn
        between rollers where a continuous double layer of film 54 is
        drawn from the film making machine. In-line operations can then
        be made on the double layer of film 54. For example, two
        integument rolls 20a and 20b can be manufactured from the double
        layer of film 54. As the double layer of film 54 is drawn from
        the film making machine or roll 56, it may be drawn over a heat
        sealing roller 58 as shown in FIG. 5. Heat sealing roller 58
        includes raised portions 60 and 62 used to simultaneously form
        heat seal band 36 and heat seals 38 respectively on two
        continuous lengths 24a and 24b which, at this point, are joined
        at their upper edges 64. After passing over heat sealing roller
        58, the double layer of film 54 may pass over perforation
        rollers 66 which include projections 68 formed about their
        circumference. Projections 68 engage recesses formed in a mating
        rollers (not shown) which are positioned above perforation
        rollers 66. As the double layer of film 54 is passed between
        these rollers, bands 36, 46 and 48, best shown in FIG. 4, are
        all perforated. The double layer of film 54 is then cut into two
        separate continuous lengths 24a and 24b as the film 54 is passed
        through a stationary knife blade 72. The two lengths 24a and 24b
        are then wound on spools 26a and 26b. </p>
      <p>The polymeric material for cellules 30 is critical to providing
        the necessary environment for housing plant and animal life. In
        particular, it is important to achieve optimum gas exchange and
        light transmission to permit the necessary biochemical activity
        conducive to life. The material must readily pass oxygen and
        carbon dioxide between the ambient atmosphere and the cellule 30
        for use by the contained plant or animal life in their metabolic
        processes to preserve the organic material and the like in a
        living condition. Thus, the cellule 30 is made of a
        semi-permeable and translucent material which permits gas
        transfer therethrough. The preferred material for cellule 30 is
        a polyethylene film from 1.0 to 2.0 mils. thick. It is preferred
        that the material have thickness of 1.25 mils. If the membrane
        material is thinner than 1.0 mil, handling the cellule 30, and
        especially opening cellule 30, is made more difficult because
        the opposing sides 32, 34 of the material of cellule 30 tends to
        adhere to each other when formed in such thin films less than
        1.0 mil. Although a translucent low density polyethylene is
        suitable and even allows greater gas permeability, a high
        density polyethylene is preferred. The high density polyethylene
        can withstand greater extremes in temperature, such as is
        encountered in an autoclave, where a low density polyethylene
        may tend to melt, distend, or distort. Other polymeric materials
        may be used where the gas and water vapor transmission rates are
        comparable to that of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The gas transmission rates of the material for cellule 30 is of
        the utmost importance. For practicing the invention described
        herein, it is preferred that the membrane material have a
        permeability to CO.sub.2 of from 200 to 1190 cc/100 sq. in/24
        hours at 1 atm. and a permeability to O.sub.2 of from 100 to 400
        cc/100 sq. in/24 hours at 1 atm. Another important factor may be
        the moisture vapor transmission rate which is preferred from 0.2
        to 0.684 gm/100 sq. in/24 hours at 1 atm. The preferred high
        density polyethylene film exhibiting the above characteristics
        is high density polyethylene material no. HiD-9650 manufactured
        by Chevron Chemical Company of Orange, Texas. Upon sealing the
        cellule 30, the organic material is completely enveloped and
        enclosed from the ambient atmosphere and environment so as to
        prevent any introduction of contaminants and permit the
        necessary gas exchange between the organic material therein and
        the atmosphere of the ambient environment. The material of
        cellule 30 is also translucent to enable the organic material to
        receive the necessary light for life and growth. </p>
      <p>The published specifications for high density polyethylene
        HiD-9650 are melt index of 0.3 (gms/10 min); density 0.950
        (gms/cc); dart impact of 90 (gms/mil at 26 inches); tensile
        strength at break of 7400 (psi); elongation of 4 and 60%;
        Elmendorf tear md/td of 16/400 (gms/mil); and a moisture vapor
        transmission rate of 0.35 (gms/100 sq. in. 24 hr./mil). </p>
      <p><b>Tractor Feed Apparatus</b> </p>
      <p>The tractor feed apparatus 50 operates to transport the
        continuous length 24 of cellules 30 throughout and between each
        of the apparatus which comprises the automated system 10.
        Tractor feed mechanism 50 comprises a plurality of individual
        tractor feed belts, belt guide channels, supports, rollers and
        drive motors as described in more detail below. The description
        of one segment of the tractor feed apparatus will typify the
        remaining segments of the mechanism. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, there is shown one portion of
        the tractor feed apparatus 50. Depicted in FIG. 6 is a partial
        plan view of that portion of the tractor feed apparatus 50 which
        serves to draw the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 from roll
        20 mounted in the integument storage unit 28 and to transport
        the cellules 30 of integument roll 20 to the media fill
        apparatus 70 shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the
        tractor feed apparatus 50 generally comprises driver and
        receiver support plates 74, 76, studded drive belts 78,
        receiving belts 82, driver and receiver belt guide channels 84,
        86, drive and receiver rollers 88, 89 and tensioning rollers 94
        respectively. Belt guide channels 84, 86 are attached to support
        plates 74, 76 which are themselves anchored to a supporting
        base, not shown, attached or resting on the floor or suspended
        from the ceiling or other suitable support structure. It is
        preferred that guide channels 84, 86 be bolted to support plates
        74, 76. In this manner, the distance between upper guide
        channels 84a, 86a and lower guide channels 84b, 86b can readily
        be changed in the event that an integument roll 20 having a
        different dimension is later used. Studded drive belts 78 and
        receiving belts 82 are received by and travel within the
        recesses of driver and receiver belt guide channels 84, 86
        respectively. It is preferred that driver and receiver belts be
        made of Teflon. Motion is imparted to the belts 78, 82 by drive
        and receiver rollers 88, 89, shown in FIG. 6, located at the
        ends of driver and receiver guide channel 84, 86. As shown in
        FIG. 7, driver and receiver rollers 88, 89 extend through slots
        75 formed in support plates 74, 76. Referring to FIG. 6A, driver
        and receiver rollers 88, 89 include teeth 98 which mesh with
        indentations 102 on the inner surface 104 of drive and receiver
        belts 78, 82. The engagement of teeth 98 with indentations 102
        prevents slippage between rollers 88, 89 and belts 78, 82. Upper
        and lower drive rollers 88a, 88b are mounted on a driver shaft
        106 and upper and lower receiver rollers 89a, 89b are mounted on
        a receiver shaft 108. Shafts 106, 108 are rotatably supported by
        journal bearings 118 and are driven by a common motor 112
        through gears 107a, 107b. It should be appreciated that it may
        only be necessary to drive one of the shafts 106, 108 using one
        gear 107 driven by motor 112. Journal bearings 118 are mounted
        on belt guide channels 84, 86. </p>
      <p>As rollers 88, 89 are rotated clockwise and counterclockwise
        respectively, as viewed in FIG. 6 projections 114 on studded
        drive belts 78 mate with indentations 116 formed in receiving
        belts 82. The projections 114 and indentations 116 are
        positioned along the belts 78 and 82 so as to coincide with the
        dimensions between adjacent upper and lower tractor perforations
        44, 42 formed in continuous length 24 as shown in FIG. 3. Thus,
        the lower band 36 and the upper bands 46, 48 of length 24 are
        captured and attached between driver and receiver belts 78, 82.
        The guide channels 84, 86 extend between each apparatus in the
        automated system 10 as shown in FIG. 1 and thereby transport the
        length 24 throughout the system 10. Tensioning rollers 94 are
        positioned along guide channels 84, 86 to tension and guide the
        belts 78, 82. Although not shown, additional drive and receiver
        rollers 88, 89 are strategically positioned between apparatus
        located throughout the automated system 10 along guide channels
        84, 86 to propel the length 24 of cellules to each of the
        apparatus in the system 10. It should be appreciated that other
        means may be adapted for attaching the bands to a moving track
        for transporting the length 24 throughout the automated system
        10. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 7, continuous length 24 is transported by its
        upper and lower edges by a total of four belts: upper drive belt
        78a; upper receiving belt 82a; lower drive belt 78b; and lower
        receiving belt 82b. To ensure that the tractor feed apparatus 50
        functions properly and that continuous length 24 of cellules 30
        is not damaged from engagement with belts moving at a number of
        different velocities, it is important that drive rollers 88a,
        88b and receiver rollers 89a, 89b be driven at the identical
        velocity. As is evident, as rollers 88, 89 are rotated clockwise
        and counterclockwise respectively as shown in FIG. 6, the
        cellules 30 of continuous length 24 are transported along with
        the moving belts 78, 82 at a uniform velocity. It should be
        understood however that other continuous lengths 24 may be
        transported at a different uniform velocity depending upon its
        location in system 10. </p>
      <p><b>Media Preparation Unit 80</b> </p>
      <p>As shown schematically in FIG. 8, media preparation unit 80
        comprises mix tank 124, stirrer 126, stirrer motor 128, heater
        132, stock solution refrigeration unit 134, stock solution
        containers 136 and metering pumps 138. A plurality of stock
        solution containers 136 are refrigerated within refrigeration
        unit 134 and maintained at a temperature of approximately two
        degrees centigrade. The stock solution containers 136 each
        contain a separate ingredient or nutrient used in the
        preparation of the various media used in the micropropagation
        process. Each medium used in the process is mixed in a batch
        mode within the mix tank 124, which is preferably made of
        stainless steel. When a level switch 142 within mix tank 124
        signals controller 150 that another batch of media is required,
        controller 150 will signal appropriate metering pumps 138, which
        are in fluid communication with fill lines 144, to inject a
        programmed amount of stock solution through individual fill
        lines 144 extending into mix tank 124. It is preferred that
        metering pump 138 be a parastolic pump such as Model No. 2P3O4
        manufactured by the Mec-O-Matic Co. Such pumps are reliable and
        extremely accurate. Controller 150 also actuates solenoid valve
        133 in sterile water line 143 allowing the appropriate amount of
        sterile water to flow into mix tank 124. </p>
      <p>Once the appropriate stock solutions and sterile water have
        been injected into the mix tank 124, the ingredients are heated
        by heater 132 while the solution is stirred by stirrer 126.
        Stirrer 126 includes an impeller 146 mounted on the end of a
        shaft 148 which is connected to and rotated by stirrer motor
        128. Both heater 132 and stirrer motor 128 are actuated by
        controller 150. The media is stirred and heated to a temperature
        of approximately 100.degree. C. in order to melt the agar or
        other gelling agent which is used in the particular growth
        medium being prepared. Optionally, the media may be supplemented
        with nutrients and plant growth regulators. Once the growth
        medium is prepared, heater 132 and stirrer 124 are turned off
        and the growth medium is then ready for injection into cellules
        30. </p>
      <p>Unused media and liquids used to clean and rinse mix tank 124
        may be drained from mix tank 124 through drain 141 and pumped to
        a disposal tank (not shown). </p>
      <p><b>Media Fill Station 70</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 8, 9 and 10, the media fill station 70
        comprises fill lines 152, parastolic fill pumps 154, injection
        nozzles 156, nozzle transport rack 158 and filling guide 162. In
        general, measured amounts of growth medium from media
        preparation unit 80 are simultaneously injected into a plurality
        of cellules 30 of continuous length 24 by media fill apparatus
        70 as shown in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>Five fill lines 152 are in fluid communication with mix tank
        124 as shown in FIG. 8 and are comprised of a flexible plastic
        tubing having an internal diameter of approximately 5/8 inches.
        Injection nozzles 156 are connected to the ends of fill lines
        152 and are positioned above filling guide 162 on nozzle
        transport rack 158. Nozzles 156 are tapered and sized to be
        inserted between upper bands 46, 48 of cellules 30 for entry
        through entry port 52 into the chamber of cellule 30. Filling
        guide 162 is supported by support arms 164. As can be seen in
        FIG. 9, the leading and trailing edges of filling guide 162 are
        formed with wedge-shaped ends 166 to separate bands 46, 48 of
        cellules 30. In response to a signal from controller 150 after
        the unfilled cellules 30 have been positioned below filling
        guide 162, pneumatic cylinders 172 actuate and lower pistons
        174, thereby lowering nozzles 156 into position for filling
        cellules 30 with growth medium 92. An individual parastolic fill
        pump 154 is dedicated to each fill line 152 and, like metering
        pump 138 described above, may be Mec-O-Matic Model No. 2P3O4.
        Upon receipt of a signal from controller 150, fill pump 154 will
        pump a predetermined measure of mixed growth medium 92 from mix
        tank 124 through fill lines 152, injection nozzle 156 and into
        cellules 30. </p>
      <p>In operation, the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 is drawn
        by tractor feed apparatus 50 to a media fill station 70 where
        the upper bands 46, 48 of cellules 30 are separated by filling
        guide 162 as continuous length 24 is drawn by tractor feed
        apparatus 50 beneath nozzle transport rack 158. Controller 150
        actuates drive motors 112 positioned along the tractor feed
        apparatus 50, as previously described and shown in FIGS. 6 and
        7, in timed intervals such that five cellules 30 are positioned
        and remain stationary underneath filling guide 162 for
        approximately three seconds while growth medium 92 is injected
        into the cellules 30. Once in position, controller 150 signals
        the pair of pneumatic cylinders 172 to lower nozzle transport
        rack 158 and injection nozzles 156. In this manner, nozzles 156
        are lowered into the filling guide 162. Controller 150 then
        signals the parastolic fill pumps 154 to inject the appropriate
        measure of media 92 into each of the five cellules 30.
        Controller 150 then actuates the pneumatic cylinders 172 to
        raise injection nozzles 156 back into position shown in FIG. 9
        above filling guide 162 and then signals drive motors 112
        operating tractor feed apparatus 50 to transport five new
        unfilled cellules 30 into position underneath rack 158 for
        filling with growth media. </p>
      <p>After a cellule 30 has been filled with media and passed
        through the media fill station, the cellule may be marked with a
        bar code by a bar code printing system 93, such as a "Digimark"
        variable information laser marker manufactured by Videojet
        Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill. The
        cellules may include a solid ink mark, portions of which are
        vaporized by the laser printer of the bar code printing system
        93 to indicate the type of media in the cellule. Other indicia
        may also be coded on the cellule. </p>
      <p><b>Fill Check Scanner 90</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 11, fill check scanner 90 is used to
        determine whether the cellules 30 have been injected with the
        appropriate measure of growth medium 92. Fill check scanner 90
        generally comprises enclosure 176, light source 178, polarized
        panel 180 and photo receptor panel 182. As shown in FIG. 11,
        tractor feed apparatus 50, upon input from controller 150, draws
        continuous length 24 through the interior of enclosure 176 so as
        to transport the media-filled cellules 30 into the enclosure 176
        for scanning. As described above with respect to the media
        filling station 70, the cooperation of controller 150, with the
        drive motors 112 of the tractor feed apparatus 50 (FIGS. 6 and
        7), will transport cellules 30 for scanning in groups of five.
        Positioned on one side of enclosure 176 is a light source 178
        which may be, for example, quartz-halogen. Polarized panel 180
        is affixed within enclosure 176 as shown in FIG. 11 and divides
        the interior of the enclosure into two compartments. Polarized
        panel 180 is selected so that light waves passing in a direction
        perpendicular to the panel 180 will be passed through the
        polarized panel 180; however, light rays traveling in other
        directions will not pass through polarized panel 180. </p>
      <p>Light waves which pass through polarized panel 180 will
        continue through the cellules 30 of continuous length 24 and
        will contact photoreceptor panel 182 on the opposite side of the
        enclosure 176. Photoreceptor panel 182 comprises a surface
        containing hundreds of photosensitive cells (not shown). Light
        waves will pass through the membranes 32 and 34 of cellules 30
        and activate the photosensitive cells on photoreceptor panel
        182. Light waves penetrating the areas of the cellules 30 filled
        with growth media 92 will be defracted to a greater degree than
        those which pass through the portion of cellule 30 containing no
        media. Accordingly, the light intensity sensed by the portion of
        photoreceptor panel 182 which is directly behind the
        media-filled portions of the cellules 30 will be less than the
        intensity sensed by remaining portions of panel 182. The
        photosensitive cells on photoreceptor panel 182 are electrically
        connected to the controller 150 by a plurality of signal wires
        184. In this manner, it can be determined which cellules 30 have
        been filled and whether they have been filled with the
        appropriate volume of growth medium 92. </p>
      <p>An alternative embodiment of fill check scanner 90 is the
        "Smarteye" photoelectric sensor manufactured by the Tri-Tronics
        Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla. The "Smarteye" photoelectric sensor
        can sense size, texture, distance, opacity, depth and color so
        as to have the capability of determining whether an appropriate
        measure of growth media 92 has been injected into a particular
        cellule. </p>
      <p>Upon fill check scanner 90 identifying a cellule which has an
        inadequate amount of media, the inadequate cellule is marked by
        an ink jet printer such as the "Excel" small character ink jet
        printer 91 manufactured by Videojet Systems International, Inc.
        of Elk Grove Village, Ill. A print registration scanner 95, such
        as the "Smarteye" color mark registration scanner manufactured
        by Tri-Tronics Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla., will subsequently
        identify the inadequate cellule by scanning for the ink mark
        prior to the insertion of plant material in tissue planting unit
        290. The print registration scanner 95 will send a signal to
        controller 150 which will in turn cause the tractor feed
        apparatus 50 to pass the inadequate cellule through the tissue
        planting unit without inserting any plant tissue. </p>
      <p><b>Sterilization Unit 100</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, there is shown sterilization
        unit 100 generally comprising an autoclave 186 used to sterilize
        the media-filled cellules 30 before the cellules 30 are invested
        with tissue. The autoclave 186 comprises a generally cylindrical
        enclosure 188 mounted on a support structure 190. The enclosure
        188 comprises a pressure chamber 192 and a closure 194 coaxially
        aligned and attached by four pneumatic cylinders 196 used to
        open and close the closure 194. The pressure chamber 192 has
        attached to its interior entrance an inner lip 198 which extends
        around the entire periphery of the interior entrance of the
        pressure chamber 192 and serves to guide the closure 194 during
        the closing of the autoclave 186 by pneumatic cylinders 196. Lip
        198 also serves to protect an O-ring seal (not shown) from the
        gases and extreme heat generated during the sterilization
        procedure. Pressure chamber 192, closure 194 and inner lip 198
        are all manufactured from stainless steel, have an inner jacket
        of monel and have a total thickness of less than 1/2 inch. </p>
      <p>In operation, the leading end of continuous length 24 is passed
        through a cutter 202 mounted on the side of autoclave 186 and in
        cooperation with the tractor feed apparatus 50. The cutter 202
        acts as a guide for the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 as
        the cellules 30 are disposed within the autoclave 186. Cutter
        202 also includes a blade 204 which is activated by controller
        150 after the autoclave 186 has been filled with a strip 200 of
        cellules 30, strip 200 having a length of as much as several
        hundred feet and comprising many thousands of cellules 30.
        Referring to FIGS. 13, 14, and 15, integument strip 200 is
        automatically loaded into the autoclave 186 for sterilization by
        internal loader/unloader apparatus 210 which operates
        identically to the tractor feed apparatus 50 previously
        described. As described in greater detail below, the internal
        loader/unloader apparatus 210 supports and transports the
        integument strip 200 by use of a series of drive belts which
        cooperatively engage upper apertures 44, 42 formed in the upper
        bands 46, 48 and lower band 36 of integument strip 200. The
        drive belts are supported in a multi-level serpentine
        configuration within the autoclave 186 so as to achieve the
        greatest density of cellules 30 as possible. </p>
      <p>There is shown in FIG. 13 a section view of the autoclave 186
        which schematically illustrates the path of integument strip 200
        as it is loaded in serpentine fashion into the autoclave 186.
        FIGS. 14 and 15 depict how the integument strip 200 is supported
        and transported within autoclave 186. Referring now to FIGS. 14
        and 15, perforated support plates 214 are rigidly attached to
        the upper interior surface of pressure chamber 192. Support
        plates 214 are perforated so as to enable steam to penetrate
        throughout enclosure 188. Attached to the perforated plates 214
        are belt guide channels 216. Retained within belt guides
        channels 216 are the drive belts including studded drive belt
        218 and receiving belt 220. As described previously with respect
        to the tractor feed apparatus 50, the projections 222 on studded
        drive belt 218 and the indentations 224 on receiving belt 220
        are spaced apart on belts 218 and 220 at a distance equal to the
        the distance between adjacent apertures 42, 44 in the upper
        bands 46, 48 and lower band 36 on integument strip 200. Still
        referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, it should be understood that a
        total of four belts are employed in the internal loader/unloader
        apparatus 210: upper studded drive belt 218a; lower studded
        drive belt 218b; upper receiving belt 220a; and lower receiving
        belt 220b. Belts 218a, 218b, 220a and 220b serpentine through
        pressure chamber 192, changing levels within the chamber 192 as
        dictated by the belt guide channels 216 which are inclined as
        the path nears an end of pressure chamber 192. </p>
      <p>In operation, tractor feed apparatus 50 transports the leading
        end of integument strip 200 into and through the guide of cutter
        202 attached near the entrance of pressure chamber 192 of
        autoclave 186. An external drive motor 226 has a sealed drive
        shaft 228a extending into pressure chamber 192 and serves to
        actuate rollers 232, 233 by means of gears 230a, 230b and
        receiver shaft 228b which are supported within pressure chamber
        192 and form a portion of the internal loader/unloader apparatus
        210 for driving the belts 218, 220. The rollers 232 and 233, in
        turn, actuate and rotate drive belts 218 and 220 as previously
        shown and described with reference to the tractor feed apparatus
        50. The external drive motor 226 will turn rollers 232, 233 and
        thus transport belts 218, 220 at the same speed that tractor
        feed apparatus 50 transports integument strip 200 into the guide
        of cutter 202. Integument strip 200 will thus be loaded in
        serpentine fashion into the autoclave 186. When the autoclave
        186 is loaded with integuments 22, the cutter knife 204 is
        actuated by controller 150 to cut the strip 200 from the
        continuous length 24. After the trailing edge of integument
        strip 200 is loaded, controller 150 will stop the external drive
        motor 226. It will then actuate the pneumatic cylinders 196 to
        close the closure 194 of autoclave 186 and initiate the
        sterilization process. The sterilization process is accomplished
        through conventional means such as a steam generator 234. Water
        inlet valves 236 and drain valves 238 are also provided as shown
        in FIG. 14. Upon completion of the sterilization process, the
        external drive motor 226 is again actuated to unload the
        sterilized integument strip 200 from the autoclave 186 while
        simultaneously loading a new unsterilized integument strip as
        just described. </p>
      <p>Because the sterilization unit 100 is a batch operation, the
        preceding operations at the media fill station 70 and fill check
        scanner 90 must be halted until the sterilization unit 100 is
        emptied to receive a new batch of cellules 30. Means can be
        provided to permit a continuous operation such as by rolling the
        length 24 of cellules 30 passing from fill check scanner 90 onto
        a spool or supporting the length 24 on an elongated tractor feed
        track until the sterilization unit 100 is ready to accept a new
        batch of cellules 30. A cutter, such as cutter 202, would be
        used to cut a length of cellules 30 for later insertion into
        sterilization unit 100. Such means would permit the continuous
        filling of cellules 30 with media 92. </p>
      <p>An alternative to the sterilization unit 100 includes the use
        of a presterilized length 24 of cellules 30 and filter
        sterilized media 92. Using presterilized cellules and filter
        sterilized media eliminates the need for a sterlilization unit
        100 in the automated system 10. The elimination of the
        sterilization unit 100 permits a continuous operation from the
        fill scanner unit 90 to the cooling and storage unit 110. A
        presterilized length 24 of cellules 30 may be produced since the
        membrane for the cellules is aseptic at the time of manufacture.
        The integuments 22 would then be produced as previously
        described under aseptic conditions. The filter sterilized media
        would be prepared and sterilized by an inline filtration
        process. </p>
      <p><b>Cooling and Storage Unit 110</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 16A, there is depicted the
        cooling and storage unit 110 which generally comprises cooling
        chamber 240, an air filter assembly 242, and cooling system 244.
        Air filter assembly 242 includes a filter housing 246, a
        prefilter 248, a blower motor 250 driving to a squirrel cage
        blower assembly 252, a flume 254 and a hepafilter 256. Air
        filter assembly 242 is attached to and supported by the upper
        surface 258 of the cooling chamber 240. Filter housing 246
        includes an air intake aperture 262 which is covered by
        prefilter 248 and attached to the housing 246. Prefilter 248
        filters dust and other large airborne particles and prevents
        them from being drawn into the air filter assembly 242. Mounted
        within air filter housing 246 is the squirrel cage blower
        assembly 252 which is driven by a blower motor 250 mounted
        externally to the cooling chamber 240. Blower assembly 252 draws
        air from the ambient atmosphere through the prefilter 248 and
        injects the air through flume 254 into the hepafilter 256 which
        covers the aperture 264 formed in the upper surface 258 of the
        cooling chamber 240. The hepafilter 256 removes 99.97% of all
        pollutants and airborne contaminates from the air injected into
        the cooling chamber 240. </p>
      <p>Cooling system 244 includes cooling coils 266 which are
        supported near the top of cooling chamber 240 on a perforated
        support plate 268 which is affixed to the sidewalls and endwalls
        of the chamber 240 so as to be parallel with the upper surface
        258 of the chamber 240. Through conventional means, coolant is
        circulated through the cooling coils 266 so as to maintain a
        constant temperature within the cooling chamber 240 of five
        degrees centigrade. </p>
      <p>The air drawn into the cooling chamber 240 is vented through
        the entry port 272 and exit port 274 for integument strip 200. A
        positive pressure of 1.1 atmospheres is maintained within the
        cooling chamber 240. The continuous flow of filtered air through
        entry and exit ports 272 and 274 resulting from the positive air
        pressure within cooling chamber 240 prevents contaminants, such
        as air-borne microorganisms, from entering the cooling chamber
        240 and contaminating the previously sterilized media. As shown
        in FIG. 16, cooling chamber 240 includes a housing extension 270
        having a front face 273 in which entry port 272 is formed.
        Housing extension 270 extends from cooling chamber 240 to a
        position in close proximity to sterilization unit 100 so as to
        minimize the distance travelled by the sterilized cellules 30
        before they enter the cooling and storage unit 110. After
        leaving sterilization unit 100 and before entering cooling and
        storage unit 110, the sterilized cellules 30 are exposed to the
        unfiltered air of the ambient environment. However, after
        undergoing the heat sterilization process, the heat radiating
        from the sterilized cellules 30 creates air currents which,
        along with gases generated by the hot media, combine to drive
        away air-borne microorganisms which might otherwise contaminate
        the media 92 or the surfaces of cellules 30 before they enter
        the sterile environment of cooling and storage unit 110. </p>
      <p>The tractor feed apparatus 50, previously described, is
        supported within the cooling chamber 240 and extends outside the
        enclosure through entry and exit ports 272, 274. Because the
        extremely high temperatures present in the sterilization unit
        100 are not present in the cooling and storage unit 110, tractor
        feed apparatus drive motors 112 may be located within the
        cooling chamber 240; however, to allow as many cellules 30 as
        possible to be contained within the cooling chamber 240, it is
        preferred that tractor feed drive motors 112 be mounted outside
        cooling chamber 240. As previously described with reference to
        the sterilization unit 100, integument strip 200 is supported in
        serpentine arrangement within cooling chamber 240 by a series of
        perforated support plates 276. In cooling chamber 240, the
        perforated support plates 276 are rigidly attached
        perpendicularly to the coil support plate 268. These support
        plates 276 in turn support the guide belt channels 216 and drive
        belts 218 and 220 in a multi-level serpentine fashion as
        described above and illustrated in FIGS. 14-15 with regard to
        the sterilization unit 100. In operation, the leading edge of
        integument strip 200 is inserted into entry port 272 to the
        cooling chamber 240 and is loaded therein in serpentine fashion.
        The sterilized cellules 30 are stored in cooling chamber 240
        until the media 92 and cellules 30 are cooled. Then, as
        required, the sterile media 92 and cellules 30 of integument
        strip 200 are drawn into the tissue manipulation unit 120
        described below. The sterilization unit 100 can sterilize one
        integument strip 200 at a time. However, it is desirable that
        cooling and storage unit 110 have the capacity to cool and store
        a plurality of such integument strips 200 simultaneously and to
        house the sterile cellules 30 until needed. </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Manipulation Unit 120</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, the tissue manipulation unit 120
        generally houses a cellule cutting unit 280, a tissue planting
        unit 290, a sealing unit 310 and a surface sterilization unit
        320. In the tissue manipulation unit 120, the sterilized
        cellules 30 with growth media 92 from the cooling and storage
        unit 110 are invested with a tissue sample 122. The tissue
        sample may be meristematic tissue from a stock or parent plant
        or more often is tissue from either a stage 1 initial culture or
        a stage 2 multiplication culture grown in cellules of a previous
        integument strip 300 transported from the culture room 130. The
        tissue planting unit 290 will ordinarily receive plant material
        for investing in media-filled cellules from cellules previously
        housed in the culture room 130 and opened by cutting unit 280.
        However, seeds or meristematic tissue may be manually fed into
        tissue planting unit 290 for inserting into the media-filled
        cellules. As depicted in schematic form in FIG. 1 and for
        purposes of the description below, it is assumed that the
        cellules of sterilized integument strip 200, previously
        described, are to be filled with plant tissue that has
        previously been grown in culture room 130 in an integument strip
        300 comprising a plurality of cellules 30 containing growing
        tissue 122. Integument strip 300 is transported from the culture
        room 130 into the tissue manipulation unit 120 where the
        cellules 30 with tissue 122 first undergo surface sterilization
        in surface sterilization unit 320. The sterilized cellules 30
        with tissue are then opened by cellule cutting unit 280 and the
        growing tissue 122 contained therein is removed and cut into
        smaller tissue samples which are then inserted into unused and
        sterilized cellules 30 of integument strip 200 in the tissue
        planting unit 290. The newly planted cellules are then sealed by
        sealing unit 310, are coded with a bar code by bar coding means
        311 and transported back to culture room 130. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIG. 1, the tissue manipulation unit 120
        includes a box-like enclosure 282 having an air filter assembly
        like the one described above with regard to the cooling and
        storage unit 110. The air filter assembly filters the air that
        is used to pressurize the enclosure 282, such pressurization
        precluding the entrance of airborne contaminates such as
        microorganisms which could contaminate the cultures 122 during
        any of the tissue manipulations which take place within the
        tissue manipulation unit 120. A positive pressure of
        approximately 1.1 atmospheres is maintained in enclosure 282. An
        entrance port 282a to the tissue manipulation enclosure 282 is
        formed in one end and is sealingly attached to the exit port of
        the cooling and storage unit 110 so that no airborne
        contaminants can enter the enclosure 282. In this manner,
        cellules 30 making up integument strip 200 transported from the
        cooling and storage unit 110 pass directly into the tissue
        manipulation unit 120 and are continuously exposed to filtered
        air. Air is exhausted from enclosure 282 through the entry and
        exit ports 282a, b for integument strip 200 and entry and exit
        ports 282c, d for integument strip 300. </p>
      <p>Tractor feed apparatus 50 extends into and through enclosure
        282 so as to transport sterile integument strip 200 from the
        cooling and storage unit 110 into the tissue manipulation unit
        120 and to transport to integument strip 200 to culture room 130
        once tissue samples 122 have been placed in the cellules 30 from
        tissue-filled integument strip 300 and once the cellules have
        been sealed. Tractor feed apparatus 50 is also employed to
        transport integument strips 300 containing sealed cellules with
        growing tissue therein from the culture room 130 to the tissue
        manipulation unit 120, and to discharge used integument strips
        300 from enclosure 282 to disposal unit 170 after tissue samples
        122 have been removed from the cellules 30. </p>
      <p><b>Surface Sterilization Unit 320</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18, after being transported from
        the culture room 130 to the tissue manipulation unit 120,
        cellules 30 of integument strip 300 containing living plant
        tissue 122 first enter the surface sterilization unit 320.
        Surface sterilization unit 320 includes an enclosure 284 which
        is divided into three compartments 286, 287, 288 that are
        separated by flap-like closures 292a, 292b, 292c, 292d. Closures
        292 span the entire cross-section of enclosure 284 and serve to
        prevent solution from being sprayed or splashed out of the
        compartments 286, 287, 288. Enclosure 284 is preferably made of
        acrylic plastic, such as plexiglass, approximately 1/2 inch
        thick. As depicted in FIGS. 17 and 18, tractor feed apparatus 50
        transports cellules 30 in integument strip 300 containing the
        living tissue 122 through slit formed in closure 292a and
        between a pair of sterilization spray bars 294 which are
        attached to lower support plate 296 which serves as part of
        enclosure 284. Sterilization spray bars 294 comprise plastic
        tubing approximately 1/2 inch in diameter having perforations
        298 in the sides. The lower ends of the spray bars 294 are
        connected to flexible tubing 302 through which a sterilizing
        solution of sodium hypochloride is pumped by pump 304 from a
        storage tank 306. As the cellules 30 pass between the spray bar
        294, the sterilization solution is sprayed on the outside
        surfaces of the cellules 30 through open windows formed in
        support plates 74, 76. The sprayed solution then runs down the
        sides of the cellules 30 and is collected in drain basin 308 in
        fluid communication with holding tank 312 via drain line 314. </p>
      <p>After undergoing the surface sterilization in compartment 286,
        the cellules 30 are then drawn through a slit formed in closure
        292b and into an identical compartment 287 where they pass
        between a second set of spray bars 318 which are connected to a
        source 322 of sterilized water. The sterilized water is sprayed
        on the cellules 30 by pump 323 through open windows in support
        plates 74, 76 to wash away remaining sterilization solution. The
        resulting fluid is then collected in a second drain basin 324
        where it is drained via drain 326 to a second holding tank 328.
      </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18A, the sterilized and washed
        cellules 30 of integument strip 300 then pass through a slit
        formed in closure 292c and are drawn into a drying chamber 330
        in compartment 288. Filtered air within tissue manipulation unit
        120 is blown down and over the surface of cellules 30 by
        squirrel cage blowers 331. The air is funneled over the surface
        of cellules 30 by unperforated plates 332a, 332b. Solution which
        drips off the surface of cellules 30 is collected in basin 324
        and drained to holding tank 328 via drain line 315. Once the
        cellules 30 have been sterilized and dried, they are transported
        through slit formed in closure 292d and into cutting unit 280 as
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 19. </p>
      <p><b>Cutting Unit 280</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 19, once in the cutting unit 280,
        the lower edge of integument strip 300 is drawn across
        stationary cutting blade 334, best shown in FIG. 20A, which cuts
        open the bottom of the cellules 30 just above lower heat seal
        band 36. Cutting blade 334 will be heated to destroy any
        contamination which may be deposited on blade 334 due to a
        contaminated plant in a cut open cellule. Lower heat seal band
        36 and the attached lower portion of the cellules 30 is then
        transported out of the manipulation unit enclosure 282 by the
        lower drive and receiving belts 218b, 220b of the tractor feed
        apparatus 50 shown in FIG. 15 for disposal in disposal unit 170.
        The now open cellules 30 are next transported into the tissue
        planting unit 290. </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Planting Unit 290</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 19, 20A, and 21 tissue planting unit 290
        generally includes a compartmentalized and rotatable tissue
        containment device 336, a water injection means 338 and
        pneumatic clamps 340. </p>
      <p>Water and/or air injection means 338 is employed to pierce the
        closed end of a cellule 30 whose other end has been opened by
        cutting unit 280 and inject water such that the water pressure
        and the force of gravity causes the tissue sample 122 contained
        therein to pass out the bottom of the open cellule 30 into the
        tissue containment device 336. The water injection means 338
        comprises a hypodermic-like needle 342 in fluid connection with
        a sterile water source 344 and a pumping means 346. Best shown
        in FIGS. 19 and 21, upon receipt of the appropriate signal from
        the controller 150, a pneumatic clamp 340 closes and clamps an
        open cellule 30 along heat seals 38 so as to maintain the
        cellule's position directly above the tissue containment device
        336. Controller 150 next signals water injection means 338 such
        that needle 342 is pneumatically lowered by cylinder 350 so as
        to pierce the top of the opened cellule 30 as shown in FIGS. 19
        and 20A. The pumping means 346 is then actuated and a stream of
        sterile water is injected into the top of open cellule 30. As
        shown in FIG. 21, the injected water and gravity cooperate to
        deposit the tissue sample 122 in one of the compartments 352 of
        the tissue containment device 336 directly below the bottom of
        opened cellule 30. It should be understood that pressurized air
        may be used in place of the sterilized water. Once the cellule's
        tissue sample 122 has been deposited in the tissue containment
        device 336, the used cellules are transported out of the tissue
        manipulation system enclosure 282 by the upper drive and
        receiving belts 218a, 220a of the tractor feed apparatus 50 for
        disposal in disposal unit 170 as shown in FIG. 19. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 20A and 21, the compartmentalized and
        rotatable tissue containment device 336 comprises a rotatable
        inner hub 354 mounted on drive shaft 356 which is driven by a
        stepping motor (not shown). Rotatable hub 354 includes a
        plurality of flat bottom plates 355 disposed around the
        circumference of the hub and forming a multi-sided polygon. On
        each side of hub 354 are multi-sided polygon shaped end plates
        363 which extend from shaft 356 to bottom plates 355. Shaft 356
        passes through, but is not attached to, the circular end plates
        358 and side plates 360. Identically dimensional rectangular
        windows 362 are formed in end plates 358 and side plates 360 and
        are coaxially aligned with push rod 376 and extraction member
        378 as described below. Radiating from and attached to rotatable
        hub 354 are a plurality of pairs of flat spokes or divider
        plates 364. Each pair of spokes 364 is attached at its inner end
        to a bottom plate 355 of hub 354 thereby forming a compartment
        352. The outer end is open to provide the opening to compartment
        352. Arcuate rim segments 366 connect the outer ends of adjacent
        spokes 364, but do not extend over the openings to compartments
        352. Bracing members 367 may be used to span the entrances to
        compartments 352 and provide rigidity to the containment device
        336. In this configuration, tissue containment device 336
        comprises a compartmentalized, carousel-like, device having a
        plurality of compartments 352 defined by outer surfaces or
        bottom plates 355 of hub 354, inner surfaces of flat spokes 364,
        and the inner surfaces of stationary end plates 358. The number
        and size of compartments 352 may be varied by changing the
        diameter and width of tissue containment device 336. </p>
      <p>The outer surface 355 of hub 354, which forms the bottom of
        compartments 352, is provided with perforations 370a to allow
        the water and less viscus media 92, which were deposited along
        with plant tissue 122 by water injection means 338, to drain
        from compartments 352 and into hub 354. Such fluids may also
        drain from compartments 352 by seaping between stationary end
        plates 358 and the edges of flat spokes 364 adjacent thereto.
        Perforations 370b are also formed in side walls 357 of hub 354
        to allow collected liquids to drain therethrough and to seap
        between hub 354 and end plates 358. Such liquids may also drain
        from hub 354 through perforations 370a of the lower, empty,
        compartments 352. All such liquids drain basin 368 where they
        then drain to disposal tank 372 shown in FIG. 21. </p>
      <p>After a cellule 30 is opened and tissue sample 122 is deposited
        in a compartment 352 of the tissue containment device 336, the
        controller 150 actuates the stepping motor to turn tissue
        containment device 336 a preset number of degrees and to
        activate the tractor feed apparatus 50 moving the integument
        strip 300 forward, so as to bring a newly opened cellule 30
        directly above the next empty compartment 352 in the tissue
        containment device 336. In this step-like manner, a compartment
        352 containing a tissue sample 122 is positioned between the
        aligned windows 362 in the circular end plates 358 and side
        plates 360. Once so positioned, the tissue sample 122 may then
        be removed from the compartment 352 and cut into a plurality of
        tissue samples by the cutting mechanism 371 as hereinafter
        described. </p>
      <p><b>Cutting Mechanism 371</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 20A, the cutting mechanism 371 comprises
        pneumatic cylinders 374, 384, pushrods 376, 382, extraction
        member 378, and cutting blade 380. Extraction member 378 is a
        rectangular-shaped block of stainless steel having a cross
        section identical in shape to the cross section of a compartment
        352 of tissue containment device 336 and rectangular windows 362
        in end plates 358 and side plates 360. Member 378 is attached to
        pushrod 376 and is actuated by pneumatic cylinder 374.
        Extraction member 378 reciprocates in a cutting channel 379
        having a cross-section which slidingly receives extraction
        member 378. The cutting channel 379 extends through windows 362
        in end plate 358a and side plate 360a, one of the compartments
        352, windows 362 in end plate 358b and side plate 360b, and
        exits into planting conduit 398. Cutting blade 380 is sideably
        disposed within a blade guide 381 at the exit of cutting channel
        379 and is attached to pushrod 382 which is actuated by
        pneumatic cylinder 384. </p>
      <p>When tissue sample 122 in compartment 352 is to be multiplied
        into a plurality of new samples, controller 150 will actuate
        cylinder 374 and pushrod 376 so that extraction member 378 is
        extended through cutting channel 379 and the compartment 352 in
        tissue containment device 336 which is then aligned between
        windows 362 in end plates and side plates 358, 360. As pushrod
        376 is further extended as shown in FIG. 20B, extraction member
        378 pushes the tissue sample 122 out of compartment 352 until a
        portion of the tissue sample 122 extends through the exit of
        cutting channel 379 beneath cutting blade 380 in blade guide
        381. Pushrod 382 connected to cutting blade 380 is then actuated
        by pneumatic cylinder 384 so that cutting blade 380 is propelled
        downward and severs a portion of the tissue sample 122, the
        severed portion then resting on working surface 388 within
        planting conduit 398. Referring now to FIG. 21B, with cutting
        blade 380 still in its lowered position, stuffing mechanism 390
        is actuated by controller 150, stuffing mechanism 390 including
        pushrod 392, pneumatic cylinder 394 and stuffing member 396.
        Stuffing member 396 reciprocates in a planting conduit 398
        having a cross-section which slidingly receives stuffing member
        396. Planting conduit 398 extends past the exit of cutting
        channel 379 to the open end of cellules 30 at fill gate device
        400. Pushrod 392, actuated by pneumatic cylinder 394, is
        extended so that stuffing member 396, which is slideably engaged
        with working surface 388, pushes the severed tissue sample 122
        through planting conduit 398 and into a sterile media-filled
        cellule 30. As shown in FIGS. 19 and 21A, a fill gate device 400
        such as that described previously with respect to the media fill
        station 70 is attached to the end of planting conduit 398 so as
        to separate the opposing membrane surfaces 46, 48 of integument
        strip 200 and thereby facilitate investment of the cellule 30
        with the severed tissue sample 122. As the sterilized integument
        strip 200 is transported from the cooling and storage unit 110
        into the tissue planting unit 290, integument strip 200 is
        rotated 90.degree. from its previous upright position so that
        the cellules 30 in integument strip 200 can be invested with a
        tissue sample 122 through fill guide 400. </p>
      <p>The process described above is employed to multiply tissue
        cultures already growing in cellules 30 of integument strip 300.
        When first beginning the micropropagation process, before
        initial cultures have been established in cellules 30 of
        integument strip 300, it is necessary to establish initial
        cultures for later multiplication. This is accomplished by
        manually inserting samples of meristimatic tissue from a
        selected parent plant or cultivar into the tissue planting unit
        290, investing the tissue samples in cellules 30 of integument
        strip 200, sealing the cellules and transporting them to culture
        room 310. Accordingly, forming a part of the enclosure 282 of
        tissue manipulation unit 120 is a normally-sealed access door
        281, as shown in FIGS. 20 and 21. When initiating the
        micropropagation process, an operator opens access door 281 and
        deposits a sample of meristimatic tissue within each compartment
        352 of tissue containment device 336 as it rotates in the
        counter-clockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 21. When a
        compartment containing a manually-inserted tissue sample becomes
        aligned with windows 362 formed in end and side plates 358, 360,
        the sample is invested in cellules 30 of integument strip 200 in
        the same manner as described above. Alternatively, access door
        281 may be enlarged or repositioned, or another access door may
        be provided in enclosure 282, so as to allow an operator to
        directly invest tissue into cellules 30 of integument strip 200
        prior to the cellules being sealed by sealing unit 310, without
        employing tissue planting unit 290. During this manual
        operation, the operator will have manual control of the tissue
        manipulation unit 120. </p>
      <p><b>Sealing Unit 310</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 19, once the severed tissue
        sample 122 has been invested into the sterile cellule 30, the
        cellule 30 is drawn into sealing unit 310 comprising a pair of
        roller heat sealers 404, thereby completely sealing the new
        culture from the exterior environment. Once sealed, the cellules
        30 are bar coded by a bar code printing system 311 such as the
        Digimark variable information laser marker manufactured by
        Videojet Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill.
        The bar code indicates the type of plant material in the cellule
        and the date the plant was invested in the cellule. The cellules
        are then transported into the culture room 130. </p>
      <p><b>Culture Room 130</b> </p>
      <p>The culture room 130 comprises a room or other enclosure
        containing the tractor feed mechanism 50, a temperature control
        system 404, and a lighting system 406. As described previously,
        the tractor feed mechanism 50 will transport the integument
        strips 200 in a multilevel serpentine fashion within the
        enclosure 130. In this system, it is not necessary that the air
        be filtered since the cultures have been sealed from the ambient
        environment by sealing unit 310 in the tissue manipulation unit
        120 after planting. It is preferred that the tractor feed system
        50 be supported by a gridwork of support brackets and channels
        rather than by the perforated support plates previously
        described with respect to the sterilization and cooling units
        100, 110 since, in this application, it is important that the
        light waves generated by the lighting system are transmitted and
        reflected throughout the entirety of the enclosure 130. The
        previously described perforated support plates block too much of
        the light. As shown in FIG. 22, between each serpentined row of
        integuments, there is a bank of fluorescent lights 408 selected
        and positioned so as to maintain approximately 1,000
        foot-candles of light throughout the unit 130. It is preferable
        that the system allow the light intensity to be varied as the
        cultures are transported throughout the unit 130 such that when
        desirable to cease multiplication and grow finished plantlets at
        the completion of the growth period in the culture unit 130, the
        light intensity can be increased to approximately 3,000
        foot-candles so as to harden the plant and ready it for shipment
        to the commercial grower for planting in a soil medium in the
        greenhouse. To enhance light transmission within culture room
        130, the walls, ceiling and floor are covered with a highly
        reflective surface 410 such as a mirrored acrylic sheet. </p>
      <p>As depicted in FIG. 1, individual lengths of plant-filled
        cellules are periodically scanned in the culture room 130 by a
        growth detection scanner 140 which detects the growth of the
        plant or tissue. One type of growth detection scanner 40 is the
        vision system, including the 2803-CM VIM module camera adapter
        and 2802 line scan camera manufactured by Allen Bradley of
        Milwaukee, Wis. The vision system will detect, fill, size,
        shape, contrast and multiple shades of gray whereby the system
        can not only detect plant and tissue growth but also
        contamination of the plant material within the cellule. Should
        contamination be detected, an ink jet printer 140a, such as the
        Excel small character ink jet printer manufactured by Videojet
        Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill., marks
        the cellule containing the contaminated plant material to later
        avoid removing the contaminated plant material from that cellule
        at the cutting unit 280. A print registration scanner 140b, such
        as the Smarteye color mark registration scanner manufactured by
        Tri-Tronics Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla., may be located at
        cutting unit 280 to detect the reject mark so as to not remove
        the contaminated plant material into tissue containment device
        336. </p>
      <p>A bar code reader 141 is stationed within culture room 130 near
        growth detection scanner 140 for identifying the plant material,
        media, and date the plant was invested in the cellule. Bar code
        reader 141 may be a bar code scanning system such as the
        Skan-4100 moving beam laser scanner and Skan-D41 bar code
        decoder manufactured by Skan-A-Matic of Elbridge, N.Y. </p>
      <p>If the plant material is ready for the next stage of
        micropropagation, the length of cellules are transported back
        into the tissue manipulation unit 120. If the appropriate number
        of tissue multiplications have been performed and the desired
        number of plantlets have been produced, the cellules are
        transported from the culture room to the packaging system 160
        where the sealed cellules are boxed for shipment. </p>
      <p><b>Control System</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 23 depicts a block diagram disclosing the basic
        organization of the control system 150 for the automated system
        10 for performing micropropagation and tissue culturing. The
        control system 150 is centered around master control unit 500, a
        programmable controller, and four local control units, 502, 504,
        506 and 508. Local control units 502, 504 506 and 508, also
        programmable controllers, are generally dedicated to controlling
        and monitoring specific portions of automated system 10. More
        specifically, local control unit 502 is generally dedicated to
        the media preparation and fill units 70, 80, the fill check
        scanner 90, ink jet printer 91 and bar coding means 93; local
        control unit 504 is dedicated to monitoring or controlling
        sterilization unit 100 and cooling and storage unit 110; local
        control unit 506 monitors and operates tissue manipulation unit
        120; and local control unit 508 controls activities in culture
        room 130. Each local control unit also operates the drive motors
        which form a part of the tractor feed apparatus 50 within its
        region of control. </p>
      <p>The master control unit 500 may be a dedicated controller
        system where a programmable logic controller, such as the PLC-3
        family of controllers having up to 4096 input/output channels
        manufactured by Allen Bradley of Milwaukee, Wis., may be used to
        control all operations with individual units also having
        keyboard input for manual operation whereby separate parts of
        the automated system 10 can be operated separately. </p>
      <p>Master control unit 500 and local control units 502, 504, 506
        and 508 are configured in a master-slave arrangement such that
        master control unit 500 can monitor all the conditions and
        parameters sensed by the local control units and can coordinate
        the operation of the entire system. Additionally, master control
        unit 500 can assume the function of any local control unit when
        it may become necessary to remove that local control unit from
        the system so as to reprogram certain steps or perform
        maintenance on the local control unit. </p>
      <p>The control provided by local control units 502, 504, 506 and
        508 will now be described in greater detail. Referring now to
        FIGS. 8, 9 and 23, local control unit 502 monitors signals from
        fill sensors 142 and actuates media mix system 510, comprising
        metering pumps 138, solenoid valve 133, stirrer motor 128 and
        heater 132. Local controller 502 also operates drive motors 112
        (FIG. 6) for transporting cellules 30 through media fill
        apparatus 70 and fill check scanner 90. Local control unit 502
        also has responsibility for controlling and actuating media
        dispensing system 516 including fill pumps 154 and transport
        rack 158. Local control unit 502 also monitors signals received
        from fill check scanner 90 and controls bar coding means 93 and
        any ink jet printer 91 applying reject marks. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 12-14 and 23, local control unit 504 is
        shown to actuate motor drives 520 which transport cellules 30
        within and through sterilization unit 100 and cooling and
        storage unit 110. Also controlled by local control unit 504 is
        the autoclave loading and unloading system 522, including cutter
        202 used to cut the continuous length 24 of integument roll 20
        and cylinders 196 employed to close autoclave 186. Local
        controller 504 also monitors and actuates the sterilization
        process 524, including the operation and monitoring of steam
        generator 234, and controls the cooling process 526 in cooling
        and storage chamber 110. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 23, local controller 506 actuates
        motor drives 528 and 530 which, respectively, transport
        integument strips 300 and integument strips 200 into and out of
        tissue manipulation unit 120. Local control unit 506 also
        controls surface sterilization unit 320, cellule cutting unit
        280, tissue planting unit 290, sealing unit 310 and bar coding
        means 311. Local control unit 506 also monitors disposal unit
        170 and signals an operator when the unit if full. Local control
        unit 506 also controls any print registration scanner 95
        adjacent tissue planting unit 290. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1, 22 and 23, local control unit 508
        actuates culture chamber motor control system 542, lighting
        system 406 and temperature control system 404 located within
        culture chamber 130. In addition, signals from the growth
        detector 140 and bar code reader 544 are monitored by local
        control unit 508. Local control unit 508 also controls any ink
        jet printer 140a applying reject marks. </p>
      <p>It is the function of the control system 150 to coordinate and
        synchronize all operations throughout the automated system 10.
        Thus the control system 150 sets the timing, sequence, and speed
        of each operation by receiving input signals from the apparatus
        located at each operation station and then sending output
        signals to such apparatus. </p>
      <p>While the preferred embodiment of this invention has been shown
        and described, modifications thereof can be made by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
        The embodiment described herein is exemplary only and is not
        limiting. Many variations and modifications of the system and
        apparatus are possible and are within the scope of the
        invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited
        by the above description, but is only limited by the claims
        which follow, and that scope includes all equivalents of the

        <b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An automated system for growing plant material includes an
        first length of membrane material having a plurality of open
        growing chambers and a second length of membrane material having
        a plurality of growing chambers filled with the plant material.
        A media preparation unit mixes stock solutions for dispensing
        into the growing chambers by a fill unit. A scanner unit
        determines that a sufficient amount of media has been dispensed
        within each chamber. A sterilization unit sterilizes the
        chambers which then pass to a cooling and storage unit until
        ready for planting with plant material. The second length of
        plant-filled growing chambers are housed in a plant culture room
        where the plant material is permitted to grow. A scanner
        determines the extent of growth of the plant material. Upon the
        material reaching a predetermined growth, the growing chambers
        pass to a surface sterilization unit. A cutting unit opens the
        chambers and the plant material is removed. The material is
        passed through a cutting unit where the material is cut into
        pieces. Each piece of material is then planted into a
        media-filled chamber from the cooling and storing unit. A heat
        sealer closes the open end of the newly plant-filled growing
        chambers. The newly plant-filled growing chambers are then
        transported back to the culture room. A tractor feed apparatus
        transports the lengths of growing chambers throughout the
        automated system and a control system controls the operation of
        each of the units and tractor feed apparatus. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to the field of
        automated apparatus and processes for micropropagation and
        culturing organic material. More particularly, the invention
        relates to automated apparatus and processes for
        micropropagation and tissue culturing of plants. Still more
        particularly, the invention relates to a new and automated
        system for performing micropropagation and tissue culturing of
        horticultural and agricultural plants using integuments. </p>
      <p><b>MICROPROPAGATION AND TISSUE CULTURING</b> </p>
      <p>Micropropagation is the process of mass producing new
        generation plants from a single tissue sample taken from a
        carefully selected parent plant or cultivar. Micropropagation
        retains the advantages common to all types of vegetative
        propagation, i.e., identity of progeny and the ability to
        propagate non-seed producing plants, while having the additional
        advantage that only a small piece of tissue from the cultivar or
        parent plant is required. Micropropagation thus eliminates the
        disadvantages associated with the other forms of vegetative
        propagation. </p>
      <p>Tissue culturing is the process of growing cells in vitro and
        is used to grow both plant and animal cells. Tissue culturing
        techniques are commonly used in the early stages of the plant
        micropropagation process where it is desirable to rapidly
        produce plant cells. </p>
      <p>Improvements in tissue culturing techniques also have
        applications beyond the micropropagation of plants. Essentially
        the same culturing process is used to culture animal and even
        human tissue, such tissue being used in the fields of animal
        agriculture and human and veterinary medicine. Culturing of
        organic material other than plant and animal cells and tissue,
        such as bacteria, viruses and algeas, is also performed in vitro
        for both research and commercial purposes. Improvements in the
        procedures and apparatus used to reproduce and maintain these
        organisms would be beneficial, for example, to researchers and
        industry who require a large or steady supply of such material.
        Further, the automated system of the present invention can be
        adapted for use with germinating seeds and growing plants
        therefrom. </p>
      <p><b>DEFICIENCIES IN PRIOR ART MICROPROPAGATION TECHNIQUES</b> </p>
      <p>The prior art micropropagation process is described in detail
        in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 021,408, page 5, line 3
        through page 11, line 9, the entire disclosure of which is
        hereby incorporated by reference. Despite the advantages
        conventional micropropagation techniques offer the commercial
        grower, there are problems associated with the prior art
        culturing apparatus and processes. One of the primary problems
        is contamination. Any of a wide variety of microorganisms,
        including viruses, bacteria, fungus, molds, yeast and single
        cell algae, can ruin the cultures during any of the various
        stages of micropropagation. </p>
      <p>The prior art sterilized glass or plastic culture containers
        such as test tubes, flasks or bottles have serious drawbacks.
        For example, since plants require both carbon dioxide and oxygen
        to live and grow, these containers must provide a means for gas
        exchange. The walls of these traditional glass and plastic
        containers, however, do not permit the required gaseous
        interchange. Thus, rubber stoppers having cotton packing or some
        similar filter material, loosely fitting caps, or baffled
        plastic cap have been employed to allow an adequate exchange of
        gas between the tissue or plant and the ambient atmosphere and
        environment. However, such devices restrict the amount and rate
        of gas which can be exchanged. Further, such caps and stoppers
        do not totally protect the plant from contamination by
        microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Thus, it has
        been of paramount importance that the tissue culture room and
        laboratory be maintained under aseptic conditions, i.e. kept
        extremely clean and their atmospheres entirely filtered.
        Further, precise temperature, humidity, and light conditions
        must also be maintained in the culture room when using
        traditional micropropagation techniques and apparatus. Gas
        exchange is also required for culturing animal cells and for
        certain other microorganisms. Traditional flasks, petrie dishes
        and the like, while allowing for a certain degree of gas
        exchange, also allow contamination to occur. </p>
      <p>The original cost of the traditional glass or plastic culture
        containers; the labor and equipment cost to maintain the
        sterility of the containers; and the added cost of the
        facilities, equipment, and related conditions required to
        maintain a sterile growing environment, all represent major cost
        factors associated with the use of such containers in
        conventional culturing processes. </p>
      <p>A further significant disadvantage of the prior art
        micropropagation process and apparatus is the fact that the
        conventional culturing containers do not lend themselves to use
        in an automated system. Currently, each step of the
        micropropagation process must be performed by time consuming and
        laborious manual operations. For example, when a tissue sample
        which has survived stage one and has grown to a size that it is
        ready for multiplication, the culture container, a glass test
        tube, for example, must be carried from the culture room to the
        laboratory and placed under a laminar flow hood. There, a
        technician sitting in front of the hood, will typically spray
        the container with a solution of alcohol to kill microorganisms
        which might be on or near the entrance of the container and
        contaminate the culture during the tissue manipulation. Next,
        the technician must grasp the test tube in one hand, remove the
        cotton filled rubber stopper (in this example), remove the
        tissue sample with sterilized forceps and place it on a
        sterilized working surface. The technician must then cut the
        tissue sample into a number of individual samples each of which
        will then be placed in a sterile container with fresh media. </p>
      <p>The containers and media to be used in this next stage will
        themselves have already been manually prepared. Typically, a
        measured amount of prepared media is placed in each test tube,
        with the test tubes being held vertically in a conventional test
        tube rack. The racks of media-filled test tubes are then
        sterilized and transferred to the laminar hood for the
        technician's use in the next tissue manipulation. Similarly,
        culture container lids and stoppers must also be cleaned,
        sterilized and placed under the laminar flow hood for the
        technician's use. Once cooled, the technician will grasp a clean
        and sterilized test tube in one hand and will insert one portion
        of the newly divided tissue sample into the sterilized media
        with the other hand, and then place a cotton filled and
        sterilized stopper on the test tube and replace the test tube in
        the rack. Once the tissue manipulations are completed, the racks
        containing the new cultures are then transported back to the
        culture room. </p>
      <p>As can be appreciated, the number of cultures which can be
        produced is directly related to the efforts and abilities of the
        technicians and more particularly to the manual dexterity of the
        technicians. Furthermore, the extensive manual operation and
        human involvement in the process creates a tremendous potential
        for contamination, even despite the precautions currently taken,
        such as requiring the technicians to wear surgical gloves and
        masks. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the remaining steps in the micropropagation
        process must be carried out manually. Test tubes are manually
        loaded and unloaded into washing apparatus and frequently
        require a manual washing to completely remove media or residue
        from a container which had a contaminated culture. Likewise, it
        is time consuming to manually mix medias and fill the test tubes
        or culture containers with the prepared media in measured
        quantities. Culture vessels or containers are also manually
        loaded into autoclaves for sterilization. As explained above,
        before opening a culture container, its sides are typically
        manually sprayed with a solution of alcohol or chlorine solution
        to kill microorganisms which might contaminate the culture once
        the container is opened. </p>
      <p>It is also currently left to technicians to visually inspect
        the growing cultures for signs of contamination and growth and
        take the appropriate action depending upon their observation.
        For example, when tissue or plantlets have reached their desired
        size, technicians must manually transfer the culture containers
        from the culture room to the laboratory in order to perform the
        next manipulation. When a culture is contaminated, it is also
        manually removed from the culture room and transported to a
        station for disposal and for container cleaning and
        sterilization. </p>
      <p>Current micropropagation techniques also lack the ability to
        monitor inventory through automatic means. Instead, inventories
        are controlled by maintaining physical separation between the
        cultures of the various plants being grown and by simply
        counting the number of culture containers and the cultures
        contained therein. </p>
      <p>As can be appreciated, the conventional micropropagation
        process is extremely labor intensive and costly. In addition,
        the level of production is limited by the number and abilities
        of the technicians involved. A well qualified technician, using
        conventional culturing apparatus and procedures can establish
        approximately 350 cultures per day. Using a laminar flow hood to
        its maximum efficiency by employing three technicians, each
        working eight hours in a 24 hour day, the maximum number of
        cultures which can be established by well trained technicians in
        a day is approximately 1050. Accordingly, there is a need in the
        art for an automated system for performing micropropagation and
        the culturing of organic material. It is desirable that such a
        system eliminate the time consuming and extremely expensive
        manual steps currently employed, including tissue manipulation,
        container cleaning and sterilization, culture transportation,
        media preparation, and filling. In addition, it is desirable
        that such a system have the capability of automatically
        detecting culture containers which have been unfilled or
        underfilled with media, cultures which have become contaminated,
        and tissue samples of plantlets which are ready for the next
        stage of micropropagation. An automated system also having the
        capability of tracking a culture throughout the micropropagation
        process and automatically computing the inventory of the various
        plants or materials being cultured would also be a great advance
        over the traditional culturing apparatus and processes. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from
        the following description. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.</b> </p>
      <p>The automated system for growing plant material includes a
        length of membrane material having a plurality of open growing
        chambers. The preferred membrane material is a high density
        polyethylene sealed together at predetermined locations to form
        a plurality of growing chambers having an open end for the
        insertion of media and plant material. A media preparation unit
        mixes measured amounts of individual stock solutions to prepare
        a selected growing media for the plant material. A fill unit
        dispense the media into the open growing chambers of the length
        of membrane material. A fill check scanner unit scans the
        media-filled open growing chambers to insure that each of the
        growing chambers has been filled with a predetermined amount of
        media. The media-filled growing chambers then pass to a
        sterilization unit for sterilization. A cooling and storage unit
        cools and stores the media-filled open growing chambers until it
        is time for the insertion of plant material. </p>
      <p>Sealed growing chambers, previously filled with media and plant
        material, are housed in a plant culture room where the plant
        material has been permitted to grow in another length of
        membrane material. The length of plant-filled growing chambers
        is periodically passed through a growth detection scanner unit
        to scan the plant material to determine the extent of plant
        growth. Upon the plant material having reached sufficient
        growth, the length of plant-filled growing chambers is
        transported from the culture room to a surface sterilization
        unit for surface sterilizing the exterior of the growing
        chambers. A cutting unit opens the plant-filled growing chambers
        in preparation for the removal of the plant material. The plant
        material is removed from the plant-filled growing chambers by
        the injection of sterilized water into the closed end of the
        growing chamber to wash the plant material out of the opposite
        open end of the growing chamber which had been opened by the
        cutting unit. A rotating tissue containment device receives the
        plant material for transporting the plant material to the plant
        cutting unit. The plant material is extracted from the tissue
        containment unit and pushed against a reciprocating blade which
        cuts the plant material into individual pieces. A planting unit
        inserts individual pieces of the cut plant material into the
        media-filled open growing chambers previously stored in the
        cooling and storage unit. After the media-filled open growing
        chambers have been planted with a piece of plant material, the
        open end of the growing chambers is closed by heat sealing. The
        newly plant-filled growing chambers are then transported back to
        the culture room for new growth. </p>
      <p>A tractor feed apparatus transports the lengths of growing
        chambers throughout the automated system. A control system
        synchronizes and controls the timing, sequence and operation of
        each of the units and tractor feed apparatus. Bar coding units
        uniquely identify each growing chamber to track each growing
        chamber as it progresses through the operations of the automated
        system. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p><b>System 10 Overview</b> </p>
      <p>Referring initially to FIG. 1, there is shown a schematic
        illustration of the automated apparatus 10 for performing
        micropropagation and tissue culturing of plant tissue. The
        apparatus of the present invention is employed to automatically
        perform micropropagation and tissue culturing procedures through
        the use of the integument, a new pliable growing container
        described in co-pending applications Ser. No. 207,405 filed June
        14, 1988 and Ser. No. 021,408 filed Mar. 4, 1987, both
        incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>In general, an integument is a growing or culture container
        formed from a translucent membrane that is liquid and
        contaminant impermeable, but which allows necessary gas exchange
        and light transmission between the living tissue being cultured
        and the ambient environment. The membrane is formed into an
        envelope or cellule for containing the tissue and growth medium.
        Once the tissue and growth medium are placed in the cellule of
        the integument, the cellule is sealed and thus closed to the
        ambient environment. As described in co-pending applications
        Ser. No. 207,405 filed June 14, 1988 and Ser. No. 021,408 filed
        Mar. 4, 1987, an integument pack includes a number of individual
        cellules which are pliant and collapsible such that they may be
        rolled. For use with the apparatus and method of the present
        invention, it is preferred that an integument roll 20, described
        in more detail below, be employed. Integument roll 20 comprises
        a plurality of integuments 22 attached at adjacent edges forming
        a continuous ribbon-like sheet or length 24 of integuments 22
        loosely rolled onto a spool 26. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, the integument roll 20 is housed in
        an integument storage unit 28. In operation, cellules 30 of
        integuments 22 from integument roll 20 are transported as a
        continuous length 24 by a tractor feed mechanism 50 throughout
        the automated system 10. After leaving storage unit 28, the
        cellules 30 move, first to the media fill apparatus 70. A media
        preparation unit 80 automatically mixes the ingredients and
        proportions thereof needed to form the growth medium used for
        particular plants in the various stages of micropropagation.
        Once the cellules 30 are appropriately positioned within the
        media fill apparatus 70, media fill apparatus 70 injects media
        92 from media preparation unit 80 into the individual cellules
        30 of the continuous length 24 of integuments 22 as it is
        unrolled from the integument roll 20. Once filled with the
        measured quantity of the growth medium 92, a bar code indicating
        the type media is placed on the outside surface of cellules 30
        by bar coding means 93. Cellules 30 are then transported to a
        fill-check scanner 90 to insure the appropriate amount of growth
        medium 92 has been inserted into the cellules 30. The cellules
        30 with growth medium 92 are then transported to the
        sterilization unit 100 where they are heated under pressure to
        kill any microorganisms in or on the cellules 30 or the prepared
        media 92. From the sterilization unit 100, the sterilized
        cellules are transported to the cooling and storage unit 110.
        The sterilized cellules with media are stored in the cooling and
        storage unit 110 until plant tissue growing in other cellules,
        as hereinafter described, are ready for transplanting into the
        sterilized cellules stored in unit 110. For transplanting, the
        cellules are transported from unit 110 on to the tissue
        manipulation unit 120. </p>
      <p>All the required tissue manipulations of the micropropagation
        process are carried out within the tissue manipulation unit 120.
        The sterilized cellules and growth media are therein invested
        with tissue samples 122 and then closed by heat sealing in
        sealing unit 310 to prevent contamination. The invested cellules
        are then coded by bar coding means 311 with a bar code
        indicating the type of plant and the date the culture was
        established. </p>
      <p>The coded cellules 30 with plant tissue are then transported to
        and through the culture room 130 where they are exposed to a
        growing environment conducive to the particular variety of plant
        being grown and the stage of micropropagation. After the culture
        has been in the culture room 130 for the appropriate time period
        and grown to the desired stage of development, the cellules 30
        containing the cultures are transported through a growth
        detection scanner 140, which detects the growth of the plant
        material or tissue, and through a bar code reader 141. If the
        culture is ready for the next stage of micropropagation, the
        cellules containing the cultures are transported back into the
        tissue manipulation unit 120 where the cellules are surface
        sterilized and washed in surface sterilization unit 320 and
        opened in cellule cutting unit 280. The tissue samples 122 are
        then removed and cut into smaller tissue samples for
        transplanting or investment in new sterile cellules with growth
        media from cooling and storage unit 110 in tissue planting unit
        290. The cellules with new tissue samples are then sealed in
        sealing unit 310 and transported back into the culture room 130.
        Once the appropriate number of tissue multiplications have been
        performed and the desired number of plantlets have been
        produced, the cellules containing the plantlets are transported
        from the culture room 130 to the packaging system 160 where the
        still sealed cellules are boxed for shipping. </p>
      <p>The entire process is controlled and monitored by control
        system 150. </p>
      <p><b>Integument Roll 20</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown an integument roll 20
        generally comprising a continuous ribbon-like sheet or length 24
        of individual cellules 30 wrapped loosely around a spool 26. One
        portion of the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 is depicted
        in FIG. 3 and, as depicted, comprises individual cellules 30a,
        30b, and 30c. As best shown in FIG. 4, an individual cellule 30
        is formed by a front membrane 32 and back membrane 34 which are
        attached at their lower extremities by a wide heat-sealed lower
        band 36. It is preferred that lower band 36 be approximately
        one-half inch wide. While a narrower heat seal will suffice to
        prevent contamination, the wider heat-sealed band adds an extra
        measure of protection against the introduction of microorganisms
        and allows for lower tractor perforations 42 in lower band 36
        which, as described below, are used in conjunction with the
        tractor feed apparatus 50 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIGS. 3 and 4, front membrane 32 and back
        membrane 34 are also heat sealed along lines perpendicular to
        band 36 as shown at 38a, 38b, 38c, and 38d, thereby forming
        individual cellules 30a, 30b, and 30c. Preferably, heat seals 38
        do not extend the entire width of membranes 32 and 34, but
        instead stop approximately one-half inch short of the upper
        edges of membranes 32 and 34, thereby leaving upper front and
        back bands 46 and 48 respectively, unattached. In this
        configuration, cellule 30 is defined by heat seals 38 and lower
        heat seal band 36 leaving initially an open end 52 which serves
        as an entry port into cellule 30 for receiving plant tissue and
        growth media. Lower tractor perforations or apertures 42 are
        formed in lower heat seal band 36 and upper tractor perforations
        44, such as 44a and 44b, are formed in upper bands 46 and 48 at
        uniform distances along the entire continuous length 24 of
        integument roll 20. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a manufacturing process
        for the integument roll 20. Although it is anticipated that the
        integuments 22 will be manufactured separately from the
        micropropagation process, the manufacturing process may be a
        part of the automated system 10. The integument roll 20 is
        manufactured by the melt blowing of a polyolefin film such as
        polyethylene. In manufacture, the film is blown into a large
        bubble which is drawn upward to obtain the desired film
        thickness and is then cooled. The blown film is then drawn
        between rollers where a continuous double layer of film 54 is
        drawn from the film making machine. In-line operations can then
        be made on the double layer of film 54. For example, two
        integument rolls 20a and 20b can be manufactured from the double
        layer of film 54. As the double layer of film 54 is drawn from
        the film making machine or roll 56, it may be drawn over a heat
        sealing roller 58 as shown in FIG. 5. Heat sealing roller 58
        includes raised portions 60 and 62 used to simultaneously form
        heat seal band 36 and heat seals 38 respectively on two
        continuous lengths 24a and 24b which, at this point, are joined
        at their upper edges 64. After passing over heat sealing roller
        58, the double layer of film 54 may pass over perforation
        rollers 66 which include projections 68 formed about their
        circumference. Projections 68 engage recesses formed in a mating
        rollers (not shown) which are positioned above perforation
        rollers 66. As the double layer of film 54 is passed between
        these rollers, bands 36, 46 and 48, best shown in FIG. 4, are
        all perforated. The double layer of film 54 is then cut into two
        separate continuous lengths 24a and 24b as the film 54 is passed
        through a stationary knife blade 72. The two lengths 24a and 24b
        are then wound on spools 26a and 26b. </p>
      <p>The polymeric material for cellules 30 is critical to providing
        the necessary environment for housing plant and animal life. In
        particular, it is important to achieve optimum gas exchange and
        light transmission to permit the necessary biochemical activity
        conducive to life. The material must readily pass oxygen and
        carbon dioxide between the ambient atmosphere and the cellule 30
        for use by the contained plant or animal life in their metabolic
        processes to preserve the organic material and the like in a
        living condition. Thus, the cellule 30 is made of a
        semi-permeable and translucent material which permits gas
        transfer therethrough. The preferred material for cellule 30 is
        a polyethylene film from 1.0 to 2.0 mils. thick. It is preferred
        that the material have thickness of 1.25 mils. If the membrane
        material is thinner than 1.0 mil, handling the cellule 30, and
        especially opening cellule 30, is made more difficult because
        the opposing sides 32, 34 of the material of cellule 30 tends to
        adhere to each other when formed in such thin films less than
        1.0 mil. Although a translucent low density polyethylene is
        suitable and even allows greater gas permeability, a high
        density polyethylene is preferred. The high density polyethylene
        can withstand greater extremes in temperature, such as is
        encountered in an autoclave, where a low density polyethylene
        may tend to melt, distend, or distort. Other polymeric materials
        may be used where the gas and water vapor transmission rates are
        comparable to that of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The gas transmission rates of the material for cellule 30 is of
        the utmost importance. For practicing the invention described
        herein, it is preferred that the membrane material have a
        permeability to CO.sub.2 of from 200 to 1190 cc/100 sq. in/24
        hours at 1 atm. and a permeability to O.sub.2 of from 100 to 400
        cc/100 sq. in/24 hours at 1 atm. Another important factor may be
        the moisture vapor transmission rate which is preferred from 0.2
        to 0.684 gm/100 sq. in/24 hours at 1 atm. The preferred high
        density polyethylene film exhibiting the above characteristics
        is high density polyethylene material no. HiD-9650 manufactured
        by Chevron Chemical Company of Orange, Tex. Upon sealing the
        cellule 30, the organic material is completely enveloped and
        enclosed from the ambient atmosphere and environment so as to
        prevent any introduction of contaminants and permit the
        necessary gas exchange between the organic material therein and
        the atmosphere of the ambient environment. The material of
        cellule 30 is also translucent to enable the organic material to
        receive the necessary light for life and growth. </p>
      <p>The published specifications for high density polyethylene
        HiD-9650 are melt index of 0.3 (gms/10 min); density 0.950
        (gms/cc); dart impact of 90 (gms/mil at 26 inches); tensile
        strength at break of 7400 (psi); elongation of 4 and 60%;
        Elmendorf tear md/td of 16/400 (gms/mil); and a moisture vapor
        transmission rate of 0.35 (gms/100 sq. in. 24 hr./mil). </p>
      <p><b>Tractor Feed Apparatus</b> </p>
      <p>The tractor feed apparatus 50 operates to transport the
        continuous length 24 of cellules 30 throughout and between each
        of the apparatus which comprises the automated system 10.
        Tractor feed mechanism 50 comprises a plurality of individual
        tractor feed belts, belt guide channels, supports, rollers and
        drive motors as described in more detail below. The description
        of one segment of the tractor feed apparatus will typify the
        remaining segments of the mechanism. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, there is shown one portion of
        the tractor feed apparatus 50. Depicted in FIG. is a partial
        plan view of that portion of the tractor feed apparatus 50 which
        serves to draw the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 from roll
        20 mounted in the integument storage unit 28 and to transport
        the cellules 30 of integument roll 20 to the media fill
        apparatus 70 shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the
        tractor feed apparatus 50 generally comprises driver and
        receiver support plates 74, 76, studded drive belts 78,
        receiving belts 82, driver and receiver belt guide channels 84,
        86, drive and receiver rollers 88, 89 and tensioning rollers 94
        respectively. Belt guide channels 84, 86 are attached to support
        plates 74, 76 which are themselves anchored to a supporting
        base, not shown, attached or resting on the floor or suspended
        from the ceiling or other suitable support structure. It is
        preferred that guide channels 84, 86 be bolted to support plates
        74, 76. In this manner, the distance between upper guide
        channels 84a, 86a and lower guide channels 84b, 86b can readily
        be changed in the event that an integument roll 20 having a
        different dimension is later used. Studded drive belts 78 and
        receiving belts 82 are received by and travel within the
        recesses of driver and receiver belt guide channels 84, 86
        respectively. It is preferred that driver and receiver belts be
        made of Teflon. Motion is imparted to the belts 78, 82 by drive
        and receiver rollers 88, 89, shown in FIG. located at the ends
        of driver and receiver guide channel 84, 86. As shown in FIG. 7,
        drive and receiver rollers 88, 89 extend through slots 75 formed
        in support plates 74, 76. Referring to FIG. 6A, driver and
        receiver rollers 88, 89 include teeth 98 which mesh with
        indentations 102 on the inner surface 104 of drive and receiver
        belts 78, 82. The engagement of teeth 98 with indentations 102
        prevents slippage between rollers 88, 89 and belts 78, 82. Upper
        and lower drive rollers 88a, 88b are mounted on a driver shaft
        106 and upper and lower receiver rollers 89a, 89b are mounted on
        a receive; shaft 108. Shafts 106, 108 are rotatably supported by
        journal bearings 118 and are driven by a common motor 112
        through gears 107a, 107b. It should be appreciated that it may
        only be necessary to drive one of the shafts 106, 108 using one
        gear 107 driven by motor 112. Journal bearings 118 are mounted
        on belt guide channels 84, 86. </p>
      <p>As rollers 88, 89 are rotated clockwise and counterclockwise
        respectively, as viewed in FIG. 6, projections 114 on studded
        drive belts 78 mate with indentations 116 formed in receiving
        belts 82. The projections 114 and indentations 116 are
        positioned along the belts 78 and 82 so as to coincide with the
        dimensions between adjacent upper and lower tractor perforations
        44, 42 formed in continuous length 24 as shown in FIG. 3. Thus,
        the lower band 36 and the upper bands 46, 48 of length 24 are
        captured and attached between driver and receiver belts 78, 82.
        The guide channels 84, 86 extend between each apparatus in the
        automated system 10 as shown in FIG. 1 and thereby transport the
        length 24 throughout the system 10. Tensioning rollers 94 are
        positioned along guide channels 84, 86 to tension and guide the
        belts 78, 82. Although not shown, additional drive and receiver
        rollers 88, 89 are strategically positioned between apparatus
        located throughout the automated system 10 along guide channels
        84, 86 to propel the length 24 of cellules to each of the
        apparatus in the system 10. It should be appreciated that other
        means may be adapted for attaching the bands to a moving track
        for transporting the length 24 throughout the automated system
        10. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 7, continuous length 24 is transported by its
        upper and lower edges by a total of four belts: upper drive belt
        78a; upper receiving belt 82a; lower drive belt 78b; and lower
        receiving belt 82b. To ensure that the tractor feed apparatus 50
        functions properly and that continuous length 24 of cellules 30
        is not damaged from engagement with belts moving at a number of
        different velocities, it is important that drive rollers 88a,
        88b and receiver rollers 89a, 89b be driven at the identical
        velocity. As is evident, as rollers 88, 89 are rotated clockwise
        and counterclockwise respectively as shown in FIG. 6, the
        cellules 30 of continuous length 24 are transported along with
        the moving belts 78, 82 at a uniform velocity. It should be
        understood however that other continuous lengths 24 may be
        transported at a different uniform velocity depending upon its
        location in system 10. </p>
      <p><b>Media Preparation Unit 80</b> </p>
      <p>As shown schematically in FIG. 8, media preparation unit 80
        comprises mix tank 124, stirrer 126, stirrer motor 128, heater
        132, stock solution refrigeration unit 134, stock solution
        containers 136 and metering pumps 138. A plurality of stock
        solution containers 136 are refrigerated within refrigeration
        unit 134 and maintained at a temperature of approximately two
        degrees centigrade. The stock solution containers 136 each
        contain a separate ingredient or nutrient used in the
        preparation of the various media used in the micropropagation
        process. Each medium used in the process is mixed in a batch
        mode within the mix tank 124, which is preferably made of
        stainless steel. When a level switch 142 within mix tank 124
        signals controller 150 that another batch of media is required,
        controller 150 will signal appropriate metering pumps 138, which
        are in fluid communication with fill lines 144, to inject a
        programmed amount of stock solution through individual fill
        lines 144 extending into mix tank 124. It is preferred that
        metering pump 138 be a parastolic pump such as Model No. 2P304
        manufactured by the Mec-O-Matic Co. Such pumps are reliable and
        extremely accurate. Controller 150 also actuates solenoid valve
        133 in sterile water line 143 allowing the appropriate amount of
        sterile water to flow into mix tank 124. </p>
      <p>Once the appropriate stock solutions and sterile water have
        been injected into the mix tank 124, the ingredients are heated
        by heater 132 while the solution is stirred by stirrer 126.
        Stirrer 126 includes an impeller 146 mounted on the end of a
        shaft 148 which is connected to and rotated by stirrer motor
        128. Both heater 132 and stirrer motor 128 are actuated by
        controller 150. The media is stirred and heated to a temperature
        of approximately 100.degree. C. in order to melt the agar or
        other gelling agent which is used in the particular growth
        medium being prepared. Optionally, the media may be supplemented
        with nutrients and plant growth regulators. Once the growth
        medium is prepared, heater 132 and stirrer 124 are turned off
        and the growth medium is then ready for injection into cellules
        30. </p>
      <p>Unused media and liquids used to clean and rinse mix tank 124
        may be drained from mix tank 124 through drain 141 and pumped to
        a disposal tank (not shown). </p>
      <p><b>Media Fill Station 70</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 8, 9 and 10, the media fill station 70
        comprises fill lines 152, parastolic fill pumps 154, injection
        nozzles 156, nozzle transport rack 158 and filling guide 162. In
        general, measured amounts of growth medium from media
        preparation unit 80 are simultaneously injected into a plurality
        of cellules 30 of continuous length 24 by media fill apparatus
        70 as shown in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>Five fill lines 152 are in fluid communication with mix tank
        124 as shown in FIG. 8 and are comprised of a flexible plastic
        tubing having an internal diameter of approximately 5/8 inches.
        Injection nozzles 156 are connected to the ends of fill lines
        152 and are positioned above filling guide 162 on nozzle
        transport rack 158. Nozzles 156 are tapered and sized to be
        inserted between upper bands 46, 48 of cellules 30 for entry
        through entry port 52 into the chamber of cellule 30. Filling
        guide 162 is supported by support arms 164. As can be seen in
        FIG. 9, the leading and trailing edges of filling guide 162 are
        formed with wedge-shaped ends 166 to separate bands 46, 48 of
        cellules 30. In response to a signal from controller 150 after
        the unfilled cellules 30 have been positioned below filling
        guide 162, pneumatic cylinders 172 actuate and lower pistons
        174, thereby lowering nozzles 156 into position for filling
        cellules 30 with growth medium 92. An individual parastolic fill
        pump 154 is dedicated to each fill line 152 and, like metering
        pump 138 described above, may be Mec-O-Matic Model No. 2P304.
        Upon receipt of a signal from controller 150, fill pump 154 will
        pump a predetermined measure of mixed growth medium 92 from mix
        tank 124 through fill lines 152, injection nozzle 156 and into
        cellules 30. </p>
      <p>In operation, the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 is drawn
        by tractor feed apparatus 50 to a media fill station 70 where
        the upper bands 46, 48 of cellules 30 are separated by filling
        guide 162 as continuous length 24 is drawn by tractor feed
        apparatus 50 beneath nozzle transport rack 158. Controller 150
        actuates drive motors 112 positioned along the tractor feed
        apparatus 50, as previously described and shown in FIGS. 6 and
        7, in timed intervals such that five cellules 30 are positioned
        and remain stationary underneath filling guide 162 for
        approximately three seconds while growth medium 92 is injected
        into the cellules 30. Once in position, controller 150 signals
        the pair of pneumatic cylinders 172 to lower nozzle transport
        rack 158 and injection nozzles 156. In this manner, nozzles 156
        are lowered into the filling guide 162. Controller 150 then
        signals the parastolic fill pumps 154 to inject the appropriate
        measure of media 92 into each of the five cellules 30.
        Controller 150 then actuates the pneumatic cylinders 172 to
        raise injection nozzles 156 back into position shown in FIG. 9
        above filling guide 162 and then signals drive motors 112
        operating tractor feed apparatus 50 to transport five new
        unfilled cellules 30 into position underneath rack 158 for
        filling with growth media. </p>
      <p>After a cellule 30 has been filled with media and passed
        through the media fill station, the cellule may be marked with a
        bar code by a bar code printing system 93, such as a "Digimark"
        variable information laser marker manufactured by Videojet
        Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill. The
        cellules may include a solid ink mark, portions of which are
        vaporized by the laser printer of the bar code printing system
        93 to indicate the type of media in the cellule. Other indicia
        may also be coded on the cellule. </p>
      <p><b>Fill Check Scanner 90</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 11, fill check scanner 90 is used to
        determine whether the cellules 30 have been injected with the
        appropriate measure of growth medium 92. Fill check scanner 90
        generally comprises enclosure 176, light source 178, polarized
        panel 180 and photo receptor panel 182. As shown in FIG. 11,
        tractor feed apparatus 50, upon input from controller 150, draws
        continuous length 24 through the interior of enclosure 176 so as
        to transport the media-filled cellules 30 into the enclosure 176
        for scanning. As described above with respect to the media
        filling station 70, the cooperation of controller 150, with the
        drive motors 112 of the tractor feed apparatus 50 (FIGS. 6 and
        7), will transport cellules 30 for scanning in groups of five.
        Positioned on one side of enclosure 176 is a light source 178
        which may be, for example, quartz-halogen. Polarized panel 180
        is affixed within enclosure 176 as shown in FIG. 11 and divides
        the interior of the enclosure into two compartments. Polarized
        panel 180 is selected so that light waves passing in a direction
        perpendicular to the panel 180 will be passed through the
        polarized panel 180; however, light rays traveling in other
        directions will not pass through polarized panel 180. </p>
      <p>Light waves which pass through polarized panel 180 will
        continue through the cellules 30 of continuous length 24 and
        will contact photoreceptor panel 182 on the opposite side of the
        enclosure 176. Photoreceptor panel 182 comprises a surface
        containing hundreds of photosensitive cells (not shown). Light
        waves will pass through the membranes 32 and 34 of cellules 30
        and activate the photosensitive cells on photoreceptor panel
        182. Light waves penetrating the areas of the cellules 30 filled
        with growth media 92 will be defracted to a greater degree than
        those which pass through the portion of cellule 30 containing no
        media. Accordingly, the light intensity sensed by the portion of
        photoreceptor panel 182 which is directly behind the
        media-filled portions of the cellules 30 will be less than the
        intensity sensed by remaining portions of panel 182. The
        photosensitive cells on photoreceptor panel 182 are electrically
        connected to the controller 150 by a plurality of signal wires
        184. In this manner, it can be determined which cellules 30 have
        been filled and whether they have been filled with the
        appropriate volume of growth medium 92. </p>
      <p>An alternative embodiment of fill check scanner 90 is the
        "Smarteye" photoelectric sensor manufactured by the Tri-Tronics
        Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla. The "Smarteye" photoelectric sensor
        can sense size, texture, distance, opacity, depth and color so
        as to have the capability of determining whether an appropriate
        measure of growth media 92 has been injected into a particular
        cellule. </p>
      <p>Upon fill check scanner 90 identifying a cellule which has an
        inadequate amount of media, the inadequate cellule is marked by
        an ink jet printer such as the "Excel" small character ink jet
        printer 91 manufactured by Videojet Systems International, Inc.
        of Elk Grove Village, Ill. A print registration scanner 95, such
        as the "Smarteye" color mark registration scanner manufactured
        by Tri-Tronics Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla., will subsequently
        identify the inadequate cellule by scanning for the ink mark
        prior to the insertion of plant material in tissue planting unit
        290. The print registration scanner 95 will send a signal to
        controller 150 which will in turn cause the tractor feed
        apparatus 50 to pass the inadequate cellule through the tissue
        planting unit without inserting any plant tissue. </p>
      <p><b>Sterilization Unit 100</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, there is shown sterilization
        unit 100 generally comprising an autoclave 186 used to sterilize
        the media-filled cellules 30 before the cellules 30 are invested
        with tissue. The autoclave 186 comprises a generally cylindrical
        enclosure 188 mounted on a support structure 190. The enclosure
        188 comprises a pressure chamber 192 and a closure 194 coaxially
        aligned and attached by four pneumatic cylinders 196 used to
        open and close the closure 194. The pressure chamber 192 has
        attached to its interior entrance an inner lip 198 which extends
        around the entire periphery of the interior entrance of the
        pressure chamber 192 and serves to guide the closure 194 during
        the closing of the autoclave 186 by pneumatic cylinders 196. Lip
        198 also serves to protect an O-ring seal (not shown) from the
        gases and extreme heat generated during the sterilization
        procedure. Pressure chamber 192, closure 194 and inner lip 198
        are all manufactured from stainless steel, have an inner jacket
        of monel and have a total thickness of less than 1/2 inch. </p>
      <p>In operation, the leading end of continuous length 24 is passed
        through a cutter 202 mounted on the side of autoclave 186 and in
        cooperation with the tractor feed apparatus 50. The cutter 202
        acts as a guide for the continuous length 24 of cellules 30 as
        the cellules 30 are disposed within the autoclave 186. Cutter
        202 also includes a blade 204 which is activated by controller
        150 after the autoclave 186 has been filled with a strip 200 of
        cellules 30, strip 200 having a length of as much as several
        hundred feet and comprising many thousands of cellules 30.
        Referring to FIGS. 13, 14, and 15, integument strip 200 is
        automatically loaded into the autoclave 186 for sterilization by
        internal loader/unloader apparatus 210 which operates
        identically to the tractor feed apparatus 50 previously
        described. As described in greater detail below, the internal
        loader/unloader apparatus 210 supports and transports the
        integument strip 200 by use of a series of drive belts which
        cooperatively engage upper apertures 44, 42 formed in the upper
        bands 46, 48 and lower band 36 of integument strip 200. The
        drive belts are supported in a multi-level serpentine
        configuration within the autoclave 186 so as to achieve the
        greatest density of cellules 30 as possible. </p>
      <p>There is shown in FIG. 13 a section view of the autoclave 186
        which schematically illustrates the path of integument strip 200
        as it is loaded in serpentine fashion into the autoclave 186.
        FIGS. 14 and 15 depict how the integument strip 200 is supported
        and transported within autoclave 186. Referring now to FIGS. 14
        and 15, perforated support plates 214 are rigidly attached to
        the upper interior surface of pressure chamber 192. Support
        plates 214 are perforated so as to enable steam to penetrate
        throughout enclosure 188. Attached to the perforated plates 214
        are belt guide channels 216. Retained within belt guides
        channels 216 are the drive belts including studded drive belt
        218 and receiving belt 220. As described previously with respect
        to the tractor feed apparatus 50, the projections 222 on studded
        drive belt 218 and the indentations 224 on receiving belt 220
        are spaced apart on belts 218 and 220 at a distance equal to the
        the distance between adjacent apertures 42, 44 in the upper
        bands 46, 48 and lower band 36 on integument strip 200. Still
        referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, it should be understood that a
        total of four belts are employed in the internal loader/unloader
        apparatus 210: upper studded drive belt 218a; lower studded
        drive belt 218b; upper receiving belt 220a; and lower receiving
        belt 220b. Belts 218a, 218b, 220a and 220b serpentine through
        pressure chamber 192, changing levels within the chamber 192 as
        dictated by the belt guide channels 216 which are inclined as
        the path nears an end of pressure chamber 192. </p>
      <p>In operation, tractor feed apparatus 50 transports the leading
        end of integument strip 200 into and through the guide of cutter
        202 attached near the entrance of pressure chamber 192 of
        autoclave 186. An external drive motor 226 has a sealed drive
        shaft 228a extending into pressure chamber 192 and serves to
        actuate rollers 232, 233 by means of gears 230a, 230b and
        receiver shaft 228b which are supported within pressure chamber
        192 and form a portion of the internal loader/unloader apparatus
        210 for driving the belts 218, 220. The rollers 232 and 233, in
        turn, actuate and rotate drive belts 218 and 220 as previously
        shown and described with reference to the tractor feed apparatus
        50. The external drive motor 226 will turn rollers 232, 233 and
        thus transport belts 218, 220 at the same speed that tractor
        feed apparatus 50 transports integument strip 200 into the guide
        of cutter 202. Integument strip 200 will thus be loaded in
        serpentine fashion into the autoclave 186. When the autoclave
        186 is loaded with integuments 22, the cutter knife 204 is
        actuated by controller 150 to cut the strip 200 from the
        continuous length 24. After the trailing edge of integument
        strip 200 is loaded, controller 150 will stop the external drive
        motor 226. It will then actuate the pneumatic cylinders 196 to
        close the closure 194 of autoclave 186 and initiate the
        sterilization process. The sterilization process is accomplished
        through conventional means such as a steam generator 234. Water
        inlet valves 236 and drain valves 238 are also provided as shown
        in FIG. 14. Upon completion of the sterilization process, the
        external drive motor 226 is again actuated to unload the
        sterilized integument strip 200 from the autoclave 186 while
        simultaneously loading a new unsterilized integument strip as
        just described. </p>
      <p>Because the sterilization unit 100 is a batch operation, the
        preceding operations at the media fill station 70 and fill check
        scanner 90 must be halted until the sterilization unit 100 is
        emptied to receive a ne batch of cellules 30. Means can be
        provided to permit a continuous operation such as by rolling the
        length 24 of cellules 30 passing from fill check scanner 90 onto
        a spool or supporting the length 24 on an elongated tractor feed
        track until the sterilization unit 100 is ready to accept a new
        batch of cellules 30. A cutter, such as cutter 202, would be
        used to cut a length of cellules 30 for later insertion into
        sterilization unit 100. Such means would permit the continuous
        filling of cellules 30 with media 92. </p>
      <p>An alternative to the sterilization unit 100 includes the use
        of a presterilized length 24 of cellules 30 and filter
        sterilized media 92. Using presterilized cellules and filter
        sterilized media eliminates the need for a sterlilization unit
        100 in the automated system 10. The elimination of the
        sterilization unit 100 permits a continuous operation from the
        fill scanner unit 90 to the cooling and storage unit 110. A
        presterilized length 24 of cellules 30 may be produced since the
        membrane for the cellules is aseptic at the time of manufacture.
        The integuments 22 would then be produced as previously
        described under aseptic conditions. The filter sterilized media
        would be prepared and sterilized by an inline filtration
        process. </p>
      <p><b>Cooling and Storage Unit 110</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 16A, there is depicted the
        cooling and storage unit 110 which generally comprises cooling
        chamber 240, an air filter assembly 242, and cooling system 244.
        Air filter assembly 242 includes a filter housing 246, a
        prefilter 248, a blower motor 250 driving to a squirrel cage
        blower assembly 252, a flume 254 and a hepafilter 256. Air
        filter assembly 242 is attached to and supported by the upper
        surface 258 of the cooling chamber 240. Filter housing 246
        includes an air intake aperture 262 which is covered by
        prefilter 248 and attached to the housing 246. Prefilter 248
        filters dust and other large airborne particles and prevents
        them from being drawn into the air filter assembly 242. Mounted
        within air filter housing 246 is the squirrel cage blower
        assembly 252 which is driven by a blower motor 250 mounted
        externally to the cooling chamber 240. Blower assembly 252 draws
        air from the ambient atmosphere through the prefilter 248 and
        injects the air through flume 254 into the hepafilter 256 which
        covers the aperture 264 formed in the upper surface 258 of the
        cooling chamber 240. The hepafilter 256 removes 99.97% of all
        pollutants and airborne contaminates from the air injected into
        the cooling chamber 240. </p>
      <p>Cooling system 244 includes cooling coils 266 which are
        supported near the top of cooling chamber 240 on a perforated
        support plate 268 which is affixed to the sidewalls and endwalls
        of the chamber 240 so as to be parallel with the upper surface
        258 of the chamber 240. Through conventional means, coolant is
        circulated through the cooling coils 266 so as to maintain a
        constant temperature within the cooling chamber 240 of five
        degrees centigrade. </p>
      <p>The air drawn into the cooling chamber 240 is vented through
        the entry port 272 and exit port 274 for integument strip 200. A
        positive pressure of 1.1 atmospheres is maintained within the
        cooling chamber 240. The continuous flow of filtered air through
        entry and exit ports 272 and 274 resulting from the positive air
        pressure within cooling chamber 240 prevents contaminants, such
        as air-borne microorganisms, from entering the cooling chamber
        240 and contaminating the previously sterilized media. As shown
        in FIG. 16, cooling chamber 240 includes a housing extension 270
        having a front face 273 in which entry port 272 is formed.
        Housing extension 270 extends from cooling chamber 240 to a
        position in close proximity to sterilization unit 100 so as to
        minimize the distance travelled by the sterilized cellules 30
        before they enter the cooling and storage unit 110. After
        leaving sterilization unit 100 and before entering cooling and
        storage unit 110, the sterilized cellules 30 are exposed to the
        unfiltered air of the ambient environment. However, after
        undergoing the heat sterilization process, the heat radiating
        from the sterilized cellules 30 creates air currents which,
        along with gases generated by the hot media, combine to drive
        away air-borne microorganisms which might otherwise contaminate
        the media 92 or the surfaces of cellules 30 before they enter
        the sterile environment of cooling and storage unit 110. </p>
      <p>The tractor feed apparatus 50, previously described, is
        supported within the cooling chamber 240 and extends outside the
        enclosure through entry and exit ports 272, 274. Because the
        extremely high temperatures present in the sterilization unit
        100 are not present in the cooling and storage unit 110, tractor
        feed apparatus drive motors 112 may be located within the
        cooling chamber 240; however, to allow as many cellules 30 as
        possible to be contained within the cooling chamber 240, it is
        preferred that tractor feed drive motor 112 be mounted outside
        cooling chamber 240. As previously described with reference to
        the sterilization unit 100, integument strip 200 is supported in
        serpentine arrangement within cooling chamber 240 by a series of
        perforated support plates 276. In cooling chamber 240, the
        perforated support plates 276 are rigidly attached
        perpendicularly to the coil support plate 268. These support
        plates 276 in turn support the guide belt channels 216 and drive
        belts 218 and 220 in a multi-level serpentine fashion as
        described above and illustrated in FIGS. 14-15 with regard to
        the sterilization unit 100. In operation, the leading edge of
        integument strip 200 is inserted into entry port 272 to the
        cooling chamber 240 and is loaded therein in serpentine fashion.
        The sterilized cellules 30 are stored in cooling chamber 240
        until the media 92 and cellules 30 are cooled. Then, as
        required, the sterile media 92 and cellules 30 of integument
        strip 200 are drawn into the tissue manipulation unit 120
        described below. The sterilization unit 100 can sterilize one
        integument strip 200 at a time. However, it is desirable that
        cooling and storage unit 110 have the capacity to cool and store
        a plurality of such integument strips 200 simultaneously and to
        house the sterile cellules 30 until needed. </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Manipulation Unit 120</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, the tissue manipulation unit 120
        generally houses a cellule cutting unit 280, a tissue planting
        unit 290, a sealing unit 310 and a surface sterilization unit
        320. In the tissue manipulation unit 120, the sterilized
        cellules 30 with growth media 92 from the cooling and storage
        unit 110 are invested with a tissue sample 122. The tissue
        sample may be meristematic tissue from a stock or parent plant
        or more often is tissue from either a stage 1 initial culture or
        a stage 2 multiplication culture grown in cellules of a previous
        integument strip 300 transported from the culture room 130. The
        tissue planting unit 290 will ordinarily receive plant material
        for investing in media-filled cellules from cellules previously
        housed in the culture room 130 and opened by cutting unit 280.
        However, seeds or meristematic tissue may be manually fed into
        tissue planting unit 290 for inserting into the media-filled
        cellules. As depicted in schematic form in FIG. 1 and for
        purposes of the description below, it is assumed that the
        cellules of sterilized integument strip 200, previously
        described, are to be filled with plant tissue that has
        previously been grown in culture room 130 in an integument strip
        300 comprising a plurality of cellules 30 containing growing
        tissue 122. Integument strip 300 is transported from the culture
        room 130 into the tissue manipulation unit 120 where the
        cellules 30 with tissue 122 first undergo surface sterilization
        in surface sterilization unit 320. The sterilized cellules 30
        with tissue are then opened by cellule cutting unit 280 and the
        growing tissue 122 contained therein is removed and cut into
        smaller tissue samples which are then inserted into unused and
        sterilized cellules 30 of integument strip 200 in the tissue
        planting unit 290 The newly planted cellules are then sealed by
        sealing unit 310, are coded with a bar code by bar coding means
        311 and transported back to culture room 130. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIG. 1, the tissue manipulation unit 120
        includes a box-like enclosure 282 having an air filter assembly
        like the one described above with regard to the cooling and
        storage unit 110. The air filter assembly filters the air that
        is used to pressurize the enclosure 282, such pressurization
        precluding the entrance of airborne contaminates such as
        microorganisms which could contaminate the cultures 122 during
        any of the tissue manipulations which take place within the
        tissue manipulation unit 120. A positive pressure of
        approximately 1.1 atmospheres is maintained in enclosure 282. An
        entrance port 282a to the tissue manipulation enclosure 282 is
        formed in one end and is sealingly attached to the exit port of
        the cooling and storage unit 110 so that no airborne
        contaminants can enter the enclosure 282. In this manner,
        cellules 30 making up integument strip 200 transported from the
        cooling and storage unit 110 pass directly into the tissue
        manipulation unit 120 and are continuously exposed to filtered
        air. Air is exhausted from enclosure 282 through the entry and
        exit ports 282a, b for integument strip 200 and entry and exit
        ports 282c, d for integument strip 300. </p>
      <p>Tractor feed apparatus 50 extends into and through enclosure
        282 so as to transport sterile integument strip 200 from the
        cooling and storage unit 110 into the tissue manipulation unit
        120 and to transport to integument strip 200 to culture room 130
        once tissue samples 122 have been placed in the cellules 30 from
        tissue-filled integument strip 300 and once the cellules have
        been sealed. Tractor feed apparatus 50 is also employed to
        transport integument strips 300 containing sealed cellules with
        growing tissue therein from the culture room 130 to the tissue
        manipulation unit 120, and to discharge used integument strips
        300 from enclosure 282 to disposal unit 170 after tissue samples
        122 have been removed from the cellules 30. </p>
      <p><b>Surface Sterilization Unit 320</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18, after being transported from
        the culture room 130 to the tissue manipulation unit 120,
        cellules 30 of integument strip 300 containing living plant
        tissue 122 first enter the surface sterilization unit 320.
        Surface sterilization unit 320 includes an enclosure 284 which
        is divided into three compartments 286, 287, 288 that are
        separated by flap-like closures 292a, 292b, 292c, 292d. Closures
        292 span the entire cross-section of enclosure 284 and serve to
        prevent solution from being sprayed or splashed out of the
        compartments 286, 287, 288. Enclosure 284 is preferably made of
        acrylic plastic, such as plexiglass, approximately 1/2 inch
        thick. As depicted in FIGS. 17 and 18, tractor feed apparatus 50
        transports cellules 30 in integument strip 300 containing the
        living tissue 122 through slit formed in closure 292a and
        between a pair of sterilization spray bars 294 which are
        attached to lower support plate 296 which serves as part of
        enclosure 284. Sterilization spray bars 294 comprise plastic
        tubing approximately 1/2 inch in diameter having perforations
        298 in the sides. The lower ends of the spray bars 294 are
        connected to flexible tubing 302 through which a sterilizing
        solution of sodium hypochloride is pumped by pump 304 from a
        storage tank 306. As the cellules 30 pass between the spray bars
        294, the sterilization solution is sprayed on the outside
        surfaces of the cellules 30 through open windows formed in
        support plates 74, 76. The sprayed solution then runs down the
        sides of the cellules 30 and is collected in drain basin 308 in
        fluid communication with holding tank 312 via drain line 314. </p>
      <p>After undergoing the surface sterilization in compartment 286,
        the cellules 30 are then drawn through a slit formed in closure
        292b and into an identical compartment 287 where they pass
        between a second set of spray bars 318 which are connected to a
        source 322 of sterilized water. The sterilized water is sprayed
        on the cellules 30 by pump 323 through open windows in support
        plates 74, 76 to wash away remaining sterilization solution. The
        resulting fluid is then collected in a second drain basin 324
        where it is drained via drain 326 to a second holding tank 328.
      </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18A, the sterilized and washed
        cellules 30 of integument strip 300 then pass through a slit
        formed in closure 292c and are drawn into a drying chamber 330
        in compartment 288. Filtered air within tissue manipulation unit
        120 is blown down and over the surface of cellules 30 by
        squirrel cage blowers 331. The air is funneled over the surface
        of cellules 30 by unperforated plates 332a, 332b. Solution which
        drips off the surface of cellules 30 is collected in basin 324
        and drained to holding tank 328 via drain line 315. Once the
        cellules 30 have been sterilized and dried, they are transported
        through slit formed in closure 292d and into cutting unit 280 as
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 19. </p>
      <p><b>Cutting Unit 280</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 19, once in the cutting unit 280,
        the lower edge of integument strip 300 is drawn across
        stationary cutting blade 334, best shown in FIG. 20A, which cuts
        open the bottom of the cellules 30 just above lower heat seal
        band 36. Cutting blade 334 will be heated to destroy any
        contamination which may be deposited on blade 334 due to a
        contaminated plant in a cut open cellule. Lower heat seal band
        36 and the attached lower portion of the cellules 30 is then
        transported out of the manipulation unit enclosure 282 by the
        lower drive and receiving belts 218b, 220b of the tractor feed
        apparatus 50 shown in FIG. 15 for disposal in disposal unit 170.
        The now open cellules 30 are next transported into the tissue
        planting unit 290. </p>
      <p><b>Tissue Planting Unit 290</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 19, 20A, and 21 tissue planting unit 290
        generally includes a compartmentalized and rotatable tissue
        containment device 336, a water injection means 338 and
        pneumatic clamps 340. </p>
      <p>Water and/or air injection means 338 is employed to pierce the
        closed end of a cellule 30 whose other end has been opened by
        cutting unit 280 and inject water such that the water pressure
        and the force of gravity causes the tissue sample 122 contained
        therein to pass out the bottom of the open cellule 30 into the
        tissue containment device 336. The water injection means 338
        comprises a hypodermic-like needle 342 in fluid connection with
        a sterile water source 344 and a pumping means 346. Best shown
        in FIGS. 19 and 21, upon receipt of the appropriate signal from
        the controller 150, a pneumatic clamp 340 closes and clamps an
        open cellule 30 along heat seals 38 so as to maintain the
        cellule's position directly above the tissue containment device
        336. Controller 150 next signals water injection means 338 such
        that needle 342 is pneumatically lowered by cylinder 350 so as
        to pierce the top of the opened cellule 30 as shown in FIGS. 19
        and 20A. The pumping means 346 is then actuated and a stream of
        sterile water is injected into the top of open cellule 30. As
        shown in FIG. 21, the injected water and gravity cooperate to
        deposit the tissue sample 122 in one of the compartments 352 of
        the tissue containment device 336 directly below the bottom of
        opened cellule 30. It should be understood that pressurized air
        may be used in place of the sterilized water. Once the cellule's
        tissue sample 122 has been deposited in the tissue containment
        device 336, the used cellules are transported out of the tissue
        manipulation system enclosure 282 by the upper drive and
        receiving belts 218a, 220a of the tractor feed apparatus 50 for
        disposal in disposal unit 170 as shown in FIG. 19. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 20A and 21, the compartmentalized and
        rotatable tissue containment device 336 comprises a rotatable
        inner hub 354 mounted on drive shaft 356 which is driven by a
        stepping motor (not shown). Rotatable hub 354 includes a
        plurality of flat bottom plates 355 disposed around the
        circumference of the hub and forming a multi-sided polygon. On
        each side of hub 354 are multi-sided polygon shaped end plates
        363 which extend from shaft 356 to bottom plates 355. Shaft 356
        passes through, but is not attached to, the circular end plates
        358 and side plates 360. Identically dimensional rectangular
        windows 362 are formed in end plates 358 and side plates 360 and
        are coaxially aligned with push rod 376 and extraction member
        378 as described below. Radiating from and attached to rotatable
        hub 354 are a plurality of pairs of flat spokes or divider
        plates 364. Each pair of spokes 364 is attached at its inner end
        to a bottom plate 355 of hub 354 thereby forming a compartment
        352. The outer end is open to provide the opening to compartment
        352. Arcuate rim segments 366 connect the outer ends of adjacent
        spokes 364, but do not extend over the openings to compartments
        352. Bracing members 367 may be used to span the entrances to
        compartments 352 and provide rigidity to the containment device
        336. In this configuration, tissue containment device 336
        comprises a compartmentalized, carousel-like, device having a
        plurality of compartments 352 defined by outer surfaces or
        bottom plates 355 of hub 354, inner surfaces of flat spokes 364,
        and the inner surfaces of stationary end plates 358. The number
        and size of compartments 352 may be varied by changing the
        diameter and width of tissue containment device 336. </p>
      <p>The outer surface 355 of hub 354, which forms the bottom of
        compartments 352, is provided with perforations 370a to allow
        the water and less viscus media 92, which were deposited along
        with plant tissue 122 by water injection means 338, to drain
        from compartments 352 and into hub 354. Such fluids may also
        drain from compartments 352 by seaping between stationary end
        plates 358 and the edges of flat spokes 364 adjacent thereto.
        Perforations 370b are also formed in side walls 357 of hub 354
        to allow collected liquids to drain therethrough and to seap
        between hub 354 and end plates 358. Such liquids may also drain
        from hub 354 through perforations 370a of the lower, empty,
        compartments 352. All such liquids drain into basin 368 where
        they then drain to disposal tank 372 shown in FIG. 21. </p>
      <p>After a cellule 30 is opened and tissue sample 122 is deposited
        in a compartment 352 of the tissue containment device 336, the
        controller 150 actuates the stepping motor to turn tissue
        containment device 336 a preset number of degrees and to
        activate the tractor feed apparatus 50 moving the integument
        strip 300 forward, so as to bring a newly opened cellule 30
        directly above the next empty compartment 352 in the tissue
        containment device 336. In this step-like manner, a compartment
        352 containing a tissue sample 122 is positioned between the
        aligned windows 362 in the circular end plates 358 and side
        plates 360. Once so positioned, the tissue sample 122 may then
        be removed from the compartment 352 and cut into a plurality of
        tissue samples by the cutting mechanism 371 as hereinafter
        described. </p>
      <p><b>Cutting Mechanism 371</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 20A, the cutting mechanism 371 comprises
        pneumatic cylinders 374, 384, pushrods 376, 382, extraction
        member 378, and cutting blade 380. Extraction member 378 is a
        rectangular-shaped block of stainless steel having a cross
        section identical in shape to the cross section of a compartment
        352 of tissue containment device 336 and rectangular windows 362
        in end plates 358 and side plates 360. Member 378 is attached to
        pushrod 376 and is actuated by pneumatic cylinder 374.
        Extraction member 378 reciprocates in a cutting channel 379
        having a cross-section which slidingly receives extraction
        member 378. The cutting channel 379 extends through windows 362
        in end plate 358a and side plate 360a, one of the compartments
        352, windows 362 in end plate 358b and side plate 360b, and
        exits into planting conduit 398. Cutting blade 380 is sideably
        disposed within a blade guide 381 at the exit of cutting channel
        379 and is attached to pushrod 382 which is actuated by
        pneumatic cylinder 384. </p>
      <p>When tissue sample 122 in compartment 352 is to be multiplied
        into a plurality of new samples, controller 150 will actuate
        cylinder 374 and pushrod 376 so that extraction member 378 is
        extended through cutting channel 379 and the compartment 352 in
        tissue containment device 336 which is then aligned between
        windows 362 in end plates and side plates 358, 360. As pushrod
        376 is further extended as shown in FIG. 20B, extraction member
        378 pushes the tissue sample 122 out of compartment 352 until a
        portion of the tissue sample 122 extends through the exit of
        cutting channel 379 beneath cutting blade 380 in blade guide
        381. Pushrod 382 connected to cutting blade 380 is then actuated
        by pneumatic cylinder 384 so that cutting blade 380 is propelled
        downward and severs a portion of the tissue sample 122, the
        severed portion then resting on working surface 388 within
        planting conduit 398. Referring now to FIG. 21B, with cutting
        blade 380 still in its lowered position, stuffing mechanism 390
        is actuated by controller 150, stuffing mechanism 390 including
        pushrod 392, pneumatic cylinder 394 and stuffing member 396.
        Stuffing member 396 reciprocates in a planting conduit 398
        having a cross-section which slidingly receives stuffing member
        396. Planting conduit 398 extends past the exit of cutting
        channel 379 to the open end of cellules 30 at fill gate device
        400. Pushrod 392, actuated by pneumatic cylinder 394, is
        extended so that stuffing member 396, which is slideably engaged
        with working surface 388, pushes the severed tissue sample 122
        through planting conduit 398 and into a sterile media-filled
        cellule 30. As shown in FIGS. 19 and 21A, a fill gate device 400
        such as that described previously with respect to the media fill
        station 70 is attached to the end of planting conduit 398 so as
        to separate the opposing membrane surfaces 46, 48 of integument
        strip 200 and thereby facilitate investment of the cellule 30
        with the severed tissue sample 122. As the sterilized integument
        strip 200 is transported from the cooling and storage unit 110
        into the tissue planting unit 290, integument strip 200 is
        rotated 90.degree. from its previous upright position so that
        the cellules 30 in integument strip 200 can be invested with a
        tissue sample 122 through fill guide 400. </p>
      <p>The process described above is employed to multiply tissue
        cultures already growing in cellules 30 of integument strip 300.
        When first beginning the micropropagation process, before
        initial cultures have been established in cellules 30 of
        integument strip 300, it is necessary to establish initial
        cultures for later multiplication. This is accomplished by
        manually inserting samples of meristimatic tissue from a
        selected parent plant or cultivar into the tissue planting unit
        290, investing the tissue samples in cellules 30 of integument
        strip 200, sealing the cellules and transporting them to culture
        room 310. Accordingly, forming a part of the enclosure 282 of
        tissue manipulation unit 120 is a normally-sealed access door
        281, as shown in FIGS. 20 and 21. When initiating the
        micropropagation process, an operator opens access door 281 and
        deposits a sample of meristimatic tissue within each compartment
        352 of tissue containment device 336 as it rotates in the
        counter-clockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 21. When a
        compartment containing a manually-inserted tissue sample becomes
        aligned with windows 362 formed in end and side plates 358, 360,
        the sample is invested in cellules 30 of integument strip 200 in
        the same manner as described above. Alternatively, access door
        281 may be enlarged or repositioned, or another access door may
        be provided in enclosure 282, so as to allow an operator to
        directly invest tissue into cellules 30 of integument strip 200
        prior to the cellules being sealed by sealing unit 310, without
        employing tissue planting unit 290. During this manual
        operation, the operator will have manual control of the tissue
        manipulation unit 120. </p>
      <p><b>Sealing Unit 310</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 19, once the severed tissue
        sample 122 has been invested into the sterile cellule 30, the
        cellule 30 is drawn into sealing unit 310 comprising a pair of
        roller heat sealers 404, thereby completely sealing the new
        culture from the exterior environment. Once sealed, the cellules
        30 are bar coded by a bar code printing system 311 such as the
        Digimark variable information laser marker manufactured by
        Videojet Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill.
        The bar code indicates the type of plant material in the cellule
        and the date the plant was invested in the cellule. The cellules
        are then transported into the culture room 130. </p>
      <p><b>Culture Room 130</b> </p>
      <p>The culture room 130 comprises a room or other enclosure
        containing the tractor feed mechanism 50, a temperature control
        system 404, and a lighting system 406. As described previously,
        the tractor feed mechanism 50 will transport the integument
        strips 200 in a multilevel serpentine fashion within the
        enclosure 130. In this system, it is not necessary that the air
        be filtered since the cultures have been sealed from the ambient
        environment by sealing unit 310 in the tissue manipulation unit
        120 after planting. It is preferred that the tractor feed system
        50 be supported by a gridwork of support brackets and channels
        rather than by the perforated support plates previously
        described with respect to the sterilization and cooling units
        100, 110 since, in this application, it is important that the
        light waves generated by the lighting system are transmitted and
        reflected throughout the entirety of the enclosure 130. The
        previously described perforated support plates block too much of
        the light. As shown in FIG. 22, between each serpentined row of
        integuments, there is a bank of fluorescent lights 408 selected
        and positioned so as to maintain approximately 1,000
        foot-candles of light throughout the unit 130. It is preferable
        that the system allow the light intensity to be varied as the
        cultures are transported throughout the unit 130 such that when
        desirable to cease multiplication and grow finished plantlets at
        the completion of the growth period in the culture unit 130, the
        light intensity can be increased to approximately 3,000
        foot-candles so as to harden the plant and ready it for shipment
        to the commercial grower for planting in a soil medium in the
        greenhouse. To enhance light transmission within culture room
        130, the walls, ceiling and floor are covered with a highly
        reflective surface 410 such as a mirrored acrylic sheet. </p>
      <p>As depicted in FIG. 1, individual lengths of plant-filled
        cellules are periodically scanned in the culture room 130 by a
        growth detection scanner 140 which detects the growth of the
        plant or tissue. One type of growth detection scanner 40 is the
        vision system, including the 2803-CM VIM module camera adapter
        and 2802 line scan camera manufactured by Allen Bradley of
        Milwaukee, Wis. The vision system will detect, fill, size,
        shape, contrast and multiple shades of gray whereby the system
        can not only detect plant and tissue growth but also
        contamination of the plant material within the cellule. Should
        contamination be detected, an ink jet printer 140a, such as the
        Excel small character ink jet printer manufactured by Videojet
        Systems International, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill., marks
        the cellule containing the contaminated plant material to later
        avoid removing the contaminated plant material from that cellule
        at the cutting unit 280. A print registration scanner 140b, such
        as the Smarteye color mark registration scanner manufactured by
        Tri-Tronics Company, Inc. of Tampa, Fla., may be located at
        cutting unit 280 to detect the reject mark so as to not remove
        the contaminated plant material into tissue containment device
        336. </p>
      <p>A bar code reader 141 is stationed within culture room 130 near
        growth detection scanner 140 for identifying the plant material,
        media, and date the plant was invested in the cellule. Bar code
        reader 141 may be a bar code scanning system such as the
        Skan-4100 moving beam laser scanner and Skan-D41 bar code
        decoder manufactured by Skan-A-Matic of Elbridge, N.Y. </p>
      <p>If the plant material is ready for the next stage of
        micropropagation, the length of cellules are transported back
        into the tissue manipulation unit 120. If the appropriate number
        of tissue multiplications have been performed and the desired
        number of plantlets have been produced, the cellules are
        transported from the culture room to the packaging system 160
        where the sealed cellules are boxed for shipment. </p>
      <p><b>Control System</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 23 depicts a block diagram disclosing the basic
        organization of the control system 150 for the automated system
        10 for performing micropropagation and tissue culturing. The
        control system 150 is centered around master control unit 500, a
        programmable controller, and four local control units, 502, 504,
        506 and 508. Local control units 502, 504 506 and 508, also
        programmable controllers, are generally dedicated to controlling
        and monitoring specific portions of automated system 10. More
        specifically, local control unit 502 is generally dedicated to
        the media preparation and fill units 70, 80, the fill check
        scanner 90, ink jet printer 91 and bar coding means 93; local
        control unit 504 is dedicated to monitoring or controlling
        sterilization unit 100 and cooling and storage unit 110; local
        control unit 506 monitors and operates tissue manipulation unit
        120; and local control unit 508 controls activities in culture
        room 130. Each local control unit also operates the drive motors
        which form a part of the tractor feed apparatus 50 within its
        region of control. </p>
      <p>The master control unit 500 may be a dedicated controller
        system where a programmable logic controller, such as the PLC-3
        family of controllers having up to 4096 input/output channels
        manufactured by Allen Bradley of Milwaukee, Wis., may be used to
        control all operations with individual units also having
        keyboard input for manual operation whereby separate parts of
        the automated system 10 can be operated separately. </p>
      <p>Master control unit 500 and local control units 502, 504, 506
        and 508 are configured in a master-slave arrangement such that
        master control unit 500 can monitor all the conditions and
        parameters sensed by the local control units and can coordinate
        the operation of the entire system. Additionally, master control
        unit 500 can assume the function of any local control unit when
        it may become necessary to remove that local control unit from
        the system so as to reprogram certain steps or perform
        maintenance on the local control unit. </p>
      <p>The control provided by local control units 502, 504, 506 and
        508 will now be described in greater detail. Referring now to
        FIGS. 8, 9 and 23, local control unit 502 monitors signals from
        fill sensors 142 and actuates media mix system 510, comprising
        metering pumps 138, solenoid valve 133, stirrer motor 128 and
        heater 132. Local controller 502 also operates drive motors 112
        (FIG. 6) for transporting cellules 30 through media fill
        apparatus 70 and fill check scanner 90. Local control unit 502
        also has responsibility for controlling and actuating media
        dispensing system 516 including fill pumps 154 and transport
        rack 158. Local control unit 502 also monitors signals received
        from fill check scanner 90 and controls bar coding means 93 and
        any ink jet printer 91 applying reject marks. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 12-14 and 23, local control unit 504 is
        shown to actuate motor drives 520 which transport cellules 30
        within and through sterilization unit 100 and cooling and
        storage unit 110. Also controlled by local control unit 504 is
        the autoclave loading and unloading system 522, including cutter
        202 used to cut the continuous length 24 of integument roll 20
        and cylinders 196 employed to close autoclave 186. Local
        controller 504 also monitors and actuates the sterilization
        process 524, including the operation and monitoring of steam
        generator 234, and controls the cooling process 526 in cooling
        and storage chamber 110. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 23, local controller 506 actuates
        motor drives 528 and 530 which, respectively, transport
        integument strips 300 and integument strips 200 into and out of
        tissue manipulation unit 120. Local control unit 506 also
        controls surface sterilization unit 320, cellule cutting unit
        280, tissue planting unit 290, sealing unit 310 and bar coding
        means 311. Local control unit 506 also monitors disposal unit
        170 and signals an operator when the unit if full. Local control
        unit 506 also controls any print registration scanner 95
        adjacent tissue planting unit 290. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1, 22 and 23, local control unit 508
        actuates culture chamber motor control system 542, lighting
        system 406 and temperature control system 404 located within
        culture chamber 130. In addition, signals from the growth
        detector 140 and bar code reader 544 are monitored by local
        control unit 508. Local control unit 508 also controls any ink
        jet printer 140a applying reject marks. </p>
      <p>It is the function of the control system 150 to coordinate and
        synchronize all operations throughout the automated system 10.
        Thus the control system 150 sets the timing, sequence, and speed
        of each operation by receiving input signals from the apparatus
        located at each operation station and then sending output
        signals to such apparatus. </p>
      <p>While the preferred embodiment of this invention has been shown
        and described, modifications thereof can be made by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
        The embodiment described herein is exemplary only and is not
        limiting. Many variations and modifications of the system and
        apparatus are possible and are within the scope of the
        invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited
        by the above description, but is only limited by the claims
        which follow, and that scope includes all equivalents of the
        subject matter of the claims. </p>
