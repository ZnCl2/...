      <div align="center"><big><b>Bark beetles' song could save forests</b><br>
          <b>Study: Tree-eating insects deterred by their own calls</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers at Northern Arizona University think they may have
      found an environmentally safe and readily available weapon against
      the tree-eating armies of bark beetles.<br>
      <br>
      It is, with apologies to the boys from Liverpool, the music of the
      beetles.<br>
      <br>
      NAU's School of Forestry was on the hunt for ways to fight the
      marauding bugs, which have chewed through millions of acres of the
      West's pine forests, leaving behind dead trees and the risk of
      wildfires.<br>
      <br>
      A research assistant suggested using sounds to aggravate the
      beetles, much as police sometimes blare music in hostage
      situations. The researchers tried Queen and Guns N' Roses and
      played snippets of radio talker Rush Limbaugh backward. None
      produced the desired results.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the beetles were exposed to digitally altered recordings of
      their own calls, the sounds they make to attract or repel other
      beetles. The response was immediate. The beetles stopped mating or
      burrowing. Some fled, helter-skelter. Some violently attacked each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      Most important, they stopped chewing away at the pine tree,
      suggesting that the scientists may have discovered a sort of sonic
      bullet that could help slow the beetles' destructive march.<br>
      <br>
      "Our interest is to use acoustic sounds that make beetles
      uncomfortable and not want to be in that environment," said NAU
      forest entomologist Richard Hofstetter, who led the experiment
      nicknamed, without apology, "beetle mania."<br>
      <br>
      Bark beetles have killed nearly 80 million ponderosa, pi?on and
      lodgepole pines in Arizona and New Mexico and tens of millions
      more across the West over the past decade. Years of punishing
      drought left the trees unable to protect themselves against the
      attacks, which carve ugly scars into forests, weaken the
      surrounding ecosystem and heighten wildfire danger.<br>
      <br>
      Forest managers can apply insecticide to individual trees or small
      stands, but forestwide treatments are impractical and would be
      wildly expensive and potentially risky to other plants and
      wildlife.<br>
      <br>
      Enter Reagan McGuire, a research assistant who wondered what would
      happen if the beetles were blasted with noise, creating an
      acoustic stress that might change their behavior. He sold
      Hofstetter on the idea, and the experiment was hatched at NAU's
      School of Forestry lab.<br>
      <br>
      They collected tree trunks infested with bark beetles and
      sandwiched slices of the trees between clear plastic plates,
      creating what looked like the old ant farms once sold in the back
      pages of magazines.<br>
      <br>
      Working in the lab, McGuire piped in the music through tiny
      speakers, the sort you might find in a singing greeting card. He
      watched the reaction of the beetles using a microscope. The rock
      music didn't seem to annoy the bugs, nor did Rush in reverse.<br>
      <br>
      McGuire and Hofstetter decided to try something different. They
      recorded the sounds of the beetles and played them back,
      manipulating them to test the response.<br>
      <br>
      Suddenly, every little thing they did seemed to provoke the
      beetles.<br>
      <br>
      "We could use a particular aggression call that would make the
      beetles move away from the sound as if they were avoiding another
      beetle," Hofstetter said.<br>
      <br>
      When they made the beetle sounds louder and stronger than a
      typical male mating call, he said, the female beetle rejected the
      male and moved toward the electronic sound.<br>
      <br>
      Even more surprising was what the beetles did to each other. The
      researchers manipulated the sounds and, at a certain point, the
      male stopped mating and tore the female apart, McGuire said.<br>
      <br>
      "This is not normal behavior in the natural world," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Questions remain about why and how the sonic attacks work. It's
      not even clear yet where the beetles' ears are. Other researchers
      hope they can work that out, seeking the best way to aim the
      offending sounds.<br>
      <br>
      The lab hopes to find more funding to continue its research into
      acoustic pest control. Scientists think it won't be long before
      they can take the experiment into the field.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises a device and method for impacting the
      behavior of invertebrates that infest wood, without the use of
      chemicals. In particular, the invention is useful for impacting
      the behavior of woodboring invertebrates, which infest wood
      products, lumber and the woody portions of plants and trees. The
      invention utilizes acoustic (sonic) agents which may be optionally
      modulated with specific signals, to cause negative effects on the
      normal behaviors exhibited by wood-infesting invertebrates, which
      may result in the invertebrates being injured or killed, unable to
      reproduce, or caused to flee the wood that the invertebrates are
      infesting.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] The device of the invention provides a way to minimize the
      impact of wood-infesting invertebrates, by subjecting the
      invertebrates and the immediate woody environment in which they
      live to certain acoustic (sonic) agents that are modulated with
      specific signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The terms "wood-infesting invertebrates", "target
      invertebrates", "targeted invertebrates", "target organisms" or
      "targeted organisms" as used herein are intended to encompass any
      invertebrate species that uses wood as a food source or that
      otherwise destroys or bores or burrows into wood for shelter or
      for reproductive or other purposes. Non-limiting examples of
      wood-infesting invertebrates include bark beetles, wood wasps,
      woodborers, termites and barnacles. Specific examples of the
      foregoing are the Emerald Ash Borer, the Asian Longhorn Beetle,
      Redbay Ambrosia Beetle, and the Mountain Pine Beetle. The Mountain
      Pine Beetle has already decimated large portions of coniferous
      forests across North America, and there is at present no way to
      effectively prevent its spread. The Emerald Ash Borer is native to
      Asia and was discovered in North America about a decade ago. It is
      widely believed by scientists that this organism will infest, and
      thereby eliminate, all ash trees in North America within the next
      several decades.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The wood that may be protected using the invention is
      typically the wood of a live, standing tree, but may also be that
      of a deceased, standing tree or a wood product such as lumber,
      fences, furniture, wine barrels, wood pilings, piers, etc. The
      invention may also be adapted for use in the protection of wood in
      buildings and other structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The wood infesting insects of particular interest for
      targeting with this invention typically have flying stage in which
      the adult insect can fly from one tree to another, laying eggs in
      each tree. The eggs hatch into larvae, which tend to cause
      significant damage to the tree or wooden object. When the
      invention is used on a tree, the tree is referred to as the "host
      tree". Often, the infestation causes the death of the host tree.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The invention is useful for causing negative effects on
      many of the normal behaviors exhibited by targeted organisms. For
      example, the invention is useful for disrupting directional
      guidance, feeding, colonization, tunneling, communication,
      organization, reproduction, nest building, competitive
      interactions, predator avoidance, mate attraction, mating, caring
      for eggs and caring for offspring, and other behaviors of the
      insects.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] When one or more of these normal behaviors are disrupted,
      there is a great decrease in the ability of an individual organism
      to reproduce and/or survive.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] For example, in an embodiment of the invention, the
      reproductive capabilities of the organism are compromised, which
      prevents the organism from successfully reproducing, which in turn
      has a negative effect on the local population of the organism. In
      another embodiment, the invention is used to negatively effect the
      colonization or organizational capabilities of a species
      population, rendering the population unable to carry out all of
      the behaviors necessary to keep the colony alive and functioning.
      As a result, in due course, this will result in decline and
      possibly eventual termination of the local population of target
      organisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The invention can be used to provide individual tree
      protection to both large scale forests (e.g., government owned
      public lands such as national and state forest lands), as well as
      to private landowners and commercial tree growers. This invention
      provides a non- chemical means for preventing the spread of
      wood-infesting invertebrates, including the prevention and the
      control of tree-infesting organisms that occur across all habitats
      from wildlife refuges to urban centers.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In an embodiment of the invention, the invention has
      effects on only specific species of target invertebrates because
      in most situations the target invertebrate is the only threatening
      wood-boring species within the tree or wood product, whilst having
      little impact on non-target species. For example, in treating a
      tree to reduce or eliminate the population of bark beetle, it may
      be preferable to avoid the reduction or elimination of non-harmful
      and/or beneficial (non-target) insects and other animals. A way to
      accomplish this according to the invention is to generate noises
      relevant to the specific target species. The term "relevant" as
      used herein means that the target organism will react in some way
      to the noise. For example, if one is to use the invention to have
      an effect on Mountain Pine Beetles, in a preferred embodiment of
      the invention, the natural sounds produced by the Mountain Pine
      Beetle are subjected to modification as discussed herein, and the
      Mountain Pine Beetles are then exposed to those modified sounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The invention is also designed to have minimal negative
      effect on the host trees.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The present invention provides a way to significantly
      reduce and even eliminate wood-infesting invertebrates that are
      already inside or on the tree or wooden material or object. The
      invention is also useful for deterring wood-investing insects from
      boring into the wood, by making the wood undesirable for the
      insect to land on and/or to remain on the tree. Thus, the
      invention deters insects from remaining on and boring into the
      wood.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a further preferred embodiment, the invention is used to
      prevent the infestation of trees, by deterring insects in the
      flying stage from alighting on the tree or wooden object.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The invention is comprised of a device for delivering sound
      (acoustic) waves to the wood to be treated (typically, to a tree),
      by physically attaching the device (actually, the device's output
      transducer(s)) to the object or material to be treated (such as a
      tree). Thus, the device transmits acoustic signals within both air
      spaces and woody substrates inside of trees, through mechanical
      vibratory coupling. The process involves the input of specific and
      biologically relevant sound patterns (e.g., mating calls,
      territorial signals, species recognition sounds) into trees,
      wooden objects and wooden materials, in order to influence the
      entry, colonization, mating, communication and tunneling behavior
      of organisms in the tree, object or material. Many of the specific
      and biologically relevant sound patterns (acoustic signals) used
      in the invention are derived directly from sounds produced by the
      target organisms, i.e., are recordings of the organisms'
      naturally-emitted sounds. These acoustic signals are subsequently
      reproduced, and in some cases also modified, and the target
      organism is exposed to the acoustic signals, to trigger and alter
      their associated behaviors and functioning. (For instance,
      modifications include, but are not limited to reverberation, ring
      modulations, flanging, chorusing, etc. are used to change sounds).
      The sounds that are used do not merely attract or repel the target
      organisms, but rather in addition or instead, the sounds disrupt
      the organisms' neural functioning, resulting in changes in one or
      more important behaviors or metabolic processes of the target
      organisms. For example, normal functioning may be disrupted by the
      invention, and may cause aberrant (non-typical) behavior or
      abnormal development with respect to such important life functions
      as reproduction, feeding, colonization, tunneling, communication,
      organization, etc. When one or more of these normal processes are
      disrupted, the ability of the organisms to survive is greatly
      decreased.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The device(s) of the invention may be used as a "single
      tree protection", i.e., used in conjunction with one living tree
      to provide effective invertebrate control to that tree. It may
      also be used on dead trees, to prevent spread of the invertebrate
      to other areas, particularly to living trees.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Alternatively, multiple units of the device, multiple
      devices or a device with multiple transducers can be used to
      provide invertebrate control for more than one tree, wooden object
      or material. The sounds created by the device could potentially be
      distributed with various broadcast strategies (e.g., through the
      roots of trees) to protect multiple trees or other wood objects or
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The device and method of the invention may be useful for
      treatment or prevention of wooden objects and materials by
      transmitting the sounds according to the invention through
      substrates other than air, such as through water, dirt, sand, air
      or ice, including through the ground and bodies of water. For
      example, infestations of wooden piers and boats by barnacles under
      water may be treated in this way.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In yet another embodiment of the invention, the device and
      method of the invention may be used to re-direct an outbreak of
      wood-boring insects or other invertebrates, by creating a buffer
      zone to deter insects from entering a particular portion of a
      treed area. For example, a buffer zone may be created by placing
      at least one device on each of multiple trees in an area.
      Similarly, a buffer zone could be created to deter invertebrates
      from entering an area containing wooden objects or materials to be
      protected. <br>
      <br>
      [0026] The device of the invention could be used on object
      comprised partially or totally of wood, such as wooden building
      structures (e.g., houses) and wooden wine barrels and casks, as
      well as on portions of objects that are comprised of wood.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] There are three general types of acoustic signals that are
      used in the device and method of the invention, as follows:
      biological acoustic waveform samples, re-synthesized biological
      acoustic waveform samples, and chaotic acoustic waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Each of these signals may be used alone, or two or more may
      be used together.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Each of these signals may optionally be subjected to
      processing digitally in both time domain and frequency domain. For
      example, standard audio signal processing effects may be used.
      Examples of types of processing include, but are not limited to,
      the following: decreasing duration of biological waveform sample
      or portion thereof without changing its speed, increasing duration
      of biological waveform sample or portion thereof without changing
      its speed, increasing amplitude of biological waveform sample or
      portion thereof, decreasing amplitude of biological waveform
      sample or portion thereof, deleting a part of the biological
      waveform sample or portion thereof, repeating a part of the
      biological waveform sample or portion thereof, inserting an
      artificially generated waveform sample or portion thereof to
      overlap all or a portion of the biological waveform sample or
      portion thereof, and inserting an artificially generated waveform
      sample or portion thereof in front of or following the biological
      waveform sample or portion thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Portions of the biological acoustic waveform samples, as
      well as portions of the re-synthesized acoustic waveform samples
      and of the chaotic acoustic waveforms may be used, instead of or
      in addition to the entire waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The term "biological acoustic waveform samples" is known to
      those of ordinary skill in the art, and refers to the "natural" or
      native, endemic sounds emitted by insects that are intended to be
      affected by the invention. These are typically recorded digitally,
      but may also be recorded in analog.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The term "re-synthesized biological acoustic waveform
      samples" is known in the art to refer to biological acoustic
      waveform samples which have been modified in certain ways. One
      example of the numerous ways that the biological waveform samples
      may be re-synthesized is by simplifying the samples to their most
      basic components, essentially distilling out the most biologically
      relevant portion of the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Chaotic oscillators are used to produce sounds that are
      highly<br>
      unpredictable, and therefore sounds will keep changing in complex
      ways to avoid any possible habituation effect. Habituation effect
      occurs when an organism becomes accustomed to a particular
      stimulus, such as in this case, auditory stimulus, and as a result
      exhibits a decreased response to the stimulus.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Shown in FIGURE 1 is an overall flowchart of the system of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] These processes are to be divided between digital software<br>
      implementation to run on a standard laptop or netbook computer and
      analog circuits housed in a separate instrumentation box, although
      variations on the foregoing are within the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In a specific, non-limiting embodiment of the invention, a
      combination of two or more of the following types of sonic agents
      also referred to herein as "acoustic signals" are employed: (1)
      one or more specifically targeted sounds (acoustic signals) of
      biological origins such as mating calls, aggression calls, and
      sounds emitted in conjunction with chemical signals (e.g.,
      biological wave form samples or portions thereof, or
      re-synthesize/biological waveform samples or portions thereof);
      (2) the aforementioned sounds subjected to a variety of signal
      processing effects (i.e., altering the nature of the audio wave
      form through changes in the frequency and amplitude domains of the
      wave form); and (3) sounds of synthetic origins that mask or
      confuse the normal sonic behaviors and communications between the
      organisms (e.g., chaotic waveforms).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In order to determine which initial sounds (auditory
      stimuli) should be generated to expose the target organism to, the
      user must first determine the range (frequency) of sound that the
      organism emits.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The user must then examine the patterns of sound(s) emitted
      by the organism. For example, if the target organism is an insect,
      the patterns include the rhythm of the beats or strides or rubbing
      of the organism's parts against one another (also called<br>
      "stridulations"), such as the rubbing of the organism's wings
      against its abdomen.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] An important aspect of one embodiment of the invention is
      to generate sounds that match the frequency and patterns that the
      organism naturally emits or is otherwise exposed to (such as a
      predator's calls). This is important because the sounds generated
      must be "relevant" to the organism, i.e., the organism must
      recognize the frequency and pattern of sound generated by the
      device of the invention, if the generated auditory stimulus is to
      have an effect on the organism's behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The invention further involves exposing the organism to the
      generated sounds, and observing how the organism responds. The
      generated sounds are modified, and the organism's response(s) to
      the modified sounds is observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The observer may then choose generated sounds which cause
      the organism to exhibit desirable behavior. The term "desirable
      behavior" is intended to mean any behavior by the organism that is
      deemed to be desirable to humans, such as cessation of or causing
      erratic life function behaviors (reproduction, feeding,
      colonization, tunneling, communication, organization).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The invention further involves taking steps to avoid
      habituation to a particular generated noise. To avoid habituation,
      the generated noise is preferably chaotic, meaning that the length
      of the noises and the time in between the noises is changed
      periodically so that that the organism is not exposed to a
      constant certain pattern.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In another embodiment of the invention, the organism may be
      exposed to a generation of the "natural" noise emitted by the
      organism, with an additional chaotic noise played at the same time
      as (on top of) the natural noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In still yet another embodiment of the invention, the
      target organism is exposed for a continuous time to a certain
      natural noise normally emitted by the organism or to which the
      organism is exposed to in nature (e.g., predators), in order to
      cause the organism to habituate to the noise. For example,
      organisms (particularly, but not necessarily, young ones in the
      larvae stage) are exposed continuously to the mating call of the
      organism, causing the organism to habituate to the mating call.
      Even after the artificially generated noise is removed, the
      organism has become habituated to the mating call, and will not
      respond to it. If the organism fails to respond to the mating
      call, it will fail to mate and thus reproduction is prevented. If
      the organism becomes habituated to the predator, the predator can
      more easily locate and attack the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In yet another embodiment, the target organism is exposed
      to the noise of the organism's natural predators or competitors,
      causing the organism to react. The typical reaction is for the
      organism to attempt to flee from the noise, but if the noise is
      essentially directionless and surrounding the organism, it will
      move around without knowing how to flee away from the noise.
      Exposing the organism to the sound of predators or competitors
      causes them to increase the amount of movement, which tends to
      have negative effects on the organism. In other words, the
      organism expends energy in futile attempts to escape the predatory
      or competitory noise, making it less able to perform other
      necessary life activities such as feeding, mating, caring for
      young, etc. The organism may be too fatigued to perform those
      other necessary life activity behaviors, or may simply not have
      sufficient time to perform them because it is busy moving around
      in its attempt to escape the predatory noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In still yet another embodiment of the invention, the
      device is used to cause individual organisms in the colony to
      attack and maim, even kill, other individuals in the colony. For
      example, the device may be used to generate male mating attraction
      noises that are stronger or louder than normal; exposing a mating
      couple (or a couple about to mate) to these noises has been found
      to cause the male to attack the female, and in some instances
      devour the female.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In other embodiments, when the device is used to generate
      male mating attraction noises that are stronger or louder than
      normal, the female may reject the male and travel towards the
      speaker (where the noise is projected from); the female may then
      try to mate with the speaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the natural
      male mating (attracting) call of the Western Pine Beetle was
      reproduced and played over and over. This caused aberrant behavior
      on the part of the beetles. More specifically, the male beetles
      kept guarding the entrance to the nest, and the female beetles
      tunneled through the wood toward the speakers through which the
      attracting call was played, in what appeared to be an attempt to
      approach what the female beetles thought were male beetles seeking
      to mate.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In still yet other embodiments, the normal tunneling
      behavior of the organisms is disrupted when the device of the
      invention is used. For example, the device may cause the organisms
      to block off the entry to the tunnel, preventing or otherwise
      disrupting other colony members from entering or leaving the tree
      or moving around within the tree. Another type of behavior that
      may be affected is preventing or otherwise disrupting the
      organism's normal behavior of cleaning the tunnels, which often
      precedes the laying of eggs. Yet another type of tunneling
      behavior that is affected is causing the organisms to make shorter
      tunnels than normal.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In most cases, the variety of "natural" noises to which the
      organisms are exposed will be generated as digital audio samples
      that are controlled and manipulated by a dedicated digital
      software application. This software application has the capacity
      to select and combine different audio samples, perform a variety
      of signal processing functions upon these samples, and to control
      their timing, rate of repetition, and playback amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In other embodiments of the invention, these "natural"
      noises can also be implemented as digital or analog audio samples
      stored in "hardware" form within preprogrammed electronic
      integrated circuits (e.g., EPROM chips).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The synthetic chaotic sounds used in the invention may be
      generated by a set of non-linear chaotic oscillators and ancillary
      systems capable of generating an infinite variety of "auditory
      behaviors" emergent from their status as autonomous electronic
      systems. The circuits produce an infinite assortment of complex
      noises and tones that exhibit repetitive action at a local level
      but tremendous global diversity over extended time periods. In
      this sense the circuits resemble the closed nervous systems of
      living unities that are under constant perturbation from other
      similar closed nervous systems. The intention is not to simulate
      the high level functioning of biological organisms and their
      cognitive capacities but rather to take this issue down to its
      most primary level of autonomous-closure machines where
      self-organization is more obviously inseparable from behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Ultimately the emergent complexity of these systems results
      from the dynamical attributes of coupled chaotic attractors
      interacting in a high dimensional phase space. The control of
      circuit parameters determines a range of instabilities and
      structural couplings between nested chaotic circuits, allowing
      these autonomous behaviors to emerge.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The chaotic oscillator circuits used to create the chaotic
      waveforms yield the following double-scroll attractor, as
      illustrated here. FIGURE 2 provides a visual representation of a
      certain sound produced over a certain period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIGURE 3 is a flowchart of one of two primary analog
      electronic units and FIGURE 4 is its schematic circuit diagram.
      These units are linked together through a resistance and feedback
      network as shown below. LPF = low pass filter; LFO = low frequency
      oscillator; PREAMP = preamplifier; NCO = nonlinear chaotic
      oscillator; VACTROL = optoisolator; AMP = amplifier. The circuit
      diagram depicts a functioning prototype of one embodiment of the
      non-linear chaotic oscillator circuit system.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The device according to a preferred embodiment of the
      invention comprises the following four parts: Three of these must
      be capable of emitting a broad range of frequencies (e.g., about
      50 Hz to about 80 kHz): an audio transducer; an amplifier to drive
      the transducer; and a sound generator/processor. The fourth item
      is a power source (e.g., battery, generator or other means).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The invention also contemplates the use of ultrasonic and
      infrasonic frequencies outside the ranges disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The sound generator/processor consists of several
      components: a network of analog chaotic oscillators, digital
      coding and other synthetic and/or biologically relevant sound
      patterns and tones.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] There are many distinct sub-circuits that make up a
      preferred embodiment of the complete system according to the
      invention, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      4 nonlinear chaotic oscillators<br>
      4 low frequency oscillators<br>
      6 low pass filters<br>
      4 line preamps<br>
      4 line amplifiers<br>
      6 multi-channel mixers<br>
      4 opto-isolators<br>
      1 balanced amplitude modulator (ring modulator)<br>
      2 voltage regulators<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The nonlinear chaotic oscillators are capable of increasing
      and decreasing frequency, amplitude, duration, and can also vary
      the rate of change. Nonlinear chaotic oscillators are preferred in
      the invention, because they provide the ability to generate more
      dynamic sounds, such as sounds that change more unpredictably and
      more rapidly. It is possible also to use a linear chaotic
      oscillator, but it will not provide the ideal dynamic sound
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] At least two oscillators are needed to be used in the
      invention, but in a preferred embodiment four oscillators are
      used. [0062] It is preferred that the low pass filters are used,
      but they are not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] As noted above, potential applications for the device and
      method of the invention include, but are not limited to, the
      elimination and/or prevention of infestations of wood-infesting
      organisms in and around private properties, nurseries and
      municipal parks.<br>
