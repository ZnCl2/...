      <div align="center"><b>Kyoto professor makes petroleum easily
          using only water and carbon dioxide…we think</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ... a professor from Kyoto University and his team have found a
      way to create petroleum efficiently and cheaply. Their method uses
      no energy-consuming high pressures or temperatures and only
      requires water, petroleum, and carbon dioxide. As a result, it can
      be done so cheaply that KTV reported 100 yen (US$0.83) of oil can
      be synthesized using only 3 yen ($0.02) worth of electricity....<br>
      <br>
      Professor Tadayuki Imanaka’s technique can be done anywhere with
      very little energy and just a few pieces of specialized equipment.
      The first step involves creating an amount of activated water.
      This is made with nanobubbles (very, very small bubbles) of oxygen
      in electrolysed water under UV light along with a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Then petroleum is mixed in with the activated water. As the saying
      goes, oil and water don’t mix so it needs some substantial shaking
      to get an emulsion. While the oil and water are blending together
      a substance containing CO2 is added to the mix.<br>
      <br>
      fter when the mixture settles and separates again the amount of
      water is decreased but the amount of petroleum is increased.
      Imanaka says that the amount of increase depends on the type of
      oil used such as kerosene or light oil, but ranges from 5 to 10
      percent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The potential</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Imanaka is confident that this method is effective and hopes a
      system of mass production can be developed as early as next year.
      After that his synthetic oil can be made for use in the market in
      large and cheap quantities.<br>
      <br>
      He also claims this oil will be cleaner burning since it doesn’t
      release certain greenhouse gases that contain sulfur and nitrogen
      like natural crude oil does. Furthermore, synthesizing Imanaka’s
      oil would require collecting and using carbon dioxide which could
      help in reducing its impact on the environment as well.<br>
      <br>
      This form of petroleum does have some obvious drawbacks. Firstly
      it requires water which also isn’t a limitless resource. And it is
      still oil which does result in pollution when burned for
      energy....<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Here, we show that petroleum can be formed efficiently at
      normal temperatures and pressures from carbon dioxide and
      activated water. The CO2- nano-bubble containing water was treated
      with TiO2 catalysis in the presence of oxygen under UV
      irradiation. The activated water was mixed vigorously with
      kerosene or light oil and carbon dioxide to form an emulsion. The
      emulsion gradually separated into a two-phase solution. After
      phase separation, the volume of kerosene or light oil, depending
      on which oil was utilized, increased by 5 to 10%. Oxygen gas is
      converted to ozone and further to reactive oxygen species such as
      superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals. The reactive
      oxygen species may reduce carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, as
      follows, 2 CO2 ⇔ 2CO+O2 (reaction 1), the generated carbon
      monoxide may form hydrogen from water, as follows, CO+H2O⇔CO2+H2
      (reaction 2), as a total, CO2+H2O⇔CO+H2+O2 (reaction 3). All
      reactions were carried out at room temperature and normal
      pressure. The oil generation reaction may occur as radical
      emulsion polymerization in micelles and be written as follows,
      nCO+(2n+1)H2⇒CnH2n+2+nH2O (reaction 4). From reactions 3 and 4,
      mass balance is shown as follows, nCO2+(n+1)H2⇒CnH2n+2+nO2
      (reaction 5).<br>

      FIELD: chemical industry.SUBSTANCE: invention relates to a method
      for the synthesis of hydrocarbons. Method of synthesis of
      hydrocarbons is carried out by restoring carbon dioxide in water,
      in which oxygen nanobubbles are formed by supplying oxygen to
      water containing carbon dioxide; water, containing oxygen
      nanobubbles, is irradiated with ultraviolet light in the presence
      of a photocatalyst to produce active oxygen; and carbon dioxide is
      reduced in the presence of active oxygen. Device for the synthesis
      of hydrocarbons is also claimed.EFFECT: technical result is an
      increase in the yield of hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method for synthesizing
      a hydrocarbon by reducing carbon dioxide in water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] As a method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon by reducing
      carbon dioxide in water, there has hitherto been known a method in
      which the synthesis is performed by adding hydrogen under
      conditions of high temperature and high pressure. However, such a
      conventional method performs the synthesis by adding hydrogen
      under the conditions of high temperature and high pressure, and
      accordingly is unfortunately high in the apparatus cost, and makes
      cumbersome the apparatus maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Consequently, there has been proposed a method for
      synthesizing a hydrocarbon without requiring the addition of
      hydrogen and the conditions of high temperature and high pressure
      (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 5131444). In the method for
      synthesizing a hydrocarbon shown in Japanese Patent No. 5131444, a
      gas column of carbon dioxide is formed in water, a swirling flow
      of water is generated around the gas column, thus carbon dioxide
      is fed into water as fine gas bubbles, the water containing fine
      gas bubbles of carbon dioxide is irradiated with ultraviolet light
      in the presence of a photocatalyst in the atmospheric pressure
      atmosphere to reduce the carbon dioxide, and thus a hydrocarbon is
      synthesized.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] However, in the method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon as
      shown in Japanese Patent No. 5131444, the formation of a gas
      column of carbon dioxide in water is always required, and the
      generation of a swirling flow of water around the gas column of
      carbon dioxide is also required; thus, a mechanism for forming the
      gas column of carbon dioxide and the swirling flow of water is
      required, and thus, the reaction mechanism is unfortunately
      complicated.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
      provide a method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon, capable of
      efficiently synthesizing a hydrocarbon by reducing carbon dioxide
      in water on the basis of an easy reaction mechanism, and an
      apparatus for synthesizing a hydrocarbon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The invention according to a first aspect of the present
      invention is a method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon by reducing
      carbon dioxide in water, wherein nanobubbles of oxygen are
      generated by feeding oxygen into water containing carbon dioxide,
      water containing the nanobubbles of oxygen is irradiated with
      ultraviolet light in the presence of a photocatalyst to produce
      active oxygen, and carbon dioxide is reduced in the presence of
      the active oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The invention according to a second aspect of the present
      invention is a method wherein in the method for synthesizing a
      hydrocarbon according to the first aspect, carbon dioxide is
      reduced in the presence of a separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon and the active oxygen produced from the nanobubbles of
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The invention according to a third aspect of the present
      invention is an apparatus for synthesizing a hydrocarbon by
      reducing carbon dioxide in water, including a nanobubble
      generation unit for generating nanobubbles of oxygen by feeding
      oxygen into water containing carbon dioxide, and an ultraviolet
      light irradiation unit for irradiating the water containing
      nanobubbles of oxygen generated by the nanobubble generation unit
      with ultraviolet light in the presence of a photocatalyst, wherein
      carbon dioxide is reduced in the presence of active oxygen
      produced by irradiating the water containing nanobubbles of oxygen
      with ultraviolet light by the ultraviolet light irradiation unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to the present invention, a hydrocarbon is
      synthesized by reducing carbon dioxide in the presence of active
      oxygen produced by irradiating water containing nanobubbles of
      oxygen with ultraviolet light, and accordingly, a hydrocarbon can
      be synthesized simply by using water containing carbon dioxide.
      Accordingly, a hydrocarbon can be synthesized with an easy
      reaction mechanism, and at the same time, a hydrocarbon can be
      synthesized efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In addition, according to the present invention, carbon
      dioxide is reduced in the presence of a separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon and the active oxygen produced from the nanobubbles of
      oxygen, a hydrocarbon can be synthesized in a larger amount.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] First, the method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon according
      to the present invention (the first method), and the synthesis
      apparatus of the first method.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] As shown in FIG. 1, the synthesis apparatus 10 for
      synthesizing a hydrocarbon by the method for synthesizing a
      hydrocarbon according to the present invention includes: a water
      tank 11 for containing carbon dioxide-dissolved water A; a
      nanobubble generator 12 (an example of “the nanobubble generation
      unit”) for generating nanobubbles of oxygen (ultrafine bubbles of
      oxygen of a few hundred nanometers or less); and a photocatalyst
      apparatus 14 (an example of “the ultraviolet light irradiation
      unit”) for irradiating the water A containing nanobubbles of
      oxygen with ultraviolet light in the presence of a photocatalyst
      (such as titanium oxide or zinc oxide).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In the water tank 11, a predetermined amount of water A
      allowed to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane is contained.
      In the water A contained in the water tank 11, carbon dioxide is
      dissolved. It is to be noted that although not shown in FIG. 1, a
      carbon dioxide feed source such as a carbon dioxide cylinder is
      provided outside the water tank 11, and there may be adopted a
      configuration in which carbon dioxide is fed from the
      aforementioned carbon dioxide feed source to the water tank 11 (a
      configuration to fill the interior of the water tank 11 with
      carbon dioxide). The water A is not limited to water allowed to
      pass through a reverse osmosis membrane, but any carbon
      dioxide-dissolving water may be adopted. The water A is preferably
      a water allowed to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane to
      remove impurities such as ions or salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The nanobubble generator 12 is an ultrafine pore type
      nanobubble generator. The nanobubble generator 12 is connected to
      an oxygen feed source 15 such as an oxygen cylinder, and generates
      nanobubbles of oxygen in the interior of the water tank 11 on the
      basis of the oxygen fed from the oxygen feed source 15.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The nanobubble generator 12 includes an oxygen jetting
      section for jetting a gaseous layer (gas bubbles) of oxygen and a
      water jetting section for jetting the water A in the water tank
      11. In the nanobubble generator 12, the oxygen jetting section and
      the water jetting section are placed in the water tank 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the oxygen jetting section, a special ceramic filter
      having nano-level fine pores is arranged, and from the
      aforementioned fine pores, a gaseous layer (gas bubbles) of oxygen
      is jetted. In the water jetting section, the water A in the water
      tank 11 is jetted to the special ceramic filter, and consequently
      the liquid flow of the water A flows on the surface of the special
      ceramic filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the nanobubble generator 12, by giving the liquid flow
      of the water A in the water tank 11 to the boundaries of the fine
      pores of the special ceramic filter, the gaseous layer (gas
      bubbles) of oxygen jetted from the oxygen jetting section (fine
      pores) is finely cut. Then, the cut gaseous layer (gas bubbles) of
      oxygen is compressed by the surface tension of the water A in the
      water tank 11, and thus nanobubbles (ultrafine gas bubbles) of
      oxygen are generated. It is to be noted that the nanobubble
      generator 12 is not limited to an ultrafine pore type, and may be
      any other heretofore known nanobubble generator that is an
      apparatus capable of generating nanobubbles of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As shown in FIG. 1, the photocatalyst apparatus 14 has UV
      lamps 13 for irradiating the water A containing nanobubbles of
      oxygen with ultraviolet light, and a reaction tube 17 provided
      with a photocatalyst in the interior thereof. The UV lamps 13 are
      arranged around the reaction tube 17, and radiate ultraviolet
      light to the reaction tube 17. The reaction tube 17 is a tubular
      vessel capable of transmitting ultraviolet light, and is
      constituted so as to allow the water A containing nanobubbles of
      oxygen to pass through the inside thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the photocatalyst apparatus 14, the water A containing
      nanobubbles of oxygen is fed at a predetermined flow rate in the
      inside of the reaction tube 17 charged with a photocatalyst, and
      the aforementioned water A passing through the inside of the
      reaction tube 17 is irradiated with ultraviolet light. Then, the
      water A having passed through the photocatalyst apparatus 14 is
      again got back to the photocatalyst apparatus 14 by a circulation
      pump 16, and is circulated for a predetermined time by the
      circulation pump 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In the synthesis apparatus 10, first, nanobubbles of oxygen
      are generated by the nanobubble generator 12 in the water A
      containing carbon dioxide in the water tank 11. In this way, the
      generated nanobubbles of oxygen stay in the water A in the water
      tank 11 (visually transparent). Then, the water A containing the
      generated nanobubbles of oxygen is fed to the photocatalyst
      apparatus 14, and thus, the water A containing the nanobubbles of
      oxygen is irradiated with ultraviolet light in the presence of a
      photocatalyst. In this way, as shown in the reaction formula (1),
      the active oxygen such as a superoxide anion radical or a hydroxyl
      radical is produced from oxygen in a nanobubble state through the
      intermediary of ozone.<br>
      <br>
      3O2→2O3→active oxygen (O2&lt;−&gt;., OH. or the like)  (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0023] At the same time, as shown in the reaction formula (2), the
      reduction reaction of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water A
      occurs.<br>
      <br>
      CO2+H2O→CO+H2+O2  (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The reduction reaction of carbon dioxide in the reaction
      formula (2) occurs in the presence of the active oxygen produced
      in the reaction formula (1), and accordingly, the reaction shown
      in the reaction formula (3) proceeds. By the reaction shown in the
      reaction formula (3), a hydrocarbon is synthesized.<br>
      <br>
      (2n+1)H2+nCO→CnH2n+2+nH2O  (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In other words, a hydrocarbon is synthesized by reducing
      carbon dioxide in the presence of the active oxygen produced from
      the oxygen in a nanobubble state.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As described above, the synthesis apparatus 10 has a
      constitution such that nanobubbles of oxygen are generated in the
      water A containing carbon dioxide dissolved therein, and a
      hydrocarbon is synthesized by reducing carbon dioxide by
      irradiating the water A with ultraviolet light in the
      photocatalyst apparatus 14 while the water A containing the
      aforementioned nanobubbles of oxygen is being circulated;
      consequently, a hydrocarbon can be synthesized simply by using
      water containing carbon dioxide and nanobubbles of oxygen (without
      forming a gas column of carbon dioxide or a swirling flow of
      water). Accordingly, a hydrocarbon can be synthesized on the basis
      of a facile reaction mechanism, and a hydrocarbon can also be
      synthesized efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Next, another synthesis method (the second method) of the
      method for synthesizing a hydrocarbon according to the present
      invention and the synthesis apparatus of the another synthesis
      method are described.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The another method of the method for synthesizing a
      hydrocarbon according to the present invention is a method for
      newly synthesizing a liquid hydrocarbon by reducing carbon dioxide
      in the presence of a separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon and
      the active oxygen produced by the above-described synthesis method
      (the first method).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Herein, the separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon means a
      liquid hydrocarbon preliminarily prepared by a method other than
      the aforementioned second method, and being a liquid hydrocarbon
      (source oil) having an approximately the same composition as the
      composition of the liquid hydrocarbon to be synthesized by the
      second method. In other words, the separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon means a liquid hydrocarbon (source oil) preliminarily
      prepared by a different method other than the above-described
      first method and the aforementioned second method concerned. In
      the case where a liquid hydrocarbon is preliminarily synthesized
      by the above-described first method, the resulting liquid
      hydrocarbon is also included in the separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon. Moreover, examples of the separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon (source oil) include a hydrocarbon having 6 to 36
      carbon atoms such as light oil and kerosene.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The synthesis apparatus 20 for synthesizing a hydrocarbon
      by this method (the second method) include: a first feed tank 21
      for feeding the separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon E (source
      oil); a second feed tank 22 for feeding the water A containing the
      active oxygen produced by the above-described first method; a
      reaction tank 23 for allowing the liquid hydrocarbon E and the
      water A containing active oxygen to react with each other; and a
      still standing tank 24 for allowing the liquid hydrocarbon E (new
      oil) after the reaction and the water A to stand still.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In the synthesis apparatus 20, first, a liquid mixture
      composed of the separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon E (source
      oil) and the water A containing the active oxygen produced by the
      above-described first method is fed to the reaction tank 23 while
      the liquid mixture is being sprayed under a predetermined
      pressure. In this way, micelles are formed between the liquid
      hydrocarbon E and the water A containing active oxygen. At the
      same time, the interior of the reaction tank 23 is filled with
      carbon dioxide by feeding carbon dioxide from a carbon dioxide
      feed source 25 such as a carbon dioxide cylinder to the reaction
      tank 23. Herewith, carbon dioxide is taken into the micelles
      formed as described above. Simultaneously, in the reaction tank 23
      filled with carbon dioxide, the liquid hydrocarbon E and the water
      A containing the active oxygen are stirred by a stirrer 26 of the
      reaction tank 23. It is to be noted that the temperature inside
      the reaction tank 23 is from room temperature to preferably
      approximately 40° C. and more preferably to approximately 30° C.
      In addition, the pressure inside the reaction tank 23 is the
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] After the stirring (after the reaction), the liquid mixture
      D composed of the liquid hydrocarbon E and the water A is fed from
      the reaction tank 23 to the still standing tank 24. Then, the
      aforementioned liquid mixture D is allowed to stand still for a
      predetermined time (for example, 24 hours). Herewith, the liquid
      hydrocarbon E is produced as a supernatant liquid of the liquid
      mixture D in the still standing tank 24 in the upper layer of the
      liquid mixture D. The amount of the liquid hydrocarbon E (new oil)
      produced in the upper layer of the liquid mixture D is increased
      by 10 to 15% as compared with the amount of the separately
      prepared liquid hydrocarbon E (source oil). In other words, a new
      liquid hydrocarbon E (new oil) is produced by the second method.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Alternatively, it is also possible to repeat the second
      method by isolating the liquid hydrocarbon E (new oil) produced in
      the upper layer of the liquid mixture D from the liquid mixture D,
      mixing the isolated liquid hydrocarbon E (new oil) with the water
      A containing the active oxygen, and again feeding the resultant
      mixture to the reaction tank 23. In this way, the amount of the
      liquid hydrocarbon E (new oil) produced in the upper layer of the
      liquid mixture D is increased by 20 to 30% as compared with the
      amount of the separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon E (source
      oil). In other words, by repeating a plurality of times the second
      method, the amount of the newly produced liquid hydrocarbon E (new
      oil) is further increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In this way, in the synthesis apparatus 20, carbon dioxide
      can be reduced by mixing the separately prepared liquid
      hydrocarbon (source oil) and the water containing nanobubbles of
      oxygen, and accordingly as compared with the case where the
      separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon (source oil) is not
      included, the reduction of carbon dioxide is promoted and the
      hydrocarbon can be synthesized in a larger amount. In other words,
      by further adding the separately prepared liquid hydrocarbon in
      the presence of the active oxygen produced by irradiating water
      containing nanobubbles of oxygen with ultraviolet light, the
      reduction of carbon dioxide is promoted and the hydrocarbon is
      efficiently synthesized.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Hereinafter, Example 1 of the present invention and
      Comparative Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 in relation to
      Example 1 are described. It is to be noted that the present
      invention is not limited to Example 1 at all.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] In the synthesis apparatus 10, 50 L of water obtained by
      allowing tap water to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane was
      placed in the water tank 11. Then, the nanobubble generator 12 was
      operated in the water tank 11 to jet nanobubbles of oxygen into
      the aforementioned water, and carbon dioxide was jetted into the
      aforementioned water from a carbon dioxide cylinder arranged
      outside the water tank 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] While the water into which nanobubbles of oxygen and carbon
      dioxide were jetted was being fed at a flow rate of 18 L/min to
      the photocatalyst apparatus 14, the water was irradiated with
      ultraviolet light by using the UV lamps 13 in the presence of
      titanium oxide (photocatalyst). The aforementioned water was
      circulated between the photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water
      tank 11 for 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] It is to be noted that in order to allow nanobubbles of
      oxygen and carbon dioxide to stay (to be dissolved) sufficiently
      in the water tank 11, nanobubbles of oxygen and carbon dioxide
      were continuously jetted into the water tank 11 to be dissolved in
      the water even while the water was circulated between the
      photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water tank 11 for 24 hours. In
      order to prevent the volatilization of the produced hydrocarbon,
      the upper surface of the water tank 11 was sealed with a seal
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] In the synthesis apparatus 10, 50 L of water obtained by
      allowing tap water to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane was
      placed in the water tank 11. Then, oxygen was fed into the water
      tank 11 from an oxygen cylinder arranged outside the water tank 11
      to jet oxygen into the aforementioned water, and carbon dioxide
      was jetted into the aforementioned water from a carbon dioxide
      cylinder arranged outside the water tank 11. In other words,
      oxygen not being in a state of nanobubbles was fed to the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Moreover, while the water into which oxygen and carbon
      dioxide were jetted was being fed at a flow rate of 18 L/min to
      the photocatalyst apparatus 14, the water was irradiated with
      ultraviolet light by using the UV lamps 13 in the presence of
      titanium oxide (photocatalyst). The aforementioned water was
      circulated between the photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water
      tank 11 for 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] It is to be noted that similarly to Example 1, in order to
      allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to stay (to be dissolved)
      sufficiently in the water tank 11, oxygen and carbon dioxide were
      continuously jetted into the water tank 11 to be dissolved in the
      water even while the water was circulated between the
      photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water tank 11 for 24 hours. In
      order to prevent the volatilization of the produced hydrocarbon,
      the upper surface of the water tank 11 was sealed with a seal
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] In the synthesis apparatus 10, 50 L of water obtained by
      allowing tap water to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane was
      placed in the water tank 11. Then, while the aforementioned water
      was being fed at a flow rate of 18 L/min to the photocatalyst
      apparatus 14, the water was irradiated with ultraviolet light by
      using the UV lamps 13 in the presence of titanium oxide
      (photocatalyst). Then, the aforementioned water was circulated
      between the photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water tank 11 for
      24 hours. In other words, in Comparative Example 2, only the
      dissolved oxygen and the dissolved carbon dioxide being dissolved
      in the water placed in the water tank 11 were used, and the
      amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide fed to the water were made
      smaller as compared with Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. In
      order to prevent the volatilization of the produced hydrocarbon,
      the upper surface of the water tank 11 was sealed with a seal
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In each of Example 1, Comparative Example 1 and Comparative
      Example 2, a certain amount of water was sampled from the water
      circulated between the photocatalyst apparatus 14 and the water
      tank 11 for 24 hours, and from the sampled water, a hydrocarbon
      was extracted by using diethyl ether. Then, the extracted
      hydrocarbon was completely dehydrated, and then analyzed with a
      GC-Mass (SHIMADZU GC-2010).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As a result of performing the analysis with the GC-Mass,
      the hydrocarbons extracted in Example 1, Comparative Example 1 and
      Comparative Example 2 were found to be saturated hydrocarbons
      having 15 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As a result of measuring the amounts of the saturated
      hydrocarbons produced in Example 1, Comparative Example 1 and
      Comparative Example 2, it was verified that 500 mg of a saturated
      hydrocarbon, 200 mg of a saturated hydrocarbon and 100 mg or less
      of a saturated hydrocarbon were produced in Example 1, Comparative
      Example 1 and Comparative Example 2, respectively. In other words,
      it has been found that a saturated hydrocarbon is produced in a
      high yield by treating water containing nanobubbles of oxygen in
      the photocatalyst apparatus 14. It has also been found that in
      order to produce a saturated hydrocarbon in a high yield, it is
      necessary to feed sufficient amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide
      to the water to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Next, Example 2 of the present invention and Comparative
      Example 3 in relation to Example 2 are described. It is to be
      noted that the present invention is not limited by Example 2 at
      all.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] In the synthesis apparatus 10, 100 L of water obtained by
      allowing tap water to pass through a reverse osmosis membrane was
      placed in the water tank 11. Then, the nanobubble generator 12 was
      operated for 120 minutes in the water tank 11 to jet nanobubbles
      of oxygen into the water and the nanobubbles of oxygen were
      retained in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Moreover, while the water containing nanobubbles of oxygen
      was being fed at a flow rate of 18 L/min to the photocatalyst
      apparatus 14, the water was irradiated with ultraviolet light by
      using the UV lamps 13 in the presence of titanium oxide
      (photocatalyst). Then, the water containing nanobubbles of oxygen
      was circulated in the photocatalyst apparatus 14 for 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Moreover, a liquid mixture composed of 2.5 l of a
      preliminarily prepared light oil (source oil) and 2.5 L of the
      water containing nanobubbles of oxygen treated in the
      photocatalyst apparatus 14 was fed to the reaction tank 23 while
      the liquid mixture was being sprayed under a pressure of 1.0 MPa.
      Simultaneously, 500 L or more of carbon dioxide was fed under a
      pressure of 0.3 MPa to the reaction tank 23 to fill the reaction
      tank 23 with carbon dioxide. Simultaneously, the light oil and the
      water were stirred for 4 minutes in the reaction tank 23 filled
      with carbon dioxide. It is to be noted that the temperature in the
      reaction tank 23 was set at 30° C. The reaction was performed in
      the atmospheric pressure atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] After the stirring for 4 minutes (after the reaction), the
      liquid mixture composed of the light oil and the water was fed
      from the reaction tank 23 to the still standing tank 24, and was
      allowed to stand still in the still standing tank 24 for 24 hours.
      The temperature inside the still standing tank 24 was set at 35°
      C. The still standing of the liquid mixture was performed in the
      atmospheric pressure atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] In Comparative Example 3, the treatment was performed under
      the same conditions as in Example 2 except that the oxygen to be
      fed to the water placed in the water tank 11 was altered from “the
      nanobubbles of oxygen” in foregoing Example 2 to “the oxygen not
      being in a state of nanobubbles” jetted from the oxygen cylinder
      arranged outside the water tank 11 (the state in which the oxygen
      fed from the oxygen cylinder was directly jetted into the water
      tank 11).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In Example 2, after the still standing for 24 hours, the
      supernatant liquid was isolated from the aforementioned liquid
      mixture in the still standing tank 24, and the isolated
      supernatant liquid (new oil) was analyzed. The analysis was
      performed with respect to the items shown in Table 1. As a
      comparison, the light oil (source oil) before the treatment in the
      reaction tank 23 was also analyzed with respect to the same items.
      Consequently, as shown in Table 1, the supernatant liquid (new
      oil) was found to be a light oil comparable to the light oil
      (source oil) before the treatment in the reaction tank 23.<br>

      [0053] In each of Example 2 and Comparative Example 3, the amount
      of the supernatant liquid (light oil) isolated from the
      aforementioned liquid mixture in the still standing tank 24 was
      measured. Consequently, in Example 2, the amount of the
      supernatant liquid (light oil) was 2.80 L. Specifically, the
      amount of the preliminarily prepared light oil was 2.5 L, and
      hence the amount of the newly synthesized light oil was found to
      be 0.3 L (yield: 12%). On the other hand, in Comparative Example
      3, the amount of the supernatant liquid (light oil) was 2.58 L.
      Specifically, the amount of the newly synthesized light oil was
      found to be 0.08 L (yield: 3.2%). From the above-described
      results, it has been able to be verified that the use of “the
      nanobubbles of oxygen” increases the amount (yield) of the newly
      synthesized light oil.<br>

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a new method for producing a
      hydrocarbon-based compound capable of efficiently producing a
      hydrocarbon-based compound.SOLUTION: Provided is a method for
      producing a hydrocarbon-based compound comprising: a step (a)
      where functional water including carbon dioxide-containing
      nanobubbles and active oxygen in water is prepared; and a step (b)
      where the functional water and a hydrocarbon-based
      compound-containing liquid matter are mixed and impact force is
      applied thereto, in which the amount of the hydrocarbon-based
      compound in the mixture applied with the impact force is made
      higher than that of the hydrocarbon-based compound in the liquid
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      producing a hydrocarbon compound.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      Conventionally, the Fischer-Tropsch method is known as a method
      for chemically synthesizing petroleum.<br>
      This process is a series of processes in which carbon monoxide is
      reacted with hydrogen gas to obtain a saturated hydrocarbon
      compound together with water. However, in this method, since the
      reaction is carried out using hydrogen gas under high temperature
      and high pressure conditions, it is necessary to ensure safety and
      the production cost is high (carbon monoxide as a raw material is
      obtained from carbon or the like In this case, the amount of
      carbon dioxide released is large, and it is inefficient such that
      multiple processes are required to obtain a saturated hydrocarbon
      compound.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      On the other hand, as a method without using carbon monoxide and
      hydrogen, a method of reducing carbon dioxide to obtain methane
      and / or methanol is known (see Patent Document 1). Patent
      Document 1 discloses a method in which a gas column of carbon
      dioxide is formed in water and a swirling flow of water is
      generated around the gas column so that carbon dioxide is supplied
      as fine bubbles in water and supplied in the presence of a
      photocatalyst And carbon dioxide is reduced by irradiating light
      containing water containing fine bubbles of carbon dioxide to
      obtain methane and / or methanol.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      Japanese Patent No. 5131444<br>
      [0005]<br>
      However, according to the study of the present inventors, it has
      become clear by the method described in Patent Document 1 that
      only a small amount of methane and / or methanol is obtained,
      which is not practical.<br>
      Also, Patent Document 1 does not disclose anything about
      synthesizing a hydrocarbon compound other than methane and / or
      methanol.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      An object of the present invention is to provide a method and
      apparatus for producing a novel hydrocarbon compound capable of
      efficiently producing a hydrocarbon compound.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      Means for Solving the Problem The present inventors prepared
      functional water containing carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles
      and active oxygen in water, and mixed such a functional substance
      with a liquid material containing a hydrocarbon compound to impart
      an impact force, We have obtained unique knowledge that the amount
      of the compound increases, in other words, a new hydrocarbon
      compound is generated by the reaction, and as a result of further
      diligent research, we have completed the present invention.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, there is
      provided a process for producing a hydrocarbon-based compound
      comprising the steps of: (a) preparing functional water containing
      carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles and active oxygen in water;
      and (b) Based compound and a liquid material containing a
      hydrocarbon compound, and applying an impact force, wherein the
      amount of the hydrocarbon compound in the mixture to which the
      impact force is applied is higher than the amount of the
      hydrocarbon in the liquid material containing the hydrocarbon
      compound The amount of the compound is higher than the amount of
      the compound.<br>
      [0009]<br>
      In one embodiment of the process for producing a hydrocarbon-based
      compound of the present invention, (a) comprises (i) supplying
      carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles in water and (ii) supplying
      at least oxygen into water, And irradiating the oxygen-supplied
      water with light in the presence of the photocatalyst to generate
      active oxygen.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      In the above embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound of the present invention, the carbon dioxide-containing
      nanobubbles may be air nanobubbles, and the (ii) may include
      supplying carbon dioxide into the water.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      Alternatively, in the above embodiment of the method for producing
      a hydrocarbon compound of the present invention, the carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles may be carbon dioxide nanobubbles.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      In one embodiment of the process for producing a hydrocarbon-based
      compound of the present invention, the functional water may have a
      dissolved oxygen concentration of 10 ppm or more.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      In one embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound of the present invention, the water used in the step (a)
      may be pure water.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      In one embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound of the present invention, the step (b) is a step of
      previously mixing the functional water and a liquid material
      containing the hydrocarbon compound before applying the impact
      force .<br>
      [0015]<br>
      In one embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound of the present invention, the impact force in the above
      (b) is such that the functional water and the liquid substance
      containing the hydrocarbon compound are discharged from the nozzle
      together to form a liquid Can be added by collision.<br>
      [0016]<br>
      In one embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon-based
      compound of the present invention, the production method
      comprises: (c) separating the mixture to which the impact force is
      applied into a water phase and a phase containing a hydrocarbon-
      For example.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      In one embodiment of the method for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound of the present invention, the liquid material containing

      Hereinafter, embodiments of the method and apparatus for producing
      a hydrocarbon compound according to the present invention will be
      described in detail with reference to the drawings, but the
      present invention is not limited to such embodiments.<br>
      [0028]<br>
      (Embodiment 1) The production of a hydrocarbon compound in this
      embodiment includes (a) a step of preparing carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles and functional water containing
      active oxygen in water (front part, see FIG. 1) and (b) A step of
      adding an impulsive force by mixing functional water and a liquid
      material containing a hydrocarbon compound (the latter part, see
      FIG. 2).<br>
      [0029]<br>
      Step (a) First, prepare functional water.<br>
      In the present invention, functional water means an aqueous fluid
      containing carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles and active oxygen
      in water.<br>
      Carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles are composed of carbon
      dioxide-containing gas (it may be at least a gas including carbon
      dioxide, the carbon dioxide content is not particularly limited,
      and may be, for example, within a range of 0.01 to 100 vol%)
      (Ultrafine bubbles) having a diameter of less than 1 μm, for
      example less than a few hundred nm.<br>
      Nanobubbles can be present (retained and / or dissolved) in water
      for a long time compared to larger diameter bubbles.<br>
      Active oxygen (which may also be referred to as reactive oxygen
      species) is a substance derived from an oxygen molecule and having
      higher reactivity than oxygen molecules.<br>
      The active oxygen is preferably a radical containing an oxygen
      atom, more specifically, a superoxide anion radical (O 2
      &lt;-&gt;.), A hydroxyl radical (OH •), or the like.<br>
      However, the active oxygen is not limited to these radicals, and
      may be hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, or the like.<br>
      [0030]<br>
      Such functional water can be obtained by (i) supplying carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles into water, and (ii) supplying at
      least oxygen into water, irradiating the water supplied with at
      least oxygen with light in the presence of a photocatalyst To
      produce active oxygen.<br>
      [0031]<br>
      Such functional water can be produced, for example, by a
      functional water production unit as shown in FIG. 1 (a front part
      of a hydrocarbon-based compound production apparatus in this
      embodiment).<br>
      1 (a), the functional water production unit 10 includes a water
      tub 11 for containing water, a first supply unit 13 for supplying
      at least carbon dioxide in water in the form of nanobubbles, a
      supply unit 13 for supplying at least oxygen And a light
      irradiating section 23 for irradiating light to the water supplied
      with at least oxygen in the presence of a photocatalyst to
      generate active oxygen.<br>
      [0032]<br>
      First, water 7 is supplied from a line 1 to a water tank 11.<br>
      It is preferable that this water contain as little impurities as
      possible, so-called pure water can be used, and ultra pure water
      is more preferably used.<br>
      Pure water or ultrapure water may be obtained by treating with,
      for example, an ion exchange resin (cation exchange resin and
      anion exchange resin) and / or a reverse osmosis membrane or the
      like.<br>
      [0033]<br>
      Step (i) Next, at least carbon dioxide (a gas containing at least
      carbon dioxide, that is, a carbon dioxide-containing gas) is
      supplied from the first supply part 13 connected to the carbon
      dioxide supply source 3 into the water 7 stored in the water tub
      11, In the form of nanobubbles.<br>
      As a result, carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles are supplied
      into the water, the concentration of carbon dioxide in water can
      be increased, and carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles can be
      retained in water due to the surface tension of water.<br>
      [0034]<br>
      In the present embodiment, a carbon dioxide gas cylinder or the
      like is used as the carbon dioxide supply source 3, and carbon
      dioxide gas (for example, purity of 99 vol% or more) is supplied
      as a carbon dioxide-containing gas in the form of nanobubbles to
      convert the carbon dioxide nano bubbles However, the present
      invention is not limited to this.<br>
      [0035]<br>
      The first supply unit 13 has a function of generating nanobubbles,
      and can therefore be understood as a nanobubble generator.<br>
      For the first supply unit 13, for example, an ultra fine hole type
      nanobubble generator can be used.<br>
      The ultra fine hole type nanobubble generator is composed of a gas
      ejecting portion for ejecting a gas layer (bubble) of gas (carbon
      dioxide-containing gas in the present invention, which is carbon
      dioxide gas in the present embodiment) And a water ejecting
      portion for ejecting the water 7, and the gas ejecting portion and
      the water ejecting portion are charged into the water 7.<br>
      A special ceramic filter having nano-level fine pores is provided
      in the gas ejecting portion, and an air layer (bubble) of the
      carbon dioxide-containing gas is ejected from the micropores.<br>
      On the other hand, in the water injection portion, the water 7 in
      the water tub 11 is injected to this special ceramic filter,
      whereby a liquid flow of water flows on the surface of the special
      ceramic filter.<br>
      Then, by giving the liquid flow of the water 7 in the water tub 11
      to the boundary of the fine pores of the special ceramic filter,
      the air layer (bubble) of the carbon dioxide-containing gas
      injected from the gas jet portion (micropore) is finely cut .<br>
      Then, a gas layer (bubble) of the cut carbon dioxide-containing
      gas is compressed by the surface tension of the water 7 in the
      water tank 11, whereby nanobubbles (ultrafine bubbles) of the
      carbon dioxide-containing gas are generated.<br>
      However, the nanobubble generator is not limited to the ultra-fine
      hole type, but any suitable nanobubble generator can be applied as
      long as it can generate nanobubbles of carbon dioxide-containing
      gas.<br>
      [0036]<br>
      Step (ii) Further, in the water 7 stored in the water tub 11, at
      least oxygen (at least oxygen-containing gas, that is,
      oxygen-containing gas may be used and oxygen The content is not
      particularly limited and may be, for example, within the range of
      1 to 100% by volume).<br>
      The second supply unit 15 may have any suitable configuration
      capable of supplying the oxygen-containing gas into the water, and
      may be a pressure bubbling type tube, a nozzle, etc. (Note that in
      FIG. 1 (a) For the purpose of illustrating the supply part 15,
      only the tip part thereof is schematically shown with an open
      square).<br>
      [0037]<br>
      In this embodiment, an oxygen gas cylinder or the like is used as
      the oxygen supply source 5, and oxygen gas (for example, purity of
      99 vol% or more) is supplied as an oxygen-containing gas, but the
      present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
      [0038]<br>
      As a result, the water 7 supplied with at least oxygen (or
      oxygen-containing gas, hereinafter the same) is pumped out by the
      pump 21 to the withdrawn portion 17 of the water tub 11 (for the
      purpose of illustrating the extraction portion 17 in FIG. 1A ,
      Only the tip portion of which is schematically shown by an open
      square) is drawn out through a line 19 and transferred to the
      light irradiation unit 23.<br>
      The light irradiation unit 23 may be a light irradiation device
      including a reaction tube 25 through which water supplied with at
      least oxygen passes, and a light source 27 disposed in the
      vicinity thereof. A photocatalyst (not shown) such as titanium
      oxide is charged and / or arranged in the reaction tube 25, and is
      made of a material that can transmit light irradiated from the
      light source 27 at least at a portion where the photocatalyst is
      located. The light source 27 may be any one as long as it can
      irradiate a light beam (for example, ultraviolet light, visible
      light, sunlight, etc.) having an appropriate wavelength according
      to the photocatalyst to be used. In the case of using titanium
      oxide as the photocatalyst, the light source 27 may irradiate at
      least a light beam having a wavelength in the ultraviolet region,
      and a UV lamp and / or a black light may be used.<br>
      [0039]<br>
      In the light irradiator 23, light having at least oxygen supplied
      thereto as described above is irradiated with light from the light
      source 27 in the presence of the photocatalyst while passing
      through the reaction tube 25, so that active oxygen is generated.
      More specifically, oxygen becomes ozone, and furthermore, it
      becomes active oxygen such as superoxide anion radical (O 2
      &lt;-&gt;.), Hydroxyl radical (OH ·).<br>
      [0040]<br>
      As a result, the water 7 contains active oxygen and is returned
      from the light irradiator 23 to the water tank 11 through the line
      29. While supplying at least oxygen into the water from the second
      supply unit 15 (oxygen-containing gas in the present invention,
      oxygen gas in the present embodiment), the pump 21 is operated and
      water containing oxygen is discharged from the extraction portion
      17 By drawing out and circulating through the line 19, the light
      irradiation part 23, the line 29, and the water tub 11, it is
      possible to obtain a sufficient active oxygen concentration.<br>
      [0041]<br>
      The position and quantity (or flow rate) of the oxygen-containing
      gas supply from the second supply 15 can be withdrawn from the
      draw-out 17 with a large part, preferably substantially all, of
      the suction force of the pump 21 As shown in FIG. In general, it
      is preferable to dispose the second supply part 15 (the position
      of the oxygen-containing gas supply) inside or in the vicinity of
      the withdrawal part 17 and supply the oxygen-containing gas
      therefrom in a relatively small amount (small flow rate) .
      Although not limited to this embodiment, for example, as shown in
      FIG. 1 (b), the tip portion (or supply port portion) of the second
      supply portion 15 may be inserted into the opening portion of the
      extraction portion 17 .<br>
      [0042]<br>
      Functional water containing carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles
      (nanobubbles of carbon dioxide in the present embodiment) and
      active oxygen in water can be obtained by the above steps (i) and
      (ii). The order of carrying out steps (i) and (ii) is not
      particularly limited, either which may be carried out first or at
      the same time so as to overlap at least partially.<br>
      [0043]<br>
      Step (b) Impact force is applied by mixing functional water
      prepared as described above and a liquid material containing a
      hydrocarbon compound.<br>
      [0044]<br>
      The imparting of the impact force can be carried out by, for
      example, a reaction unit as shown in FIG. 2 (a latter stage
      portion of the hydrocarbon-based compound producing apparatus in
      this embodiment).<br>
      2, the reaction unit 30 includes a first tank 31 that contains
      functional water A containing water and carbon dioxide-containing
      nanobubbles and active oxygen, and a second tank 31 that contains
      a liquid material containing a hydrocarbon compound (hereinafter
      simply referred to as " A reaction tank 41 for reacting the
      functional water A with a liquid substance B containing a
      hydrocarbon compound, a second tank 33 connected to the first tank
      31 and the second tank 33 The supply line 37 is provided with a
      nozzle 39 disposed in the reaction tank 41 at the tip portion
      thereof, and the functional water A supplied from the first tank
      31 and the hydrocarbon supplied from the second tank 33 And a
      supply line 37 configured to apply an impact force by discharging
      the liquid compound B and a liquid compound B containing the
      compound compound in collision with the wall surface 41 a of the
      reaction tank 41. The reaction unit 30 in the present embodiment
      may further include a separation tank 45 for separating the
      mixture to which the impact force extracted from the reaction tank
      41 is applied into a water phase and a phase containing a
      hydrocarbon compound. , The reaction unit 30 is understood as a
      reaction and separation unit.<br>
      [0045]<br>
      First, the functional water prepared in step (a) is stored in the
      first tank 31. The first tank 31 may be a separate container from
      the water tub 11 in the functional water producing unit 10 or may
      be the same.<br>
      [0046]<br>
      In the functional water A, it is preferable that the active oxygen
      exists so that carbon dioxide present in the water can be
      efficiently reduced. The concentration of active oxygen in
      functional water can be represented schematically by dissolved
      oxygen concentration. While the dissolved oxygen concentration of
      ordinary water is about 8 ppm, the dissolved oxygen concentration
      of functional water may be higher than this. The functional water
      preferably has a dissolved oxygen concentration of 10 ppm (or mg /
      L) or more. The upper limit value of the dissolved oxygen
      concentration of functional water is not particularly limited, but
      it may be, for example, 30 ppm or less, preferably 24 ppm or less.
      The dissolved oxygen concentration of the functional water can be
      appropriately selected according to specific embodiments and / or
      conditions. In the case where the carbon dioxide-containing
      nanobubbles are carbon dioxide nanobubbles as in this embodiment,
      the dissolved oxygen concentration of the functional water is
      preferably 21 ppm or more, for example 30 ppm or less,
      particularly 24 ppm or less, It is not limited thereto.<br>
      [0047]<br>
      Further, in the functional water A, it is preferable that carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles are present as much as possible
      (staying and / or dissolving) in water, but in actual reaction
      conditions to be described later (how to use a liquid material or
      an impact force to be used, etc.) For example. The functional
      water A is acidic (less than pH 7) due to carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles staying and carbon dioxide
      dissolving.<br>
      [0048]<br>
      On the other hand, the original oil B is stored in the second tank
      33. The crude oil is a liquid material containing a hydrocarbon
      compound, and as a hydrocarbon compound, a compound composed of
      carbon and hydrogen, optionally having a hetero atom and / or a
      functional group (aliphatic and / Or an aromatic group, which may
      be saturated or unsaturated), as long as it is liquid. Such
      hydrocarbon compounds include, for example, at least one member
      selected from the group consisting of saturated hydrocarbons
      having 5 to 27 carbon atoms, in particular saturated hydrocarbons
      having 9 to 25 carbon atoms, and light oil, kerosene, gasoline and
      jet fuel For example.<br>
      [0049]<br>
      Although the temperatures of the functional water A in the first
      tank 31 and the original oil B in the second tank 33 are not
      particularly limited, they are conveniently set to room
      temperature (for example, 0 to 40 ° C., particularly 25 to 35 °
      C.) . Although not essential to this embodiment, the first tank 31
      and the second tank 33 may each include a temperature controller
      31 a and 33 a. The temperature controller may be a temperature
      controller (such as a heater or the like in FIG. 2, which shows a
      throw-in type temperature regulator in the example) disposed
      inside the tank, a jacket placed outside the tank or A temperature
      controller such as a heater may be used. In addition, the first
      tank 31 and the second tank 33 may be equipped with a stirring
      system such as an impeller system, a system using a fluid flow, or
      the like, in order to keep the temperature of the stored materials
      in each tank homogeneous.<br>
      [0050]<br>
      Then, the functional water A from the first tank 11 and the
      original oil B from the second tank 33 are supplied to the
      reaction tank 41 through the supply line 37. The supply ratio
      (mixing ratio) of the functional water and the base oil is not
      particularly limited but may be, for example, 1: 99 to 99: 1
      (volume basis, the same applies hereinafter). Generally speaking,
      it is considered that the ratio of the functional water and the
      original oil is closer to each other, the contact efficiency is
      higher, and from this viewpoint, the supply ratio (mixing ratio)
      of the functional water and the raw oil is, for example, 40: 60,
      in particular about 50: 50. As a result of the study of the
      inventors of the present invention, it has been found that in
      order to make the reaction more efficiently proceed in the present
      invention, it is preferable that the proportion of the raw oil is
      higher than that of the functional water, and from this viewpoint,
      (Mixing ratio) may be, for example, 1: 99 to 49: 51, in particular
      20: 80 to 45: 55, more particularly 40: 60.<br>
      [0051]<br>
      The supply line 37 further includes a preliminary mixer 35 for
      mixing in advance the functional water A supplied from the first
      tank 31 and the original oil B supplied from the second tank 33
      before discharging from the nozzle 39 Good. As a result, the
      functional water A and the original oil B can be mixed in advance
      before applying the impact force, and the functional water A and
      the original oil B can be discharged from the nozzle 39 in a more
      uniform mixture state . However, it should be noted that such a
      premixer 35 is not essential.<br>
      [0052]<br>
      In the present embodiment, the functional water A from the first
      tank 31 and the original oil B from the second tank 33 are
      discharged together from the nozzle 39 provided at the tip of the
      supply line 37, and are discharged from the reaction tank 41 . The
      mixture of the functional water A and the original oil B
      discharged from the nozzle 39 collides with the wall surface
      (inner wall surface) 41 a of the reaction tank 41, whereby an
      impact force is applied.<br>
      [0053]<br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the open end of the nozzle 39 is
      disposed so as to face a portion of the wall surface 41 a of the
      reaction vessel 41 forming the inclined bottom surface, but it is
      also possible to mix the functional water A and the original oil
      B, It is not limited to such an embodiment as long as it can be
      added.<br>
      [0054]<br>
      The nozzle 39 may have a straight shape or an orifice shape, and /
      or may have a venturi structure in addition thereto / in addition.<br>
      The hole diameter (orifice diameter in the case of having an
      orifice shape) at the discharge port of the nozzle 39 can be
      appropriately selected, but may be, for example, 0.1 to 10 mm.<br>
      [0055]<br>
      The discharge pressure from the nozzle 39 and the distance between
      the nozzle 39 and the wall surface 41 a can be appropriately set
      according to a desired impact force (reaction efficiency). A pump
      36 may be placed on the supply line 37 to obtain an appropriate
      discharge pressure. The discharge pressure at this time is, for
      example, 1 to 5 MPa, in particular 1 to 3 MPa, more particularly 1
      to 1.5 MPa (gauge pressure in all) by the pump pressure (ignoring
      the pressure loss of the pipe) obtain. Also, the distance between
      the nozzle 39 and the wall surface 41 a may vary depending on the
      apparatus scale.<br>
      [0056]<br>
      The atmosphere in the reaction vessel 41 is not particularly
      limited, and may be air in a simple manner. The temperature in the
      reaction vessel 41 may be conveniently room temperature, but may
      be, for example, 0 to 70 ° C, particularly 10 to 50 ° C, more
      particularly 15 to 35 ° C. The pressure in the reaction vessel 41
      may conveniently be normal pressure (about 0.1 MPa), but may be,
      for example, 0.1 to 20 MPa, particularly 1 to 15 MPa (absolute
      pressure in any case). The reaction vessel 41 may be open to the
      atmosphere or may be sealed.<br>
      [0057]<br>
      As described above, when the functional water A and the original
      oil B are mixed and impact force is applied (or vigorously mixed),
      a reaction for newly generating a hydrocarbon compound progresses
      and an impact force is applied The amount of the hydrocarbon
      compound contained in the mixed mixture is higher than the amount
      of the hydrocarbon compound contained in the liquid material
      containing the hydrocarbon compound before the original (or before
      the reaction, even before mixing).<br>
      [0058]<br>
      Then, according to the research by the inventors of the present
      invention, it was found that the newly generated hydrocarbon
      compound can vary depending on the hydrocarbon compound contained
      in the original oil, and depending on the reaction conditions, It
      has been confirmed that it can have the same number of carbon
      atoms as the number of carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon compound
      contained in the catalyst.<br>
      [0059]<br>
      Although the present invention is not bound by any theory, this
      reaction is considered as follows.<br>
      As shown in the following formula (1a), active oxygen can reduce
      carbon dioxide to produce carbon monoxide, and the produced carbon
      monoxide can produce hydrogen from water as shown in the following
      formula (1b), and these Is represented by the following formula
      (1) as a whole.<br>
      (1) CO 2 + H 2 O → CO + H 2 + O 2 (1) Further, in the presence of
      active oxygen, a hydrocarbon compound represented by the following
      formula (2) It is considered that the synthesis reaction proceeds.
      (2 n + 1) H 2 + n CO → C n H 2 n + 2 + n H 2 O (2) These reactions
      are understood as efficiently proceeding by mixing the functional
      water and the original oil and applying an impact force (or
      vigorously mixing) .<br>
      [0060]<br>
      The new hydrocarbon-based compound can differ according to the
      hydrocarbon-based compound contained in the original oil and can
      have the same number of carbons as the reaction site provided is
      crude oil Depending on the hydrocarbon compound (in particular,
      the number of carbon atoms) contained in the catalyst. It is
      considered that the hydrocarbon compound itself contained in the
      original oil is not decomposed and / or consumed by the reaction.<br>
      [0061]<br>
      Such reactions can proceed rapidly by the application of an impact
      force. The reaction time (or the residence time in the reaction
      tank 41) is, for example, 0.1 second to 10 minutes, typically 1
      second to 4 minutes, depending on the functional water to be used,
      the original oil and the reaction conditions and the like obtain.<br>
      [0062]<br>
      Then, the mixture to which the impact force is applied as
      described above is withdrawn from the reaction vessel 41 through
      the extracting portion 41 b as a reaction mixture containing the
      hydrocarbon compound generated by the reaction. The reaction
      vessel 41 may have a lower structure for receiving a mixture to
      which an impact force is applied and may be discharged from the
      reaction vessel 41 immediately after colliding with the wall face
      41 a, but it is not limited thereto.<br>
      [0063]<br>
      Although not essential to this embodiment, the reaction mixture
      (mixture subjected to impact force) withdrawn from the reaction
      tank 5 is transferred to a separation tank 45 through a line 43,
      and a phase containing a hydrocarbon compound (organic Phase) and
      an aqueous phase. The separation tank 45 may have any suitable
      configuration capable of phase separation, and may be phase
      separated by using a stationary vessel (settler), a centrifugal
      separator, a pulse column, or the like. The phases including the
      hydrocarbon compound separated from each other and the aqueous
      phase are discharged from the separation tank 45 through lines 47
      and 49, respectively.<br>
      [0064]<br>
      The phase containing the hydrocarbon compound (hereinafter also
      simply referred to as "new oil") obtained by this will contain the
      hydrocarbon compound and the newly generated hydrocarbon compound
      contained in the original oil . In other words, the amount of the
      hydrocarbon compound in the fresh oil will be higher than the
      amount of the hydrocarbon compound in the original oil. In the
      case where the new oil and the original oil are substantially
      composed of the hydrocarbon compound, the amount of the new oil
      simply increases more than the amount of the raw oil.<br>
      [0065]<br>
      The average carbon number of the hydrocarbon compound contained in
      the new oil (in other words, the combination of the hydrocarbon
      compound and the newly generated hydrocarbon compound contained in
      the original oil) is included in the original oil Depending on the
      average carbon number of the hydrocarbon-based compound. For
      example, the average carbon number of the hydrocarbon compound
      contained in the fresh oil is substantially the same as the
      average carbon number of the hydrocarbon compound contained in the
      mixture to which the impact force is applied, which is included in
      the original oil Based on the average number of carbon atoms of
      the hydrocarbon-based compound which has been present. This
      suggests that it is possible to control the hydrocarbon compound
      (especially the carbon number) newly generated by the reaction by
      selecting the hydrocarbon compound (especially carbon number) of
      the original oil according to the desired hydrocarbon compound
      doing. In the present invention, the average carbon number means
      the number average carbon number, and it can be measured by, for
      example, column chromatography, gas chromatography, or the like.<br>
      [0066]<br>
      As described above, the hydrocarbon-based compound production
      method of the present embodiment is carried out. The process for
      producing a hydrocarbon compound of this embodiment can be carried
      out continuously, and is thus suitable for large-scale production
      of hydrocarbon compounds. However, the present embodiment is not
      limited to this, and it may be carried out in a batch manner.<br>
      [0067]<br>
      The fresh oil thus obtained is recovered as a liquid material
      containing a hydrocarbon compound and can be used for any purpose.
      A part of the new oil may be transferred to the original oil tank
      33 and used as the original oil. On the other hand, a part or all
      of the aqueous phase may be used as water in the functional water
      producing unit 10 as necessary, or may be discarded after
      subjected to post-treatment as necessary.<br>
      [0068]<br>
      (Embodiment 2) This embodiment is a modification of Embodiment 1
      described above, and the description of Embodiment 1 is similarly
      applied unless otherwise noted. (A) a step of preparing carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles and functional water containing
      active oxygen in water (front part, see FIG. 3), and (b)
      functional water and hydrocarbons Based compound and a liquid
      material containing the compound (impact part) (posterior part,
      see FIG. 2).<br>
      [0069]<br>
      Step (a) In this embodiment, the functional water can be produced,
      for example, by a functional water production unit as shown in
      FIG. 3 (front part of the hydrocarbon-based compound production
      apparatus in this embodiment). 3 (a), the functional water
      production unit 10 'includes a water tub 11 for containing water,
      a first supply unit 13 for supplying at least carbon dioxide in
      water in the form of nanobubbles, at least oxygen A second supply
      unit 15 for supplying carbon dioxide into the water, a third
      supply unit 16 for supplying carbon dioxide into the water, light
      irradiation for irradiating light supplied with at least oxygen in
      the presence of a photocatalyst to generate active oxygen Section
      23 as shown in FIG.<br>
      [0070]<br>
      First, water 7 is supplied from a line 1 to a water tank 11.<br>
      [0071]<br>
      Step (i) Next, at least carbon dioxide (a gas containing at least
      carbon dioxide, that is, a carbon dioxide-containing gas) is
      supplied from the first supply part 13 connected to the carbon
      dioxide supply source 3 'into the water 7 stored in the water tank
      11 ) In the form of nanobubbles.<br>
      [0072]<br>
      In the present embodiment, air (for example, a carbon dioxide
      content of 0.03 to 0.04 vol%) is supplied in the form of
      nanobubbles as a carbon dioxide-containing gas using an air
      cylinder or the like as the carbon dioxide supply source 3 ' , And
      generate nanobubbles of air.<br>
      [0073]<br>
      Step (ii) Furthermore, at least carbon dioxide (carbon
      dioxide-containing gas) is supplied from the third supply unit 16
      connected to the carbon dioxide supply source 6 into the water 7
      stored in the water tank 11.<br>
      At least oxygen (oxygen-containing gas) is supplied from the
      second supply unit 15 connected to the oxygen supply source 5 into
      the water 7 stored in the water tub 11.<br>
      The second supply unit 15 may be similar to that described above
      in the first embodiment and the third supply unit 16 may be of any
      appropriate configuration capable of supplying carbon dioxide gas
      (or carbon dioxide-containing gas) (For the purpose of
      illustrating the second supply unit 15 and the third supply unit
      16 in FIG. 3 (a), only the leading ends of them are referred to as
      white It is shown schematically with a square).<br>
      [0074]<br>
      In the present embodiment, an oxygen gas cylinder or the like is
      used as the oxygen supply source 5, oxygen gas (for example,
      purity of 99 vol% or more) is supplied as an oxygen-containing
      gas, a carbon dioxide gas cylinder or the like is used as the
      carbon dioxide supply source 6 , And carbon dioxide gas (for
      example, purity of 99 vol% or more) is supplied as the carbon
      dioxide-containing gas, but the present invention is not limited
      thereto.<br>
      [0075]<br>
      The order of supplying the carbon dioxide-containing gas and the
      oxygen-containing gas is not particularly limited, and as long as
      functional water including active oxygen and carbon
      dioxide-containing nanobubbles is appropriately used in step (b),
      which one is first performed , Or they may be performed at the
      same time so as to at least partially overlap.<br>
      Typically, first, a carbon dioxide-containing gas is supplied into
      the water 7 from the third supply unit 13, and then the
      oxygen-containing gas is supplied from the second supply unit 15
      into the water 7.<br>
      [0076]<br>
      As a result, the water 7 supplied with at least oxygen and carbon
      dioxide (carbon dioxide which is not in the form of nanobubbles in
      addition to carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles) is pumped out
      by the pump 21 to a withdrawing portion 17 of the water tub 11 (in
      FIG. 3 (a) , Only the distal end portion thereof is schematically
      shown by an open square for the purpose of illustrating the
      extracting portion 17) from the line 19 and is transferred to the
      light irradiating portion 23.<br>
      [0077]<br>
      In the light irradiator 23, light supplied from the light source
      27 in the presence of the photocatalyst, while water passing
      through the reaction tube 25 is supplied with at least oxygen and
      carbon dioxide as described above, so that active oxygen .<br>
      [0078]<br>
      As a result, the water 7 contains active oxygen and is returned
      from the light irradiator 23 to the water tank 11 through the line
      29.<br>
      While supplying the oxygen-containing gas into the water from the
      second supply unit 15, the pump 21 is operated to withdraw water
      containing oxygen from the extracting unit 17, leading to the line
      19, the light irradiation unit 23, the line 29 and the water tub
      11 By circulating, sufficient active oxygen concentration can be
      obtained.<br>
      Meanwhile, even if the supply of the carbon dioxide-containing gas
      from the third supply unit 16 into the water is being performed,
      it may be stopped or terminated.<br>
      [0079]<br>
      The position and amount (or flow rate) of the oxygen-containing
      gas supply from the second supply unit 15 and the position and
      amount (or flow rate) of the carbon dioxide-containing gas supply
      from the third supply unit 16 are mostly, It is preferable that
      all of them are set so as to be extracted together with water from
      the extracting portion 17 by the suction force of the pump 21.<br>
      Briefly, the second supply unit 15 (the position of the
      oxygen-containing gas supply) and the third supply unit 16 (the
      position of the carbon dioxide-containing gas supply) are disposed
      in the vicinity of or in the vicinity of the withdrawal unit 17
      and oxygen- And a carbon dioxide-containing gas are supplied in a
      relatively small amount (small flow rate). For example, as shown
      in FIG. 3 (b), each of the distal ends (or supply ports) of the
      second supply unit 15 and the third supply unit 16 is connected to
      the opening of the extraction unit 17 It may be inserted into the
      part.<br>
      [0080]<br>
      Functional water containing carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles
      (air nano bubbles in this embodiment) and active oxygen in water
      can be obtained from the above steps (i) and (ii). The order of
      carrying out steps (i) and (ii) is not particularly limited,
      either which may be carried out first or at the same time so as to
      overlap at least partially.<br>
      [0081]<br>
      Step (b) Impact force is applied by mixing functional water
      prepared as described above and a liquid material containing a
      hydrocarbon compound.<br>
      [0082]<br>
      The imparting of the impact force can be carried out in the same
      manner as that described in Embodiment 1, for example, by a
      reaction unit as shown in FIG. 2 (a latter stage portion of the
      hydrocarbon-based compound producing apparatus in this embodiment)
      it can.<br>
      [0083]<br>
      Also in the present embodiment, the functional water preferably
      has a dissolved oxygen concentration of 10 ppm (or mg / L) or
      more, and the dissolved oxygen concentration of the functional
      water depends on a specific embodiment and / or condition And can
      be appropriately selected.<br>
      When the carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles are air bubbles as
      in this embodiment, the dissolved oxygen concentration of the
      functional water is preferably 11 ppm or more, for example 20 ppm
      or less, especially 15 ppm or less, but in the present invention .<br>
      [0084]<br>
      Also in the present embodiment, as in Embodiment 1, when the
      functional water and the original oil are mixed and impact force
      is applied (or intensively mixed), a reaction for newly generating
      a hydrocarbon compound progresses , The amount of the hydrocarbon
      compound contained in the mixture to which the impact force is
      applied is larger than the amount of the hydrocarbon compound
      contained in the liquid material containing the original
      hydrocarbon compound (or before the reaction, even before mixing)
      To increase.<br>
      Besides, also in the present embodiment, the description of the
      first embodiment applies in the same way.<br>
      [0085]<br>
      Although the method and apparatus for producing a hydrocarbon
      compound in the two embodiments of the present invention have been
      described above, various modifications are possible within the
      scope of the present invention. For example, the functional water
      containing carbon dioxide-containing nanobubbles and active oxygen
      in water may be produced by other suitable apparatus and method
      different from those described with reference to FIG. 1 or FIG. 3,
      and the present invention Of the hydrocarbon-based compound
      production apparatus may not have a functional water production
      unit. Also, for example, the manner in which the functional water
      and the original oil are mixed and the impact force is applied may
      be carried out by another suitable apparatus and method different
      from those described with reference to FIG. 2. For example, the
      functional water and the hydrocarbon compound may be placed in a
      container and shocked to apply an impact force, and even in such a
      case, the amount of the hydrocarbon compound contained in the
      mixture to which the impact force is applied Is higher than the
      amount of the hydrocarbon-based compound contained in the liquid
      material containing the original hydrocarbon-based compound by the
      research of the present inventors.<br>
      [0086]<br>
      The method and apparatus for producing a hydrocarbon compound of
      the present invention can be carried out with activated water and
      carbon dioxide with a simple apparatus configuration in an
      extremely short reaction time, so that it is safe And a
      hydrocarbon compound can be easily synthesized. Furthermore, in
      the present invention, since it is unnecessary to use substances
      other than functional water containing carbon dioxide-containing
      nanobubbles and active oxygen in water besides the crude oil, the
      obtained new oil has high purity and is refined And can be used as
      it is for arbitrary purposes without requiring post-processing
      such as the post-processing. The point that no post-treatment such
      as purification is required contributes to lowering the production
      cost together with the extremely short reaction time. When such a
      new oil is used as a hydrocarbon-based fuel, problems due to
      combustion products such as NOx and SOx can be reduced or
      eliminated.<br>
      [0087]<br>
      Hereinafter, the present invention will be described based on
      examples, and it is shown that fresh oil can be efficiently
      produced from functional water and original oil under normal
      temperature and normal pressure conditions.<br>
      [0088]<br>
      <b>Example 1</b> <br>
      In this example, a hydrocarbon compound was produced according to
      Embodiment 1 described above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
      [0089]<br>
      Functional water was prepared as follows.<br>
      First, ultrapure water was obtained by passing water through an
      ultrapure water production system (manufactured by Organo
      Corporation) equipped with a cation exchange column and an anion
      exchange column.<br>
      In the functional water production unit 10 shown in FIG. 1, 100 L
      of this pure water was placed in the water tank 11, and carbon
      dioxide gas was supplied at 500 mL / min at a rate of 500 mL / min
      by a nanobubble generator (manufactured by Nikken Devices, Ltd.)
      as the first supply unit 13 for 2 hours Ie 60 L in total).
      Thereafter, oxygen gas is supplied from the second supply unit 15
      to the water 7 obtained thereby at 50 to 100 mL / min, and an
      ultraviolet sterilizing lamp (GL-1, manufactured by Panasonic
      Corporation) 40 4 W (254 nm)) and black light (FL 40 S BLB 40 W
      (315 to 400 nm, peak wavelength 352 nm, manufactured by Toshiba
      Corporation)), the reaction tube 25 packed with titanium dioxide
      catalyst is circulated through water 7 For 40 to 60 minutes
      (corresponding to 5 to 10 cycles). The dissolved oxygen
      concentration of the functional water obtained by this was 21 ppm
      or more. (It should be noted that the dissolved oxygen
      concentration of ordinary water such as tap water is about 8 ppm.
      ）<br>
      [0090]<br>
      Next, using the functional water obtained above and light oil as
      the original oil, these were mixed as described below and impact
      force was applied. In the reaction unit 30 shown in FIG. 2, the
      functional water A adjusted to a temperature within the range of
      25 to 35 ° C. and the original oil (diesel oil in this embodiment)
      B are preliminarily mixed in the premixer 35, and the pump 36 At a
      pump pressure of 1 to 1.5 MPa (gauge pressure), and discharged
      from a nozzle 39 having a straight shape having a hole diameter of
      5 mm, and caused to collide with a wall surface 41 a separated
      from the nozzle 39 by about 20 to 30 cm. The mixing ratio of
      functional water and light oil was 1: 1 (volume basis), and each
      was supplied at 10 L (that is, 20 L in total). The reaction vessel
      41 was opened to the air and made into an air atmosphere of normal
      temperature and normal pressure. As a result, the mixture to which
      the impact force is applied is quickly withdrawn from the
      extracting portion 41 b at the bottom of the reaction vessel 41
      and allowed to stand in the separation tank 45 to separate into an
      organic phase and an aqueous phase, .<br>
      [0091]<br>
      The obtained fresh oil (organic phase) was about 11 L and the
      aqueous phase was about 9 L. About 11 L of new oil was obtained
      for about 10 L of the original oil used, indicating that the oil
      (liquid material of the hydrocarbon compound) increased by about
      10% by volume.<br>
      [0092]<br>
      The carbon number distribution of the hydrocarbon compound
      containing gas oil and crude oil used as the raw oil and analyzed
      by gas chromatographic analysis was investigated. The results are
      shown in FIG. 3 (the symbol "n" indicates a straight chain and the
      number next to the symbol "C" indicates the carbon number). Fig. 3
      (a) is the gas chromatograph analysis result of light oil used as
      the original oil, and Fig. 3 (b) is the gas chromatograph analysis
      result of fresh oil obtained from this original oil. For gas
      chromatographic analysis, GC-2010 (manufactured by Shimadzu
      Corporation) was used.<br>
      [0093]<br>
      Comparing Fig. 3 (a) with Fig. 3 (b), both peaks are carbon atoms
      17 (nC 17), distributed in the range of about 9 to 25 carbon
      atoms, and show similar carbon number distributions . Therefore,
      it was confirmed that a fresh oil having the same composition as
      that of light oil was obtained when light oil was used as the
      original oil.<br>
      [0094]<br>
      Furthermore, when kerosene is used as the original oil, a fresh
      oil having the same composition as kerosene is obtained, and when
      a saturated hydrocarbon compound represented by C15 H22 is used as
      the crude oil, the same composition . In both cases, it was
      confirmed by the experiment of the present inventors that the
      amount of fresh oil is increased as compared with the original
      oil.<br>

      Functional water was prepared as follows.<br>
      First, ultrapure water was obtained by passing water through an
      ultrapure water production system (manufactured by Organo
      Corporation) equipped with a cation exchange column and an anion
      exchange column.<br>
      In the functional water production unit 10 'shown in FIG. 3, 50 L
      of this pure water was placed in the water tank 11, and air
      (carbon dioxide content: about 0.03 vol% (carbon dioxide content:
      about 0.03 vol) was supplied by a nanobubble generator
      (manufactured by Nishiki Devices, %) Was fed at 600 mL / min for 1
      hour. Thereafter, carbon dioxide gas was first supplied at a rate
      of 600 mL / min for 30 minutes from the third supply unit 16 into
      the water 7 obtained by this, then oxygen gas was supplied from
      the second supply unit 15 at 150 mL / min for 5 minutes Supplied.
      While the supply of carbon dioxide gas and supply of oxygen gas
      are being carried out, an ultraviolet sterilizing lamp (GL-40 40W
      (254 nm) manufactured by Panasonic Corporation) and black light (
      A process of circulating water through a reaction tube 25 packed
      with a titanium dioxide catalyst under light irradiation using
      FL40S BLB 40 W (315 to 400 nm, peak wavelength 352 nm)
      manufactured by Toshiba Corporation was performed. The dissolved
      oxygen concentration of the functional water thus obtained was 12
      to 14 ppm.<br>
      [0097]<br>
      Next, using the functional water obtained above and light oil as
      the original oil, these were mixed as described below and impact
      force was applied. In the reaction unit 30 shown in FIG. 2, the
      functional water A adjusted to a temperature within the range of
      25 to 35 ° C. and the original oil (diesel oil in this embodiment)
      B are preliminarily mixed in the premixer 35, and the pump 36 At a
      pump pressure of 1 to 1.5 MPa (gauge pressure), and discharged
      from a nozzle 39 having a straight shape having a hole diameter of
      5 mm, and caused to collide with a wall surface 41 a separated
      from the nozzle 39 by about 20 to 30 cm. The mixing ratio of
      functional water and light oil was as shown in Table 1, and a
      total of 20 L of these was supplied. The reaction vessel 41 was
      opened to the air and made into an air atmosphere of normal
      temperature and normal pressure. As a result, the mixture to which
      the impact force is applied is quickly withdrawn from the
      extracting portion 41 b at the bottom of the reaction vessel 41
      and allowed to stand in the separation tank 45 to separate into an
      organic phase and an aqueous phase, . The rate of increase of oil
      (liquid substance of hydrocarbon compound) was determined from the
      amount of used oil and the amount of recovered fresh oil. The
      results are also shown in Table 1.<br>
