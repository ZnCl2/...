      We are a research team at PrakashLab at Stanford University,
      focused on democratizing science by developing scientific tools
      that can scale up to match problems in global health and science
      education. Here we describe Foldscope, a new approach for mass
      manufacturing of optical microscopes that are printed-and-folded
      from a single flat sheet of paper, akin to Origami. <br>

      Stanford bioengineer develops a 50-cent paper microscope<br>
      <br>
      UPDATE: A second blog entry, including a link to Prakash’s TED
      talk on this topic, can be found here. And this entry discusses
      Prakash’s plans to give away 10,000 build-your-own paper
      microscope kits to citizen scientists with the most inspiring
      ideas for things to do with this new invention.<br>
      <br>
      When Manu Prakash, PhD, wants to impress lab visitors with the
      durability of his Origami-based paper microscope, he throws it off
      a three-story balcony, stomps on it with his foot and dunks it
      into a water-filled beaker. Miraculously, it still works.<br>
      <br>
      Even more amazing is that this microscope — a bookmark-sized piece
      of layered cardstock with a micro-lens — only costs about 50 cents
      in materials to make.<br>
      <br>
      In the video posted above, you can see his “Foldscope” being built
      in just a few minutes, then used to project giant images of plant
      tissue on the wall of a dark room.<br>
      <br>
      Prakash’s dream is that this ultra-low-cost microscope will
      someday be distributed widely to detect dangerous blood-borne
      diseases like malaria, African sleeping sickness, schistosomiasis
      and Chagas.<br>
      <br>
      “I wanted to make the best possible disease-detection instrument
      that we could almost distribute for free,” said Prakash. “What
      came out of this project is what we call use-and-throw
      microscopy.”<br>
      <br>
      The Foldscope can be assembled in minutes, includes no mechanical
      moving parts, packs in a flat configuration, is extremely rugged
      and can be incinerated after use to safely dispose of infectious
      biological samples. With minor design modifications, it can be
      used for bright-field, multi-fluorescence or projection
      microscopy.<br>
      <br>
      One of the unique design features of the microscope is the use of
      inexpensive spherical lenses rather than the precision-ground
      curved glass lenses used in traditional microscopes. These
      poppy-seed-sized lenses were originally mass produced in various
      sizes as an abrasive grit that was thrown into industrial tumblers
      to knock the rough edges off metal parts. In the simplest
      configuration of the Foldscope, one 17-cent lens is press-fit into
      a small hole in the center of the slide-mounting platform. Some of
      his more sophisticated versions use multiple lenses and filters.<br>
      <br>
      To use a Foldscope, a sample is mounted on a microscope slide and
      wedged between the paper layers of the microscope. With a thumb
      and forefinger grasping each end of the layered paper strip, a
      user holds the micro-lens close enough to one eye that eyebrows
      touch the paper. Focusing and locating a target object are
      achieved by flexing and sliding the paper platform with the thumb
      and fingers.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the unique optical physics of a spherical lens held
      close to the eye, samples can be magnified up to 2,000 times. (To
      the right are two disease-causing microbes, Giardia lamblia and
      Leishmania donovani, photographed through a Foldscope.)<br>
      <br>
      The Foldscope can be customized for the detection of specific
      organisms by adding various combinations of colored LED lights
      powered by a watch battery, sample stains and fluorescent filters.
      It can also be configured to project images on the wall of a dark
      room.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Prakash is passionate about mass-producing the
      Foldscope for educational purposes, to inspire children — our
      future scientists — to explore and learn from the microscopic
      world.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent Stanford bioengineering course, Prakash used the
      Foldscope to teach students about the physics of microscopy. He
      had the entire class build their own Foldscope. Then teams wrote
      reports on microscopic observations or designed Foldscope
      accessories, such a smartphone camera attachment.<br>
      <br>

      details, read Prakash’s technical paper : <br>

      Here we describe an ultra-low-cost origami-based approach for
      large-scale manufacturing of microscopes, specifically
      demonstrating brightfield, darkfield, and fluorescence
      microscopes. Merging principles of optical design with origami
      enables high-volume fabrication of microscopes from 2D media.
      Flexure mechanisms created via folding enable a flat compact
      design. Structural loops in folded paper provide kinematic
      constraints as a means for passive self-alignment. This light,
      rugged instrument can survive harsh field conditions while
      providing a diversity of imaging capabilities, thus serving
      wide-ranging applications for cost-effective, portable microscopes
      in science and education. <br>

      A Foldscope is an optical microscope that can be assembled from
      simple components, including a sheet of paper and a lens. It was
      developed by Manu Prakash and designed to cost less than US$1 to
      build.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A Foldscope is an optical microscope that can be assembled from a
      punched sheet of cardstock, a spherical lens, a light emitting
      diode and a diffuser panel, along with a watch battery that powers
      the LED.[1] It can magnify up to 2000 times and weighs 8 grams.
      The magnification power is enough to enable the spotting of
      organisms such as Leishmania donovani and Escherichia coli, as
      well as malarial parasites.[2] A Foldscope can be printed on a
      standard A4 sheet of paper and assembled in seven minutes.[3]<br>
      <br>
      The basic principle of using a small spherical lens held close to
      the eye dates back to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), who was
      the first to see single-celled organisms using such a lens held in
      a device of his own design.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      The Foldscope was developed by a team led by Manu Prakash, an
      assistant professor of bioengineering at the Stanford School of
      Medicine.[4] The project was funded by several organisations
      including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which gave a
      grant of US $100,000 for research in November 2012. The Gordon and
      Betty Moore Foundation funded the "Ten Thousand Microscopes"
      project under which Prakash plans to give away 10,000 Foldscope
      kits to interested parties, including students for
      research.[5][2][6] Foldscope sets will also be produced and tested
      in Kenya, India and Uganda.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Twelve Foldscope variants are available, each designed to aid the
      identification of a particular disease-causing organism.[3] To
      enable several people to use them at once, each microscope can
      project images with a built-in projector.[3] The Foldscope is
      designed to be assembled by the end user, and hence is
      colour-coded to help with the assembly.[2] Each unit costs less
      than one US dollar to build, with estimates varying from 50 cents
      to 97 cents.[2][3]<br>

      An optical device, such as a microscope, is disclosed that can be
      assembled from flat materials. The optical device can be assembled
      via a series of folds of a flat material. The optical microscope
      can include a stage for supporting a sample, an optic stage, and a
      light source. The optic stage can include one or more lenses. The
      optical microscope can be capable of obtaining simultaneous images
      from different forms of microscopy. The optical microscope may
      have bright field and filter field viewing capabilities wherein a
      user shifts from bright field to filter field by lateral movement
      of the stage containing a lens and a light source that cooperate
      to provide either the bright field or the filter field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention relates generally to diagnostic
      optical devices, such as microscopes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] An optical instrument is an instrument used to move light
      along a specified path or paths. Microscopes are common,
      general-purpose optical instruments. Other optical instruments
      include interferometers and spectrophotometers.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Microscopes are generally used to view objects that are too
      small to be seen by the unaided eye. Optical microscopes use
      visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small
      objects. Optical microscopes are used in observing small
      structures, determining pathology and diagnosing disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There are two basic configurations of the conventional
      optical microscope, the simple (one lens) and compound (many
      lenses). There are also several different types of microscopy
      including brightfield, darkfield, fluorescence, and other forms.
      Each of these forms of microscopy are performed individually and
      one at a time. High magnification optical microscopes are often
      heavy and take up much volume. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] There is a need for improved optical instruments to better
      diagnose pathologies and disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] In some embodiments an optical device is provided. The
      optical devices can include a first stage for supporting a sample
      and a second stage engaged with the first stage and movable
      relative to the first stage, the second stage including an optic,
      the optic having a distance of less than about 3 mm from the
      sample to the opposite side of the optic. In some embodiments the
      optical device is an optical microscope. In some embodiments the
      optical device is an interferometer or spectrophotometers. In some
      embodiments the second stage can be movable laterally relative to
      the first stage such that the optic can be positioned over a
      desired location on the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [00010] In some embodiments the first stage is configured to
      receive a substrate containing the sample. In some embodiments the
      first stage includes a slot shaped to receive the substrate. In
      some embodiments the substrate is a glass slide. In some
      embodiments the glass slide includes a portion treated with a
      reagent to interact with the sample. In some embodiments the
      sample is supported directly on the first stage. In some
      embodiments the first stage includes a sample area comprising a
      reagent to react with the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [00011] In some embodiments the optical device includes an
      illumination stage comprising a light source. The illumination
      stage can be engaged with the first stage and second stage with
      the illumination stage movable with the second stage. The light
      source can be positioned adjacent to the first stage to facilitate
      viewing the sample using the optic.<br>
      <br>
      [00012] In some embodiments the light source is on one side of the
      first stage and the optic is spaced apart from the opposite side
      of the first stage a distance between the light source and the
      side of the optic farthest from the first stage is less than about
      5 mm. In some embodiments the light source is on one side of the
      first stage and the optic is spaced apart from the opposite side
      of the first stage a distance between the light source and the
      side of the optic farthest from the first stage is from about 1 mm
      to about 20 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [00013] In some embodiments the light source includes one or more
      light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In some embodiments the LED is white
      to provide a full-spectrum color image of the sample in
      bright-field. In some embodiments the LED is blue to provide light
      of an appropriate wavelength for fluorescence imaging. In some
      embodiments the LED has an output power suitable to project an
      image of the sample. In some embodiments the LED has a power
      suitable to illuminate the sample so that a user's eye may
      perceive the image of the sample. In some embodiments the LEDs
      have power suitable so that a user may perceive multiple
      simultaneous images of the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [00014] In some embodiments the optical device includes an
      illumination stage with an aperture. In some embodiments the
      illumination stage includes an aperture having a diameter of about
      1/4 to about 2/3 of the diameter of the substantially spherical
      lens. In some embodiments the optical microscope includes an
      illumination stage with an element for modifying the profile of
      the light from the LED, such as a condenser, diffuser, light
      shaping diffuser, polycarbonate light shaping filter, etc. In some
      embodiments, optical microscope has an illumination stage that
      provides Kohler illumination.<br>
      <br>
      [00015] In some embodiments the optical device is manufactured
      from a flat material that includes the first stage and second
      stage. In some embodiments a single material piece provides the
      first stage and second stage. In some embodiments the flat
      material comprises one or more of paper, polymer, and metal.<br>
      <br>
      [00016] In some embodiments a power source is provided with the
      optical microscope. The power source can engage with the
      illumination stage and is configured to provide power to the light
      source.<br>
      <br>
      [00017] In some embodiments the microscope optic comprises a
      substantially spherical ball lens. In some embodiments the
      substantially spherical ball lens has a diameter of less than
      about 2,500 [mu][iota][eta]. In some embodiments the spherical
      ball lens has a diameter of about 1 ,000 [mu][iota][eta] to about
      2,500 [mu][pi][iota]. In some embodiments the spherical ball lens
      has a diameter of about 300 [mu][eta][iota] to about 1 ,000
      [mu][pi][iota]. In some embodiments the spherical ball lens has a
      diameter of about 100 [mu][iota][eta] to about 300
      [mu][eta][iota]. In some embodiments the spherical lens has a
      diameter of about 200 [mu][iota][eta] to about 1,000
      [mu][pi][iota].<br>
      <br>
      [00018] In some embodiments the spherical lens has an effective
      aperture of less than the diameter of the spherical lens. In some
      embodiments the aperture is about 1/4 to about 2/3 of the diameter
      of the spherical lens. In some embodiments the spherical ball lens
      has an aperture diameter of about 1/4 to 1/3 the lens diameter. In

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [00092] Optical devices and methods for using optical devices,
      such as microscopes are disclosed herein. The optical devices
      disclosed herein can be assembled from a flat material. The flat
      material can include one or more lenses, a sample support,
      illumination sources, and control electronics. The optical devices
      can be an optical microscope, interferometer, and
      spectrophotometers. The optical devices can be designed and
      assembled based on Origami principles and optical design
      principles. For example, the individual components of the optical
      devices can be designed based on Origami principles. The
      components can be designed to facilitate assembly and alignment of
      the optical device.<br>
      <br>
      [00093] A microscope can be a critical tool for disease
      diagnostics, especially in resource poor settings around the
      world. Conventional microscopes were designed as general-purpose
      research tools. Conventional microscopes are costly and not
      designed with portability in mind. Traditional microscopes are
      also prone to failure in harsh field conditions since they are
      complex three-dimensional objects that are costly, bulky and
      require regular maintenance for optimal performance. In addition,
      traditional optical instruments require significant alignment post
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [00094] The optical devices disclosed herein can be assembled in
      the field from a flat material and assembled to achieve the
      optical alignment. The achievement of the optical alignment
      through folding and engagement of the components can be referred
      to as passive alignment. Passive alignment can be achieved through
      kinematic constraints and structural loops. The optical devices
      and individual components of the optical can be shaped to
      facilitate passive alignment. Passive alignment great reduces the
      costs associated with the optical devices and allows for the
      optical devices to be assembled in environments without the
      resources for assembling and aligning a conventional optical
      device, such as an optical microscope.<br>
      <br>
      [00095] The components of the optical microscope can be formed,
      printed, or applied on the flat flexible substrate. Examples of
      flat materials include paper, thin metal, polymers, paper coated
      with polymers, polyamide, Flex PCBs, etc. The flat material can be
      flexible and is not limited to a planar configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [00096] In some embodiments other optical instruments can be
      constructed using the folding principles disclosed herein to
      achieve a desired optical or beam path in 3 dimensions. Examples
      of optical instruments include interferometers,
      spectrophotometers, and other optical instruments.<br>
      <br>
      [00097] The optical devices can be assembled from the flat
      material using a series of cutting and folding steps. The optical
      microscopes disclosed herein can be designed to self-align due to
      kinematic constraints present in how the optical microscope is
      assembled from the flat materials. The optical microscope can be
      designed with folds and mating stages that self align the one or
      more lenses with the sample support and any illumination sources
      when assembled. Mechanical components such as a panning and focus
      stage can be implemented as flexure mechanisms manufactured by
      folding paper. The panning stage can allow for movement in the X-Y
      direction to position the optic over any portion of a sample. For
      a 2 cm by 2 cm sample the panning stage can include a travel
      distance of 2 cm by 2 cm. [00098] The optical device can be a
      multi-modal microscope implementing one or more of bright field,
      multi-fluorescence, polarization, phase contrast, and projection
      microscopy. The optical microscope can include a filter for
      fluorescence and polarization modalities. For projection
      microscopy the optical microscope includes a light source with a
      power suitable to project an image. For example, the light source
      may consume 800mA of electrical current at<br>
      3.7V.<br>
      <br>
      [00099] The sample can be viewed through the optic. In some
      embodiments the user can position the optical microscope close to
      their face, such that the optic is located about 5 cm or less from
      the user's retina. In some embodiments the optical microscope can
      project an image. For example, the image can be projected on a
      flat surface such as a screen. Alternatively, the optical
      microscope can use a screen designed to conform to the shape of
      the Petzval surface of the lens to eliminate field curvature in
      the projected image.<br>
      <br>
      [000100] The optical microscope can include an array of lenses.
      The lenses can have different sizes and magnifications. The lenses
      in the array can also be used to provide images of different
      modalities simultaneously, e.g. two different fluorescence images
      or a bright field image and a fluorescence image. The array of
      lenses can be provided in a side by side arrangement. The multiple
      lenses can be paired with one or more light sources. The array of
      lenses can be arranged in a grid, e.g. in a 3x3 grid arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [000101] The optical microscopes can have an optical path that is
      much shorter than conventional microscopes. For example, the
      optical path can include the distance between the light source and
      the opposing side of the lens. In some embodiments the distance
      between the light source and the opposing side of the optic or
      lens is from about 1 mm to about 20 mm. In some embodiments the
      optical path is less than about 5 mm. In some embodiments the
      optical path is less than about 3 mm. The short optical path
      allows for the microscope to be a much smaller vertical height,
      assuming a vertical optical path, in comparison to traditional
      optical microscopes. The shorter vertical height requires less
      structural support and less material, thereby decreasing
      manufacturing costs. In some embodiments the optical path between
      the sample and the opposing side of the optic is less than about 3
      mm. In some embodiments the optical path between the sample and
      the opposing side of the optic is less than about 2 mm or less
      than about 1 mm. These short optical paths can allow for
      illuminating the sample with a a much lower power light source or
      lower amount of light versus conventional microscopes.<br>
      <br>
      [000102] Unlike a traditional microscope, the entire optics and
      illumination stage can be panned across the surface of the sample
      slide, which can be fixed in a single location. The optical
      microscopes disclosed herein can have a lens and light source that
      are movable relative to the sample or sample stage. An optic stage
      can include a support for the lens. The light source can be
      integrated with a separate stage, such as an illumination stage.
      The optic stage and illumination stage can be engaged such that
      they move together. The lens can move along above the sample along
      an x-axis and y-axis to observe different areas of the sample. In
      addition the vertical distance, e.g. along a z-axis, between the
      lens and sample can be adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [000103] The optical microscopes disclosed herein can be used for
      a variety of applications. The optical microscopes can be used for
      diagnostic applications such as testing for a disease, parasite,
      bacteria, or disorder that is detectable in a bodily fluid.
      Examples include diagnostic applications such as diagnosing
      diseases such as Malaria, Chagas, Giardiasis, Microfilariasis,
      Sickle-cell disease, and other diseases. Stains for common
      parasites and diseases can be used with the samples. The sample
      and stain can be observed with the optical microscope to determine
      the presence or absence of the diagnostic target. The optical
      microscopes can also be used for general purposes, including
      science education.<br>
      <br>
      [000104] In some embodiments the lens is a substantially spherical
      lens, for example a ball lens. A ball lens advantageous for
      manufacturing because it can minimize part count and be assembled
      without concern for rotational alignment as shown in FIG. 8A. Ball
      lenses can be formed from molten glass or UV-curable epoxies.
      Suspension polymerization can also be used to produce spherical
      GRIN lenses with reduced spherical aberration. Other examples of
      ball lens materials include borosilicate, sapphire, BK-7,
      polymeric materials such as acrylic, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [000105] The ball lens can be sized based on the desired
      magnification of the optical microscope. As shown in FIG. 9A the
      magnification varies inversely with the ball lens radius. For a
      high magnification, e.g. above 500X, the ball lens can have a
      small radius, such as below 0.5 mm. The small lens size allows for
      a thinner optical microscope thickness and smaller form factor. In
      some embodiments the ball lens has a diameter of less than about
      2,500 microns. In some embodiments the spherical ball lens has a
      diameter of about 1 ,000 [mu][iota][tau][iota] to about 2,500
      [mu][iota][tau][iota]. In some embodiments the ball lens has a
      diameter of less than about 1 ,000 microns. In some embodiments
      the spherical ball lens has a diameter of about 300 [mu] [iota] to
      about 1 ,000 [mu][pi][iota]. In some embodiments the ball lens has
      a diameter of about 100 microns to about 1,000 microns. In some
      embodiments the ball lens has a diameter of about 100 microns to
      about 3,000 microns. In some embodiments the spherical ball lens
      has a diameter of about 100 [mu][eta][iota] to about 300
      [mu][eta][iota].<br>
      <br>
      [000106] In some embodiments half-ball spherical lenses can be
      used. In some embodiments a Wallston doublet lens is utilized. The
      Wallston doublet lens can be composed of multiple half ball
      lenses. In some embodiments a Gradient Index lens is used.<br>
      <br>
      [000107] In some embodiments the effective aperture of the
      substantially spherical lens in the optical microscope can be less
      than the full diameter of the spherical lens. For example, a
      portion of the spherical lens can be covered or removed to reduce
      the effective aperture of the spherical lens as discussed in
      detail below. In some embodiments the aperture is about 1/4 to
      about 2/3 of the diameter of the spherical lens. In some
      embodiments the spherical ball lens has an aperture diameter of
      about 1/4 to about 1/3 of the spherical lens diameter. In some
      embodiments the spherical lens has an aperture diameter of about
      1/3 to about 1/2 of the spherical lens diameter. In some
      embodiments the spherical lens has an aperture diameter of about
      1/2 to about 2/3 of the spherical lens diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [000108] The components of the optical microscopes can be selected
      to achieve a desired magnification and resolution as discussed in
      detail below. In some embodiments the optical microscope has a
      magnification of about 100X to about 200X. In some embodiments the
      optical microscope has a magnification of greater than about 140X.
      In some embodiments the optical microscope has a magnification of
      about 200X to about 500X. In some embodiments the optical
      microscope has a magnification of greater than about 300X. In some
      embodiments the optical microscope has a magnification of greater
      than about 500X. In some embodiments the optical microscope has a
      magnification of about 500X to 1 ,500X. In some embodiments the
      optical microscope has a magnification of greater than about
      1000X. In some embodiments the optical microscope has a
      magnification of greater than about 1500X. In some embodiments the
      optical microscope has a magnification of about 1 ,500X to 2,500X.
      In some embodiments the optical microscope has a magnification of
      greater than about 2000X. In some embodiments the optical
      microscope has a magnification of greater than about 2500X.<br>
      <br>
      [000109] In some embodiments the microscope has a resolution of
      about 2.0 to about 3.0 microns. In some embodiments the microscope
      has a resolution of about 1.5 to about 2.0 microns. In some
      embodiments the microscope has a resolution of about 1.0 to about
      1.5 microns. In some embodiments the microscope has a resolution
      of about 0.88 to about 1.0 microns. In some embodiments the
      microscope has a resolution of about 0.6 to about 0.88 microns. In
      some embodiments the microscope has a resolution of less than
      about 1.0 microns. In some embodiments the microscope has a
      resolution of 0.2 to 0.5 microns.<br>
      <br>
      [000110] Examples of light sources include sun light, LED lights,
      a lamp, indoor lighting, incandescent lighting, fluorescent
      lighting, a flame, chemiluminescence source such as a glow stick,
      and other light sources.<br>
      <br>
      [000111] In some embodiments the light source is an LED light. In
      some embodiments the LED is white. A white LED can provide a
      full-spectrum color image of the sample in bright- field. In some
      embodiments the LED is blue. A blue LED can provide light of an
      appropriate wavelength for fluorescence imaging. In some
      embodiments the LEDs have power suitable so that a user may
      perceive multiple simultaneous images of the sample. In some
      embodiments the LED has a luminous emittance of about 1 - l OOkLux
      or more, which is suitable to project an image of the sample. In
      some embodiments the LED has a power of about 10-1 ,000 Lux, which
      is suitable to illuminate the sample so that a user's eye may
      perceive the image of the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [000112] In some embodiments the light source can be coupled to an
      illumination stage. In some embodiments the optical device or
      microscope includes an illumination stage with an element for
      modifying the profile of the light from the light source (e.g.
      LED), such as a condenser, diffuser, light shaping diffuser,
      polycarbonate light shaping filter, etc. The illumination stage
      can also include a condenser to focus the light from the light
      source. Filters can also be used with the illumination stage.
      Examples of filters include polarization filters, polymer color
      filters, diffusive filters, and fluorescence filters. In some
      embodiments, optical microscope has an illumination stage that
      provides Kohler illumination.<br>
      <br>
      [000113] In some embodiments the illumination stage includes an
      aperture or hole for allowing light to pass through the
      illumination stage towards the sample. The illumination stage
      aperture can be sized based on the size and diameter of the lens.
      In some embodiments the aperture has a diameter of about 1/4 to
      about 2/3 of the diameter of the lens<br>
      <br>
      [000114] A power source, such as a battery, can be used to provide
      power to the light source. The power source can be coupled to the
      illumination stage.<br>
      <br>
      [000115] The sample can be provided to the optical microscope on a
      substrate. The substrate can include a coating or reagent. In some
      embodiments the substrate can be provided on the flat material
      having the optic stage, sample stage, and illumination stage. In
      some embodiments the sample is provided on a glass slide.<br>
      <br>
      [000116] FIG. 1 illustrates the components for assembly into an
      exemplary optical microscope. The optical microscope 100 includes
      sample or specimen stage 1 10, an illumination stage 1 12, a
      spacer insert 1 14, a locking spacer insert 1 16, and an optics
      stage 1 18. In various embodiments, the optical microscope 100 may
      not include an illumination stage 1 12. In the embodiment without
      an illumination stage 1 12, the illumination source may be an
      external source, such as the sun, a lamp, a candle or some other
      source. Components 1 10-1 18 may be part of a single flat sheet of
      paper that may be used to implement the optical microscope. The
      specimen stage 1 10 may include microscope identifiers 120, grid
      122, horizontal position indicators 124, vertical position
      indicators 125, specimen illumination window 126, vertical fine
      position indicator 128, horizontal fine position indicator 130,
      slide sleeve 132 and slide viewing window 134. In the illustrated
      embodiment, horizontal position indicators 124 are denoted by the
      letters A-L and vertical position indicators 125 are denoted by
      the letters U-Z. Each letter A-L and U-Z of the horizontal
      position indicators 124 and vertical position indicators 125,
      respectively, may advance in increments of 2mm. Any increment may
      be implemented. The microscope identifiers 120 may give the
      specification information that may include the microscope modality
      and magnification.<br>
      <br>
      [000117] Grid 122 may be used along with horizontal position
      indicators 124, vertical position indicators 125, vertical fine
      position indicator 128, and horizontal fine position indicator
      130. Specimen illumination window 126 may be an aperture or hole
      that allows a user to view a sample. Slide sleeve 132 may be
      folded over specimen illumination window 126 of specimen stage 1
      10. Slide sleeve 132 may include slide slot 136 and slide tab 131.
      Slide tab 131 may be inserted into tab slot 121 during assembly.
      The size of each of the slide sleeve 132, slide slot 136, slide
      tab 131 , slide slot 136, slide guides 139 and tab slot 121 may
      control the force that holds the slide in place. In various
      embodiments, the size of each of the slide sleeve 132, slide slot
      136, slide tab 131 , slide slot 136, slide guides 139 and tab slot
      121 is configured to allow the slide to be easily inserted and
      positioned. In various embodiments, the size of each of the slide
      sleeve 132, slide slot 136, slide tab 131 , slide slot 136, slide
      guides 139 and tab slot 121 is configured to maintain an original
      position and resist movement after the sample slide is inserted. A
      slide containing a sample may be inserted through slide slot 136
      into slide sleeve 132. Slide guides 139 along the edges of slide
      sleeve 132 may be folded over to help guide insertion of the
      slide. The sample slide (not shown) may be positioned over
      specimen illumination window 126. The edge of the sample slide is
      lined up so that it is adjacent to a longitudinal edge 138.<br>
      <br>
      [000118] Specimen stage 1 10 includes a mechanism for reproducing
      microscope settings. The mechanism is implemented by grid 122,
      vertical fine position indicator 128, horizontal fine position
      indicator 130, horizontal position indicator 124, vertical
      position indicator 125 and slide sleeve 132.<br>
      <br>
      [000119] The illumination stage 1 12 may include circuitry 140,
      light source 142, and contact pads 144A-B. Circuitry 140 may
      include copper tape, conductive paper, conductive ink, or any
      other flat conductive material. The circuitry 140 can control the
      power supply to light source 142. In various embodiments, the
      power supply includes a battery. Light source 142 may include one
      or more LED lights, a lamp, a chemiluminescence source such as a
      glow stick, or other source. Illumination can be enhanced via a
      condenser lens 157 (located between 156 and 158). Contact pads
      144A-B may establish contact with contacts on the optics stage 1
      18.<br>
      Illumination stage 1 12 may be mounted to specimen stage 1 10. In
      various embodiments, the optics stage 1 18 and the illumination
      stage 1 12 remain aligned within 0.5mm or better during panning
      and focusing. This may be accomplished by connecting tabs 145A-B
      in the illumination stage 1 12 into the slots 147A-B in the optics
      stage 1 18. <br>
      <br>
      [000120] A light source using chemiluminescence uses a chemical
      reaction as the illumination or light source. Liquid light sources
      may flow into a tube or flat chamber and allow for a wide array of
      optical designs. The liquid light source may move translationally
      so that the user sees the entire sample. Usually, one only has 2
      degrees of freedom; the present disclosure allows vision of
      everything on the slide. Additionally, the present disclosure may
      allow for a configuration of a tube within a tube. A liquid light
      source within inner tube may illuminate a sample located between
      the inner tube and the outer tube. This design requires "zero
      power" to remove the need for a power source such as a battery or
      button cells.<br>
      <br>
      [000121] Spacer insert 1 14 and locking spacer insert 1 16 may be
      used to position the lens (not shown) and adjust the optics of the
      optical microscope 100. One or more spacer inserts 1 14, 1 16 may
      be attached to illumination stage 1 12. One or more spacer inserts
      1 14 may be positioned first. The locking spacer insert 1 16 is
      positioned over the one or more spacer inserts 1 14 to lock or
      hold them in position.<br>
      <br>
      [000122] Optics stage 1 18 may include contacts 146A-B, vertical
      slits 148, horizontal slits 150, and lens apertures 152. Optics
      stage 1 18 is mounted to illumination stage 1 12 and specimen
      stage 1 10. Contacts 146A-B are designed to align with contact
      pads 144A-B. By depressing contacts 146A or 146B, a circuit is
      closed with light source 142 and a power source causing light
      source 142 to illuminate.<br>
      <br>
      [000123] Vertical slits 148 and horizontal slits 150 align with
      vertical fine position indicator 128 and horizontal fine position
      indicator 130, respectively. As the sample slide is moved to the
      left horizontally, the horizontal fine position indicators 130
      advance in that direction as it goes from one line to the next. In
      various embodiments, each horizontal line of horizontal fine
      position indicator 130 may represent a specific increment such as
      0.5mm. If a user sees two solid lines at the same time, the
      position is in between increments such as 0.25mm. Any increment
      may be implemented. A location may be determined by the horizontal
      position indicators 124 and the vertical position indicators 125.
      For example, as a user looks at the left side of the optical
      microscope 100, a mark (not shown) indicates the horizontal
      position is at A or B. The vertical position may be determined
      similarly using vertical position indicators 125, X, Y, and Z, and
      may have similar increments. Vertical fine position indicator 128
      and horizontal fine position indicator 130 may compliment vertical
      position indicators 125 and horizontal position indicator 124 by
      providing more detailed alignment information.<br>

      [000124] The optical microscope 100 may be created using a flat
      manufacturing process. Components may be together on a flat sheet
      that can be cut out and folded into an optical device. A design of
      pre-cut sheets can be created, downloaded, printed and used.
      Several integrated microscopes can be contained in one such
      optical microscope, creating different optical microscopes based
      on how the paper/material is folded. The present microscope may be
      a single-use microscope and is suitable for the present technology
      because the overall manufacturing process is inexpensive enough to
      discard or incinerate after use.<br>
      <br>
      [000125] FIG. 2A illustrates a top view of an exemplary optical
      microscope. FIG. 2B illustrates a cross-sectional view of the
      optical microscope of FIG. 2A. The optical microscope 100 of FIGs.
      2A-B include specimen stage 1 10, illumination stage 1 12, optics
      stage 1 18, and sample 154. Sample 154 may be viewed through slide
      viewing window 134 (See FIG. 1). Light source 156 may direct light
      through filter 158, condenser 157, sample 154, specimen<br>
      illumination window 126 and is received by lens 160. Lens 160 may
      be positioned between spacer inserts 1 14 and locking spacer
      insert 1 16. In some embodiments, a second lens may be implemented
      between sample 154 and light source 156. In some embodiments an
      array of lenses are used. In some embodiments a condenser is used
      to shape the light and improve resolution.<br>
      <br>
      [000126] Focusing the optical microscope 100 can be shown with
      reference to FIG. 2B. Focusing the lens 160 can be implemented by
      a flexure mechanism that uses a cantilever beam of paper being
      pinched at two points for a symmetric upward and downward motion
      of the embedded optics as shown in FIG. 2B. Tension or compression
      of the optics stage 1 18 causes a Z-axis scan via a flexure
      mechanism. The flexure mechanism can have a maximum travel
      distance of about 1 mm. The flexure mechanism can converts purely
      translational pinching movement along the X-axis to upward or
      downward motion along the Z-axis. The distance between the lens
      160 and the sample 154 can be adjusted by pushing or pulling on
      the ends of the optics stage 1 18. Pushing the ends of the optics
      stage towards each other causes the lens 160 to raise thereby
      increasing the distance between the lens 160 and the sample 154.
      Pulling the ends of the optics stage 1 18 away from each other
      lowers the lens 160 thereby decreasing the distance between the
      lens 160 and the sample 154. The movement of the lens 160 towards
      and away from the sample 154 can be referred to as movement along
      the z-axis. In the case when there are two lenses (as shown in
      FIG. 5C), the lenses may be a certain distance apart. In various
      embodiments, the lenses may be about 6mm apart. In other
      embodiments, the lenses may be about 5.5mm apart. If a user finds
      something in left lens and wants to look at the same article/item
      with the right lens, the user may put a mark on grid 122. A
      marking instrument such as a pen or pencil may be inserted through
      marking apertures 133 in the optics stage 1 18 and marking
      apertures 135 in the illumination stage 1 12 to mark a position on
      grid 122. The user then moves the optics stage 1 18 so that it is
      lined up with the mark on grid 122. This may also allow a second
      user to find and view the same article/item using markings created
      by the first user. For example, a lab technician may be able to
      easily locate a particular pathology that has been indicated by
      markings on grid 122. The marking apertures can be used in any of
      the lens arrangements described herein. The marking apertures can
      have a precision of 0.5mm or less.<br>
      <br>
      [000127] The optical design may include focusing features, zoom
      features, panning features, and/or other features. Lens 160 may
      have a magnification of 140x, 340x, 680x, and 1 140x corresponding
      to a borosilicate ball lenses with diameters of 2.4mm, 1.0mm,
      0.5mm, and 0.3mm, respectively, as well as other magnifications. A
      variety of materials may be used for the lens. The lens may have a
      short path length due to the flat optical design that reduces
      signal-to- noise ratio for fluorescence. The path length may be
      symmetric or asymmetric. An asymmetric path length is created with
      a filter, a specimen, another filter, a ball lens on the top side,
      a light source and a light receiver. If a ball lens is placed on
      the bottom, the microscope becomes symmetric. The second lens may
      correct for the LED's divergence, making the light rays parallel
      rather than diverging, optimizing the LED. The LED may also act as
      a point source depending on the design.<br>

      [000128] FIG. 3 illustrates different embodiments of optical
      microscopes with various magnifications and modalities. Bright
      field optical microscopes are shown with a magnification of 435X

      [000129] FIG. 5A shows a schematic arrangement of the parts of an
      optical microscope on a flat material that can be cut, folded,
      assembled, and used to diagnose a blood sample. FIG. 5B
      illustrates various parts of an optical microscope prior to
      assembly in accordance with an embodiment. FIGS. 5C, 5D, and 5E
      illustrate assembling and adjusting portions of an optical
      microscope. FIG. 5C illustrates the x-y scanning feature. FIG. 5D
      illustrates two lenses 160 with magnifications of 140x and 330x,
      respectively. The 140x magnification lens 160 produces a bright
      field image. The 330x magnification lens 160 produces a
      fluorescence image. The glass slide 170 is shown engaged with the
      optical microscope 100. FIG. 5E illustrates the z-axis focus by
      pushing inward on the edges of the optical stage.<br>
      [000130] FIGS. 5F-G are various images produced by a conventional
      microscope (FIG. 5F) compared to images taken with an optical
      microscope in accordance with embodiments (FIG. 5G). The images in
      FIG. 5F were taken using a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope
      with a Hg lamp, LED, and glow stick under a magnification of 400X,
      respectively. FIG. 5G illustrates fluorescence images produced by
      an optical microscope in accordance with embodiments disclosed
      herein for AO stained beads and AO stained white blood cells at a
      magnification of 330X and 140X, respectively. The images
      illustrated in FIG. 5F are comparable to the images achieved using
      a conventional microscope shown in FIG. 5G.<br>
      <br>
      [000131] The optical devices disclosed herein can be assembled
      without written language instructions. This is advantageous
      because the optical microscopes can be used in a variety of
      countries without requiring translations of the instructions for
      different countries. The language free folding instructions can
      include colors and pictures to facilitate the assembly of the
      optical microscope. The language free instructions can be directly
      printed on the instrument itself, for example a color matching
      scheme that guides a user to correct folding sequence. The
      surfaces of the optical microscope can also provide staining
      instructions for the sample. The surfaces of the optical
      microscope can include an identification guide for the diagnostics
      provided on the optical microscope. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate
      examples of optical microscopes prior to folding in accordance
      with various embodiments. FIGS. 6A and 6B are illustrated in black
      and white but can include bright colors to facilitate the folding
      and assembling instructions.<br>
      <br>
      [000132] The optical microscopes can be folded and assembled with
      a high degree of precision and accuracy. Traditional optical
      instruments require significant alignment post assembly. An
      advantageous feature of a folding optical assembly design is that
      self-alignment can be exploited with kinematic constraints present
      in how the folds are executed, even for manual folding. Folding a
      sheet of paper introduces an alignment error proportional to the
      thickness of the paper in a valley or mountain fold. This error
      arises from uncertain position of a hinge in a fold due to
      buckling of paper in the inner edge of the fold. The alignment
      errors can be corrected by introducing folding features that
      provide kinematic constraints, for example mating the two stages
      and implementing closed structural loops during folding. For a
      mechanical process, repeatability is inversely proportional to the
      square root of contact points for elastically averaged coupling
      alignment schemes. The optical microscopes disclosed herein, for
      example, can utilize four contact points and two alignment
      surfaces to couple the optics and illumination stage. To
      characterize the alignment accuracy and repeatability of the
      optical microscopes, twenty independent microscopes were cut out
      of A4 sheets of paper with a laser cutting tool having a cutting
      error of +-6 microns. Each microscope was hand folded and unfolded
      repeatedly, while measuring X-Y alignment errors between the
      optical and illumination stage. FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate data
      for the accuracy and repeatability, respectively, for folding and
      unfolding the optical microscopes. Assembly accuracy and precision
      for the optical alignment as small as 10 microns was demonstrated
      for the microscope components in a manual assembly process using
      paper with a thickness of about 150 [mu][iota][eta]. The optical
      alignment can include the alignment of the light source,
      optic/lens, sample stage, and any other items within this path,
      such as filters, diffusers, apertures, etc. The alignment
      precision was acceptable for the lens sizes disclosed herein, for
      example a lens having a diameter of 300 [mu][iota][eta].<br>
      <br>
      [000133] The optical microscopes disclosed herein can be durable
      and resistant to outdoor elements. For example, the optical
      microscopes can be stepped on and still work as shown in FIGS.
      25A-B. The microscopes can work submerged in water and survive a
      fall from a three story building.<br>
      <br>
      [000134] The optical device can be optimized based on the desired
      application or for general use. A number of parameters can be
      adjusted to optimize the optical device. For example, the lens
      size and shape, lens refractive index, lens material, the optical
      path length, optical path shape/direction, the lens aperture size
      and shape, the light source type and location, the aperture
      associated with the light source, the light source intensity and
      profile, the alignment of the light source with the lens, the
      wavelength of the light source, the polarization and coherence of
      the light source, the magnification of the sample, the resolution
      of the image, the inclusion of additional features such as
      automated staining or sample separation, the inclusion of a cell
      counter feature for keeping track of the level of parasitimia,
      optical filters placed in front of the light source or in front of
      the lens, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [000135] In some embodiments, the folding accuracy is accomplished
      by geometrical features cut in flat material that act as kinematic
      couplings thus providing a self-alignment. In some embodiments,
      self-alignment is further improved by providing structural closed
      loops in folding steps.<br>
      <br>
      [000136] In some embodiments, the optical microscope can have an
      integrated microfluidic channel for bringing samples directly to
      the microscope lens.<br>
      <br>
      [000137] In some embodiments, the optical microscope can be
      incinerated after one use safely and thus can be used with
      infected samples. In some embodiments, the entire microscope is
      disposable after single or multiple uses.<br>
      <br>
      [000138] In some embodiment, a waveguide is utilized to channel
      light from the light source to other optical components.<br>
      <br>
      [000139] In some embodiments, the sample is reacted to a reagent
      already deposited in the sample holding stage via a microfluidic
      network embedded in the sample holding stage. In some embodiments,
      the reagent is dried for preservation. In some embodiments, the
      reagent is wet.<br>
      <br>
      [000140] The devices disclosed herein can be modified to modify
      the optical path to a desired configuration. The flexibility in
      designing the optical path allows the device to be used as a
      general purpose optical design tool. Optical devices such as
      microscopes, interferometers, and spectrophotometers can be
      assembled using the methods, devices, and concepts disclosed
      herein. [000141] In some embodiments, the lens can be cleaned by
      inserting a slide with lens paper attached to the surface followed
      by panning the second stage with the lens/optic in circles over
      the lens paper so that the lens paper brushes off contaminants
      from the surface of the lens.<br>
      <br>
      [000142] FIG. 8A illustrates an exemplary optical path of an
      optical microscope in accordance with an embodiment. FIG. 8A
      illustrates the distance between the light source (e.g.LED) and
      sample object as D¦ed-0bj, the distance between the sample object
      and lens as D0bj-iens, the distance between the lens and image
      plane as Dier,s-img- The optical chain of the optical microscope
      includes illumination sources (distance Z oi condenser lens,
      illumination aperture (A /), sample glass slide, spherical
      micro-lens (radius r, refractive index n at a distance D0bj-iens
      from the slide) and entrance {A2) and exit {A3) aperture. For a
      real image in projection mode, the image plane is a distance
      Diem.img apart. The total optical path length from the light
      source to the last lens surface can be about 2.5mm, which is only
      about 1 % of the optical path length for a conventional
      microscope. The decreased optical path length allows for the
      microscope to be constructed with a short vertical height assuming
      a vertical optical path. The reduced optical path length can also
      minimize the extent to which stray light can enter the system and
      degrade optical performance.<br>
      <br>
      [000143] FIG. 9A illustrates the magnification obtained versus
      various lens radii for different refractive index values. FIG. 9A
      depicts overall magnification obtained as a function of ball
      radius (r) for refractive index (") values ranging from 1.33 to 2.
      The parameters shown in FIG. 9A can be optimized to improve the
      resolution of the optical microscope. Utilizing ray- tracing
      methods, a collimated beam of light entering an aperture diameter
      A2 and a spherical ball lens with a diameter (D=2r) and refractive
      index n, is focused to a point given by the effective focal length
      EFL = 2^_^ and numerical aperture (NA) is given by NA =
      &lt;A&gt;'^&lt;n&gt; ^ with magnification inversely proportional
      to ball lens radius as shown in FIG. 9A. A magnification of -2175X
      can be obtained with a sapphire glass lens of about 200
      [mu][eta][iota] in diameter as shown in FIG. 9A. FIG. 9B
      illustrates the third order spherical aberration versus ball lens
      radii. The transverse third order spherical aberration can be
      expressed as TSC = ^&lt;71-3&gt;^*^ which reduces as a<br>
      Zn'r"<br>
      function of ball lens radius as shown in FIG. 9B.<br>
      <br>
      [000144] The aperture radius (A2) can be optimized to maximize
      contrast and resolution, for example by balancing spherical
      aberration in the image and transmitted illumination intensity for
      a fixed wavelength of light. Considering collimated incident
      light, resolution as a function of lens-image distance (D
      iens-img) and aperture radius (A2) can be calculated both
      numerically and analytically. Since the optimization depends on
      two independent parameters numerical optimization is achieved in
      two stages. The first stage optimizes the focus by varying D
      iens-inig, while the second stage optimizes the resolution by
      varying A2 with D iens-img equal to its optimum value for each
      aperture radius. For the first optimization stage, the focusing
      metric is chosen to be the reciprocal of the Strehl Ratio (1/SR).
      Minimizing this focusing metric effectively selects a value for
      Diens-img corresponding to diffraction focus, or best focus. FIG.
      10 illustrates focusing metric versus the distance between the
      lens and image for RMS spot size (RSS), inverse Strehl ratio
      (1/SR), and ratio of spot size to Strehl ratio (RSS/SR).<br>
      <br>
      [000145] The second optimization stage calculates optimal aperture
      diameter (A2) by minimizing a resolution metric, evaluated as the
      ratio of Airy Disk Radius and Strehl Ratio (ADR/SR). Graphically,
      this metric gives a curve that subtends the Airy Disk Radius (ADR)
      for small aperture radii and parallels RMS Spot Size for large
      aperture radii. Also, it provides good numerical convergence.
      Numerical modeling results in design curves as a function of lens
      radius r, refractive index n, and incident light wavelength
      [lambda]. FIG. 1 1 A illustrates the normalized optimal aperture
      radius versus magnification for various radii and refractive index
      values. FIG. 1 I B illustrates resolution versus magnification for
      various radii and refractive index values. FIGS. 12A-12B
      illustrate calculations for the optimal aperture radius and
      resolution, respectively, as a function of ball lens radius,
      refractive index, and incident light wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [000146] For the analytical model, the optimization proceeds by
      evaluating the diffraction limited resolution at best focus, where
      the normalized longitudinal aberration ([Lambda]) is equal to 1.
      Two different analytical models can be used to derive identical
      results, within a multiplicative constant. In the first analytical
      model, Airy Disk Radius is equated to RMS Spot Size<br>
      (ADR=RSS). The Airy Disk Radius is evaluated as ADR = 1.22 .
      [lambda]- F , where F = EFL/2A2 is the focal ratio or F/#. The RMS
      Spot Size is approximated as the RMS blur radius (rRMs)&gt; at
      best focus, RSS s<br>
      is the focal ratio, s = s- A2&lt;4&gt; is the peak aberration
      coefficient and s is the aberration coefficient. For a ball lens,
      the following expression was derived for the aberration
      coefficient: s = -(" - l)- [" + (2 - ")- (2" - l)]/8rV . Setting
      the expression for ADR equal to the expression for RSS and solving
      for A2/r, the following expression is obtained for the normalized
      optimal aperture radius: [lambda] - [eta]&lt;3&gt;<br>
      nOAR = k' , where<br>
      - (n - ])- [n + (2 - n)- (2n - \<br>
      k[ = (l .22 . 2 . -JeJ = 1.5636 . This can be substituted into the
      expression for ADR (or that for RSS) to obtain the following
      expression for image resolution:<br>
      <br>
      where k' = (l .227276) 4 = 0.1951. The above expression for
      optimal aperture and corresponding resolution show good agreement
      with the numerical calculations illustrated in FIGS. 12A-B. The
      second analytical model determines the diffraction-limited
      resolution by minimizing the ratio of Airy Disk Radius (ADR) to
      Strehl Ratio (SR), i.e. by solving d/da(ADR/SR) = 0 . For this
      model, the Strehl ratio can be expressed using the empirical
      approximation,<br>
      SR - exp[-(2/w[3/4]/ l)&lt;2&gt;], where [omega]5 is the RMS
      wavefront error at best focus. As mentioned earlier, this model
      produces the same results as the first model, except with the
      constants now being, k[ = (6VK)/7T)&lt;1&gt; = 1.5677 and k2' = (l
      .22/4). ([tau][tau]/6)&lt;[iota]/4&gt; . (e/1 o)&lt;1
      s&gt;[identical to] 0.2205. For example, the numerical and
      analytical models predict an optimized image resolution of about
      0.88um for a 300um diameter sapphire lens, which agrees well with
      experimental data (see FIG. 12B and FIG. 18). In some embodiments
      a resolution can be as high as 500 nm at magnifications greater
      than about 2000X.<br>
      <br>
      [000147] The resolution of the optical microscope can be
      quantified by observing an object having a known size. For
      example, fluorescence resolution was determined between two
      adjacent microspheres using ImageJ's linear intensity profile
      tool. Microspheres were considered to be resolvable when the
      minimum intensity value between the two spheres was 84.4% of the
      maximum intensity of the normalized dataset as is in accordance to
      the Rayleigh Criterion. To make peaks of intensity
      distinguishable, a local polynomial regression model weighted
      across every 10 pixels was used to smooth the data. Using this
      analysis, the [Iota] [mu][eta][iota] beads were barely resolvable.
      FIG. 18 illustrates an image of 1 [mu][pi][iota] polystyrene beads
      using a 300 [mu][iota][eta] ball lens and an aperture size of
      about 150 [mu][iota][eta]. FIG. 19A illustrates a bright field
      image of 1 micron polystyrene beads. FIG. 19B illustrates a
      fluorescent image of 2 micron polystyrene beads. FIG. 19C
      illustrates a plot of intensity versus distance.<br>
      <br>
      [000148] For brightfield resolution, the beads could clearly be
      resolved between one another as shown in FIG. 18. As there are
      several methods for measuring resolution in brightfield, we
      borrowed a technique used by Lorusso and Joy (2003) for
      quantifying resolution using the Fourier Transform of the
      bead-matrix image. FIG. 19D is an image of the polystyrene beads
      shown in FIG. 18 along with a 2D-Fourier transform showing the
      power spectrum of the threshold image and spatial frequency
      detail. A threshold was set for the original image such that noise
      was removed and the 2-dimensional fast-Fourier transform was then
      performed on the image. Upon taking the power spectrum of the
      Fourier transform, the extent of the spatial frequencies was
      found. The mean radius of this ellipsoidal extent was then used to
      calculate the smallest feature size, which is equal to the
      resolution, in the image using the following equation: Resolution
      = ROIW * PixelSize / RFFT * Image Scaling where ROIW is the
      average width of the sensor and RFFT is the average radius of the
      power spectrum in the Fourier domain. The pixel size is the size
      of the pixels on the CCD. The image scaling is a factor used in
      determining the scale of the image plane compared to the CCD
      plane. For this image, the ROIW was 4680 pixels, the RFFT was
      318.25, the Pixel Size was 6.4 micrometers and the Scaling factor
      was 95 CCD pixels per object pixel. This resulted in a calculated
      resolution of 0.99 micrometers. In general, this is a conservative
      method of measuring resolution as the smallest features can be
      filtered out with the noise during the threshold step.<br>
      <br>
      [000149] FIG. 13 is a graph of resolution versus aperture radius
      for various metrics. The optimal resolution metric was obtained
      using the ratio of Airy Disk to Strehl ratio. FIG. 14 is a graph
      of the filter transmission versus wavelength for various filter
      types. FIG. 14 compares an excitation filter, emission filter, and
      diffusive filter. Associated fluorescence image data using the
      above filter set as barrier (blue) and emission (red) filter is
      shown in FIGS. 18 and FIG. 23L. In some embodiments the filters
      can be provided with separate light sources. In some embodiments
      the filters can be integral with the sample stage. In some
      embodiments the filter can be included with the optic stage.<br>
      <br>
      [000150] Malaria samples are often observed under an oil immersion
      lens due to ring artifacts that arise because of curved shape of a
      red blood cell. FIGS. 15A and 15B are images of malaria samples
      observed with a diffuser. FIG. 15A is an image obtained using an<br>
      embodiment of the optical microscopes described herein and FIG.
      15B is an image obtained using a conventional microscope. FIGS.
      15A and 15B illustrate that good quality images can be obtained
      without the use of an oil immersion lens. Using a simple thin
      plastic film diffuser that cuts out directional illumination can
      remove artifacts due to cell inhomogeneity and enhance the image
      component due to light absorption. An example of the transmission
      spectra of the diffusive filter is shown in FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      [000151] FIG. 16A illustrate three different LED light sources
      with and without a condenser. The three LED based light sources,
      labeled #516, #350 and #425, were imaged using fluorescein
      dissolved in water. As shown in FIG. 16A, the condenser further
      focuses the light. FIG. 16B illustrates the illumination intensity
      in a polar plot of LED light source #516.<br>
      <br>
      [000152] Additional modeling is shown in FIGS. 17A-D. A 0.3 mm
      sapphire lens is modeled in FIGS. 17A-D. FIG. 17A is model of the
      ray tracing for a 0.3 mm spherical ball lens. FIG. 17B a model of
      the RMS spot size for off-axis rays of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
      degrees. FIG. 17C is a model of an RMS spot radius field map. FIG.
      17D is a model of a Strehl Ratio field map.<br>
      <br>
      [000153] The microscope may also allow a user to view the same
      object at two different magnifications at the same time. This
      embodiment can provide two concentric magnification regions, where
      the inner region is at a higher magnification than the outer
      region. This may be achieved by placing a half ball lens above a
      smaller diameter ball lens in a doublet configuration, for
      example. The microscope may be utilized as a single purpose
      microscope, having optics that depend on the type of stain used,
      the light source and the filters used. The optics design allows
      for illumination to track with the optics. A reflective mylar
      sheet may be implemented for providing a mirror surface, and may
      allow for simultaneous frontside ackside imaging as shown in FIG.
      8B.<br>
      <br>
      [000154] The present microscope may have a simultaneous
      multi-modal imaging feature. Multi-modal may involve two or more
      images on the retina simultaneously by taking advantage of the
      psychophysics of the eye. The present microscope may have one or
      more lenses. Each of the one or more lenses may correspond to a
      different microscope modality. The microscope modalities may
      include brightfield, darkfield, fluorescence in many sets
      depending on the type of filter implemented (GFP, YFP, AO,
      Auramine-O, DAPI, or other filter) or any other filter, and
      polarization using polarization filters and any other optical
      microscopy. Each of the microscope modalities may be implemented
      at high and low magnifications. One or more of the microscope
      modalities may be implemented at the same time on optical
      microscope 100 in any arrangement. For example, the microscope may
      include darkfield imaging at a specific magnification and
      brightfield imaging at a second magnification. Hence, in the same
      field of view, the user may be looking at the same object l OOOx
      magnified, and simultaneously looking at it l Ox magnified. In
      various embodiments, the microscope modalities form an array.<br>
      <br>
      [000155] In various embodiments, the ball lenses may be arranged
      in an 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 matrix, where each lens provides identical
      images but with a slightly different experience - a continuous
      field may be presented. For example, if looking at red blood
      cells, even though each ball is only contributing one portion of
      that field, it appears to be like a continuous field. The images
      provided by the matrix merge as one and appear as a landscape
      rather than individual images. In various embodiments, if a user
      changes an illumination angle, and turns it bright or dark, the
      microscope may provide the user with 3D information about the
      sample by producing contrast over the sample based on variations
      in the sample's 3D profile. Because the illumination stage can
      move, a user can take the same object and achieve a 3D imaging
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      [000156] Another feature of the optical microscope 100 is a
      projection mechanism. FIG. 20A illustrates a schematic for
      utilizing a refraction ball lens for projection microscopy with
      ray- tracing for half of a lens. FIG. 20B illustrates a projection
      illuminated through water containing fluorescein. The projection
      mechanism can project images onto a wall, screen, or other
      surface. The mechanism is a brighter LED such as a high-intensity
      LED to make the projection more visible. Rather than looking
      directly into the optical microscope, a user may flip it over and
      point to a wall in the dark. Two or more people may be looking at
      the same image at the same time. For example, in a dark room, a
      high-intensity LED may allow a projection of an image from across
      the room, making a 1 mm mosquito proboscis appear over 2 meters
      tall on the wall. The projection may be onto a camera, a wall, a
      retina, or other location, and the microscope can be a digital
      image of the projection - the projection optics are the same. In
      various embodiments, there is also a CCD version that may be
      provided with one or more cameras integrated in the present
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [000157] The projected mode allows for a number of people to
      simultaneously view the images. The effective magnification in
      projection mode is dependent on the distance between the lens and
      the projected image with the intensity inversely proportional to
      the distance between the lens and projected image. FIG. 21 A is a
      projected image of a mosquito proboscis at an effective
      magnification of 1500X. FIG. 21B is a projected image of red blood
      cells at an effective magnification of 3000X.<br>
      <br>
      [000158] FIG. 22B is a picture of a single ball lens optical
      microscope projecting an image on the retina of a user in
      accordance with an embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [000159] Optical components of the manufacturing process may
      include microfluidics, doublets, and other features. Microfluidics
      may be used to manufacture components. Doublets may be created
      from liquid and cured lenses and used in combination with a
      microscope. This may allow for lower costs and timing while
      increasing magnification. A unique slide position readout may
      provide a location grid of the sample and allow a user to know
      where they are on the slide. An integrated cell count mechanism
      may also be used with the present optical microscope.<br>
      <br>
      [000160] Fluidic integration into microscope design may minimize
      sample handling. An auto-staining process within the microscope
      involves filters designed from plastic films. The auto-staining
      process may have the staining dye already integrated.<br>
      <br>
      [000161] Several optical microscopes may be contained in a single
      package. The optical microscopes can be packaged individually
      similar to a band aid and revealed just before use. This packaging
      minimizes the risk of having fungus grow on microscope components
      in humid environments.<br>
      <br>
      [000162] The optical microscopes disclosed herein can also be used
      under water. The microscope can include a water resistant coating
      such as a polymer coating. Operating under water allows for live
      imaging of microscopic swimming organisms under water. The
      underwater image can be projected on the side wall of the
      aquarium. The thermal gradients generated allow for water to flow
      past by the sample stage, thus bringing live swimming organisms to
      be imaged in projection mode through the microscope. FIG. 22A is a
      picture of a single ball lens optical microscope submerged under
      water in accordance with an embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [000163] The optical microscopes disclosed herein can be used for
      disease diagnostics. For example, temperature stable stains are
      widely available for labeling infectious disease samples including
      Giemsa and Acridine Orange that are usually used on a standard
      thin blood smear. Various imaging parameters of optical
      microscopes disclosed herein, such as field of view,
      magnification, etc. can be optimized to match the imaging
      requirements for a disease of interest. The optical microscopes
      disclosed herein can be configured and built to match a specific
      disease of interest. In some embodiments disease specific optical
      microscopes are used instead of general-purpose optical
      microscopes. For example, various optical microscope
      configurations were setup and utilized to image freshly prepared
      diagnostics samples of various parasitic diseases, including
      Plasmodium falciparum (FIG. 23A), Trypanosom cruzi (FIG. 23B),
      Giradia lamblia (FIG. 23C), sickle cell disease (FIG. 23D), gram
      positive and gram negative bacteria (FIG. 23E), Leishmania
      donovani (FIG. 23F) and Dirofilaria immitis (FIG. 23G) imaged via
      various magnification settings. It is noted that the above data
      (maximum magnification 2500X) was obtained without the use of oil
      immersion technique or coverslips, which further complicates
      sample preparation and microscope maintenance in conventional
      diagnostics assays. This broad dataset reveals the versatility of
      utility of the optical microscopes disclosed herein in disease
      diagnostics.<br>
      <br>
      [000164] FIG. 24A is an image produced by a single ball lens
      optical microscope in accordance with an embodiment of human
      chromosomes. FIG. 24B is an image produced by a single ball lens
      optical microscope in accordance with an embodiment of a DNA/RNA
      stain. FIG. 24C is an image produced by a single ball lens optical
      microscope in accordance with an embodiment of a spinal cord. FIG.
      24D is an image produced by a single ball lens optical microscope
      in accordance with an embodiment of skeletal muscle.<br>
      <br>
      [000165] Microscopy based diagnostics can be further improved via
      integrated multiple imaging modalities (such as bright field and
      fluorescence imaging) to improve sensitivity or increase the total
      field of view via implementation of parallel array microscopes.
      The optical microscopes disclosed herein can be packed in a close
      form to implement Simultaneous Multi- modal Microscopy (SMM) using
      the miniature optical components and independent optical paths
      disclosed herein. FIG. 23H is a schematic illustration of a 3x3
      lens array with different modalities embedded in an optical
      microscope in accordance with an embodiment. The use of SMM is
      largely possible due to the large surface area of the retina (FIG.
      23H) that allows for many fields of view to be packed in a closed
      packed configuration, such as 1 +1 , 2x2 or 3x3 array microscopes
      (FIG. 231) with nine fields of view visible simultaneously (FIG.
      23J). Since the optical path for each field of view is
      independent, different modes of microscopy can be combined to
      build simultaneous bright and polarization setup (FIG. 23K) or
      fluorescence from two different wavelengths (FIG. 23 L).
      Simultaneous Multi-modal Microscopy (SMM) enables imaging of
      samples in multiple modalities simultaneously, which is not
      possible in conventional optical setups. <br>
      <br>
      [000166] FIG. 8B is a schematic illustration of an optical path
      for an optical microscope in accordance with an embodiment. FIG.
      8B illustrates two ball lenses 160. One ball lens 160 directly
      observes the sample 154 using the light source 142. The eye can
      directly observe the sample 154 through the optical path 201 and
      ball lens 160. Simultaneously, the eye can observe the sample
      through an alternate optical path 203 involving the second ball
      lens 160 and a mirror205 that can be tilted to focus on the back
      of the sample. The mirror can be adjusted to observe a desired
      area of the sample 154. In some embodiments multiple lenses can be
      aligned with one or more mirrors to alternately view the sample.<br>
