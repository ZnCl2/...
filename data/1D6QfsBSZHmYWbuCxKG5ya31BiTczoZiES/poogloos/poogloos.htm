        <p>A bizarre contraption has just been put together in the
          northern Utah town of Plain City. It's the first full-scale
          test of a major invention from the University of Utah. If it
          works, it could have worldwide significance and will save
          people here lots of money on their sewer bills.</p>

    <blockquote>It looks like alien mushrooms sprouting in a sewage
      lagoon, but it may be the wave of the future in sewage treatment.
      <p>Don Weston, Plain City director of environmental services,
        said, "The good bacteria stays in there and just continues to
        eat, eat, eat and propagate and propagate." </p>
      <p>For the folks in Plain City, the new concept came at a good
        time. Their sewage volume is increasing with growth. Effluent
        discharges are getting closer to violating pollution standards.
        They face the enormous cost of a mechanical sewage plant.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>"They figured it would be right around $13 million. And
      this is going to cost us $100,000," Weston said.
      <p>Over the next couple of weeks, they'll be filling up the lagoon
        so the sewage will rise above the level of the domes. Air will
        bubble through them and up through the sewage. </p>
      <p>"We call them <b>PooGloos</b>," said Professor <b>Kraig
          Johnson</b>, with the department of civil and environmental
        engineering at the University of Utah. </p>
      <p>A University of Utah team invented the igloo concept and have
        successfully treated sewage in the lab. "I don't know why
        somebody didn't think of this already. It's elegant in its
        simplicity," Johnson said. </p>
      <p>The idea is to give bacteria lots of surface area to grow on,
        plenty of oxygen, and a dark environment to prevent algae
        growth. "If you can keep the algae from growing and enhance the
        bacteria, then the pollutants are removed by the bacteria,"
        Johnson explained.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The result is faster, cheaper sewage treatment. "This
      way we can use two of our six ponds to do the same thing, and I
      can shut half this plant down once these are going," Weston said.
      <p>And homeowners don't have to pay for a big new plant. </p>
      <p>Plain City mayor Jay Jenkins said, "We've got real low sewer
        rates. We're down around the $10-a-month area. And our feeling
        was if we would have had to go to a mechanical plant, we
        probably would have ended up having to increase that to around
        $40 or $50 a month." </p>
      <p>If it works, communities all over the world may have PooGloos
        in their future. The University shares the patents, so if
        PooGloos catch on around the world, the U will split the profits
        with the inventors. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to water treatment.
        More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and
        method for removing ammonia from water, such as wastewater. </p>
      <p><b>2. Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>Wastewater treatment lagoons are one of the most widespread
        treatment technologies in the United States, and quite possibly
        one of the most neglected. Lagoons as a treatment technology are
        suited for small to medium sized rural communities, animal
        feedlot operations, as well as some industries. The primary
        advantages of lagoons are low cost and ease of operation.
        Generally speaking, lagoons are effective at removing organic
        material and suspended solids, provided the lagoons are not
        overloaded. One disadvantage of most types of lagoon systems is
        their inability to remove ammonia compounds from the water. </p>
      <p>Ammonia is the primary cause of stench and subsequent neighbor
        complaints from lagoon systems. Ammonia is not removed from the
        wastewater stream in lagoons because the growth of nitrifying
        bacteria is not encouraged. These bacteria are inhibited by
        sunlight, and are out-competed by algae and most other
        free-floating bacteria. </p>
      <p>The lack of nitrification of ammonia compounds is due to
        several factors inherent in the design of an open lagoon. The
        conversion of ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate depends on a
        class of bacteria known collectively as nitrifiers. Nitrifying
        bacteria are somewhat fickle compared to other bacteria such as
        zooglea and organisms like algae that thrive in wastewater
        treatment lagoons. Nitrifying bacteria are slower growing than
        zooglea and algae. They are also inhibited by direct sunlight.
        They have a total oxygen demand to convert ammonia to nitrate
        that is quite high. These bacteria are also temperature
        sensitive, and are generally inhibited at temperatures below
        11.degree. C. It is also known that the waste secretions from
        certain strains of algae can be inhibitory to nitrifying
        bacteria. </p>
      <p>Aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of nitrogenous organic
        compounds in the lagoon release ammonia into the water column,
        thus adding to the dissolved ammonia levels. The TKN (Total
        Kjeldahl Nitrogen) level of the influent wastewater can be
        thought of as an indicator of the ultimate possible ammonia
        loading as the nitrogen in the organic compounds is biologically
        converted to ammonia. One additional source of ammonia in the
        water should be mentioned. A few genera of photosynthetic algae
        can also fix atmospheric N.sub.2 gas (i.e. convert N.sub.2 into
        NH.sub.3). The extent of ammonia addition to wastewater
        treatment lagoons has not been quantified at this time. </p>
      <p>At neutral pH levels, the ammonia molecule is in the form of
        ammonium (NH.sub.4+), a highly soluble compound with a low
        water-to-air transfer coefficient. In other words, ammonium
        wants to stay in solution with the water. Gas stripping of
        ammonia is usually accomplished by adjusting the pH of the water
        to around 10.5. An example of this is given in Tchobanoglous, G.
        and E. D. Schroeder, Water Quality, 535 538 (Addison-Wesley,
        1987). </p>
      <p>Trickling filters are one of the oldest forms of wastewater
        treatment. Rocks, or other media designed to have a high surface
        area to volume ratio are stacked in a basin and wastewater is
        trickled over the media. Attached growth organisms metabolize
        the organic material out of the wastewater as it flows past the
        surface. The thickness of the film provides conditions suitable
        for aerobic bacteria at the free surface, and anaerobic bacteria
        near the media surface. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are
        considered facultative bacteria and thrive in the interface
        between the aerobic and anaerobic zones. Trickling filters are
        effective at removing ammonia from wastewater due to this
        extensive zone favorable to the growth of ammonia consuming
        organisms. Growth of these organisms is favored because the
        sunlight is blocked in the depths of the filter, the metabolism
        of the bio-film increases the temperature within the bio-film,
        the fixed media provides extremely long detention times for the
        bacteria (the film remains in place until it becomes so thick
        that it sluffs off), and the exact oxygen requirements for the
        nitrifying bacteria and the denitrifying bacteria will be met at
        some point across the thickness of the bio-film. </p>
      <p>Other designs that provide surface area for fixed film growth
        are Rotating Biological Contractors (RBCs), and various designs
        that place foam blocks and spacers or fibrous material down in
        the wastewater. </p>
      <p>The primary disadvantages of a trickling filter are the initial
        capital costs to build the filter, pumping costs to lift the
        wastewater plus recycle to the top of the filter, maintenance of
        the mechanical distribution system at the top of the filter, and
        ultimate disposal replacement of the media within the filter.
        (Plastic media within the filter has an estimated life of 10 to
        15 years, and must be disposed of as a hazardous waste when
        removed.) </p>
      <p>RBCs require mechanical rotation systems, and provide much less
        surface area than plastic media filters. Capital costs to reach
        the equivalent surface area of a trickling filter can be quite
        high, although the energy costs to rotate the devices are
        generally a fraction of the pumping costs for trickling filters.
      </p>
      <p>The metabolism of nitrifying bacteria is enhanced when the
        bacteria are immobilized on a fixed film surface, as opposed to
        free-floating bacterial colonies. Scandinavian researchers
        subjected the species Nitrobacter agilis to temperature
        variations from 30.degree. C. to 12.degree. C. Suspended growth
        bacteria experienced a 90% reduction in nitrification activity,
        whereas the fixed film bacteria only experienced a 20% reduction
        in nitrification activity. Other advantages of attached growth
        bacteria are enumerated in an article by Criddle et al. found in
        Bear, J. and M. Y. Corapcioglu, eds., Transport Processes in
        Porous Media, 641 691 (Kluwer Academic Pubs, 1991). </p>
      <p>Most lagoon systems are devoid of oxygenated surfaces that are
        blocked from the sunlight. The bottom of the lagoon does not
        provide surface area because it is unconsolidated media and is
        anoxic. As such, lagoon systems do not nitrify ammonia
        compounds. High ammonia levels are fairly typical in lagoon
        effluents. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop
        a simple and reliable system and method for removing ammonia
        from water, such as wastewater. </p>
      <p>The invention advantageously provides a system for reducing the
        content of ammonia in water. The system includes a surface,
        substantially submerged in the water, having a bio-film of
        nitrifying bacteria thereon. A bubble system is provided,
        configured to create air bubbles that travel along the submerged
        surface as they rise, so as to (i) create aerobic conditions at
        the bio-film and (ii) circulate the water along the surface. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a more detailed aspect thereof, the present
        invention provides a system for reducing the content of ammonia
        in wastewater. The system provides a surface that is
        substantially submerged in the wastewater, is aligned in a
        substantially non-vertical orientation, is substantially
        shielded from sunlight, and has a bio-film of nitrifying
        bacteria thereon. The system also includes an aeration system,
        configured to release air bubbles at a lower extremity of the
        submerged surface, such that the air bubbles travel along the
        submerged surface as they rise to create aerobic conditions at
        the bio-film, and such that the wastewater is circulated along
        the submerged surface. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the
        invention provides a method for reducing the content of ammonia
        in water, comprising the steps of providing a submerged surface
        having a bio-film of nitrifying bacteria thereon, creating air
        bubbles that travel along the surface as they rise to create
        aerobic conditions on the surface, and contacting the water
        along the surface to allow the nitrifying bacteria to remove
        ammonia from the water. </p>
      <p>Additional features and advantages of the invention will be
        apparent from the detailed description which follows, taken in
        conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which together
        illustrate, by way of example, features of the invention. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments
        illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used
        herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood
        that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby
        intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive
        features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the
        principles of the inventions as illustrated herein, which would
        occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession
        of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a simple and effective system
        and method for removing ammonia from water. The system can be
        used to enhance the performance of wastewater treatment lagoons,
        or other applications. The system operates through the addition
        of specially designed submerged structures that encourage the
        growth of a bio-film of certain types of nitrifying bacteria.
        The inventors have recognized that ammonia-consuming bacteria
        need four basic conditions to really flourish: a submerged
        surface to adhere to, an adequate supply of oxygen, protection
        from sunlight, and a supply of ammonia. The inventors have
        devised the present invention in order to provide these
        conditions in a simple system. </p>
      <p>The invention generally provides a system for the enhancement
        of the performance of certain types of ammonia-consuming
        bacteria when the bacteria are incorporated into a bio-film. Air
        is supplied directly to the submerged bio-film surfaces to
        enhance oxygen transfer to the bacteria in the bio-film. While
        the invention is depicted and described as used in wastewater
        treatment, it will be apparent that the invention can be used
        for the treatment of any water to remove ammonia therefrom,
        whether the water is considered wastewater or not. For example,
        other applications include agricultural irrigation return water,
        anaerobic digester supernatant, industrial process water, etc. </p>
      <p>The basic structure of the ammonia removal system is shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 2. The system basically comprises one or more panels
        10 that are submerged in water 12, such as wastewater. The
        panels can be made of a variety of materials, so long as they
        are durable in the water or wastewater environment. Structures
        that provide the surface area must be able to withstand
        corrosion while submerged in a wastewater stream for years. High
        surface area to volume ratio is desired, yet plugging of the
        media must be avoided. It is also desirable that the panels be
        of materials that are nontoxic. Suitable materials include
        concrete, plastics, metal, etc. It is even believed that garbage
        elements or recycled waste products can be fabricated into
        suitable panels for application in the present invention. In
        tests carried out by the inventors, panels of reinforced
        concrete were used. </p>
      <p>Growing on the side surfaces 14 of the panels 10 is a film 16
        of nitrifying bacteria. The conversion of ammonia to nitrite and
        then nitrate depends on a class of bacteria known collectively
        as nitrifiers. The metabolism of nitrifying bacteria is enhanced
        when the bacteria are immobilized on a fixed substrate, as
        opposed to being free-floating bacterial colonies. There are a
        variety of species of nitrifying bacteria that can be suitable
        for the present invention, such as Nitrobacter agilis. All
        species colonizing this bio-film are naturally-occurring
        bacteria in the environment. No special species are required for
        this invention to work. Instead, the invention is simply
        configured to enhance a naturally occurring process. Nitrifying
        and denitrifying bacteria are considered facultative bacteria,
        and thrive in the interface between the aerobic and anaerobic
        zones. In one test of the present invention, the submerged
        panels were first inoculated with buckets of trickling filter
        effluent water (known to be rich in nitrifying bacteria). After
        the bacteria had sufficient time to become established on the
        panels and it was confirmed that ammonia removal was occurring,
        it was observed that the bio-film took on a slightly
        reddish-brown hue. </p>
      <p>Disposed at the lower end of each panel 10 is a compressed air
        conduit 18 with openings 20 that are configured to release air
        bubbles 22. The compressed air conduit in the panel is connected
        to a series of other air conduits (24 in FIGS. 3, 4) that are
        eventually connected to a compressed air source 26, such as a
        compressor. Compressed air is released along the bottom edge of
        the panels, and, as the bubbles rise up, they contact the
        bio-film 16 along the side surfaces 14 of the panels. The
        bio-film is thus supplied with a continual stream of oxygenated
        air. For efficiency, it is desirable to provide just enough air
        for the oxygen demand of the nitrifying bio-chemical processes
        of the bacteria, without wasting energy by providing more air
        than is needed. Those skilled in the art will be able to
        determine suitable aeration levels for this purpose. </p>
      <p>While the panels 10 depicted in FIG. 1 (and the other figures
        herein) are shown with non-vertical surfaces, the bio-film
        panels of the present invention could be vertical or configured
        with vertical sides. However, panels with sloping or
        non-vertical surfaces are preferred, so as to continually force
        the air bubbles 22 against the surface of the bio-film 16 as
        they rise, rather than allowing the bubbles to be deflected
        outwardly away from those surfaces. A relatively small
        non-vertical angle is sufficient to provide this function. For
        example, the panels 10 shown in FIG. 1 have an angle of about
        3.degree. from the vertical. It is believed that even smaller
        angles could still provide the desired bubble contact time
        benefit. At the same time, greater angles (i.e. surfaces that
        are closer to horizontal) will tend to slow the rate of rising
        of the air bubbles, thus increasing contact time of the bubbles
        with the bio-film. This can be desirable for shallower
        wastewater lagoons, or for other reasons. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the rising bubbles 22 also create flow patterns
        in the water, represented by arrows 23, pulling the water up
        from the bottom along the bio-film surfaces 16, and thereby
        enhancing circulation to promote complete treatment of the
        water. Accordingly, the bio-film is thus supplied with a
        continual stream of nutrient rich water, in addition to the
        oxygenated air. </p>
      <p>It is also desirable to protect the bio-film 16 from sunlight.
        As noted above, nitrifying bacteria are inhibited by direct
        sunlight. Additionally, sunlight can also encourage the growth
        of algae on the bio-film surface. Accordingly, in the embodiment
        of FIG. 1, the assembly of submerged panels 10 is covered by a
        light barrier 28. The light barrier can be a roof, a cover (such
        as a cover that floats on the surface of the water), or any
        comparable structure which shields the submerged bio-film from
        sunlight (represented by arrows 30). The light-shielded
        environment encourages the growth of nitrifying bacteria. Other
        embodiments of the submerged panels also help shield the
        bio-film from sunlight, as discussed below. </p>
      <p>The size of the panels 10 can vary within a wide range. In an
        embodiment consistent with FIGS. 1 and 2, the inventors have
        constructed bio-film panels that were about 2 feet tall.
        However, the system of the present invention can be used in
        bodies of water of any depth, limited only by the survivability
        of the nitrifying bacteria. For example, it is believed that the
        system of the present invention can be adapted to treat salt
        water or sea water, with the appropriate bacteria. Accordingly,
        the panels can be made to whatever size needed to extend to the
        desired depth. </p>
      <p>As a practical matter, however, most wastewater treatment is
        carried out in relatively shallow lagoons or reservoirs, such as
        the lagoon 32 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. In such lagoons, the
        bottom surface 34 is generally covered by a layer 36 of
        sediments and solids that have settled out of the wastewater. It
        is generally desirable to dispose the bio-film panels above this
        sediment layer. The panels can extend above the top surface of
        the water, but do not need to do so. Indeed, in areas where ice
        covers lagoon systems in the winter, the structures must either
        be submerged below a level where the ice layer forms (which is
        preferable), or be heavy enough to remain in place when pushed
        by wind-driven ice. Also, a system must be provided to deliver
        oxygen to the submerged surface. Naturally, nitrifying bacteria
        that are suspended out of the water will be limited or stopped
        in their growth, and will have little or no effect in removing
        ammonia from the water. However, where the water level in the
        lagoon can fluctuate, the panels can be configured with a height
        corresponding at least to the maximum water level. </p>
      <p>In the lagoon system shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, a plurality of
        groups or modules 38 of submerged bio-film panels 10 are
        supported on individual frames or racks 40 which rest upon the
        bottom 34 of the lagoon 32. These groups of panels are all
        interconnected by compressed air conduits 24 that lead to the
        compressed air source 26. A power source, control devices,
        pressure regulators, and other components needed for operation
        of the aeration system are not shown, but their provision and
        specification would be a routine matter within the knowledge of
        one skilled in the art. It will also be apparent that the
        compressor or other compressed air source must be capable of
        providing air at a suitable pressure, depending on the depth of
        submersion of the compressed air conduit 18 at the lower end of
        each panel. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, an existing wastewater treatment lagoon can be
        easily retrofitted with the system of the present invention. A
        plurality of modules 38, each comprising one assembled rack 40
        of bio-film panels 10, can be placed into an existing lagoon at
        a desired spacing, then interconnected to the compressed air
        source 26 to begin operation. If needed, the lagoon can be
        charged with nitrifying bacteria, and after the bacteria has
        become established, ammonia in the wastewater flowing though the
        lagoon will be continuously removed. </p>
      <p>While the bio-film panels 10 shown in FIGS. 1 4 have a
        wedge-shaped configuration with planar sides, other
        configurations can also be used. The panels may be any suitable
        geometry, and are not limited to the examples illustrated, and
        include any geometry with curved or flat surfaces disposed
        vertically or non-vertically, with bubble systems to provide
        bubbles traveling along the surface. Preferably, the surface
        that supports the bio-film is neither horizontal nor vertical,
        so that rising bubbles travel along the surface. As one example,
        shown in FIG. 5, substantially planar bio-film panels 42 can be
        oriented at an angle and nested together in a group. Each panel
        includes an air conduit 44 at its lower extremity, allowing air
        bubbles 22 to be released to rise up the surfaces of the panels.
        These individual panels could be supported by a submersible
        frame similar to that shown and described with reference to FIG.
        3. </p>
      <p>The configuration shown in FIG. 5 can provide several
        advantages. First, the submerged panels 42 can be placed at a
        spacing D that is small enough to allow the upper portion of
        each panel to help block sunlight 30 from the surfaces of an
        adjacent panel. Such a configuration can reduce or eliminate the
        need for additional light shielding. Additionally, it is
        believed that sufficient reduction of the spacing D can allow
        the air bubbles 22 to oxygenate both the downward-facing surface
        46 of a panel, and at least partially oxygenate the opposing
        upward-facing surface 47 of the adjacent panel. This can allow
        both side surfaces of the planar panel to support a bio-film 16
        of nitrifying bacteria, thus possibly doubling the effectiveness
        of each panel. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, bio-film panels in accordance with the present
        invention can comprise other shapes, such as curved surfaces and
        shells that are configured for submersion in water. For example,
        in one embodiment shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the submerged
        bio-film shell comprises a hemisphere or dome 48, which has an
        opening 50 at its top to allow air bubbles 22 to escape. The
        hemisphere can be configured to rest upon a frame 52 on the
        bottom 34 of the wastewater lagoon, with a compressed air
        conduit 54 disposed around the bottom of the shell to provide
        the air bubbles. Placing the bottom of the hemisphere above the
        bottom of the lagoon is desirable to allow water to circulate,
        as shown by arrows 23, and enter the lower end of the
        hemisphere. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the hemisphere 48 naturally shields its inner
        surface 56 from sunlight 30, so that a bio-film 16 of nitrifying
        bacteria can grow thereon. The bubbles 22 released from the air
        conduit 54 travel up the inner surface, providing oxygen to the
        bacteria and helping to circulate the water, until reaching the
        top opening 50, where the bubbles naturally rise to the surface
        58 of the water. The use of a shell can be desirable for
        situations where it is impractical or undesirable to cover an
        entire lagoon to block sunlight. A plurality of shells can be
        placed into a lagoon, and by their own geometry provide the
        appropriate conditions for growth of the nitrifying bacteria. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the hemispherical shell configuration can
        comprise multiple nested hemispherical shells in a module 59, as
        shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. Like the outer shell 48, the inner
        shells 48a and 48b are each shielded from sunlight 30 by their
        own structure, and by the next outer shell. While only two inner
        shells are shown, it will be apparent that the number of nested
        shells is not restricted to this number. These nesting shells
        can be supported on the same frame 52, and all function in the
        same way as the outer shell to provide a surface for nitrifying
        bacteria and to provide oxygen to the bacteria. Additionally, as
        with the nesting panels 42 of FIG. 5, the nesting shells can be
        placed close enough together that nitrifying bacteria can
        flourish on the outer surfaces of the inner nested shells, and
        increase the performance of the system. </p>
      <p>In addition to curved shells, non-curved shells can also be
        used. Shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B is a pyramidal shell 60. Like the
        hemispherical shell 48, the pyramidal shell includes an opening
        62 at its top to allow bubbles to escape, and is supported on a
        frame 64 resting on the bottom 34 of the lagoon 32, with air
        conduits 66 disposed at the bottom of the shell. The outer
        surface 68 of the shell blocks sunlight 30, allowing a bio-film
        16 of nitrifying bacteria to grow on the inner surface 70. Air
        bubbles 22 released from the air conduit rise up the
        substantially planar inner surface, as indicated by arrows 23,
        providing oxygen to the bacteria and circulating the water. </p>
      <p>As with the hemispherical shell module 59, a pyramidal shell
        module 69 can comprise nesting shells, as shown in FIGS. 7A and
        7B. The inner pyramidal shells 60a and 60b are each shielded
        from sunlight 30 by their own structure, and by the next outer
        shell. While only two inner shells are shown, the number of
        nested shells is not restricted to this number. These nesting
        shells are supported on the frame 64, and function in the same
        way as the outer shell. As shown in FIG. 7B, the pyramidal
        shells that are illustrated have a substantially square plan
        shape, which can make them more space efficient than the
        hemispherical shells. This shape, comprising substantially flat
        panel components, may also be easier to fabricate and less
        expensive. </p>
      <p>While two shapes of shells and nesting shells are shown, it
        will be apparent that other shapes can also be used. For
        example, a conical shell or series of nesting conical shells can
        be used. It will also be apparent that non-hemispherical curved
        shells can be used, and these can be selected for their effect
        on the rate at which the bubbles 22 rise. Because the
        hemispherical shell 48 provides a curved inner surface 56, the
        rate of rising of the bubbles 22 will vary with height. This can
        provide different contact time of the bubbles with different
        regions of the bio-film. The inventors are investigating the
        effects of this phenomenon. Nevertheless, the shape of the shell
        can be selected to provide different effects on the rate of
        rising of the bubbles. For example, rather than a hemispherical
        shell, an elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolically curved shell
        could be used. Other curved and non-curved shapes can also be
        used. </p>
      <p>A system incorporating submerged aerated bio-film modules
        according to this invention can be used in a variety of
        situations to remove ammonia from water. As described in more
        detail below, the present invention can be adapted to batch
        treatment applications, wherein a fixed volume of water is
        contained and treated for a period of time sufficient to remove
        ammonia. However, it is believed that perhaps the most common
        application will be in continuous-flow wastewater treatment
        lagoons, particularly lagoons originally designed as non-aerated
        lagoons. Such lagoons can be configured like the earthen lagoon
        32 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Alternatively, concrete-lined lagoons
        with vertical side walls, and even above-ground reservoirs,
        tanks, or basins can be adapted for treatment of water according
        to the present invention. Indeed, the present invention merely
        requires a body of water, which can be a static body (e.g. a
        batch) or a flowing body (e.g. a continuous flow lagoon or the
        like). </p>
      <p>The lagoon of FIGS. 3 and 4 is part of a flow-through or
        constant flow system, wherein influent enters the lagoon through
        an inlet 72, and effluent continuously flows out through an
        outlet 74. Such lagoons are generally sized to allow sufficient
        residence time of the water in the lagoon for the desired
        treatment. Those of skill in the art will be able to calculate
        the quantity of submerged aerated bio-film modules required for
        a lagoon having a given flow rate. </p>
      <p>Alternative continuous-flow treatment configurations are shown
        in FIGS. 8 and 9. Shown in FIG. 8 is a submerged aerated
        bio-film treatment system comprising a plurality of submerged
        hemispherical modules 59 disposed in an open-flow lagoon or
        reservoir 80. Water enters the lagoon through the inlet 82, and
        gradually flows toward and past the submerged biofilm modules as
        it works its way toward the outlet 84. The submerged modules are
        grouped toward the outlet in order to provide a settling area 86
        toward the inlet. This settling area provides a region in which
        suspended solids and organic material can settle out of the
        water before encountering the submerged bio-film modules. This
        helps to reduce the level of organic material in the water by
        the time the water reaches the submerged modules, and thus helps
        reduce the level of heterotrophic bacteria that may grow on the
        submerged panels. Nitrifying bacteria are autotrophs. These
        naturally compete with heterotrophic bacteria, which consume
        organic material. The inventors have found that in a
        continuous-flow ammonia treatment system, the heterotrophic
        bacteria tend to dominate until the COD level (caused by the
        presence of organic material) drops below a certain level, after
        which the autotrophs begin to dominate. Consequently, submerged
        aerated bio-film modules located closest to the inlet in a
        continuous flow system appear to support a higher proportion of
        non-nitrifying (heterotrophic) bacteria, and thus provide lower
        levels of ammonia removal, while those nearer the outlet tend to
        include solely nitrifying bacteria. Thus, allowing a substantial
        quantity of organic material to settle out of the water will
        contribute to the desired operation of the submerged modules. </p>
      <p>Shown in FIG. 9 is an alternative continuous-flow treatment
        system comprising a channeled lagoon 90 having a series of
        baffles 92 that force the water to flow along a serpentine path
        from the inlet 94 to the outlet 96. The submerged hemispherical
        modules 59 are arranged in series through the channeled lagoon,
        thus causing the water to traverse each module as it passes
        through the lagoon. Like the open-flow lagoon 80 of FIG. 8, the
        channeled lagoon 90 includes a settling area 98 near its inlet
        to provide a region in which suspended solids and organic
        material can settle out of the water before encountering the
        first submerged bio-film modules. </p>
      <p>As noted above, the aeration system of the submerged modules
        causes water surrounding the modules to circulate gently. This
        feature advantageously helps to promote complete treatment of
        the water, rather than allowing some portions of water to
        short-circuit to the outlet without complete treatment. That is,
        as a given volume of water passes a submerged module, the
        currents created by the motion of air bubbles associated with
        that module will tend to mix and circulate the volume of water
        so that a substantial portion of that water is drawn into the
        module and brought into contact with the nitrifying bacteria.
        Those portions of the volume that are not actually treated by a
        given module will be mixed and dispersed so that treatment by a
        subsequent module is likely. Thus, as the water works its way
        toward the outlet, the chances are very high that the entire
        volume will be treated along the way. The channeled lagoon
        configuration in particular is designed to increase the
        likelihood that the water will be fully treated. </p>
      <p><b>Batch Operation</b> </p>
      <p>The inventors first tested the system of the present invention
        in a batch treatment configuration, wherein a given volume of
        ammonia-containing wastewater was contained, treated, and then
        released. A pilot scale system was built using an 8'.times.24'
        commercial dumpster 3' deep with 24 submerged bio-film panel
        modules installed. Each module consisted of 12 individual
        panels, configured as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The panels were 28
        inches wide by 24 inches tall, with a fine bubble distribution
        tube along the bottom. Total surface area for bio-film
        colonization was 2794 square feet. The wastewater volume was
        1600 gallons when the dumpster was filled to a depth of 2 feet.
        Total air supply to the modules was 7.5 to 8 cubic feet per
        minute at a pressure of about 3 psi. The top of the pilot plant
        was covered with wooden panels to block sunlight. The dumpster
        was set up beside an effluent ditch leading from primary
        clarifiers to trickling filters at a major municipal wastewater
        treatment facility. Wastewater in the effluent ditch had a
        typical ammonia concentration of between 25 and 30 mg/L at the
        start of each week. </p>
      <p>In a batch mode, the submerged panels were first inoculated
        with buckets of trickling filter effluent water. Several times
        during the first week, buckets of water from the treatment plant
        trickling filter effluent were poured over the modules in an
        effort to seed the bio-film panels with nitrifying bacteria.
        Ammonia removal during this initial phase (Run #1) is shown in
        graphical form in FIG. 10. At first, ammonia concentrations
        increased slightly, apparently due to the absence of nitrifying
        bacteria. After this initial lag phase of about eight days,
        however, the effects of a healthy nitrifying bio-film began to
        be manifest. The bio-film began to remove the ammonia from the
        wastewater, and during the following 6 days, essentially all of
        the ammonia was consumed. The treated water from the dumpster
        was released, and the dumpster was then refilled with a fresh
        batch of wastewater for Run #2. Ammonia removal over time for
        Run #2 is shown in graphical form in FIG. 11. In this run the
        bio-film immediately began consuming the ammonia, and after 4
        days the ammonia was gone. </p>
      <p>Over a period of three and one half months, this process was
        repeated for a total of 11 batch runs using wastewater with
        slightly varying characteristics, and in varying weather and
        temperature conditions. The time required to consume the ammonia
        decreased with each of the first few runs until it appeared to
        settle in at around 40 hours. This shortening of reaction time
        is thought to be a result of the maturing of the nitrifying
        bio-film. It was also observed after about the third run that
        the bio-film on the surfaces of the panels was thinner, and had
        taken on a reddish hue. This color is consistent with the
        literature on nitrifying bacteria. </p>
      <p>Ammonia concentration over time for Run #7 is shown in FIG. 12.
        This run is fairly typical of the results of the runs after the
        nitrifying bio-film became established. In addition to ammonia
        concentration over time, a variety of other parameters were also
        measured during each run to provide a clear indication of what
        was taking place. Graphs of these measurements for Run #7 are
        shown in FIGS. 12 15. Proof of biological nitrification was
        established by measuring nitrite and nitrate levels along with
        ammonia levels. A simplified model of the nitrogen pathway for
        biological nitrification is as follows:
        NH.sub.4.sup.+.fwdarw.NO.sub.2.sup.-.fwdarw.NO.sub.3.sup.-
        Accordingly, the removal of ammonia should result in a
        measurable increase in the intermediate compound nitrite and a
        significant increase in the end product of nitrate. </p>
      <p>The results of these measurements for Run #7 are shown in FIG.
        13, and are consistent with these expectations, showing a very
        clear picture of biological nitrification. As can be seen from
        this graph, as the ammonia level dropped, nitrite levels rose
        moderately (an intermediate), and nitrate levels rose
        significantly to around 6 mg/L. In some earlier runs, possibly
        because the water temperature was warmer, the nitrate levels
        dropped off after the ammonia was expended, indicating possibly
        the presence of denitrifying anaerobic bacteria, which consume
        nitrate and convert it into nitrogen gas. </p>
      <p>Oxygen demand of the wastewater was also monitored for each
        test run, and dropped significantly during each of the batch
        runs, as expected. The wastewater treatment plant at which this
        pilot plant was run monitors both chemical oxidation demand
        (COD) and biological oxidation demand (BOD). The COD/BOD ratio
        for the source water at this plant is typically 0.48.
        Measurement of the COD level in Run #7 is shown in FIG. 14. In
        this run, the COD levels dropped from 187 mg/L to around 24
        mg/L. These results are fairly typical of all of the batch runs,
        except Run #9, as will be discussed below. </p>
      <p>Alkalinity levels were also monitored. Nitrifying bacteria
        utilize the energy stored in ammonia for their own metabolism,
        as well as utilizing some of the nitrogen atoms to build cell
        material. An example is typified in this reaction:
        NH.sub.4.sup.++1.83O.sub.2+1.98HCO.sub.3.sup.-.fwdarw.0.021C.sub.5H.sub.7-
NO.sub.2+1.041H.sub.2O+0.98NO.sub.3.sup.-+1.88H.sub.2CO.sub.3
Biological
nitrification




        consumes NH.sub.4.sup.+, O.sub.2, and HCO.sub.3.sup.-. At the pH
        of this system (around 8), HCO.sub.3.sup.- is one of the major
        components of alkalinity. Therefore, biological nitrification
        should result in a decrease in alkalinity. </p>
      <p>For batch Run #7, alkalinity was monitored and the results are
        shown in FIG. 15. As the graph shows, the alkalinity level
        dropped from around 300 mg/L to around 150 mg/L, providing
        additional evidence of the mechanism of biological
        nitrification. The reduction in alkalinity shown by these
        measurements is consistent with nitrification, and provides
        additional evidence that the intended processes were taking
        place. </p>
      <p>On Run #9, the aeration system was left off as a control run,
        and the results of some measurements from this run are shown in
        FIGS. 16 17. As shown in FIG. 16, ammonia was barely consumed
        during Run #9, with the level dropping from 24 mg/L to about 18
        mg/L in 40 hours. In Batch Run #9, there was also virtually no
        reduction in oxygen demand, as shown in FIG. 17. The next week,
        however, run #10 was started with aeration, and the results
        substantially returned to previous levels. Within 40 hours,
        essentially all the ammonia was gone from the water, and other
        parameters were consistent with previous results. </p>
      <p>By the end of the batch run operation test, the average water
        temperature during the runs had dropped to around 6.degree. C.
        and at one point was as low as 3.3.degree. C. Advantageously,
        the bio-film continued to perform even at these low
        temperatures, reducing ammonia levels from around 25 mg/L to
        basically zero within 40 to 48 hours. This is significant. The
        inventor's results confirm that, unlike suspended growth
        nitrifying bacteria, which are inhibited at temperatures below
        10.degree. C., the fixed-film nitrifying bacteria remain active
        and effective at temperatures approaching 0.degree. C. </p>
      <p><b>Plug-Flow Operation</b> </p>
      <p>The inventors also tested the present invention in a continuous
        plug-flow system to demonstrate the applicability of the
        invention to continuous-flow lagoon treatment systems. Some
        results of this test are shown in FIGS. 18 19. The plug-flow
        test used the same apparatus as the batch treatment test
        described above, except that a submersible pump was installed to
        pump water from the aeration ditch at the wastewater treatment
        plant at a controlled rate, and water was allowed to flow out of
        the test apparatus at the same rate. Flow rate was measured in
        an influent tank with a 500 ml glass beaker and a timer.
        Performance of the system was tested in three phases, referred
        to as Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III. </p>
      <p>A series of batch runs were performed prior to starting the
        continuous plug flow reactor (PFR) configuration to facilitate
        seeding the panels with nitrifying bacteria, and allowing the
        bacteria to mature. This was done to allow easier handling to
        measure and monitor initial and final concentrations of
        interesting substances than the PFR system. The results of the
        initial batch runs were consistent with those reported above,
        including some start-up lag time when the nitrifying bacteria
        was not mature. </p>
      <p>There were 22 measurements taken over 18 days for Phase I. In
        Phase I, initial flow rates were set at 0.61 gal/min. In these
        runs, pH increased during nitrification, conductivity dropped
        slightly, turbidity dropped dramatically, and dissolved oxygen
        levels increased moderately. Most importantly, concentrations of
        ammonia nitrogen and COD dropped significantly through the pilot
        plant during the first series of measurements. </p>
      <p>Flow rate was then increased to above 1.0 gal/min, and the
        removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and COD were still
        substantial. Because of some pump problems, flow rate was
        decreased back to various levels between 0.61 and 1.0 gal/min
        for the remainder of Phase I. With these flow rates, the plug
        flow pilot plant was able to remove ammonia nitrogen and COD
        very well. </p>
      <p>Following this success in removal of ammonia nitrogen and COD
        with flow rates below 1 gal/min., a higher capacity submersible
        pump was installed at the pilot plant for Phase II, and five
        runs were undertaken. Flow rate was initially set at 2.1
        gal/min. Among other things, the rate of removal of ammonia
        nitrogen was worse than in Phase I, but the rate of removal of
        COD was similar to Phase I. Flow rate was then adjusted to 1.31
        gal/min for the remainder of Phase II because excessive flow
        rates around 2.0 gal/min for several days had caused the
        nitrifying bacteria to become lethargic. This was believed to be
        due to excessive nutrients and a lack of dissolved oxygen. Even
        when the flow rate was thus decreased, the rate of removal of
        ammonia nitrogen was not as good as in Phase I. </p>
      <p>In Phase III, the flow rate was initially set at 1.36 gal/min,
        and adjusted as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19. Throughout Phase III
        influent grab samples were paired with effluent grab samples
        taken at a point at the end of the calculated retention time in
        order to obtain the removal efficiency values shown in the
        figures. The initial flow rate of 1.36 gal/min gave a calculated
        retention time of 1,179 minutes or 19.7 hours. As shown in FIGS.
        18 and 19, the removal percentages of ammonia nitrogen and COD
        through the system at this flow rate were 41% and 77%
        respectively. At the next flow rate, 1.17 gal/min, the
        calculated retention time was 22.8 hours. The removal percents
        of ammonia nitrogen and COD were 36% and 85% respectively. The
        removal percent of ammonia nitrogen was lower whereas the
        removal percent of COD was higher compared to measurement A. </p>
      <p>Similarly, for subsequent measurements in Phase III, the flow
        rate was varied from a maximum of 1.27 gal/min to a minimum of
        0.56 gal/min. As is apparent from FIG. 18, and as would be
        expected, the nitrification activity was highest with lower flow
        rates, and declined at the higher flow rates. Specifically,
        ammonia removal efficiency was around 90% when flow rates were
        around 0.5 gal/min. This result makes sense because lower flow
        rates correspond to longer residence time or retention time of
        the wastewater in the treatment reactor, allowing the nitrifying
        bacteria to remove greater amounts of ammonia. As shown in FIG.
        19, COD efficiency was around 90% at the lower flow rates, but
        was generally above 80% for all flow rates. The performance of
        the plug flow system fluctuated at times during Phase III
        because of the introduction of some shock loads, temporary power
        failures, etc. during the PFR test. Measurements following these
        irregular conditions were removed from the graphs shown in FIGS.
        18 and 19 because those results are considered unreliable and
        not representative of the actual operation of the system. </p>
      <p>The main results of the plug flow system test for treatment of
        the aeration ditch water by the submerged bio-film system can be
        summarized as follows. Throughout operation, pH increased during
        nitrification in the reactor. The higher the water temperature,
        the better nitrification occurred. Conductivity, turbidity, and
        salinity dropped. Dissolved oxygen levels dropped very rapidly
        in the region of the reactor just following the inlet, but then
        began to increase from the region of the #8 module toward the
        outlet of the reactor. Ammonia nitrogen removal rates were more
        sensitive than COD removal rates when flow rates were over 1
        gal/min. Maximum flow rate for effective operation of this
        reactor appeared to be about 1 gal/min. </p>
      <p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>
      <p>From the results of the pilot tests, it is apparent that this
        invention provides a robust solution to the problem of ammonia
        removal. The aerated submerged surfaces will grow nitrifying
        bio-film that consume ammonia compounds from wastewater. It is
        believed that those skilled in the art will be able to determine
        appropriate ways to provide this aerated bio-film in a
        full-scale lagoon system. </p>
      <p>The primary advantage of a lagoon system is low maintenance and
        operational costs. The submerged bio-film modules fit well into
        this operational scenario. They are essentially passive devices
        that, once in place, will require little ongoing maintenance.
        Because they are modular, the devices could be added to a lagoon
        a few at a time until the desired level of treatment is
        attained. The aerated submerged bio-film modules tested in this
        pilot plant are a good start to meeting these requirements. </p>
      <p>This submerged bio-film process could be beneficial to animal
        operations with wastewater lagoon systems. As an example, the
        inventors have considered the needs for an open flow lagoon
        system (similar to that shown in FIG. 8) at a dairy farm
        supporting a herd of 500 dairy cows. At such an installation,
        approximately 55 nested hemispherical modules (configured as
        shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B) with an outside diameter of 6 ft.
        would be needed to adequately remove ammonia from the
        wastewater. Such a dairy farm could be expected to have a
        wastewater lagoon occupying about 1 acre (or more), and the
        submerged hemispherical modules would take up about 2000 square
        feet of the lagoon space, or about 4.5% of a 1 acre lagoon. </p>
      <p>This sort of system is beneficial in several ways. First,
        odorous ammonia concentrations are reduced and replaced with the
        more benign nitrate. Oxygen demand of the wastewater is greatly
        reduced. Mixing would occur in the lagoon, which would reduce
        stratification and allow for more consistent pollutant removal.
        Short-circuiting of wastewater from the inlet to the outlet
        could also be reduced simply by the presence of physical
        barriers (the submerged modules) that naturally create water
        circulation by virtue of their aeration system. For animal
        operations, where the treated lagoon water is returned for barn
        flushing, the cleaner lagoon effluent would improve the air
        quality and reduce the demand for fresh makeup water. </p>
      <p>If lagoon effluent is used for irrigation, the nitrate
        concentrations could be beneficial to crops. In applications
        where the lagoon effluent is to be discharged to surface waters,
        longer detention times with the aerated submerged bio-film
        modules would most likely lead to the removal of the nitrate
        through the biological process of denitrification. In summary,
        the aerated submerged bio-film modules offer the potential for a
        low-cost upgrade to lagoon systems, leading to better odor and
        pollution control. </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the above-referenced arrangements
        are illustrative of the application for the principles of the
        present invention. It will be apparent to those of ordinary
        skill in the art that numerous modifications can be made without
        departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as
        set forth in the claims. </p>
