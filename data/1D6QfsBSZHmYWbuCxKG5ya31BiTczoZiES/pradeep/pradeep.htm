      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      SOMETIMES the solution to an enormous problem is tiny. Silver
      nanoparticles may be the key to supplying clean, affordable
      drinking water worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      Thalappil Pradeep at the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai
      and colleagues have developed a filter based on an aluminium
      composite, embedded with silver nanoparticles. As water flows
      through the filter, the nanoparticles are oxidised and release
      ions, which kill viruses and bacteria, and neutralise toxic
      chemicals such as lead and arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      Some nanoparticles leach into the water but at concentrations that
      pose no threat to health. Pradeep describes the process of making
      the filter as "water positive": 1 litre of water spent on making
      nanoparticles gives 500 litres of clean water.<br>
      <br>
      In tests, a 50-gram composite filtered 1500 litres of water
      without needing reactivation, so they estimate that a 120g-filter
      that costs just $2 would provide safe drinking water for a family
      of five for one year (PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1220222110).<br>
      <br>
      The filters are undergoing field trials in India with the aim of
      preventing waterborne diseases.<br>

      The purifier will be able to provide arsenic-free water at about
      five paise per litre<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M)
      are gearing up for the commercial release of an affordable nano
      technology-based water purifier.<br>
      <br>
      The purifier has been developed to address the problem of arsenic
      contamination, a threat to drinking water sources and an emerging
      health hazard in several parts of the country.<br>
      <br>
      The Arsenic Task Force of the government of West Bengal has
      certified and approved the purifier developed by IIT-M. “The pilot
      phase is over and we are now preparing to take it to the market,”
      said T. Pradeep, professor, department of chemistry, who heads the
      research group working on water purifiers.<br>
      <br>
      The team has incubated a company at IIT-M to commercialise the
      technology, Dr. Pradeep told The Hindu on the sidelines of the
      Nano India conference organised by the department of science and
      technology and the National Institute for Interdisciplinary
      Science and Technology (NIIST) in Thiruvananthapuram.<br>
      <br>
      The purifier developed by IIT-M uses iron oxyhydroxide, a
      nanostructured material, to remove arsenic from drinking water. It
      functions without electricity or piped water supply.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pradeep said it could provide arsenic-free water at an
      approximate cost of five paise per litre. “Over the next few
      years, we hope it will benefit at least 10 per cent of people
      living in arsenic-contaminated areas.”<br>
      <br>
      The IIT-M-incubated company will commercialise the technology with
      partners who can take up distribution.<br>
      <br>
      The research group has also come up with a nano material-based
      fluoride water purifier. “It will take some more work for field
      implementation of this purifier. We expect the technology to be
      ready in six months.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Praveer Asthana, director of the nano mission under the Union
      department of science and technology said the water purifiers
      developed by IIT-M highlighted the relevance of
      industry-institution projects in the nano technology sector to
      deliver affordable, efficient solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pradeep said nano materials could play a key role in low-cost
      solutions to remove water contaminants. “They interact with the
      contaminant to remove it within a very small contact time. It is
      also possible to tune the chemistry of any of these materials so
      they can attack a wide spectrum of contaminants.”<br>
      <br>
      IIT-M has already developed and commercialised a nano silver-based
      water purifier that breaks down pesticide residue.<br>
      <br>
      The research team is working on an all-inclusive water purifier to
      address a wide spectrum of contaminants like pesticides, mercury,
      cadmium, lead, fluoride and arsenic. The group is collaborating
      with scientists working on other methods of water purification
      like reverse osmosis, membranes and solar and thermal
      technologies.<br>

            Drinking Water Affordably</b></big><br>
        <br>

      <br>
      Each year, around 3.6 million people die because of issues related
      to contaminated water, poor hygiene, and unsanitary conditions. If
      those households most at risk could gain access to safe drinking
      water, more than 2 million lives could be saved. Now, one research
      team has proposed a cheap, safe means of achieving this with an
      all-inclusive drinking water purifier assembled from several
      nanocomposites. <br>
      <br>
      “We wanted to show that it is possible to deliver affordable clean
      water that had all of the contaminants removed,” says Thalappil
      Pradeep, a materials scientist at the Indian Institute of
      Technology Madras, and senior author of a paper published in the
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences describing the new
      filter. “I’ve been on this dream for quite some time, it’s a very
      big thing for me.” <br>
      <br>
      Pradeep and his students and colleagues began work on this project
      several years ago. Contaminated water may contain bacteria,
      viruses, protozoa, heavy metals, pesticides, or other potential
      toxins. They knew that silver ions, released from the metal in
      nanoparticle form, worked as a disinfectant for a number of
      bacteria and viruses found in contaminated water, while other
      inorganic toxins, such as lead, iron, and arsenic, can be
      scavenged from contaminated water with materials containing
      different chemical properties, particular to each of those
      elements. Iron oxyhydroxide nanopaprticles scavenge arsenic, for
      example, while manganese oxide adsorbs lead. “For a diverse array
      of contaminants, you can use a variety of nanostructured materials
      to finally get water that is purified,” Pradeep says. <br>
      <br>
      But contaminants found in the water tend to anchor to nanosilver
      surfaces, blocking the release of silver ions from them. To
      overcome this problem, the researchers created a unique family of
      nanocrystalline metal oxyhydroxide-chitosan granular composite
      materials. This material, which forms a cage-like matrix, strongly
      bonds to embedded nanoparticles. The nanoparticles remain isolated
      inside the matrix, which only allows ions to escape at a
      controlled rate. Those ions then kill microbes found in the water,
      without releasing nanoparticles. <br>
      <br>
      The materials can all be prepared at room temperature in water,
      and they gradually settle to form a sand-like material. No
      electricity is required and all of the elements needed to build
      the filters are widely available and affordable. For each liter of
      water needed to make the composite, 500 liters of clean water can
      be produced. None of the composite materials themselves are toxic.
      When the material eventually stops releasing silver ions, hot
      water can get rid of the thin layer of scalants to regain activity
      in the composite. The purifiers would cost small families about
      US$2.50 per year. <br>
      <br>
      Pradeep hopes to produce the filters in the remote villages where
      they are most needed. About 2,000 small community-scale units are
      being installed in west Bengal, an area plagued by arsenic
      contamination in its water. Pradeep thinks the filters could be
      deployed to more than 2 million people over the next two years or
      so, though other organizations will have to take responsibility
      for organizing those efforts. The same technology could eventually
      be used in other developing nations as well so long as tests were
      carried out to customize the filters to each particular country’s
      conditions. If all goes well, the new composites could even
      provide a potential solution for achieving the United Nations
      millennium development goal of doubling the number of people with
      sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. <br>
      <br>
      “People talk about nanotechnology from the context of advanced
      computing and high density data storage,” Pradeep says. “Those are
      important, but at the same time frugal science is also important,
      and can make a larger impact in the short term.”&nbsp; <br>

      </b><b> Description -- </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] Metal quantum clusters (MQCs) have fascinating
      size-dependent properties including discrete electronic energy
      levels and 'molecule-like' optical transitions in their absorption
      and emission spectra. As such, MQCs can be used for single
      molecule optics, nanophotonics, bioscience, catalysis, and other
      similar applications. The practical use of MQCs in such
      applications will require the large-scale synthesis of
      monodisperse MQCs.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Conventional methods for the synthesis of MQCs are based on
      solution- phase routes. Typically, MQCs of various sizes are made
      together in a synthetic procedure. In order to get monodispersed
      MQCs with well-defined molecular formulae, size-separation using
      elaborate chromatographic techniques is required.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0003] This disclosure is not limited to the particular systems,
      devices and methods described, as these may vary. The terminology
      used in the description is for the purpose of describing the
      particular versions or embodiments only, and is not intended to
      limit the scope.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Methods of growing metal quantum clusters within a porous
      gel matrix are described herein. These methods allow for the
      large-scale synthesis of monodispersed metal quantum clusters
      using a single-step approach, which may improve the availability
      and utility of metal quantum clusters. By growing metal quantum
      clusters within a porous gel matrix, monodisperse uniform
      nanoparticles may be produced more easily and/or in better yields
      than in free-solution approaches. It is believed that the growth
      of the metal quantum clusters is encouraged within but limited by
      the size of the pores of the gel matrix. Because individual
      cluster growth is determined by pore size a monodisperse and
      uniform population is readily made.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In an embodiment, a method of synthesizing metal quantum
      clusters includes growing the metal quantum clusters in a porous
      gel matrix. This embodiment includes formation of a porous gel
      matrix that encapsulates a metal quantum cluster precursor
      compound and the introduction of a reducing agent to form the
      metal quantum clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In an embodiment, a method of synthesizing metal quantum
      clusters includes forming a porous gel matrix from the mixture
      comprising a metal-containing compound, a capping agent, and a
      gel-forming solution and adding a reducing agent to form the metal
      quantum clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In an embodiment, a kit for synthesizing metal quantum
      clusters includes a metal-containing compound, a capping agent, a
      gel-forming solution, a reducing agent, and instructions for use.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In an embodiment, a gel matrix includes a porous gel
      encapsulating a metal quantum cluster precursor compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In an embodiment, a gel matrix includes a porous gel
      encapsulating metal quantum clusters of the formula
      Agi8(glutathione)25.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] Figure 1 is a flowchart that illustrates an exemplary
      method for synthesizing metal quantum clusters, in accordance with
      an embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] Methods of growing metal quantum clusters within a porous
      gel matrix are described herein. These methods allow for the
      large-scale synthesis of monodispersed metal quantum clusters
      using a single-step approach, which may improve the availability
      and utility of metal quantum clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In an embodiment, metal quantum clusters are grown within a
      porous gel matrix. Despite variations in nomenclature concerning
      small-sized particles based on size regimes, properties, and
      makeup, the term metal quantum clusters is not intended to be
      limiting, but instead refer to particular products of the general
      methods described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] . The average diameter of metal quantum clusters may be
      less than about 5 [mu][pi][iota], or about 100 nm to about 0.5
      ran, or about 10 ran to about 1 nm. Specific examples of average
      diameters include about 5 [mu][pi][iota], about 400 nm, about 300
      nm, about 200 nm, about 100 nm, about 50 nm, about 40 nm, about 30
      nm, about 20 nm, about 10 nm, about 1 nm, about 0.5 nm, and ranges
      between any two of these values. The standard deviation of the
      diameter of the metal quantum clusters may be less than or equal
      to about 15% of the average diameter, less than or equal to about
      10% of the average diameter, less than or equal to about 5% of the
      average diameter, or the metal quantum clusters may be
      monodisperse.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Materials for making metal quantum clusters are well-known
      to a person having ordinary skill in the art, and the examples
      described herein are not intended to be limiting. The metal
      quantum clusters may comprise Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sn, Ti, Ag, Au, Cd,
      Se, Si, Pt, S, Ni or combinations thereof. For example, the metal
      quantum clusters may be of the formula Ag25(glutathione)i8.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Figure 1 is a flow diagram describing a method for
      synthesizing metal quantum clusters within a porous gel matrix
      according to an embodiment. As shown in Figure 1, a metal
      containing compound and a capping agent may be combined 105 to
      form a metal quantum cluster precursor compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The metal-containing compound used to make the metal
      quantum clusters may be a metal thioate, an organometallic
      compound, a metal oxide, an inorganic salt, a coordination
      compound, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the
      metal-containing compound used to make the metal quantum clusters
      may contain Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sn, Ti, Ag, Au, Cd, Se, Si, Pt, S, Ni
      or a combination thereof. For example, the metal-containing
      compound used to make the metal quantum clusters may be AgN03.
      [0017] The surface of the metal quantum clusters may comprise at
      least one layer of capping agents. The capping agent may be used
      to control the growth, improve the solubility, provide chemical
      functionality, or otherwise alter the properties the metal quantum
      clusters. Materials used as capping agents are well-known to a
      person having ordinary skill in the art, and the examples
      described herein are not intended to be limiting. Despite
      variations in nomenclature regarding surface-functionalization of
      metals based on chemical makeup and properties, the term capping
      agent is not intended to be limiting, but instead refers to
      particular products of the general methods described herein. The
      capping agent can comprise an aromatic group, a conjugated pi
      system, a pi bond, a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom, a sulphur
      atom, a phosphorus atom, an aromatic thiol or an aliphatic thiol.
      In an embodiment, the capping agent may be an organosulfur
      compound. For example, the capping agent may be a thiol. As a
      specific example, the capping agent may be glutathione thiolate.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The metal quantum cluster precursor compound is the
      starting material used in the formation of the metal quantum
      clusters. The metal quantum cluster precursor compound may be a
      metal-containing compound, or the metal quantum cluster precursor
      compound may be formed by mixing a metal-containing compound with
      a capping agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The metal quantum cluster precursor compound may optionally
      be sonicated 110. Aggregates may sometimes be present in the metal
      quantum cluster precursor compound. Any unwanted aggregates may be
      dispersed by sonicating 110 the metal quantum cluster precursor
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A mixture may be formed 115 by combining a gel-forming
      solution, a polymerization agent, and a metal quantum cluster
      precursor compound. The gel-forming solution is a liquid
      comprising the materials used to form a porous gel matrix. In an
      embodiment, the gel-forming solution may be a polymer or a
      polymerizable material. For example, the polymerizable material
      may be acrylamide, bisacrylamide, piperazine di-acrylamide,
      diallyltartardiamide, dihydroxyethylene-bis-acrylamide,
      bis-acrylylcystamine or mixtures thereof. Typical mixtures of the
      polymerizable material may comprise acrylamide and at least one
      cross-linker selected from bisacrylamide, piperazine
      di-acrylamide, diallyltartardiamide,
      dihydroxyethylene-bis-acrylamide, and bis-acrylylcystamine. In
      some examples, the polymerizable material may be a mixture of
      acrylamide and the cross-linker bisacrylamide.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] A gel-forming solution may use a change in temperature,
      additional reagents, or both a change in temperature and
      additional reagents to form a porous gel matrix. The additional
      reagents may be polymerization agents such as catalysts and
      polymerization initiators and combinations thereof. For example,
      polymerization agents may be [Nu],[Nu],[Nu]',[Nu]'-
      tetramethyl-ethane-l,2-diamine (TMED), ammonium persulfate,
      riboflavin-5'-phosphate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The mixture of the gel-forming solution, a polymerization
      agent, and a metal quantum cluster precursor compound may
      polymerize and allow formation 120 of the porous gel matrix
      encapsulating the metal quantum cluster precursor compound. In an
      embodiment, porous gel matrix matrices are composed of molecular
      cages which may be used to control mass transfer of reagents and
      nucleate the preferred metal quantum clusters. Metal quantum
      clusters grown using this method, may be at least partially
      encapsulated by the porous gel matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The materials and methods for making porous gel matrix
      matrices are well- known to a person having ordinary skill in the
      art, and the examples described herein are not intended to be
      limiting. The porous gel matrix may comprise a sol-gel or a
      polymer. In an embodiment, the porous gel matrix may comprise
      agarose or cross-linked polyacrylamide. For example, the porous
      gel matrix may comprise a polyacrylamide cross-linked with
      bisacrylamide, agarose gel, cellulose gel, or a starch gel. [0024]
      Methods that vary the pore size of the porous gel matrix may alter
      the diameter of the metal quantum clusters grown within the porous
      gel matrix. In some embodiments, increasing the cross-linker
      concentration in the gel-forming solution may induce a systematic
      increase in the pore size of the porous gel matrix and may
      facilitate the growth of larger metal quantum clusters within the
      matrix. The following table is exemplary only, it is not meant to
      limit the invention in any way.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Using the methods described herein, a porous gel matrix
      made using a gel- forming solution can be made to have desired
      pore sizes, resulting in a desired quantum cluster of a desired
      size, wherein the resultant quantum clusters are substantially all
      the desired quantum cluster and substantially free of polydisperse
      plasmonic nanoparticles. Preferably the content of the desired
      metal quantum clusters is greater than about 80%, greater than
      about 90%, greater than about 95%, greater than about 91%, greater
      than about 99%, greater than about 99.5%, or greater than about
      99.9% of all the metal quantum clusters formed. For example, a
      porous gel matrix comprising 51% acrylamide monomer and 7.8%
      bisacrylamide crosslinker yields a matrix comprising metal quantum
      clusters that are substantially all Ag25(glutathione)i8 metal
      quantum clusters. Preferably the content of Ag25(glutathione)i8
      metal quantum clusters is greater than about 80%), greater than
      about 90%, greater than about 95%, greater than about 97%, greater
      than about 99%, greater than about 99.5%, or greater than about
      99.9% of all the metal quantum clusters formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Monodispersity of a metal quantum cluster sample may be
      confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. A
      sample of monodisperse metal quantum clusters may show strong
      quantum size effects such as multiple molecule-like transitions in
      the optical absorption spectrum, whereas metal nanoparticles may
      show a dominant plasmon resonance band. In an embodiment, the
      UV-Vis spectrum of an aqueous solution of Ag25(glutathione)i 8
      metal quantum clusters shows prominent features at about 350, 480,
      and 650 nm indicating that the clusters obtained were
      monodispersed. Further confirmation of monodispersity in a metal
      quantum cluster sample can be had via gel electrophoresis, where
      elution of a single band may indicate that only one type of
      cluster is present. In an embodiment, a sample of
      Ag25(glutathione)i 8 metal quantum clusters produced a single band
      when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Finally, a
      mass spectrum of monodisperse metal quantum clusters may be
      substantially free of all features not corresponding to the
      ionized metal quantum cluster and its multiply charged ions that
      originate from ligand deprotonation. In an embodiment, the
      electrospray ionization mass spectrum of Ag25(glutathione)j8 taken
      in negative ion mode showed only the parent peak of
      [Ag2s(glutathione)i8]&lt;~&gt; at m/z = 1641.1 and peaks from a
      series of multiply charge ions originating from deprotonation of
      the 18 glutathione ligands.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an embodiment, the porous gel matrix may encapsulate the
      metal quantum cluster precursor compound. The metal quantum
      cluster precursor compound may be introduced to the porous gel
      matrix by adding the metal quantum cluster precursor compound to
      the gel-forming solution, by adding the metal quantum cluster
      precursor compound to the porous gel matrix, or by forming the
      metal quantum cluster precursor compound within the porous gel
      matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring back to Figure 1 , a reducing agent may be added
      125 to the porous gel matrix encapsulating the metal quantum
      cluster precursor. The reducing agent may be used to form metal
      quantum clusters within the porous gel matrix through the
      reduction of the metal quantum cluster precursor compound.
      Materials used as reducing agents are well- known to a person
      having ordinary skill in the art, and the examples described
      herein are not intended to be limiting. The reducing agent may be
      an inorganic salt. In some embodiments, the reducing agent may be
      NaBH4, LiAlH4, nascent hydrogen, borane-tetrahydrofuran complex,
      or sodiumcyanoborohydride.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The reducing agent may be introduced to the porous gel
      matrix by adding the reducing agent to the gel-forming solution,
      by passive permeation of the reducing agent into the porous gel
      matrix, or by using an applied current to carry the reducing agent
      through the porous gel matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an embodiment, formation of the preferred metal quantum
      clusters can include lowering the reaction temperature between the
      reducing agent and the metal quantum cluster precursor compound.
      For example, the reducing agent and the porous gel matrix
      encapsulating the metal quantum cluster precursor compound may be
      cooled below room temperature prior to introducing the reducing
      agent to the porous gel matrix. In some embodiments, they are
      cooled to about 20 [deg.]C or below, about 15 [deg.]C or below,
      about 10 [deg.]C or below, about 5 [deg.]C or below, or to about 0
      [deg.]C or to a range between any two of these values. In
      particular, the reducing agent and the porous gel matrix
      encapsulating the metal quantum cluster precursor compound may be
      cooled to about 0 [deg.]C prior to introducing the reducing agent
      to the porous gel matrix. <br>
      <br>
      [0031] Following formation of the metal quantum clusters, the
      reaction may be stopped by removing excess reducing agent from the
      porous gel matrix. Solvent extraction may be used to remove excess
      reducing agent. The extraction solvent may be an alcohol, such as
      ethanol or methanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Further use of the metal quantum clusters may include
      separation or isolation of the metal quantum clusters from the
      porous gel matrix. Pulverizing the porous gel matrix may improve
      the isolation of the metal quantum clusters from the porous gel
      matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In some embodiments, solvent extraction may be used to
      extract metal quantum clusters from the porous gel matrix. The
      extraction solvent may be aqueous. For example, the extraction
      solvent may be water, water and about 20% methanol, water and
      about 20% tetahydrofuran, or water and about 20%
      dimethylformamide. Centrifugation may be used to separate
      insoluble gel fragments from a solution containing metal quantum
      clusters. Purification of dissolved metal quantum clusters may be
      achieved by precipitating the metal quantum clusters. In an
      embodiment, addition of a solvent may be used to precipitate the
      metal quantum clusters from an aqueous solution. The precipitation
      solvent may be an alcohol such as ethanol or methanol, or it may
      be an organic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In other embodiments, the porous gel matrix may be
      dissolved with a suitable solvent. The metal quantum clusters may
      dissolve with the porous gel matrix, or may remain insoluble. In
      embodiments where the metal quantum clusters are not dissolved
      along with the porous gel matrix, centrifugation may be used to
      separate the insoluble metal quantum clusters from the solution.
      In embodiments where the metal quantum clusters are dissolved
      along with the porous gel matrix, selective precipitation may be
      used to isolate the metal quantum clusters. [0035] Removal of
      solvent may be used to acquire a dry powder of metal quantum
      clusters. Solvent may be removed by applying a vacuum, raising the
      temperature, decanting, or any combination thereof. For example,
      solvent may be removed by applying a vacuum at elevated
      temperature. The isolated yield of metal quantum clusters may be
      about 30% to about 100%, about 50% to about 80%, about 66%, or
      about 63%, based on the weight of the metal-containing compound.
      Specific examples of yield include about 30%, about 40%, about
      50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about
      99%, and ranges between any two of these values. In an ideal
      example, the yield is about 100% or is 100%.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] A phase-transfer reagent may be used to alter the
      solubility properties of the metal quantum clusters. Water soluble
      metal quantum clusters may be transferred to an organic solvent by
      dissolving the metal quantum clusters in an aqueous solvent and
      adding a phase-transfer reagent dissolved in an organic solvent.
      The mixture of metal quantum clusters and phase-transfer reagent
      may be heated, stirred, or heated and stirred. Suitable
      phase-transfer reagents include but are not limited to quaternary
      ammonium cations, such as benzyltrimethylammonium chloride or
      tetraoctylammonium bromide, and phosphonium salts, such as
      tetraphenylphosphonium chloride. The phase-transfer reagent may be
      tetraoctylammonium bromide. The organic solvent may be immiscible
      with water. For example, suitable solvents include organic
      solvents, such as toluene, dichloromethane, carbontetrachloride,
      hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, and diethyl ether.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The aqueous and organic solvents may be separated. Ethanol,
      for example, may be added to the organic layer to precipitate the
      phase-transferred metal quantum clusters. The precipitated
      phase-transferred metal quantum clusters may be washed, isolated,
      dried, or any combination thereof. The precipitated
      phase-transferred metal quantum clusters may be redispersible in
      an organic solvent. The phase-transferred metal quantum clusters
      may be more stable when compared to the metal quantum clusters in
      an aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an embodiment, a kit for making metal quantum clusters
      may be provided. The kit may comprise: a metal-containing
      compound, a capping agent, a gel-forming solution, a reducing
      agent, and instructions for preparing the metal quantum clusters.
      In an embodiment, the kit may include four containers, wherein:
      the metal-containing compound is in the first container, the
      capping agent is in the second container, the gel-forming solution
      is in the third container, and the reducing agent is in the fourth
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The metal-containing compound provided in the kit may be a
      metal thiolate, an organometallic compound, a metal oxide, an
      inorganic salt, a coordination compound, or a combination thereof.
      In an embodiment, the metal-containing compound provided in the
      kit may contain Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sn, Ti, Ag, Au, Cd, Se, Si, Pt, S,
      Ni or a combination thereof. For example, the metal-containing
      compound provided in the kit may be AgN03.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The capping agent provided in the kit can comprise an
      aromatic group, a conjugated pi system, a pi bond, a nitrogen
      atom, an oxygen atom, a sulphur atom or a phosphorus atom. In an
      embodiment, the capping agent provided in the kit may be an
      organosulfur compound. For example, the capping agent provided in
      the kit may be a thiol. In particular, the capping agent provided
      in the kit may be glutathione thiolate.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The gel-forming solution provided in the kit is a liquid
      comprising the materials used to form a porous gel matrix. In an
      embodiment, the gel-forming solution provided in the kit may be a
      polymer or a polymerizable material. For example, the
      polymerizable material provided in the kit may be acrylamide,
      bisacrylamide, piperazine di- acrylamide, diallyltartardiamide,
      dihydroxyethylene-bis-acrylamide, bis-acrylylcystamine or mixtures
      thereof. In particular, the polymerizable material provided in the
      kit may be a mixture acrylamide and bisacrylamide. [0042] The
      gel-forming solution provided in the kit may use a change in
      temperature, additional reagents, or both a change in temperature
      and additional reagents to form a porous gel matrix. The
      additional reagents may be polymerization agents such as catalysts
      and polymerization initiators and may be included in the kit. In
      an embodiment two additional containers with the polymerization
      agents N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-ethane-l ,2- diamine (TMED) and
      ammonium persulfate are provided in the kit. As will be
      appreciated by those skilled in the art, the polymerization agents
      should be separate from the polymerizable material until
      polymerization is desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The reducing agent provided in the kit may be an inorganic
      salt. For example, the reducing agent may be NaBH4.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The solubility of the metal quantum clusters made using the
      kit can optionally be changed from organic to aqueous or from
      aqueous to organic. In an embodiment, the kit will provide an
      additional container with a phase-transfer agent. The
      phase-transfer reagent may be tetraoctylammonium bromide.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Embodiments illustrating the method and materials used may
      be further understood by reference to the following non-limiting
      examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Example 1 : Preparation of metal quantum clusters in a
        porous gel.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0046] The metal quantum cluster precursor compound was formed by
      dissolvingAgN03 (47 mg, 276 mM) and glutathione (GSH) (150 mg, 489
      mM) in a 1 mL solution of NaOH (60 mg, 1.5 mM, triply distilled
      water) at room temperature. The solution was vigorously stirred
      and sonicated to make a uniform solution of Ag(I)thiolate.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The gel-forming solution was formed by mixing
      acrylamide(T)/bisacrylamide(C) (51% T, 7.8%C) and 20 [mu][iota],,
      of 0.1% ammonium persulfate in a 250 mL beaker. 0.7 mL of the
      metal quantum cluster precursor solution was added and stirred.
      With the addition of 10 [mu][iota]
      N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-ethane-l,2-diamine (TMED), polymerization
      leading to the porous gel matrix occurred. The gel was cooled to 0
      [deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Formation of the metal quantum clusters was initiated by
      adding ice cold, aq. NaBH4 (0.5 M, 10 mL) on top of the porous gel
      matrix encapsulating metal quantum cluster precursor. The color of
      the gel changed from light yellow to dark brown within half an
      hour indicating the formation of gel-encapsulated metal quantum
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      <b> Example 2: Isolation of metal quantum clusters from a porous
        gel matrix.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0049] The porous gel matrix was pulverized, and the metal quantum
      clusters were extracted into water. This aqueous solution of metal
      quantum clusters was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove traces of
      the porous gel matrix. Excess ethanol was added to precipitate the
      metal quantum clusters. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure
      led to a dry powder of metal quantum clusters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3: Phase transfer of metal quantum clusters.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0050] An aqueous solution of metal quantum clusters (5 mg/mL) was
      mixed with 5 mM tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) in toluene and
      stirred vigorously for 2 minutes. Metal quantum clusters underwent
      immediate and complete phase transfer from the aqueous to the
      toluene layer. The phase transfer was monitored visually by color
      changes in the aqueous and toluene layers. The colorless toluene
      layer turned reddish brown and the aqueous layer, which was
      originally reddish brown, turned colorless after stirring. Ethanol
      was added to the toluene layer to precipitate the phase
      transferred metal quantum clusters. The precipitate was washed two
      times with ethanol, centrifuged and dried. This powder was
      redispersible in toluene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4: Determining product monodispersitv and composition</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0051] The UV-Vis spectrum of an aqueous solution of the product
      from Example 2 shows prominent features at 330, 478, and 640 nm,
      and is devoid of a plasmon resonance band. These multiple
      molecule-like transitions in the optical absorption spectrum are
      indicative of a sample containing monodisperse metal quantum
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were made with a 1
      mm thick spacer where the total contents of the acrylamide
      monomers were 28% (bis(acrylamide:acrylamide) = 7:93) and 3%
      (bis(acrylamide:acrylamide) = 6:94) for the separation and
      condensation gels, respectively. The eluting buffer consisted of
      192 mM glycine and 25 mM tris(hydroxymethylamine). The crude
      mixture of metal quantum clusters, as a reddish brown powder,
      obtained in the reaction from example 2 was dissolved in 5% (v/v)
      glycerol-water solution (1.0 mL) at a concentration of 60 mg/mL.
      The sample solution (1.0 mL) was loaded onto a 1 mm gel and eluted
      for 4 h at a constant voltage of 150 V to achieve separation. The
      metal quantum clusters appeared as a single band in the gel,
      further indicating that the sample was contained monodisperse
      metal quantum clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on
      the product from example 3 in methylene chloride. The spectrum
      taken in negative ion mode showed only the parent peak of
      [Ag25(glutathione)i8]&lt;""&gt;at m/z = 1641.1 and peaks from a
      series of multiply charge ions originating from deprotonation of
      the 18 glutathione ligands. The absence of other features and the
      mass correlation to the desired metal quantum clusters confirms
      that the synthesized product is Ag25(glutathione)i8 metal quantum
      clusters.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Example 5 : Preparation of nanoparticles.</b><br>
      <br>
      [0054] Silver nitrate (AgN03, 47 mg, 276 mM) and glutathione (GSH)
      (150 mg, 489 mM) will be dissolved in a 1 mL solution of NaOH (60
      mg, 1.5 mM, triply distilled water) at room temperature. The
      solution will be vigorously stirred and sonicated to make a
      uniform solution of Ag(I)thiolate. Formation of the nanoparticles
      will be initiated by adding ice cold, aq. NaBH4 (0.5 M, 10 mL) to
      the solution of Ag(I)thiolate. Polydisperse plasmonic
      nanoparticles will be isolated by centrifugation, removal of
      supernatant, dispersion of the resulting pellet in water, and a
      second centrifugation and removal of supernatant step.<br>

      singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate
      from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the
      plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The
      various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth
      herein for sake of clarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It will be understood by those within the art that, in
      general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims
      (e.g. , bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as
      "open" terms (e.g. , the term "including" should be interpreted as
      "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be
      interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be
      interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.). It will be
      further understood by those within the art that if a specific
      number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an
      intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence
      of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an
      aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain
      usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more"
      to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases
      should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim
      recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any
      particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to
      embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the
      same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at
      least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a"
      and/or "an" should be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one
      or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles
      used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a
      specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly
      recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such
      recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited
      number (e.g. , the bare recitation of "two recitations," without
      other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more
      recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention
      analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in
      general such a construction is intended in the sense one having
      skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g. , " a
      system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not
      be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B
      together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C
      together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the
      art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting
      two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims,
      or figure, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities
      of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms.
      For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to include the
      possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure
      are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art
      will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in
      terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the
      Markush group.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any
      and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written
      description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and
      all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any
      listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing
      and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal
      halves, thirds, &lt;'&gt;quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a
      non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily
      broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc.
      As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language
      such as "up to," "at least," and the like include the number
      recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down
      into subranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood
      by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual
      member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 substituents refers
      to groups having 1, 2, or 3 substituents. Similarly, a group
      having 1-5 substituents refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
      substituents, and so forth.<br>

      </b><b> TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present disclosure relates to nanomaterials, and
      particularly to nanometal oxyhydroxide materials, such as, for
      example, organic templated nanometal oxyhydroxide materials,
      together with methods of preparing such materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] Amongst all aluminum based compositions, activated alumina
      is the most popular composition. Activated alumina is typically
      prepared by complete thermal dehydration of aluminum hydroxide
      whereas boehmite is typically prepared by partial thermal
      dehydration of aluminum hydroxide. Activated alumina is an
      effective industrial desiccant, catalyst support and an effective
      adsorbent of arsenic and fluoride in water. The United Nations<br>
      Environmental Program agency (UNEP) classified activated alumina
      adsorption among the best available technologies for arsenic
      removal from water. Aluminum based compounds in general, and
      alumina in particular, are widely used and are the basis of
      demonstrated technology for removing arsenic and fluoride from
      drinking water. The fluoride adsorption capacity of aluminum based
      compounds, however, is typically very low, for example, on the
      order of 1 to 10 mg/g. Arsenic adsorption capacity is similarly
      low. Thus, adsorption technologies and devices which utilize
      conventional alumina materials are limited by the low arsenic and
      fluoride uptake capacity and can require frequent regeneration,
      producing large amounts of solid and liquid waste.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Typically, granular beads of alumina are used in the
      applications discussed above. Powder based compositions cannot be
      directly used due to the inherent poor hydraulic conductivity and
      the danger of particle leaching. The conventional granular beads
      are prepared by adding binders along with fine particles of
      alumina/aluminum hydroxide, and heating the mixture at elevated
      temperatures in the range of 300 [deg.]C to 600 [deg.]C. Yet
      another method for obtaining alumina beads is via an oil-drop
      method wherein a gel obtained by precipitation of an aluminum
      precursor is allowed to drop into a hot oil bath, forming
      spherical particles and ageing the particles at higher pressure
      and temperature. The resulting crystalline spherical alumina
      particles are obtained after washing, drying and calcining at high
      temperature. Due to the use of external physical and/or chemical
      agents, such approaches are lesser environment friendly and
      uneconomical.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Metal oxide-chitosan composite materials are one example of
      organic bio-based materials known for their adsorption capacity to
      remove, for example, various aquatic pollutants. Ti-Al supported
      chitosan beads have recently been examined for the removal of
      fluoride, wherei it was found that chitosan beads dried at 80
      [deg.]C swell in water and clog the filter unit. Calcining the
      beads at elevated temperature (e.g., 450 [deg.]C) can improve the
      stability of the beads; however, the calcination process reduces
      the fluoride uptake capacity and can decompose chitosan. These
      constraints restrict the use of such media for water purification
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Thus, there is a need to address the aforementioned
      problems and other shortcomings associated with the adsorption
      materials and water filtration technologies. Specifically, there
      is a need for bio-friendly materials that having improved fluoride
      and/or arsenic adsorption capacities. These needs and other needs
      are satisfied by the compositions and methods of the present
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as
      embodied and broadly described herein, this disclosure, in one
      aspect, relates to a granular composite material, and specifically

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0021] The present invention can be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description of the invention
      and the Examples included therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Before the present compounds, compositions, articles,
      systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it
      is to be understood that they are not limited to specific
      synthetic methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular
      reagents unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary.
      It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is
      for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not
      intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials
      similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the
      practice or testing of the present invention, example methods and
      materials are now described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0023] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the
      singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless
      the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
      reference to "a solvent" can include mixtures of two or more
      solvents.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" one
      particular value, and/or to "about" another particular value. When
      such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one
      particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly,
      when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the
      antecedent "about," it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the
      endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation
      to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It
      is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed
      herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as "about"
      that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value "10" is disclosed, then "about 10" is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two
      particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are
      disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As used herein, the terms "optional" or "optionally" means
      that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or can
      not occur, and that the description includes instances where said
      event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As used herein the term "oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide" can
      refer to an<br>
      oxyhydroxide, a hydroxide, an oxide, or any combination thereof.
      It is not necessary that each of an oxyhydroxide, a hydroxide, and
      an oxide be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Throughout this specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the word "comprise," or variations such as "comprises"
      or "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
      stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the
      exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or
      steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Disclosed are the components to be used to prepare the
      compositions of the invention as well as the compositions
      themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These
      and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood
      that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of
      these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of
      each various individual and collective combinations and
      permutation of these compounds can not be explicitly disclosed,
      each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For
      example, if a particular compound is disclosed and discussed and a
      number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules
      including the compounds are discussed, specifically contemplated
      is each and every combination and permutation of the compound and
      the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated
      to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are
      disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an
      example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if
      each is not individually recited each is individually and
      collectively contemplated meaning combinations, A-E, A-F, B-D,
      B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are considered disclosed. Likewise,
      any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for
      example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C- E would be considered
      disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application
      including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and
      using the compositions of the invention. Thus, if there are a
      variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood
      that each of these additional steps can be performed with any
      specific<br>
      embodiment or combination of embodiments of the methods of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] It is understood that the compositions disclosed herein
      have certain functions. Disclosed herein are certain structural
      requirements for performing the disclosed functions, and it is
      understood that there are a variety of structures that can perform
      the same function that are related to the disclosed structures,
      and that these structures will typically achieve the same result.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As briefly discussed above, the present disclosure relates
      generally to a granular composite material. In one aspect, the
      invention comprises a granular composite of an organic templated
      nanometal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide material. In another
      aspect, such a granular composite can be prepared using a process
      conducted at least partially in an aqueous medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods
      for the preparation of a granular composite, such as, for example,
      an organic templated nanometal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide. In
      one aspect, the present disclosure provides methods for preparing
      a granular composition using an aqueous medium, the method
      comprising a biopolymer and one or more nanometal
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles. In a general aspect, the
      methods of the present invention comprise contacting a metal or
      metal precursor with a biopolymer and/or biopolymer solution, and
      then contacting the resulting mixture with a base.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In various aspects, a metal and/or metal precursor can
      comprise a salt of a metal or a solution thereof. In one aspect,
      the metal from which a metal and/or metal precursor can comprise
      aluminum, zinc, manganese, iron, titanium, zirconium, lanthanum,
      cerium, or a combination thereof.. In one aspect, a metal
      precursor comprises a solution of an aluminum salt comprising
      aluminum nitrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate, aluminum
      isopropoxide, or a combination thereof. In still other aspects,
      the metal precursor can comprise other metal salts or solutions
      not specifically recited herein, and the present invention is not
      intended to be limited to any particular metal precursor. In other
      aspects, the metal precursor can comprise a mixture of two or more
      individual metal precursors in any desired ratio, such as, for
      example, from about 20: 1 to about 1:20, for example, about 20: 1,
      10: 1, 5: 1, 3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 1: 10, or 1:20. In
      one aspect, the metal precursor comprises aluminum nitrate. In
      another aspect, the metal precursor comprises a mixture of
      aluminum and iron salts in a ratio of, for example, about 3: 1
      (Al:Fe).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The biopolymer can comprise any suitable biopolymer or
      mixture of biopolymers. In one aspect, the biopolymer can comprise
      chitosan, banana silk, cellulose fibers, or a combination thereof.
      In another aspect, the biopolymer or a portion thereof is a flake
      biopolymer. In another aspect, functionalized forms of the
      biopolymer can also be used as biopolymer flakes. In other
      aspects, chitosan flakes can be used as biopolymer flakes. In one
      aspect, a biopolymer, such as, for example, a biopolymer flake,
      can be dissolved in a solution of water and/or a solution of water
      and a mineral acid, such as, for example, HCl, HNO3 and the like.
      In such an aspect, the H&lt;+&gt; ions of the mineral acid can at
      least partially ionize the biopolymer and dissolve it in the water
      to obtain biopolymer solution. In one aspect, the biopolymer
      comprises chitosan. In another aspect, the biopolymer comprises a
      mixture of cellulose and chitosan.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one aspect, the metal ions of a metal precursor can
      interact with a biopolymer through a number of functional groups.
      The amounts of metal precursor and biopolymer can vary, and any
      suitable amount for a desired composite can be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The base of the present invention can comprise any suitable
      base for use in preparing the inventive granular composites. In
      one aspect, a base can comprise sodium hydroxide, ammonia,
      potassium hydroxide, or a combination thereof. In other aspects,
      other bases or combination of bases and/or solutions thereof can
      be used, and the present invention is not intended to be limited
      to any particular base. In one aspect, upon addition of base to a
      mixture of metal precursor and biopolymer, metal ions present in
      the resulting metal- biopolymer complex solution can hydrolyze and
      precipitate as nanometal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles.
      In one aspect, functional groups associated with a biopolymer,
      such as chitosan, can enable the formation of
      metal-oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide, for example, a combination of
      oxyhydroxide, hydroxide, and oxide, rather than metal hydroxide.<br>
      [0036] In such an aspect, a semi-solid precipitate comprising
      nanometal- oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles aligned on the
      chitosan biopolymer can be obtained. In one aspect, the size of
      the resulting nanometal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles can
      be in the range of from about 1 nm to about 100 nm. In with yet
      another aspect, the size of the nanometal
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles can be in the range of from
      about 3 nm to about 10 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In one aspect, the method for preparing the inventive
      granular composite can be conducted at least partially in an
      aqueous medium. In another aspect, the method can be conducted in
      an aqueous medium. In one aspect, the phrase 'an aqueous medium'
      can refer to a medium comprising water, and optionally other
      aqueous and/or nonaqueous components. In another aspect, the
      phrase 'an aqueous medium' can refer to a medium wherein all
      components are aqueous or at least partially soluble in water. In
      still other aspects, other items, such as particulate materials,
      that can form, for example, a suspension, can be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one aspect, the method can be conducted wherein the
      temperature of the medium is below about 60 [deg.]C for at least a
      portion of the process. In another aspect, the method can be
      conducted wherein the temperature of the medium is below about 60
      [deg.]C during the process.<br>

      [0039] A metal precursor can be contacted with a biopolymer. In
      one aspect, the metal precursor or a portion thereof can be in the
      form of a solution. Upon contacting, the metal precursor and
      biopolymer can form a metal-biopolymer complex solution. In one
      aspect, such a complex solution can be subjected to a hydrolysis
      step wherein the metal precursor or a portion thereof is
      hydrolyzed by contacted with a base. In one aspect, the base can
      comprise a solution. In one aspect, the order of contacting can
      vary. In another aspect, the biopolymer can metal precursor are
      first contacted, and then the resulting mixture can be contacted
      with a base or base solution. In other aspects, the degree of
      mixing can vary, and it is not necessary that the components be
      thoroughly mixed or that a completely homogeneous mixture be
      obtained. In another aspect, the components are mixed such that
      the resulting composition is uniform or substantially uniform. In
      still another aspect, the components can be vigorously mixed, for
      example, by stirring, to obtain the desired product. <br>
      <br>
      [0040] After contacting with a base, the resulting product can
      comprise one or more nanometal oxyhydroxiee/hydroxide/oxide
      particles. In one aspect, any of the one or more particles can
      comprise the same or a different chemical composition and/or
      structure than any other particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In one aspect, a precipitate, such as, for example, a
      semi-solid precipitate of the one or more nanometal
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particle-biopolymer composite can be
      obtained. In such an aspect, the semi-solid precipitate can be
      subjected to optional filtration and/or drying steps to remove
      impurities, concentrate the precipitate, and isolate the desired
      solid nanometal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particle-biopolymer
      composite.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In another aspect, a solid composite produced from the
      methods described herein can be ground to obtain a granular
      composite having a particle size and/or particle size distribution
      suitable for an intended application.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one aspect, the methods of the present invention do not
      require at least one of elevated temperature, elevated pressure,
      and/or external chemical agents to prepare a granular composite.
      In antoher aspect, the methods of the present invention do not
      require elevated temperature, pressure, or external chemical
      agents to prepare a granular composite. In such aspects, the
      inventive methods provide substantial improvements over
      conventional methods known in the art. As the inventive granular
      composite includes a biopolymer as a component, the method for
      preparing the composite can be easy, economical, and environment
      friendly, especially as compared to conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In various aspects, the present invention provides methods
      for preparing granular composites of one or more organic templated
      nanometal-oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide via an aqueous process. In
      another aspect, the inventive granular composites can have useful
      adsorption properties and can be used to remove, for example,
      fluoride and/or arsenic contaminants from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary reaction 100 through which
      a granular composite of organic templated
      nanometal-oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide can be obtained. Reaction
      100 can be initiated by preparing a biopolymer solution 102 of,
      for example, a biopolymer flake 101, and then a metal precursor
      solution 103 can be added to the biopolymer solution 102 to obtain
      a metal-biopolymer complex solution 105. A base 104 can then be
      added to the metal-biopolymer complex solution 105 to obtain the
      composite 106 of biopolymer and nanometal-
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles .<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one aspect, the resulting semi-solid precipitate can be
      filtered and/or dried to remove impurities, to concentrate the
      precipitate and to obtain a solid metal
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particle-biopolymer composite. The
      particular method of drying, if dried, can vary, and the present
      invention is note intended to be limited to any particular drying
      method. In various aspects, exemplary drying methods can comprise
      freeze drying, surface drying, hot air drying, spray drying,
      vacuum drying, or a combination thereof. In other aspects, other
      drying technologies known in the art can be used in addition to or
      in lieu of any other specifically recited methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In another aspect, the dried solid precipitate can
      optionally be ground to a desirable size for an intended
      application, for example, in the range of from about 0.1 mm to
      about 3 mm. The resulting granular composite can comprise the
      metal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles and the biopolymer.
      In another aspect, the resulting granular composite can consist of
      the metal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide particles and the
      biopolymer. Ina specific aspect, a metal oxyhydroxide, such as,
      for example, aluminum oxyhydroxide, commonly known as boehmite,
      can be prepared, wherein the granular composite obtained has an
      organic template boehmite nanoarchitecture (OTBN).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In another aspect, the reaction 100 can take place at a
      temperature below about 60 [deg.]C, for example, about 55, 50, 45,
      40, 35, 30, or 25 [deg.]C. In another aspect, the reaction 100 can
      take place at a temperature of about 30 [deg.]C. With the use of
      bio material and low temperature, the inventive methods described
      herein can provide easy, economical, and environment friendly
      methods to prepare composites of organic templated nanometal-
      oxyhydroxide/hydroxide/oxide .<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary schematic representation of
      OTBN comprising chitosan bound aluminum oxyhydroxide particles
      prepared by the methods of the present invention. As shown in the
      figure, one or more nanoscale aluminum oxyhydroxide particles 202
      can be aligned on the surface of chitosan 201. Transmission
      electron micrographs 203 illustrate the OTBN at various
      magnifications. As illustrated in the micrographs, the OTBN
      samples can exhibit nano-whisker morpholigies. Upon close
      observation, small particles can be attached to the fibrils, where
      the attached small particles resemble peppercorns. The fibrils can
      be organic templates and the particles can comprise AIOOH
      nanoparticles. Also, as illustrated in the figures, the particles
      can have nanosize dimensions with diameters of, for example, less
      than about 5 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Characterization of organic templated boehmite
      nanoarchitecture (OTBN) can be explored by various techniques such
      as x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
      (FTIR) spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
      as illustrated in FIGS. 3-5, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 3 illustrates the XRD patterns of (A) an exemplary
      as-synthesized material reacted with 1000 mg/L fluoride; (B)
      as-synthesized material reacted with 100 mg/L fluoride (C) as-
      synthesized AIOOH; and (D) chitosan. Dotted lines correspond to
      the standard reflections of AIOOH. The traces are shifted
      vertically for clarity. (Label: '+' - chitosan; '*'- AIOOH). The
      as-synthesized samples showed peaks corresponding to (020), (120),
      (013), (200) and (231) and (251) planes (FIG. 3A). All these peaks
      can be indexed as orthorhombic- AIOOH. The broadened XRD peaks
      imply that the crystallite size of the OTBN particles is very
      small. The mean crystallite size calculated from the Scherrer
      formula shows that nanocrystals are of an average size of about
      3.5 nm. The presence of organic template (chitosan) is also clear
      from the XRD data. Fluoride reacted OTBN samples showed no change
      in diffraction patterns indicating that the crystal structure is
      intact even after fluoride adsorption (FIG. 3A). The standard
      reflections of orthorhombic-AlOOH are also given to validate the
      structure of the sample. Comparing the XRD positions of the
      standard sample and the as- synthesized sample, a change in
      intensity pattern could be seen, which can be ascribed to the
      effect of the organic template. The intensity of the higher index
      planes is higher in the nanoscale material. Recent studies on the
      catalytic activity of metals such as Pt have shown that high-index
      planes exhibit much higher catalytic activity than that of common
      and stable, low-index planes.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Apart from the point of view of enhanced catalytic
      activity, the current synthesis method can yield crystalline
      nanoscale- AIOOH having good green strength at much lower
      temperature in comparison to conventional methods. According to
      the current literature, AIOOH formation is possible only above 373
      K, and the prior art syntheses of nanoscale- AIOOH have been done
      in hydrothermal conditions at temperatures above 373 K. <br>
      <br>
      [0053] XRD patterns of the OTBNs prepared at various physical and
      chemical conditions were recorded in order to understand their
      effects on crystal structure of OTBN. Some of the XRD patterns
      recorded are shown in FIG. 3b. FIG. 3b illustrates the XRD
      patterns of as- synthesized materials through various starting
      materials: (Al) OTBN prepared using aluminum nitrate and ammonia
      as the starting materials, (A2) OTBN prepared using aluminum
      sulfate and ammonia as the starting materials, (A3) OTBN prepared
      using aluminum nitrate and sodium hydroxide as the starting
      materials, (A4 to A6) OTBN prepared using aluminum chloride and
      NaOH as the starting materials. All the materials except A5 and A6
      were dried at 60 degree centigrade in oven. A5 was dried at room
      temperature and A6 was dried at 120 degree centigrade in oven. The
      data shows the formation of AIOOH with all the aluminum precursors
      and temperature range (25 to 130 degree centigrade) studied. The
      crystallographic structures obtained were seemingly identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 4 illustrates FT-IR spectra of (A) the as- synthesized
      OTBN and (B) fluoride adsorbed OTBN. All the absorption bands are
      consistent with literature values and give additional evidence for
      the formation of [gamma]- AIOOH. The bands at 1072 and 1154
      cm&lt;-1&gt; are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric
      stretching frequencies of Al-O-H of boehmite, respectively. The
      bands at 3096 and 3312 cm&lt;-1&gt; are assigned to Al-OOH
      stretching vibrations. The band at 1636 cm&lt;-1&gt; is assigned
      to the bending modes of adsorbed water and the broad band at 3429
      cm&lt;-1&gt; is due to the O-H stretching mode of adsorbed water.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 5 illustrates the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      (XPS) survey spectra of OTBN before and after the adsorption of
      the fluoride. Trace (A) and (B) in the FIG. 5(a-d) represent
      as-prepared OTBN and fluoride adsorbed OTBN respectively. FIG.
      5(a) shows the survey spectra and (b,c,d) show the spectra of
      various regions of interest.These spectra confirm the existence of
      adsorbed fluoride along with the key elements aluminum and oxygen.
      For understating the chemical form of the pristine and fluoride
      adsorbed materials, detailed scans of specific regions of key
      elements (Al 2p, O ls) and adsorbed ion (F Is) were carried out
      and are shown in FIG. 5. The XPS spectrum of the aluminum 2p level
      shows a peak at 74.4 eV, which is in agreement with reported
      values of aluminum in AIOOH. Thus, in one aspect, fluoride
      adsorption does not affect the position of aluminum, but a
      reduction in the surface positive charge can be seen in the oxygen
      of Is orbital, as a result of which it appears at a lower binding
      energy. [0056] In another aspect, the granular composite of
      organic templated nanometal- oxyhydroxide prepared by the methods
      of the present invention can exhibit fluoride, arsenic and/or
      pathogen adsorption capability from water. In one aspect, a
      granular composite can have a fluoride adsorption capacity in
      excess of about 50 mg/g at an initial fluoride concentration of
      about 10 mg/1, and/or have an arsenic adsorption capacity in
      excess of about 19 mg/g at an initial arsenate concentration of
      about 1.0 mg/1.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another aspect, the fluoride and/or arsenic adsorption
      rates of the composite of organic templated nanometal-oxyhydroxide
      prepared by the methods of present invention are discussed in FIGS
      6 - 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 6a illustrates the extent of fluoride adsorption by
      OTBN as a function of adsorbent dose. The working volume of the
      contaminated water was taken to be 100 ml and the quantity of
      adsorbent dose is varied between 2.5 mg to 100 mg. The OTBN
      prepared through various starting materials were also tested to
      assess their capability to remove fluoride. As expected, the
      amount of fluoride adsorbed increased with increase in material
      dose from about 2.5 mg to about 50.0 mg and became more or less
      constant for further increase in dose. As evident from the data,
      the fluoride concentration reduced to a value as low as about 0.5
      mg/L from an initial concentration of about 10 mg/L at optimum
      adsorbent dose. When the OTBN dose was further increased, there
      was less proportionate increase in adsorption because of the
      limitation of fluoride ions as compared to the adsorption sites
      available for the reaction. From these results it is observed that
      at about 10 mg/L fluoride concentration and neutral pH, the OTBN
      sample can remove about 53 mg/g of fluoride. This is considerably
      higher than the commercially available alumina or AIOOH based<br>
      nanomaterials tested so far. A recent attempt to remove fluoride
      from water using nanoscale- AIOOH showed a removal capacity of
      3.26 mg/g, which is around 16 times less in capacity compared to
      the inventive OTBN sample prepared using the methods of present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 6b illustrates the fluoride uptake capacity as a
      function of initial fluoride concentration. The working volume of
      the contaminated water was taken to be 100 ml and the initial
      fluoride concentration was varied between 5-60 mg/L. An increase
      in fluoride uptake capacity was observed with increase in initial
      fluoride concentrations and an uptake capacity in excess of about
      50 mg/g was observed at initial fluoride concentration of 60 mg/L
      (Ce = 33.5 mg/L). <br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 7a illustrates fluoride uptake capacity of OTBN as a
      function of time.The working volume of the contaminated water was
      taken to be 100 ml and quantity of adsorbent used is 50 mg.
      Results show that fluoride uptake with OTBN sample prepared using
      the method of present invention is very fast and most of the
      removal takes place in the first 10 minutes of contact and the
      equilibrium is reached in 60 min. The fluoride uptake kinetics
      observed in the case of OTBN is much superior to the commercially
      available alumina and many other adsorbents used for scavenging
      fluoride, which has large implications in practical applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] To understand the process kinetics better, kinetic data of
      fluoride adsorption by OTBN was analyzed with various reaction
      kinetic models, including Lagergren pseudo-first-order, and Ho's
      pseudo-second-order reaction rate models. While not wishing to be
      bound by theory, mathematical representations of these models are
      given in equations 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      Pseudo-first-order equation:<br>
      (1)<br>
      Pseudo- second-order equation:<br>
      <br>
      where qt is the amount of fluoride removed from aqueous solution
      at time t (mg/g); qe is the amount of fluoride removed from
      aqueous solution at equilibrium (mg/g); Ki is the pseudo-
      first-order rate constant of adsorption (1/min); K2 is the
      pseudo-second-order rate constant of adsorption (g/mg.min); and t
      is the time (min).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The best-fit model plots (pseudo-second-order reaction
      model) along with experimental plots are illustrated in FIG. 7b.
      The kinetic rate constant, K2 for 10 mg/L and 5 mg/L of fluoride
      were calculated to be 0.049 and 0.098 g/mg.min, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 8a illustrates the extent of arsenic adsorption by
      OTBN as a function of adsorbent dose. OTBN dose was varied over a
      range of 5 to 100 mg. The working volume of the contaminated water
      was taken to be 100 ml. Studies were conducted with an initial
      arsenic concentration of about 1.1 mg/L and at pH of 7 + 0.2. As
      evident from the data, the OTBN (25 mg) could reduce the arsenic
      concentration to a value below detectable limits of current
      techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) (&lt;
      0.05 mg/L).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In another aspect, an equilibrium adsorption study of
      arsenic by OTBN was carried out at 30 + 2 [deg.]C and neutral pH.
      The initial arsenic concentrations were varied over a wide range
      (5 - 100 mg/L). The working volume of the contaminated water was
      taken to be 100 ml. The results obtained from this study are shown
      in FIG. 8b. As evident from the data, the uptake capacity
      increased with increase in arsenic concentrations. An adsorption
      capacity of 183 mg/g is observed at initial arsenic concentration
      of 100 mg/L. This shows that the OTBN prepared using the method of
      the present invention has high affinity to arsenic and is better
      than any other aluminum based material reported for arsenic
      removal at similar equilibrium concentrations studied.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In yet other aspects, the present invention provides
      methods for using a granular composite, such as, for example, to
      remove at least a portion of fluoride and/or arsenic that can be
      present in a water source. In such an aspect, the present
      invention can serve as an adsorption media in a water purification
      technology, such as, for example, a water filter. In various
      aspects, the inventive granular composite can reduce the
      concentration of fluoride, arsenic, pathogens, and/or other
      contaminants in a water source.<br>

      glacial acetic acid or HC1 or combination thereof) with vigorous
      stirring. In a general procedure, a solution of aluminum
      precursor, such as aluminum nitrate was added slowly into the
      chitosan solution with vigorous stirring for 60 minutes and was
      kept overnight without agitation. Aqueous ammonia or NaOH solution
      was slowly added into the metal-chitosan solution with vigorous
      stirring to facilitate the precipitation of the metal-chitosan
      composites (pH 7 - 8.0). All these steps were carried out at
      temperature below 30 [deg.]C. Stirring was continued for two
      hours. The precipitate was filtered, washed to remove any unwanted

      [0069] This example describes the use of a mixture of biopolymers
      for the preparation of OTBN through a simple soft chemistry route.
      The biopolymers used for the study are chitosan and cellulose.
      Cellulose powder was added to the chitosan solution (chitosan
      dissolved in 1% acetic acid). The weight ratio of chitosan to
      cellulose is 1: 1. Further, aluminum nitrate solution was added
      slowly into the biopolymer solution with vigorous stirring for 60
      minutes and was kept overnight without agitation. Aqueous ammonia
      or NaOH solution was slowly added into the metal-chitosan solution
      with vigorous stirring to facilitate the precipitation of the

      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0070] This example describes the low temperature synthesis of
      metal ion doped nanoscale- AIOOH through a simple soft chemistry
      route. A mixture of aluminum nitrate and ferric nitrate is
      prepared in the molar ratio of 3: 1 (Al:Fe). The mixture is then
      slowly added into the chitosan solution (prepared in 1-5% nitric
      acid) with vigorous stirring for 60 minutes and was kept overnight
      without agitation. Aqueous ammonia or NaOH solution was slowly
      added into the metal-chitosan solution with vigorous stirring to

      [0071] This example describes the variation in the size of
      nanoscale-[Alpha][Iota][Omicron][Omicron][Eta] by varying the
      ratio of Akchitosan. The quantity of chitosan in the OTBN is
      increased to 40%. The presence of higher quantity of chitosan
      helps in further reducing the size of the
      nanoscale-[Alpha][Iota][Omicron][Omicron][Eta]. A solution of
      aluminum precursor such as aluminum nitrate was added slowly into
      the chitosan solution with vigorous stirring for 60 minutes and
      was kept overnight without agitation. Aqueous ammonia or NaOH
      solution was slowly added into the metal-chitosan solution with

      </b><b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] The present disclosure relates to the field of water
      purification and specifically to compositions and methods related
      to sustained silver release for water purification.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Contamination of drinking water is a major health concern
      across the world, especially in the developing and under-developed
      countries. A number of contaminants affect the water quality
      including biological (e.g. bacteria and virus), inorganic (e.g.
      fluoride, arsenic, iron) and organic (e.g. pesticides, volatile
      organics) species. These contaminants in water are a source of a
      number of diseases for a large population of the world. A
      significant cost burden associated with health effects of the
      contaminated water still rests on the shoulders of the poor. This
      problem can be addressed by developing affordable and effective
      solutions for removal of these contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Silver is widely known for its antibacterial property and
      has been employed as an inorganic silver salt, as an organic
      silver salt and as colloids of its salt, oxide, and in metallic
      states for treatment of contaminated water. Although it is well
      known that silver is a good antibacterial agent, the nature of
      silver present in the water determines its antibacterial
      efficiency. Recently, silver has been extensively used in the form
      of metallic nanoparticles. The antibacterial property of silver
      nanoparticles emerges either from nanoparticle-bacteria surface
      interaction or from released silver ions from nanoparticles or
      both.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Antibacterial property of silver nanoparticles has been
      discussed in a number of patent applications, wherein improvements
      to method of synthesis of silver nanoparticles have been disclosed
      (Pal et. al. in Appl Environ Microbiol, 2007, 73(6), 1712; De
      Windt et. al. in United States Patent Application 20100272770;
      Sastry et. al. in 936/MUM/2008), methods for their synthesis in
      media other than water have been used (Chen et. al. in United
      States Patent 7329301), and methods for loading silver
      nanoparticles on various substrates have been discussed (Rautaray
      et. al. in Indian patent application 1571/MUM/2008). The enhanced
      antibacterial property of silver nanoparticles is due to size
      confinement of silver metal. Although a number of methods have
      been developed for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, keeping
      reactive particles in nanometer size for a long time in real water
      composed of various species is very difficult. This is due to ion
      induced aggregation, surface modification, salt deposition and so
      forth. Therefore, an important requirement while employing
      reactive silver nanoparticles in water purification is size
      stabilization and preventing surface modification over extended
      periods.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another important aspect of use of silver nanoparticles for
      anti-bacterial performance is the fraction of silver ions released
      (quantity of silver ions released/quantity of silver nanoparticle
      used). It is known that although significant quantities of silver
      nanoparticles are used, a small amount of silver ions are released
      into the contaminated water. For example, Hoek et al. (Environ.
      Sci. Technol. 2010, 44, 7321) reported that in reproduced real
      water having total dissolved solids (TDS) of around 340 parts per
      million (ppm), the fraction of dissolved silver is less than 0.1%
      of the total mass of silver added, regardless of the initial
      source, i.e., AgN03 or silver nanoparticles. This phenomenon is
      attributed to the presence of various anions in water, such as
      chlorides (many silver salts have very low solubility). Hence, the
      quantity of silver nanoparticles used in water filters is more
      than the optimum and results in an increase in the filter size and
      the cost of the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The release rate of silver ion from the nanoparticles
      determines how long the nanoparticels can be used as an
      antimicrobial agent. Constant release of silver ions from silver
      nanoparticles for longer time is essential for effective use in
      water filters. This ensures consistent anti-microbial performance
      and release of silver ions below permissible limit as prescribed
      by the World Health Organization (WHO). The rate of silver ion
      release has been discussed in the literature. For example, Epple
      et al. (Chem. Mater. 2010, 22, 4548 and Hurt et al. Environ. Sci.
      Technol. 2010, 44, 2169) demonstrated that the release of silver
      ions from silver nanoparticles in distilled water depends on
      temperature, incubation days, and species present in the water
      such as dissolved oxygen level, salt, and organic matter. The rate
      of dissolution is not constant with time and attains saturation in
      a short period.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Hence, stability of reactive nanoparticles for prolonged
      periods in water is essential for controlled release of silver
      ions. Metal oxides have been widely considered as good substrates.
      Silver nanoparticles have been ex-situ and in-situ loaded in/on
      metal oxides. In-situ loading in metal oxide has shown promising
      stability even at high loading percentage. For example, in-situ
      syntheses of silver nanoparticles in metal oxide matrices have
      been reported earlier. Chen et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009,
      43, 2905 demonstrated the sol-gel synthesis of silver
      nanoparticles (&lt;5 nm) loaded onto Ti02 nanocomposite where Ti02
      particles act as anti-aggregation support and showed that 7.4 wt%
      Ag loading in Ti02 had highly potent antibacterial properties
      against E. coli. Similar results were obtained by the use of rice
      husk ash (Rautaray et. al. 157 l/MUM/2008). Results obtained by
      this group indicates that the leached silver concentration varied
      in a wide range of 1.3 ppb - 65 ppb (measured over a volume of
      3000L).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Various attempts have been made to synthesize silver
      nanoparticles on low-cost substrates. For example, Shankar et al.
      (J Chem Technol Biotechnol. 2008, 83, 1177) loaded silver on
      activated carbon at high silver loading percentage. An optimum of
      9-10.5 wt% of Ag loaded in activated carbon (5 g) is necessary to
      have effective anti-bacterial properties against E. coli
      (concentration: 10&lt;3&gt; CFU/ml) in the contact-mode for up to
      350 L of flowing water (flow rate: 50 mL/min). Accordingly, -0.5 g
      of silver for 350 L of bacteria free water should be used which
      has a cost of lOpaise/liter (US$.0088/gallon) water .<br>
      <br>
      [0009] As described above, current systems fail to address the
      problem of stabilization of silver nanoparticles on a supporting
      matrix. Further, the surface chemistry is altered in controlled
      silver ion release systems over extended periods, thereby
      requiring the use of large quantities of silver. Controlled
      constant silver release determines the long term use,
      effectiveness, and the life time of a device and low cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The above referenced shortcomings are resolved by the
      compositions and methods described herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0011] The compositions and methods described herein, in one
      aspect, relates to water purification. Particularly, the
      disclosure compositions and methods described herein relates to a
      sustained silver release composition for water purification.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] An object of the compositions and methods described herein
      is to provide dissolution of silver ions from silver nanoparticles
      in water, for prolonged use (composition for a sustained silver
      ion release). [0013] Another object of the compositions and
      methods described herein is to increase the volume of water that
      can be treated with silver nanoparticles while maintaining a
      substantially constant concentration of silver ions in the water
      derived from the silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles
      can be loaded on organic polymer-metal oxide/hydroxide
      compositesuch as an organic-templated-boehmite nanoarchitecture
      (OTBN).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Yet another object of the compositions and methods
      described herein is to use organic polymer-metal oxide/hydroxide
      composites as a dual stabilizing agent for the synthesis of highly
      dispersed and stable silver nanoparticles. The silver
      nanoparticles can be antimicrobial, for example antibacterial, at
      a loading of about 0.1-1 wt%.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The compositions and methods described herein release at
      least 10% of the silver present in nanoparticles into the water
      with moderately high TDS from silver nanoparticles loaded OTBN
      over an extended period. An aspect of the compositions and methods
      described herein includes the volume of water treated and time
      independent constant release of silver ion from a Ag-OTBN matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In one aspect, a method is disclosed for preparing an
      adsorbent composition. The method comprises impregnating silver
      nanoparticles on an organic-templated-nanometal oxyhydroxide.
      Particle size of the silver nanoparticles can be less than about
      50 nm. The adsorbent composition has antimicrobial properties in
      water. In an aspect, the organic-templated-nanometal oxyhydroxide
      can be organic-templated-boehmite nanoarchitecture (OTBN).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In the compositions and methods described herein, the
      potent antibacterial material for long term use is obtained when
      silver nanoparticles are synthesized in organic-templated metal
      oxide/hydroxide nanoarchitecture. Stability of silver
      nanoparticles in water for longer time determines its
      antibacterial properties over time. Stable silver nanoparticles
      can be achieved via a in-situ syntheses of the nanoparticles in
      the OTBN matrix. Disclosed herein is an OTBN matrix that enhances
      the antimicrobial (i.e. antibacterial) property of silver
      nanoparticles in water. The matrix controls the size and
      stabilizes the particles from aggregation, and prevents the
      adsorption/deposition/scaling of soluble ligands, organic matters
      and dissolved solids on the silver nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The surface reactivity of silver nanoparticles can be
      maintained by both chitosan and metal oxide/hydroxide. Silver
      nanoparticles encapsulated by chitosan, can be dispersed in metal
      oxide support and vice-versa. The dual stabilization prevents the
      surface modification and also salt deposition over a period of
      time. This is further explained through the material<br>
      characterization studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In one aspect, the compositions disclosed herein can
      contain 0.5 wt% Ag loaded in OTBN with antimicrobial properties.
      For example the compositions and methods can kill 10&lt;5&gt;
      CFU/mL of E.coli in the contact-mode using several hundred liters,
      for example 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700 liters, of flowing
      water at very high flow rate. This is achieved through controlled
      constant release of silver ion for long time, for example 50
      mL/min, 100 mL/min, 200 ml/min, 300 ml/min, 400 ml/min, 500ml/min
      or 1000 ml/min.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one aspect the silver nanoparticles described herein can
      kill 10&lt;5&gt; CFU/mL of E.coli in tap water. In another aspect,
      killing microorganism with the disclosed compositions and methods
      does not require contact between the microorganisms and the
      nanoparticels.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another aspect, a water purification device that
      includes a water filter is disclosed. The water filter can be made
      of an adsorbent composition prepared by impregnating silver
      nanoparticles on an organic-templated-nanometal oxyhydroxide,
      wherein a particle size of the silver nanoparticles is less than
      about 50 nm. The adsorbent composition can kill microorganisms,
      i.e have antimicrobial properties, in water. The water filter can
      be in the form of a candle, a molded porous block, a filter bed
      and a column. In another aspect, the water filter can be in the
      form of a sachet or porous bag.<br>
      <br>

      set forth, in part, in the detailed description and any claims
      which follow, and in part will be derived from the detailed
      description or can be learned by practice of the invention. The
      advantages described below will be realized and attained by means
      of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the
      appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing
      general description and the following detailed description are

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] The present invention can be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description of the invention
      and the examples included therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Before the present compounds, compositions, articles,
      systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it
      is to be understood that they are not limited to specific
      synthetic methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular
      reagents unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary.
      It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is
      for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not
      intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials
      similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the
      practice or testing of the present invention, example methods and
      materials are now described.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by
      reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in
      connection with which the publications are cited.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0036] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific
      terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by
      one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
      Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
      described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the
      present invention, example methods and materials are now
      described.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the
      singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless
      the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
      reference to "a metal" includes mixtures of two or more metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" one
      particular value, and/or to "about" another particular value. When
      such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one
      particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly,
      when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the
      antecedent "about," it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the
      endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation
      to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It
      is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed
      herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as "about"
      that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value "10" is disclosed, then "about 10" is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two
      particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are
      disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As used herein, the terms "optional" or "optionally" means
      that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or
      cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where
      said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Disclosed are the components to be used to prepare the
      compositions of the invention as well as the compositions
      themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These
      and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood
      that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of
      these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of
      each various individual and collective combinations and
      permutation of these compounds cannot be explicitly disclosed,
      each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For
      example, if a particular compound is disclosed and discussed and a
      number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules
      including the compounds are discussed, specifically contemplated
      is each and every combination and permutation of the compound and
      the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated
      to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are
      disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an
      example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if
      each is not individually recited each is individually and
      collectively contemplated meaning combinations, A-E, A-F, B-D,
      B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are considered disclosed. Likewise,
      any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for
      example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C- E would be considered
      disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application
      including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and
      using the compositions of the invention. Thus, if there are a
      variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood
      that each of these additional steps can be performed with any
      specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the methods
      of the invention. [0041] Each of the materials disclosed herein is
      either commercially available and/or the methods for the
      production thereof are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It is understood that the compositions disclosed herein
      have certain functions. Disclosed herein are certain structural
      requirements for performing the disclosed functions and it is
      understood that there are a variety of structures that can perform
      the same function that are related to the disclosed structures,
      and that these structures will typically achieve the same result.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one aspect, synthesis, characterization and application
      of silver nanoparticles
      impregnatedorganic-templated-boehmite-nanoarchitecture (Ag-OTBN)
      are described. Impregnation of silver nanoparticles in OTBN is
      demonstrated using a number of procedures. The as-synthesized
      Ag-OTBN composition is characterized by a number of spectroscopic
      and microscopic techniques. The capability of Ag-OTBN to remove
      microorganisms from drinking water is demonstrated through the use
      of E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage as model organisms for bacteria
      and virus, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The silver nanoparticles can be impregnated in p-block,
      transition and rare-earth metal doped organic template metal
      oxyhydroxide compositions. It should also be noted that it can be
      of mixed metal oxide/hydroxide/oxyhydroxide nanoarchitecture. The
      mixture can be binary or a mixture of all the above mentioned
      metal oxide/hydroxide/oxyhydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In an aspect, the Ag-OTBN defined in the present invention
      can have chitosan polymer to metal oxide/hydroxide weight ratio
      between 5%and 50%. In another aspect, Ag to OTBN weight ratio can
      be between 0.1 to 10 %.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In another aspect, the silver nanoparticles can be
      synthesized in OTBN using any reducing agent at any temperature
      for any application. In one aspect, the reducing agent can be
      ascorbic acid, tri sodium citrate, dextrose, hydrazine, etc., and
      at a temperature between 40 to 200[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG 1 illustrates the scheme 100 utilized for the
      preparation of granular composite of silver nanoparticles loaded
      metal oxyhydroxide particles-biopolymer. Steps 101-106 have been
      described in the PCT application PCT/IB2011/001551 by Pradeep et
      al.\, its entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by
      reference. The filtered composite gel 106 is thereafter
      homogeneously dispersed in distilled water. Silver precursor
      solution 107 is then added to metal oxyhydroxide
      particles-biopolymer composite 106. Metal oxyhydroxide
      particles-biopolymer composite 106 and silver ions of silver
      precursor solution 107 interact with each other through a number
      of functional groups to obtain silver ion complexed metal
      oxyhydroxide particles- biopolymer composite 108. Further,
      reducing agent 109 is added to 108. Upon addition of reducing
      agent 109, silver particles in the precursor solution 107undergo
      reduction and nucleate on metal oxyhydroxide particles-biopolymer
      composite 108 to form silver nanoparticles loaded metal
      oxyhydroxide particles-biopolymer composite. Eventually, a semi
      solid precipitate 110 is obtained, which is washed with copious
      amounts of water and is dried at a temperature between 30-60
      [deg.]C.<br>

      [0048] FIG. 2 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of an
      organic-templated-boehmite nanoarchitecture (OTBN) and silver
      nanoparticles loaded OTBN are shown, in accordance with various
      aspects of the present disclosure. In FIG. 2, the peaks marked by
      * correspond to the organic template i.e., chitosan.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The as-synthesized OTBN shows peaks corresponding to (120),
      (013), (051), (151), (200), (231) and (251) planes (refer to curve
      (a)). These peaks can be indexed as orthorhombic- AIOOH (JCPDS
      21-1307). The broadened XRD peaks imply that the crystallite size
      of OTBN particles is very small. The mean crystallite size
      calculated from the Scherrer formula shows that nanocrystals have
      an average size of 3.5 nm. The presence of organic template (i.e.,
      chitosan) can also been seen in the XRD data. The peaks marked by
      * in FIG.2 corresponding to 2[Theta] (in degrees) = 18.7[deg.],
      20.6[deg.], and 41.2[deg.] are attributed to the presence of the
      organic template. It is clear that there is a definite difference
      in the full-width at half maxima (FWHM) for the peaks
      corresponding to AIOOH and organic template.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Upon impregnation of silver nanoparticles in the OTBN,
      there are no new peaks observed in the diffraction pattern (refer
      to curve (b)). This is attributed to the low loading percentage of
      silver nanoparticles and homogeneous distribution of silver
      nanoparticles in OTBN. Comparing the diffraction peaks of OTBN and
      silver nanoparticles impregnated OTBN, a negative shift in the
      2[Theta] value is observed. The interplanar distance of OTBN
      increases after loading of silver nanoparticles. This is a clear
      evidence of the loading of an external material which increases
      the interplanar spacing. [0051] FIG. 3 shows high-resolution
      transmission electron microscopic(HRTEM) micrographs of silver
      nanoparticles loaded OTBN system and an energy-dispersive X-ray
      (ED AX) spectrum of silver nanoparticles loaded OTBN, in
      accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.
      FIG.3(a) to 3(c) show HRTEM micrographs of Ag nanoparticles loaded
      OTBN system and spectrum 3(d) shows the EDAX spectrum of Ag
      nanoparticles loaded OTBN.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In order to determine the interaction between OTBN and
      silver nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles impregnated OTBN matrix
      was analyzed under transmission electron microscope. The TEM image
      shows the three components i.e., silver nanoparticles, organic
      polymers and metal oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles in the Ag-OTBN.
      The OTBN matrix stabilizes the silver nanoparticles from
      aggregation, which results in the homogenous distribution of
      silver nanoparticles in the matrix. It is clear from the TEM
      images that homogenously sized silver nanoparticles are anchored
      in the organic polymer-metal oxide/hydroxide nanoparticle matrix
      (pictures (b) and (c)) and the silver nanoparticles are of 5-10 nm
      in size (picture (c)). The sheetlike organic polymer chitosan is
      seen clearly (Figs 3 (a), (b) and (c)). Such homogeneity is
      difficult in unprotected silver nanoparticles. Typically,
      homogeneity is brought about by monolayer protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] This HRTEM of the composition also shows that silver
      nanoparticles are trapped in the biopolymer-metal oxyhydroxide
      cages. This allows nanoparticles to be preserved by reducing
      contact with the scale forming chemical species while allowing
      sufficient interaction with water, which results in sustained
      release of Ag&lt;+&gt;ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Graph (d) shows the EDAX spectrum measured from the area
      shown in picture (b). From this,the presence of silver is
      confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 4 shows EDAX elemental imaging of silver nanoparticles
      loaded OTBN matrix, in accordance with various aspects of the
      present disclosure. In FIG. 4, the top left extreme is the TEM
      image and others are elemental maps from the region.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] EDAX coupled with TEM was used to image the elemental
      mapping of Ag loaded OTBN. Elements present in the Ag-OTBN such as
      C, N, O, Al and Ag were mapped. The presence of three components
      i.e., chitosan (C, N and O), boehmite (Al and O) and silver
      nanoparticles (Ag) was confirmed. [0057] FIG. 5 shows the SEM
      micrograph of silver nanoparticles loaded OTBN and its chemical
      composition. Silver nanoparticles are not visible on the surface
      of the composition (note: particles of similar size (10-30 nm)
      from substrate (Indium tin oxide) are clearly observable in the
      highlighted red circle) (FIG. 5(a)). This confirms that silver
      nanoparticles are embedded and well-protected in the OTBN matrix.
      Granular form of the composition is also visible (FIG. 5(b)).
      Elemental composition confirms the presence of essential elements:
      carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, aluminum and silver (FIG. 5(c)). Insets
      show the elemental composition for an illustrative silver
      nanoparticles impregnated OTBN and expanded region of ED AX
      spectrum around 3 keV, confirming the presence of silver (note:
      carbon content is higher due to presence of conducting carbon tape
      in the background).<br>

      [0058] FIG. 6 shows an antibacterial activity of silver
      nanoparticles loaded OTBN tested in batch mode, in accordance with
      various aspects of the present disclosure. In FIG. 6 curve (a)
      depicts the input E. coli concentration and curve (b) depicts the
      output E. coli concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The Ag-OTBN material as explained in example 1 was used for
      batch study. As explained in the example 7, the antibacterial
      activity was tested for batch mode. FIG. 6 shows the antibacterial
      efficiency of Ag-OTBN with number of trials. Curve (a) in shows
      the input concentration of E. coli and curve (b) shows the number
      of E. coli colonies after 1 hour of shaking. It is confirmed from
      curve (b) that the Ag-OTBN completely kills the E. coli present in
      the water. For up to 30 trials, complete killing of E. coli was
      seen. It should be noted that the number of trials or the output
      E. coli counts do not indicate the saturation point of the Ag-OTBN
      material, but show the continuous release of silver ions at
      constant rate. It should also be noted that the concentration of
      released silver ions from silver nanoparticles is higher under
      shaking for an hour. The antibacterial activity of Ag-OTBN in
      batch mode indirectly demonstrates the promising long-time
      antibacterial activity of Ag-OTBN in column mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The material was also tested for antibacterial study
      without contact mode. The 100 mL of the shaken water was filtered
      and 1 x 10&lt;5&gt;CFU/mL of bacterial load was added to the
      water. It was plated as described in the foregoing specification.
      The performance of the material tested without contact mode is
      similar to the material tested with contact mode (data not shown).
      It showed that the antibacterial property is due to the released
      silver ions from silver nanoparticles. [0061] FIG. 7 depicts an
      antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles loaded OTBN tested
      in column mode, in accordance with various aspects of the present
      disclosure. In FIG. 7, curve (a) depicts the input E. coli
      concentration and curve (b) depicts the output E. coli
      concentration.As explained in the example 8, the antibacterial
      activity was tested for a column filled with Ag- OTBN. FIG. 7
      shows the antibacterial efficiency of Ag-OTBN with volume of
      contaminated water passed. Curve (a) in Fig6 shows the input
      concentration of 10&lt;5&gt; CFU/mL E. coli and curve (b) shows
      the number of surviving E. coli colonies after filtration. Curve
      (b) shows that the Ag- OTBN material kills E. coli for 1500 L at
      1000 mL/min flow rate. It should be noted that complete killingwas
      observed at 10 mL/min, 100 mL/min and 1000 mL/min flow rate,
      separately. Hence, the present invention demonstrates that the
      complete killing of E. coli at the concentration of ~10&lt;5&gt;
      CFU/mL can be achieved using Ag-OTBN material even at very high
      flow rate such as -1000 mL/min.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 8 depicts inductively coupled plasma optical emission
      spectrometer(ICP-OES) data for silver ion leaching in E. coli
      contaminated water, in accordance with various aspects of the
      present disclosure. In FIG. 8,curve (a) shows the allowed silver
      ion concentration in drinking water as per WHO norms and curve (b)
      shows the released silver ion concentration in output water, in
      accordance with an aspect of the present invention.<br>
      [0063] The Ag-OTBN material as explained in example 1 was used for
      column study. As explained in the example 8, the antibacterial
      activity was tested for Ag-OTBN in column mode. E. coli
      concentration of lxl 0&lt;5&gt; CFU/mL was periodically spiked in
      challenge water at the passage of 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250 and
      1500L. Contaminated water was passed at a flow rate of 10- 2000
      mL/min, preferably at 1000 mL/min. At regular intervals, the
      microbial de-contaminated output water was collected. Quantitative
      detection of concentration of silver ions released from the
      Ag-OTBN material was performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma
      Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). FIG. 8 shows the relation
      between the concentration of silver ions released into the
      contaminated challenge water and the volume of water passed. Curve
      (a) in FIG. 8 shows the allowed silver ion concentration in
      drinking water and curve (b) shows the released silver ion
      concentration from Ag-OTBN. FIG. 8 shows that silver ions are
      continuously released into the contaminated challenge water at a
      constant rate and the concentration found was significantly below
      the permitted level of silver ions in drinking water. The present
      invention demonstrates that the silver ions released from Ag-OTBN
      into the challenge water areenough for killing all E. coli present
      in the water. From the ICP-OES, it was found that more than 10% of
      silver from Ag-OTBN released into water upon passage of 1500L of
      challenge water.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 9 shows an antiviral activity of silver nanoparticles
      loaded OTBN tested in batch mode, in accordance with various
      aspects of the present disclosure. In FIG. 9, curve (a) depicts
      the input MS2 coliphage concentration and curve (b) depicts the
      output MS2 coliphage concentration. The Ag-OTBN material as
      explained in example 1 was used for batch study and the antiviral
      activity was tested as explained in the example 9. FIG. 9 shows
      the antiviral efficiency of Ag-OTBN with number of trials. Curve
      (a) in Fig8 shows the input concentration of MS2 coliphage and
      curve (b) shows the number of MS2 coliphage plaques after 1 hour
      of shaking. It is confirmed from curve (b) that the MS2 coliphage
      is completely removed from the water. For up to 35 trials,
      complete removal of MS2 coliphage was observed. It should be noted
      that the number of trials or the output counts do not indicate the
      saturation point of the Ag- OTBN material, but show the continuous
      performance of its antiviral property. Antiviral activity of
      Ag-OTBN in batch mode indirectly demonstrates the promising
      long-time performance of Ag- OTBN in column mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In an aspect of the present invention, a method for
      preparing an antimicrobial composition for water purification is
      provided. Silver nanoparticles are impregnated on an
      organic-templated-nanometal oxyhydroxide, such as OTBN. The
      particle size of the silver nanoparticles is preferably less than
      about 50 nm. Sizes include, but are not limited to, less than
      50nm, 40nm, 30nm, 20nm, lOnm, and 5nm. The antimicrobial
      composition is used for killing microorganisms in water as
      explained in the foregoing specification. The silver ions are
      impregnated with OTBN in gel or solid states. The method also
      includes reduction of the silver ions to a zerovalent state by
      using a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride, ascorbic acid,
      tri-sodium citrate, hydrazine hydrate or combinations thereof. In
      an aspect, the concentration of the reducing agent is kept in the
      range of about 0.001 M to about 1 M. In a preferred aspect, the
      concentration of the reducing agent is kept at 0.001 M to 0.05 M.
      Further, organic templates such as chitosan, banana silk and
      cellulose can be used. The invention supports following
      precursors: silver nitrate, silver fluoride, silver acetate,
      silver sulfate, silver nitrite and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one aspect, the compositions and methods release for
      silver ion into water for a prolonged period of time. For example,
      the compositions and methods can release a silver ions at a
      constant or substantially constant rate for at least 1 day, 1
      week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or 3 years.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In another aspect, a water purification system that
      includes a filter prepared by the method described herein is
      provided. The filter can be realized in the form of a candle, a
      molded porous block, a filter bed and a column. In another aspect,
      a water purification system can comprise the compositions
      described herein, for example, a silver impregnated boehmite
      structure, disposed in a sachet or porous bag, such that the
      sachet can be placed in contaminated water and the water allowed
      to flow through the sachet to contact the composition. A skilled
      artisan will appreciate that such forms of filters are well known
      in the art and their description has been omitted so as not to
      obfuscate the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The described aspects are illustrative of the compositions
      and methods and are not restrictive. Modifications of design,
      methods, structure, sequence, materials and the like that are
      apparent to those skilled in the art, also fall within the scope
      of the compositions and methods described herein.<br>

      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0069] The identification of the phase(s) of the as-prepared
      sample was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (using D8
      Discover of Bruker AXS, USA) using Cu-[Kappa][alpha] radiation at
      [lambda] = 1.5418 A. Surface examination was carried out using
      Field Emission Scanning Electron<br>
      Microscope (using FEI Nova NanoSEM 600 instrument). For this, the
      sample was re-suspended in water by sonication for 10 minutes and
      drop-casted on an indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass. The
      sample was subsequently dried. Surface morphology, elemental
      analysis and elemental mapping studies were carried out using a
      Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive
      Analysis of X-rays (EDAX) (using FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron
      microscope). Granular composition was imaged by attaching it on a
      conducting carbon tape. High resolution Transmission Electron
      Microscopy (HRTEM) images of the sample were obtained with JEM
      3010 (JEOL, Japan). The samples prepared as above were spotted on
      amorphous carbon films supported on copper grids and dried at room
      temperature. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was
      performed using ESCA Probe TPD of Omicron Nanotechnology.
      Polychromatic Mg Ka was used as the X-ray source (hv = 1253.6 eV).
      Spectra in the required binding energy range were collected and an
      average was taken. Beam induced damage of the sample was reduced
      by adjusting the X-ray flux. Binding energy was calibrated with
      respect to C Is at 284.5 eV. Silver ion concentration in the water
      was detected using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
      spectrometry (ICP-OES).<br>

      [0071] This example describes the in-situ impregnation of silver
      nanoparticles on OTBN. In an aspect, OTBN was prepared as reported
      in the previous Indian patent application 1529/CHE/2010, entire
      contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The OTBN

      nitrate, silver fluoride, silver acetate, silver permanganate,
      silver sulfate, silver nitrite, silver bromate, silver salicylate
      or any combination of the above) was added drop-wise. The weight

      stirring the solution overnight, 10 mM sodium borohydride was
      added to the solution drop wise (in ice-cold condition,
      temperature &lt; 5[deg.] C). Thereafter, the solution was allowed
      to stir for half an hour, filtered and washed with copious amount
      of water. The obtained gel was then dried at room temperature.<br>

      washing the salt content was used for the impregnation of silver
      nanoparticles. The OTBN gel was again re-dispersed in water, to
      which 1 mM silver nanoparticles solution (prepared by any route
      reported in the literature) was added drop-wise. The weight ratio
      of Ag to OTBN can be varied anywhere between 0.1-1.5%. After
      stirring the solution overnight, it was filtered and washed with
      copious amount of water. The obtained gel is then dried at room

      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><br>
      <br>
      [0074] This example describes the ex-situ impregnation of silver
      nanoparticles on OTBN powder. In an aspect, the dried OTBN powder
      was crushed to a particle size of 100-150 [mu][iota][eta]. The
      powder was stirred in water, using a shaker. 1 mM silver
      nanoparticles solution (prepared by any route reported in the
      literature) was added drop-wise. The weight ratio of Ag to OTBN

      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0075] The organic templated metal oxyhydroxide/oxide/hydroxide
      matrix defined in the methods and compositions described herein,
      is such that the metal is chosen from amongst p- block, transition
      and rare-earth metal series. The metal precursor can be Fe(II),
      Fe(III), Al(III), Si(IV), Ti(IV), Ce(IV), Zn(II), La(III), Mn(II),
      Mn(III), Mn(IV), Cu(II) or a combination thereof. And the metal
      oxide/hydroxide/oxyhydroxide nanoparticle may serve as an inert
      filler material or an active filtration medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] This example describes the silver nanoparticles
      impregnation in p-block, transitionand rare-earth metal doped
      organic templated metal oxyhydroxide composition (as disclosed in
      the previous Indian patent application 1529/CHE/2010, entire
      contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). P-block,
      transition and rare-earth metals were chosen from the following:
      aluminum, manganese, iron, titanium, zinc, zirconium, lanthanum,
      cerium, silicon. The synthesis procedure for composition is as
      follows: the chosen metal (eg: La) salt was mixed with the ferric
      nitrate salt solution in an appropriate ratio, preferably 1 :9
      (wt/wt). The salt solution was added slowly to the chitosan
      solution (dissolved in 1 - 5 % glacial acetic acid or HC1 or
      combination thereof) with vigorous stirring for 60 minutes and was
      kept overnight.<br>
      <br>
      Aqueous ammonia or NaOH solution was slowly added into the
      La-Fe-chitosan solution with vigorous stirring to facilitate the
      precipitation of the metal-chitosan composites. Stirring was
      continued for two hours. The precipitate was filtered, washed to
      remove any unwanted impurities and dried.<br>
      [0077] The as-synthesized precipitategel was again re-dispersed in
      water, to which 1 mM silver precursor was added drop-wise. The
      weight ratio of Ag to OTBN can be varied anywhere between
      0.1-1.5%. After stirring the solution overnight, 10 mM sodium
      borohydride was added to the solution drop-wise (in ice-cold
      condition). Thereafter, the solution was allowed to stir for half
      an hour, filtered and washed with copious amount of water. The
      obtained gel was then dried at room temperature.<br>

      is similar to that described in example 5, with a change that gel
      or dried powder obtained after silver nanoparticles impregnation
      is soaked with metal precursor chosen from p-block, transition and
      rare-earth metal series.<br>

      <b>Example 7</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0079] This example describes the testing protocol in batch for
      antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles impregnated OTBN
      composition. In an aspect, 100 mL of water was shaken with the
      material and 1 x 10&lt;5&gt; CFU/mL of bacterial load was added to
      the water. Challenge water having the specific ions concentration
      similar to prescribed by US NSF for contaminant removal claim was

      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] The present technology generally relates to quantum
      clusters. In particular, the present technology refers to quantum
      clusters made of gold or silver. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0003] Quantum clusters are materials having very few atoms; with
      core sizes in the sub-nanometer range and which exhibit novel
      properties. Compared to metal nanoparticles, quantum clusters do
      not have a continuous density of states but are characterized by
      discrete electronic energy levels. Quantum clusters act as a
      bridge between atomic and nanoparticle behaviors and therefore
      exhibit properties different from both these.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0004] In one aspect, a composition is provided including a
      quantum cluster with Agm, Au", or AgmAun where m and n are from 2
      to 100, one or more protector molecules and a molecular cavity
      partially or wholly surrounding the quantum cluster. In some
      embodiments, the protector molecule is a thiol. In some
      embodiments, thiol is glutathione, cysteine, mercaptosuccinic
      acid, dimercaptosuccinic acid, phenylethane thiol and other
      aliphatic and aromatic thiols. In some embodiments, the molecular

      embodiments, the methods includes removing the first solvent,
      wherein the composition does not luminesce, or exhibits a
      luminescence of reduced intensity, after the first solvent is
      removed. In some embodiments, removing the solvent includes
      exposing the substrate to a second solvent, wherein the second
      solvent does not produce a luminescent response from the
      composition, and contacting the substrate with the second solvent
      quenches the luminescent response induced by the first solvent. In
      some embodiments, the removing includes allowing the first solvent
      to evaporate from the substrate. The method can further comprise
      detecting the presence or absence of the luminescent response.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof. The
      illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description,
      drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other
      embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made,
      without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter
      presented here. The present technology is also illustrated by the
      examples herein, which should not be construed as limiting in any
      way.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In general, compositions are provided which include Agm,
      Au", or AgmAun quantum clusters are provided by combining
      host-guest chemistry with core- etching. Such compositions exhibit
      luminescence that is dependent upon the environment in which the
      quantum cluster is located. Such compositions may also be useful
      in authentification processes. The compositions, devices, and
      methods are all described in greater detail below. As used herein,
      "core etching" refers to treatment of the metal quantum clusters
      with excess of protector molecules. As used herein, "host-guest
      chemistry" refers to partial or whole containment of the metal
      quantum clusters in the molecular cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one aspect, compositions including Agm, Au", or AgmAun
      quantum clusters are provided. In some embodiments, the
      composition includes one or more protector molecules surrounding
      the metal atoms, and m and n are from 2 to 100. In some
      embodiments, n is from 5 to 50, or from 10 to 20. In some
      embodiments, n is 15. Specific examples of n include 2, 3, 4, 5,
      10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and ranges
      between any two of these values. In some embodiments, the quantum
      cluster comprises Au". In other embodiments, the quantum cluster
      comprises Agm.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In some embodiments, the protector molecule is a thiol. The
      protector molecule can bind to the surface of the quantum cluster,
      thereby forming a layer partially or fully around the cluster and
      protecting the cluster. In some embodiments, the protector
      molecules may include glutathione (GSH), cysteine, homocysteine,
      mercaptosuccinic acid, dimercaptosuccinic acid, phenylethane
      thiol, or other alkyl or aryl thiols. Generally, where the
      protector molecule is a mono thiol, it will reduce the
      Au&lt;3+&gt; to Au&lt;1+&gt;. Further reduction may be carried out
      by the addition of a reducing agent. In contrast, where the
      protector molecule is a dithiol, for example the
      dimercaptosuccinic acid, one of the thiol groups will act as
      reducing agent (i.e. one of the groups is oxidized) and the other
      will act as a protecting agent (i.e. it is reduced). In some
      embodiments, the protector molecule is a reduced form of the
      protector molecule; such as reduced glutathione. Clusters of Au
      atoms with the glutathione ligand (-SG) may be represented as
      Au@SG for convenience.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In some embodiments, a molecular cavity partially or wholly
      surrounds the metal cluster with the protector molecule, e.g.,
      Au@SG. Such molecular cavities may include one or more molecules
      of cyclodextrin, calixirane, or a crown ether. In addition, it may
      be possible to create cluster compositions within other molecular
      cavities such as PAMAM, BSA, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Cyclodextrins are a family of compounds made up of sugar
      molecules bound together in a ring. In some embodiments, [alpha]-,
      [beta]-, or [gamma]-cyclodextrin ([alpha]-, [beta]-, or [gamma]-
      CD) molecules are used to form the cluster composition represented
      as Au@aCD, Au15@pCD or AU15@YCD. Cyclodextrins are bowl-shaped
      molecules which may "trap" or "encapsulate" other molecules of an
      appropriate size which will fit into the bowl.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As noted, the above compositions exhibit luminescence. Such
      luminescence may be medium-dependent, liquid solvent-dependent, or
      solvent vapor-dependent. For example, when the composition is
      exposed to some media, the luminescence is increased. In some
      embodiments, the solvent is, but not limited to, an alcohol,
      methanol, ethanol, or propanol; water; acetonitrile; acetone;
      dichloromethane; carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; toluene;
      hexane; or a mixture of any two or more thereof. In some cases, it
      is observed that the more hydrogen bonding between the cluster
      ligands and the solvent, the greater the luminescence.
      Accordingly, the luminescence of the composition in the presence
      of either methanol or ethanol is greater than that for propanol.
      In some embodiments, where the composition is placed in water,
      luminescent emission at 318 nm, 458 nm and 580 nm is observed<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In another aspect a method of preparing the compositions is
      provided. In one embodiment, a gold or silver salt is mixed with
      the thiol protector molecule to precipitate a protected metal
      cluster, . In some embodiments, where it is a gold slat that is
      used, and the protector molecule is glutathione, the cluster
      particles (referred to as Au@SG) may be precipitated from the
      mixture in the presence of a reducing agent. It is understood that
      gold salts such as HAuCL^FkO, AuCl3, or other trivalent gold salts
      may be used in the methods. Suitable reducing agents include, but
      are not limited to NaBFLj and L1BH4, as well as other known
      reducing agents, or a mixture of any two or more reducing agents.
      In some embodiments, the amount of gold or silver salt to
      protector molecule ranges from about 1 :2 to about 1 :8. In other
      embodiments, the metal cluster has formula Agm, Aun, or AgmAun
      where m and n are from 2 to 100. In some embodiments, n is from 5
      to 50, or from 10 to 20. Specific examples of n include 2, 3, 4,
      5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and ranges
      between any two of these values. In some embodiments, n is 15. In
      some embodiments, n is from 5 to 50, or from 10 to 20. Specific
      examples of n include 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60,
      70, 80, 90, 100, and ranges between any two of these values. In
      some embodiments, n is 15.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      [0034] After preparation of the protected metal cluster, it is
      then mixed with the molecule that is to form the molecular cavity
      to form the composition of the protected metal cluster partially
      or fully surrounded by the molecular cavity. For example, where
      the protected metal cluster is Au@SG, it may be processed with an
      a-, [beta]-, or [gamma]-cyclodextrin (CD) molecule to form the
      cluster composition, Aui5@CD. In one embodiment, the Au@SG
      precipitate is dissolved in aqueous solution and mixed with CD and
      excess GSH. The Au15@CD cluster composition may be collected from
      the solution by any known method of separation. Such separation
      may include centrifugation in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In another aspect, a device is provided which includes any
      one of the above compositions deposited on a substrate. Suitable
      substrates include, but are not limited to Si02, glass, conducting
      glass, quartz, silicon or functionalized polymers. For example, in
      one embodiment, the substrate is a thin layer chromatography (TLC)
      plate coated with a S1O2 stationary phase. In other embodiments,
      the substrate is a chitosan, a carbon nanotube, activated carbon,
      alumina, or the like. Such substrates may be sequestered on a
      surface, or the substrate may be a powder or suspension. In some
      embodiments, the cluster compositions are uniformly coated on the
      substrate. In some embodiments, the cluster compositions are
      coated on the substrate in a pattern. The devices coated with the
      compositions exhibit a solvent- or medium- dependent luminescence
      as described above for the compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Any solvent may be used to produce luminescence including
      methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, water, acetonitrile, acetone,
      dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, toluene, hexane
      or a mixture. As used herein, "solvent" may be a liquid solvent or
      solvent vapors.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In some embodiments, the luminescence of the substrate may
      be reduced or eliminated when the solvent is removed by either
      evaporation of the first solvent or exposure to a second solvent.
      In some embodiments, exposure to a first solvent produces
      luminescence of a cluster composition coated substrate and
      exposure to a second solvent quenches the luminescence. In some
      embodiments, the intensity of the luminescence is a dependant on
      the concentration of the solvent. In some embodiments, a device
      which includes a cluster composition coated substrate may be used
      to monitor or identify solvent vapors in the air. The cluster
      composition may also be used for the selective detection of metal
      ions as described in Example 8.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;[0038] Useful information about a product may be contained
      in a label including the cluster compositions. In some
      embodiments, a labeling system is provided having a substrate
      coated with the cluster compositions in a pattern and the pattern
      is luminescent when exposed to solvents. The labeling system may
      also include a detection system or means for detecting the pattern
      on the substrate, or it may be observed visually. The pattern on
      the substrate may include letters, numbers, symbols, pictures or
      barcodes that can capture information. The substrate may be
      attached to currency, financial and legal documents, shipping
      containers, electronics, medical device, pharmaceutical packaging,
      packaging on consumer items, biological compounds or other items
      that should be labeled. For example, the composition may be used
      to label an article or an object, either with a physical label, or
      through direct application of the composition to form a label. In
      some embodiments, the label is invisible to naked eye, but when
      exposed to a substance, such as a solvent liquid or vapor, the
      luminescence of the composition is altered, and the label may be
      visualized.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The detection system or "means for detecting" may be a
      device that can capture the luminescent pattern including a
      camera, a UV-Vis detector, a scanner, and the like. As used
      herein, "coating" of the cluster compositions is understood to
      include attachment, embedment or other means of binding or
      association. <br>
      <br>
      [0040] In some embodiments, the cluster composition is used in a
      method for authentication. The cluster composition may be coated
      on an object in a particular pattern where the authenticity of the
      object is encoded in the pattern. When the object is exposed to a
      solvent, the pattern becomes luminescent and the luminescence
      intensity is reduced when the solvent is removed. In some
      embodiments, the pattern will be detected with a device such as a
      camera, UV-Vis detector or the human eye upon contact with the
      solvent, but the pattern is not detectable, or it is invisible to
      the naked eye in the absence of the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0041 ] In some embodiments, the object may be any item that may
      need authentication such as currency, financial or legal document,
      a shipping container, an electronic object, medical device,
      pharmaceutical packaging, an envelope, packaging or other item. In
      some embodiments, authenticity of the object will be verified by
      checking the presence or absence of the pattern of luminescence.
      Thus, in one embodiment, a method of authentication includes
      exposing a patterned coating to a solvent, where the patterned
      coating includes a composition as described above. The method also
      includes detecting the patterned coating. In such methods, the
      coating is luminescent when exposed to the solvent and is not
      luminescent when the solvent is removed; and the patterned coating
      encodes the authenticity of an object to which the coating is
      applied. The method may also then include verifying the
      authenticity of the object. Such authentifications may include the
      patterned coating being in the form of letters, numbers, symbols,
      pictures, or barcodes. Thus, the verification may be based upon
      coding, a standard message, or the like.<br>

      [0042] As used herein, the following definitions of terms shall
      apply unless otherwise indicated.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As used herein, "about" will be understood by persons of
      ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent depending
      upon the context in which it is used. If there are uses of the
      term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art,
      given the context in which it is used, "about" will mean up to
      plus or minus 10% of the particular term.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The use of the terms "a" and "an" and "the" and similar
      referents in the context of describing the elements (especially in
      the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover
      both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated
      herein or clearly contradicted by context. Recitation of ranges of
      values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method
      of referring individually to each separate value falling within
      the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate
      value is incorporated into the specification as if it were
      individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be
      performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein
      or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and
      all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., "such as") provided
      herein, is intended merely to better illuminate the embodiments
      and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the claims unless
      otherwise stated. No language in the specification should be
      construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential.
      [0045] The embodiments, illustratively described herein may
      suitably be practiced in the absence of any element or elements,
      limitation or limitations, not specifically disclosed herein.
      Thus, for example, the terms "comprising," "including,"
      "containing," etc. shall be read expansively and without
      limitation.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the terms and expressions employed herein have been
      used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is
      no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding
      any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions
      thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are
      possible within the scope of the claimed technology. Additionally,
      the phrase "consisting essentially of will be understood to
      include those elements specifically recited and those additional
      elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel
      characteristics of the claimed technology. The phrase "consisting
      of excludes any element not specified.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As used herein, "thiols" are compounds with an "SH"
      functional group represented by R-SH where R may be H, an alkyl,
      or aryl group.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Alkyl groups include straight chain, branched chain, or
      cyclic alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or, in some
      embodiments, from 1 to 12, 1 to 8, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
      Examples of straight chain alkyl groups include those with from 1
      to 8 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl,
      n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, and n-octyl groups. Examples of
      branched alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, isopropyl,
      iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, isopentyl, and
      2,2-dimethylpropyl groups. Representative substituted alkyl groups
      may be substituted one or more times with substituents such as
      those listed above. Where the term haloalkyl is used, the alkyl
      group is substituted with one or more halogen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Cycloalkyl groups are cyclic alkyl groups such as, but not
      limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl,
      cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl groups. In some embodiments, the
      cycloalkyl group has 3 to 8 ring members, whereas in other
      embodiments the number of ring carbon atoms range from 3 to 5, 3
      to 6, or 3 to 7.<br>
      <br>
      Cycloalkyl groups further include mono-, bicyclic and polycyclic
      ring systems, such as, for example bridged cycloalkyl groups as
      described below, and fused rings, such as, but not limited to,
      decalinyl, and the like. In some embodiments, polycyclic
      cycloalkyl groups have three rings. Substituted cycloalkyl groups
      may be substituted one or more times with, non-hydrogen and
      non-carbon groups as defined above. However, substituted
      cycloalkyl groups also include rings that are substituted with
      straight or branched chain alkyl groups as defined above.
      Representative substituted cycloalkyl groups may be
      mono-substituted or substituted more than once, such as, but not
      limited to, 2,2-, 2,3-, 2,4- 2,5- or 2,6-disubstituted cyclohexyl
      groups, which may be substituted with substituents such as those
      listed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Aryl, or arene, groups are cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
      that do not contain heteroatoms. Aryl groups include monocyclic,
      bicyclic and polycyclic ring systems. Thus, aryl groups include,
      but are not limited to, phenyl, azulenyl, heptalenyl,
      biphenylenyl, indacenyl, fluorenyl, phenanthrenyl, triphenylenyl,
      pyrenyl, naphthacenyl, chrysenyl, biphenyl, anthracenyl, indenyl,
      indanyl, pentalenyl, and naphthyl groups. In some embodiments,
      aryl groups contain 6-14 carbons, and in others from 6 to 12 or
      even 6-10 carbon atoms in the ring portions of the groups.
      Although the phrase "aryl groups" includes groups containing fused
      rings, such as fused aromatic-aliphatic ring systems (e.g.,
      indanyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, and the like), it does not include
      aryl groups that have other groups, such as alkyl or halo groups,
      bonded to one of the ring members. Rather, groups such as tolyl
      are referred to as substituted aryl groups. Representative
      substituted aryl groups may be mono- substituted or substituted
      more than once. For example, monosubstituted aryl groups include,
      but are not limited to, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-substituted phenyl or
      naphthyl groups, which may be substituted with substituents such
      as those listed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In general, "substituted" refers to a group, as defined
      above (e.g., an alkyl or aryl group) in which one or more bonds to
      a hydrogen atom contained therein are replaced by a bond to
      non-hydrogen or non-carbon atoms. Substituted groups also include
      groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s)
      atom are replaced by one or more bonds, including double or triple
      bonds, to a heteroatom. Thus, a substituted group will be
      substituted with one or more substituents, unless otherwise
      specified. In some embodiments, a substituted group is substituted
      with 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 substituents. Examples of substituent
      groups include: halogens (i.e., F, CI, Br, and I); hydroxyls;
      alkoxy, alkenoxy, alkynoxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, carbonyls(oxo),
      carboxyls, esters, urethanes, thiols, sulfides, sulfoxides,
      sulfones, sulfonyls, sulfonamides, amines, isocyanates,
      isothiocyanates, cyanates, thiocyanates, nitro groups, nitriles
      (i.e., CN), and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0051 ] The present technology, thus generally described, will be
      understood more readily by reference to the following example,
      which is provided by way of illustration and is not intended to
      limit the present technology.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLES<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Example 1. Synthesis of Au@SG. To a 50 mL methanolic
      solution (0.5 mM) of HAuC-4.3H20, 1.0 mM GSH was added (1 :2 molar
      ratio, total volume of methanol was 50 mL). The mixture was cooled
      to 0 [deg.]C in an ice bath for 30 minutes. An aqueous solution of
      NaBHt (0.2 M, 12.5 mL), cooled to 0[deg.]C, was injected rapidly
      into the above mixture under vigorous stirring. The mixture was
      allowed to react for another hour. The resulting precipitate was
      collected and washed repeatedly with methanol through centrifugal
      precipitation. Finally, the Au@SG precipitate was dried and
      collected as a dark brown powder. The size of Au@SG particles was
      in the range of2-3 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Example 2. Cyclodextrin assisted synthesis of Au15
      clusters. The above nanoparticles (50 mg) were dissolved in 40 mL
      of de-ionized water containing 1.6 mole of GSH and 2.2x10^ mole of
      cyclodextrin (the three CD molecules were used separately). The
      mixture was heated at 70[deg.]C for 48 hours. The completion of
      the reaction was monitored by checking the red emission of the
      cluster under UV light. Intense red emission from the sample
      indicates the formation of the desired cluster. The entire
      solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The whitish
      brown precipitate of Au(l)thiolate was discarded. The supernatant
      was then transferred to a plastic vial and freeze dried to obtain
      a brown powder with intense red emission in the solid state. The
      same method was used for all the three CD molecules ([alpha]-,
      [beta]-, and [gamma]-cyclodextrin) resulting in three separate
      cluster products. The material was washed twice with ethanol to
      remove excess GSH. Analysis was done with energy dispersive
      analysis of X-rays (ED AX). The sample becomes a gel if the
      solution is allowed to dry in air. [0054] FIG. 1 is a schematic of
      the process for synthesizing some<br>
      embodiments of the cluster compositions. A Au nanoparticle 10
      interacts with one or more protector molecules 20. In some
      embodiments, the protector molecules are glutathione (-SG)
      ligands. The Au cluster 10 and the- SG ligand 20 form the Au@SG
      particle 25. The Au@SG clusters are then mixed with a molecular
      cavity 30, which may be one or more cyclodextrin (CD) molecules,
      in the presence of reduced glutathione molecules (GSH) 40. As
      shown in FIG. 1 , various cluster compositions may form during
      this process including - the Au cluster is partially or wholly
      surrounded by one CD molecule as in 50, which is an illustration
      of an Aui5SGi3@CD cavity. It is believed that the -SG ligand 20
      interacts with the CD molecules 30 (partially shown) in the
      cluster composition 50 as shown in FIG. 2A. In particular, the
      proton 'e' of the -SG ligand 20 interacts with the [Eta]3' proton
      of the CD molecule 30. This was confirmed by 2D 1H NMR (ROESY) of
      Aui5@aCD, which showed cross peaks for the H3 and e protons.
      &lt;l&gt;H NMR of Aui5@aCD suggests that the -SG ligands near the
      surface of the cluster compositions are in two different
      environments - inside or outside the CD molecules. In addition,
      the -SG peaks are shifted from the peak for the parent GSH
      suggesting that there are no free GSH molecules.<br>
      [0055] Example 3. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a Perkin
      Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. The experimentally obtained
      intensities in<br>
      absorbance, as a function of wavelength [I(W)], have been
      converted to energy- dependent values [1(E)] using the expression
      1(E) = I(W)l(dEldW) a I(W)*W&lt;2&gt;, where dEldw represents the
      Jacobian factor. The photoexcitation and luminescence studies were
      done using a NanoLog HORIBA JOBINYVON spectrofluorimeter with a
      100 W xenon lamp as the excitation source, at a scan speed of 240
      nm/sec. Band pass for both excitation and emission monochromators
      was kept at 5 nm. Metal ion detection was studied at ppm
      concentrations. Acetates (Cu and Hg ), nitrates (Ag , Cd and
      Zn&lt;2+&gt;) and chlorides (Fe&lt;34&gt;) were used for metal ion
      detection studies. XPS measurements were done using an Omicron
      Nanotechnology spectrometer with polychromatic Al Ka X-rays (hv =
      1486.6 eV). At least ten spectra in the desired binding energy
      range were collected and an average was taken. The samples were
      spotted as drop cast films on the sample stub and dried under
      vacuum. X-ray flux was adjusted to reduce the beam induced damage
      of the sample. The energy resolution of the spectrometer was set
      at 1.1 eV, at a pass energy of 50 eV. Binding energy (BE) was
      calibrated with respect to Cl s at 285.0 eV. Luminescence
      transients were measured and fitted using a commercially available
      spectrometer (Lifespec-ps) from Edinburgh instrument, U.K. (80 ps
      instrument response function (IRF)). 1H NMR and 2D 1H NMR (ROES Y)
      spectra were measured with a 500 MHz Briiker Advance III
      spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H NMR and equipped with
      a 5 mm triple- resonance PFG probe. Solutions were made in 99.98 %
      D20 (Aldrich) and sealed immediately. The signal of the solvent
      served as the reference for the field-frequency lock. All
      experiments were performed at a temperature of 25 [deg.]C unless
      specified. Standard Bruker pulse programs (Topspin 2.1) were
      employed throughout. The ID spectra were acquired with 32 K data
      points. The data for phase sensitive ROES Y experiments were
      acquired with a sweep width of 5600 Hz in both dimensions. For
      each spectrum, 16 transients of 2048 complex points were
      accumulated for 256 ti- increments and a relaxation delay of 2s
      was used. A CW spin lock mixing time of 200 ms was employed. Prior
      to Fourier transformation, zero filling to 2K x 2K complex points
      was performed, and apodized with a weighted function (QSINE) in
      both dimensions. All the data were processed on a HP workstation
      using Topspin 2.1 software. Mass spectrometric studies were
      conducted using an electrospray (ESI-MS) system, 3200 Q-TRAP
      LC/MS/MS (Applied Biosystems). Samples of 15 ppm concentration,
      taken in 1 : 1 water/methanol mixture were electrosprayed at a
      flow rate of [Iota][Omicron][mu][iota]/[iota][eta][iota][eta] and
      ion spray voltage of 5 kV. Circular dichroism studies were
      measured using a JASCO J-810 circular dichroism
      spectropolarimeter. Limit of detection (LOD) of GSH in circular
      dichroism is approximately 0.1 mg/mL. The optical polarization
      image was measured using a Nikon Eclipse LV100 POL polarizing
      microscope. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were
      carried out with Nano-S Malvera-instrument employing a 4 mW He-Ne
      laser ([lambda] = 632.8 ran) equipped with a thermostated sample
      chamber. All the scattered photons were collected at 173[deg.]
      scattering angle. The scattering intensity data were processed
      using the instrumental software to obtain the hydrodynamic
      diameter (dn) and the size distribution of the scatterer in each
      sample. [0056] Example 4. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
      measurements were performed to understand the size of the cluster
      compositions in solution. DLS measurements were carried out with
      Nano-S Malvem-instrument employing a 4 mW He-Ne laser ([lambda] =
      632.8 nm) equipped with a thermostated sample chamber. All the
      scattered photons were collected at 173[deg.] scattering angle.
      The scattering intensity data were processed using the
      instrumental software to obtain the hydrodynamic diameter (dn) and
      the size distribution of the scatterer in each sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The hydrodynamic diameter of the cluster compositions were
      observed to be 3-4 nm, which implies the presence of one cluster
      per CD molecule with water of hydration (see 50 in FIG. 1 ).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Although the structure of Au15 core is not available from
      single crystal XRD studies, calculations suggest it to have a
      symmetric, shell-like flat cage structure with a pointed tip. It
      is possible that a part of the core or monolayers can penetrate
      into the CD cavity. The inner core diameter is in the range of
      0.6-0.9 nm for [alpha], [beta] or [gamma] CDs, respectively,
      sufficiently large enough to partially accommodate Au15 cluster
      compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The nature of the metal core in these cluster compositions
      was confirmed by XPS analysis. XPS measurements were done using an
      Omicron Nanotechnology spectrometer with polychromatic Al K"
      X-rays (hv = 1486.6 eV). At least ten spectra in the desired
      binding energy range were collected and an average was taken. The
      samples were spotted as drop cast films on the sample stub and
      dried under vacuum. X-ray flux was adjusted to reduce the beam
      induced damage of the sample. The energy resolution of the
      spectrometer was set at 1.1 eV, at a pass energy of 50 eV. Binding
      energy (BE) was calibrated with respect to Cls at 285.0 eV. The
      4f7/2 and 4f5 2 BEs of Au in all these cluster compositions appear
      at 85.2 and 89.2 eV.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The S 2p, N Is and C ls core level spectra of these cluster
      compositions were also measured. The Au/S atomic ratio measured
      from XPS is 1.150, which is in agreement with a composition of
      AuisSn (theoretical value is 1.1538). The Au15 core reported is
      with 13 -SG ligands. The S 2p occurs at a slightly higher BE
      (163.1 eV) than typical thiolates (-162.0 eV) suggesting that the
      -SG protection is intact. The N Is spectrum shows two peaks at
      399.5 eV and 401.3eV BE, indicating the presence of -NH and
      -NH3&lt;+&gt;, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Example s. Three samples of cluster compositions- Aui5@aCD;<br>
      Aui5@pCD; Aui5@yCD were prepared according to Example 2 each with
      [alpha], [beta] or [gamma] CDs. FIG. 3 A is a UV-Vis spectra of
      Aui5@aCD, Aui5@ CD, and Au15@yCD. FIG. 3 A indicates that the
      absorption wavelengths for Aui5@aCD, Aui5@ CD, and Aui5@yCD
      exhibit the same features. The distinct features of the Aui5 core
      are indicated by the ellipses. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded
      using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. The
      experimentally obtained intensities in absorbance, as a function
      of wavelength [I(W)]t have been converted to energy-dependent
      values [1(E)] using the expression 1(E) = I(W)l(dEldW) a I(W)*
      W&lt;2&gt;, where dEldw represents the Jacobian factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The three varieties of the quantum composition have
      characteristic absorption features at 318, 458 and 580 nm, where
      there are no features for GSH as well as CD. FIG. 3B gives the
      plot of the natural logarithm of the Jacobian factor versus the
      wavelength of all the three clusters to show the molecular
      features more clearly (well-defined absorption features are marked
      by arrows). FIG. 3C provides the absorption profiles of pure GSH
      and a-CD.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 3D is the luminescence spectra of quantum compositions
      Au15@aCD, Au15@pCD, and Auis@yCD. The photoexcitation and
      luminescence studies were done using a NanoLog HORIBA JOBINYVON
      spectrofluorimeter with a 100 W xenon lamp as the excitation
      source, at a scan speed of 240 nm/sec. Band pass for both
      excitation and emission monochromators was kept at 5 nm. The
      samples were excited at 375 nm and the emission was observed at
      690 nm. These values are consistent with reported numbers for such
      as Au22, Au^, and Auio.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Lifetime values of the clusters were obtained by numerical
      fitting of the luminescence at 690 nm. They are 0.029 ns (83.50%),
      1.50 ns (5.90%), 14.80 ns (2.60%) and 181 ns (8.0%) for Aui5@aCD;
      0.071 ns (76.6%), 1.15 ns (1 1.8%), 1 1.10 ns (4.5%) and 163 ns
      (7.1%) for Au15@ CD and 0.024 ns (84.7%), 1.23 ns (7.6%), 13.90 ns
      (3.0%) and 172 ns (4.7%) for Aui5@yCD. The fast lifetime component
      is present in several clusters investigated so far which also show
      an extremely slow component with reduced weight. For example, the
      Au22 system shows a fast life time component of 0.05 ns (86.50%)
      and a slow component of 141.80 ns (3.40%).&lt;14&gt; The quantum
      yields of the cluster compositions were approximately 6.7%
      (Aui5@aCD), 6.5% (Aui5@ CD) and 7 % (Aui5@yCD) at room
      temperature, using ethidium bromide as the reference. In
      comparison to other similar clusters such as Au22 (4%) and Au23
      (1.3%), the quantum yield for the cluster compositions here are
      substantially larger.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 4A shows circular dichroism spectra for the cluster
      compositions with [alpha], [beta] and [gamma] -CDs. Circular
      dichroism was measured using a J ASCO J-810 circular dichroism
      spectropolarimeter. Limit of detection (LOD) of GSH in circular
      dichroism is approximately 0.1 mg/mL. In addition, the spectra for
      pure GSH another cluster Au^SGig have been included in FIG. 4A as
      a comparison. GSH is a chiral compound with a negative Cotton peak
      around 237 nm. The absence of this peak in the cluster and the
      cluster composition suggest that there is no free GSH.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] As seen in FIG. 4A, the spectrum of the cluster
      compositions are different from the spectra for the AU25SG18
      cluster. FIG. 4A suggests that the cluster compositions exhibit
      induced circular dichroism. The cluster compositions have a
      positive Cotton peak around 330-380 nm and a negative Cotton peak
      around 400-455 nm, which may be attributed to the cluster core.
      FIG. 4B shows the combined plot of absorption and circular
      dichroism (CD) spectra for Aui5@aCD.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Example 6. Aui5@aCD was stored in a glass vial for 24 hours
      and the solution was decanted. The glass vial retains a thin layer
      of cluster composition even with water sonication for 10 minutes.
      The cluster compositions remain intact and coat on the glass.
      Although not bound by theory, it is believed that the cluster
      compositions may bind with the Si-OH of the glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] A thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate with bulk S1O2
      coating was coated with the cluster composition solution of two
      different concentrations. The plate with the high and low
      concentration of cluster composition shows red and rose emissions,
      respectively, under UV light. The cluster composition-coated TLC
      plate can be used as a substrate for checking the solvent
      dependency of photoluminescence. The emission from the TLC plate
      was collected with 375 nm excitation. Then 2- propanol was sprayed
      over the plate using a sprayer. Immediately after spraying,
      emission was collected using the same excitation. There is a
      slight enhancement of the luminescence intensity. The plate was
      then allowed to dry completely resulting in the reversal of
      luminescence. A few other alcohols such as methanol and ethanol
      were sprayed. Luminescence increased in the order, propanol &lt;
      methanol ~ ethanol. However, exposure of water on the TLC plate
      drastically reduced the luminescence intensity. No shift in the
      emission wavelength was observed. The emission data are presented
      in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The solvent dependency of emission is currently believed to
      be attributed to hydrogen bonding of the solvent molecules with
      ligands on the cluster. As a result, the non-radiative rate of
      decay will reduce and this will enhance the emission. In addition
      to the cluster composition emission, FIG. 5 shows a peak at 725 nm
      which is attributed to the emission from the TLC plate. Asterisk
      (*) corresponds to regions where higher order line of the grating
      mask the spectrum and dollar ($) corresponds to the emission
      coming from Si02.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The solvent dependency of the emission was used to write
      letters on the TLC plate. In this approach; the TLC plate was
      coated with a given concentration of the cluster composition. In
      one embodiment, a low concentration of cluster composition was
      used to coat the TLC place such that the emission intensity is
      weak (and the plate is rose in color). When solvent contacts the
      plate, it enhances luminescence intensity and the solvent exposed
      regions appear with brighter luminescence. As the solvent
      evaporates, the parent luminescence reappears bringing the plate
      to the original state.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Example 7. At higher concentrations, QCs have a tendency to
      form a gel-like material with intense emission. Self assembly of
      the CD and -SG molecules at high concentration may result in
      gelation. This appears to be the first report of a gel using QCs.
      These materials were analyzed by SEM and HRTEM. The microstructure
      of the gel is composed of fibers of ~8 [mu][pi][iota] diameter
      (FIG. 6B). In order to study the spatial distribution of gold in
      the gels formed by QCs, elemental mapping was carried out using
      energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (ED AX). FIG. 6A shows the ED
      AX spectrum collected from the gel shown in FIG. 6B. ED AX mapping
      was done using Au Ma and the image is given in FIG. 6C. The
      detailed structure of the fibers was examined by TEM (FIG. 6D).
      The isolated clusters are not seen in [Tau][Epsilon][Mu], as
      mentioned before. Both in TEM and SEM, a fiber-like morphology is
      observed. Cyclodextrins and their derivatives have been
      extensively used as host molecules in supramolecular chemistry.
      Inclusion complexes (ICs) of CDs and guest molecules may result in
      supramolecular nanostructures (nanogels). Such complexes may find
      applications in drug delivery and diagnosis, especially in view of
      the low metallic content of the cluster and its high solubility in
      water in conjunction with<br>
      luminescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Example 8. The cluster composition may be used for the
      selective detection of metal ions such as Cu&lt;2+&gt;. An aqueous
      solution of the cluster composition was prepared. Metal ions were
      added individually under UV light. With the addition
      ofCu&lt;2+&gt; ions, there was a drastic change in luminescence-
      disappearance of red emission followed by the emergence of yellow
      emission (within a few minutes). The UV-Vis and luminescence
      spectra of cluster solution before and after addition of Cu are
      given in Figure 7 A and 7B. Even after the addition of Cu , the
      molecular absorption features are still intact (FIG. 7A),
      suggesting that the cluster composition is stable. But by looking
      into the PL spectra of cluster composition before and after the
      addition of Cu&lt;2+&gt;, a drastic change of emission maximum was
      observed (a blue shift of -100 run).<br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Description </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] Sub-nanoclusters of noble metals differ substantially from
      metallic nanoparticles of the same element in both structure and
      physical properties. While metal nanoparticles may range from a
      few nanometers (nm) to hundreds of nm in size, sub-nanoclusters
      have dimensions of about 1 nm or less and include relatively few
      atoms of metal. Due to the sub-nanometer core size,
      sub-nanoclusters cannot possess continuous density of states but
      have discrete electronic energy levels. They show "molecule-like"
      optical transitions in absorption and emission and therefore show
      characteristic features different not only from those of
      nanoparticles but from individual atoms as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The absorption profiles of sub-nanoclusters of various
      sizes can be distinguished from each other and from nanoparticles.
      Sub-nanoclusters exhibit strong photoluminescence and their
      luminescence ranges from the near-infrared (NIR) region to the
      ultraviolet as core size decreases. While metal nanoparticles of
      2-3 nm exhibit very weak luminescence with quantum yields of about
      10&lt;-4 &gt;to 10&lt;-5&gt;, sub-nanoclusters can exhibit
      luminescence with quantum yields in the range of 10&lt;-1 &gt;to
      10&lt;-3&gt;. Moreover, sub-nanoclusters may be readily conjugated
      to biological molecules and their low metal content makes them
      more biocompatible than nanoparticles. Such properties allow for
      the use of sub-nanoclusters in imaging and detection, especially
      medical imaging and in conjunction with therapeutics.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Discovery and use of metal sub-nanoclusters remain an
      empirical enterprise. While current techniques have allowed for
      the preparation of a variety of sizes of sub-nanoclusters, not all
      sizes have proven accessible. Some sub-nanoclusters are
      thermodynamically unstable and luminescence quantum yields vary
      between sub-nanoclusters. In addition, methods such as the
      reduction of Au&lt;3+&gt; ions in the presence of glutathione
      provide a complex mixture of sub-nanoclusters that must be
      separated by, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] The present technology provides gold sub-nanoclusters with
      good thermodynamic stability and luminescence quantum yields and
      reliable methods of making such sub-nanoclusters. The present
      technology further provides conjugates and compositions including
      such sub-nanoclusters and methods of using the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In one aspect, the present technology provides gold
      sub-nanoclusters including a gold core and one or more thiolates
      bound to the gold core. In some embodiments, the gold core
      includes or consists essentially of 23 gold atoms. In some
      embodiments, the one or more thiolates are selected from
      glutathione thiolate, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane,
      octanethiolate and a mixture of any two or more thereof. In some
      embodiments, the one or more thiolates is glutathione thiolate. In
      an illustrative embodiment, the gold sub-nanocluster has the
      formula Au23(SG)18 wherein SG is glutathione thiolate.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In some embodiments of the present technology, the gold
      sub-nanoclusters further include one or more amine or phosphine
      ligands. In some embodiments of the present technology, the gold
      sub-nanoclusters further include one or more fluorescent ligands
      selected from dansyl, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), green
      fluorescent protein, coumarin, fluorescein, and cyanine dyes.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In other embodiments, the gold sub-nanocluster of the
      present technology may be conjugated to a targeting molecule
      selected from the group consisting of a protein, a polynucleotide,
      or a ligand that binds to a protein or polynucleotide.
      Illustrative targeting molecules include but are not limited to
      streptavidin, biotin, an antibody, folic acid, lactoferrin,
      transferrin, or tat protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In another aspect, the present technology provides a
      composition including an aqueous solution, an organic solution or
      a mixture thereof that includes one or more gold sub-nanoclusters
      as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In yet another aspect, the present technology provides
      methods of making gold sub-nanoclusters. The methods include core
      etching of one or more Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters using a molar
      excess of thiolate relative to the molar amount of SG, to provide
      one or more gold sub-nanoclusters, wherein SG is glutathione
      thiolate. In some embodiments of the methods, the one or more
      Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters are dissolved in an aqueous solution and
      the excess thiolates are dissolved in an organic solvent that
      forms a two-phase system with the aqueous solution. The organic
      solvent may, e.g., be selected from toluene and xylene. In some
      embodiments of the methods, the thiolate may be selected from
      glutathione thiolate, octanethiolate, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy
      silane thiolate and a mixture of any two or more thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Various gold nanoclusters may be produced by the present
      methods. In some embodiments of the methods, the gold
      sub-nanocluster produced consists essentially of 23 atoms of gold
      and one or more thiolates such as, e.g., glutathione thiolate. In
      some embodiments, the gold sub-nanocluster produced has the
      formula Au23SG18 (wherein SG is glutathione thiolate). In other
      embodiments, the gold sub-nanocluster produced contains 22 or 33
      gold atoms. In some embodiments, the gold sub-nanoclusters
      produced have the formula Au22(MPTS)10(SG)7 or Au33OT22.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect, there are provided methods of using the
      sub-nanoclusters of the present technology. The methods include
      labeling a biological target with a conjugate of a gold
      sub-nanocluster as described herein, and detecting the conjugate
      by luminescence. In some embodiments of the present methods, the
      biological target may be a cancer cell. In other embodiments, the
      luminescence may be excited at a wavelength from about 400 to
      about 550 nm and the emission may be detected at a wavelength from
      about 600 nm to about 800 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In yet another aspect of the present technology, there are
      provided methods of detecting Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions in an aqueous
      sample. The methods include treating an aqueous sample to be
      tested for Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions with an effective amount of gold
      sub-nanoclusters and measuring the decrease in fluorescence of the
      treated sample, wherein the gold sub-nanocluster includes a gold
      core and one or more thiolates bound to the gold core, and wherein
      the gold core consists essentially of 23 gold atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not
      intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the
      illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above,
      further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
      described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
      not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
      other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The present technology provides gold sub-nanoclusters,
      compositions and conjugates of such sub-nanoclusters and methods
      of making and using the same. Such sub-nanoclusters are
      luminescent, e.g., fluorescent in the near infrared, may be coated
      with thiolate, are relatively non-toxic and are therefore useful
      in various imaging applications, including, e.g., fluorescent
      patterns for soft lithography, protein chips, medical imaging and
      in conjunction with therapy. In particular, such sub-nanoclusters
      may be derivatized with ligands that selectively bind to
      biological targets and allow them to be used as fluorescent labels
      for the biological targets.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one aspect, the present technology provides gold
      sub-nanoclusters including a gold core and one or more thiolates
      bound to the gold core. The gold core refers to the gold atoms in
      the sub-nanocluster, but does not include any surface
      modifications of the gold atoms such as thiolates or other
      molecules which are bound to the surfaces of the gold atoms. Gold
      sub-nanoclusters of the present technology include Au22, Au23, and
      Au33 cores. The luminescence quantum yields of the Au22 and Au23
      cores are 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively, making them significantly
      brighter fluorescent labels than the similar Au25 cores (about
      0.1% quantum yield).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Gold sub-nanoclusters of the present technology may include
      thiolates bound to the gold core. A thiolate is the anionic form
      (-S&lt;-&gt;) of the chemical group, thiol (-SH). Both water
      soluble and non-water soluble thiolates may be used. Thiolates
      that may be bound to the gold core include but are not limited to
      glutathione thiolate (SG), 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane
      (MPTS), octanethiolate (OT) and a mixture of any two or more
      thereof. In some embodiments, the gold sub-nanoclusters include,
      consist of or consist essentially of 23 gold atoms and glutathione
      thiolate, for example, Au23(SG)18. Other illustrative embodiments
      include but are not limited to Au22(MPTS)10(SG)7 and Au33(OT)22.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In still other embodiments, amine and phosphine ligands may
      be bound to the gold core in addition to or in place of thiolates
      through, e.g., interfacial ligand exchange involving two or more
      immiscible phases such as two immiscible liquids or solid-liquid
      phases, and the like. For example, alkyl amines including but not
      limited to 1-butylamine, 1-hexylamine, and 1-octylamine as well as
      amino acids with amine side-chains such as lysine or ornithine may
      be exchanged onto the surface of gold sub-nanoclusters of the
      present technology. Likewise, phosphines including but not limited
      to triphenylphosphines, salts of sulfonated phosphines (e.g.,
      4-(diphenylphosphino)benzenesulfonic acid), and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Gold sub-nanoclusters of the present technology may also
      include one or more fluorescent ligands. Suitable ligands include
      but are not limited to dansyl, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC),
      green fluorescent protein, coumarin, fluorescein, and cyanine
      dyes. In illustrative embodiments, ligands include but are not
      limited to acridine, 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin-3-acetic acid
      (AMCA), boron dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY), Cascade Blue, Cy2, Cy3,
      Cy5, Cy7, Edans, Eosin, Erythrosin, 6-Fam, Tet, Joe, Hex, Oregon
      Green, Rhodamine, Rhodol Green, Tamra, Rox, and Texas Red.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Such fluorescent ligands may be readily attached to
      suitably functionalized thiolates. By way of non-limiting example,
      fluorescent ligands containing amino or carboxyl groups may be
      coupled to a thiolate bearing a carboxyl or amino group,
      respectively, using standard procedures for amide bond formation
      (see, e.g., S-Y. Han and Y-A. Kim, Recent development of peptide
      coupling reagents in organic synthesis. Tetrahedron, 2004, 60,
      2447). Thus, coupling agents (e.g., EDC), active esters (e.g.,
      pentafluorophenol), mixed anhydrides and the like may all be used
      to form amide bonds between, e.g., a carboxyl-bearing thiolate of
      the sub-nanocluster and an amino-bearing ligand. Other types of
      linkages such as urethane and thiourea may also be formed from,
      e.g., isocyanates with amines or thiols. Similarly, click
      chemistry such as, e.g., the copper catalyzed Huisgen azide-alkyne
      reaction, may be used to attach fluorescent ligands to suitable
      functional groups on the thiolates. Depending on the type of
      chemistry, the reactions may be carried out directly on the
      sub-nanoclusters, or thiolates of the sub-nanoclusters may be
      exchanged for fluorescent-containing thiolates prepared according
      to the reactions described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Gold sub-nanoclusters may be conjugates that include a
      targeting molecule. By "targeting molecule" is meant a molecule
      that specifically binds to another molecule, i.e. has a binding
      constant with its partner of about 10 [mu]M or less, and in some
      embodiments, 1 [mu]M or less, 0.1 [mu]M or less, or even 0.01
      [mu]M or less. A targeting molecule may be a protein, a
      polynucleotide, or a ligand that binds to a protein or
      polynucleotide. Such ligands include not only large biological
      macromolecules, such as but not limited to antibodies, receptors,
      enzymes, oligonucleic acids, and aptamers, but small organic
      molecules, such as but not limited to folic acid and cofactors,
      such as but not limited to, biotin. Thus, in illustrative
      embodiments, targeting molecules include but are not limited to
      streptavidin, biotin, antibodies, folic acid, lactoferrin,
      transferrin, or tat protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Such conjugates may be prepared by coupling a suitably
      functionalized thiolate to the targeting molecule in much the same
      way that fluorescent ligands may be attached to thiolates as
      described above. For example, antibodies, other proteins and small
      molecules bearing carboxyl or amino groups may be linked,
      respectively, to the amino or a carboxyl group of glutathione via
      amide bond formation as described herein for fluorescent ligands.
      Likewise, urethanes, thiourethanes, and thioureas may also be
      formed from suitably functionalized thiolates and targeting
      molecules. Click chemistry may also be employed to prepare such
      conjugates.<br>

      [0027] In one aspect, the present technology provides compositions
      including aqueous solutions, organic solutions or mixtures thereof
      that include one or more gold sub-nanoclusters described herein.
      Such compositions may be useful in imaging applications and may be
      readily prepared using water or organic solvents as appropriate to
      the particular application at hand. Aqueous solutions of, e.g.,
      Au23SG18, may be used to stain cells in vitro or in vivo. Organic
      solutions of, e.g., Au33(OT)22 may be used for catalysis of
      chemical reactions. Particularly with respect to in vivo use,
      aqueous solutions may include pharmaceutically acceptable
      carriers. As used herein the term "pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier" includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings,
      antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption
      delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical
      administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be
      incorporated into the compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The gold sub-nanoclusters described herein may be prepared
      by core etching (also known as "interfacial etching") one or more
      Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters using a molar excess of thiol relative
      to the molar amount of SG. The types of gold sub-nanoclusters that
      may be made will vary with the conditions used. In some
      embodiments of the methods, the Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters are
      dissolved in an aqueous solution and the excess thiols (which form
      thiolates) are dissolved in an organic solvent that forms a
      two-phase system with the aqueous solution. The organic solvent
      may, e.g., be selected from aromatic solvents such as, but not
      limited to, toluene and xylene, chlorocarbons, such as but not
      limited to chloroform and dichloromethane. Various thiols may be
      used including but not limited to hexane thiol, decane thiol,
      phenylethane thiol, mercaptopropionic acid, mercaptosuccinic acid,
      glutathione, octanethiol, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane thiol
      and a mixture of any two or more thereof. The molar excess of
      thiol may range, e.g., from about 2 to about 4, about 6 or about 8
      equivalents per mole of SG in the Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters. In
      some embodiments, the excess thiol may range from about 2 to about
      100, about 2 to about 50, about 2 to about 30, about 2 to about
      15, or about 2 to about 10 equivalents. The core-etching may be
      carried out at or near room temperature (e.g., about 20[deg.] C.
      to about 30[deg.] C., or at about 25[deg.] C.) or at an elevated
      temperature, e.g., about 50[deg.] C. to about 60[deg.] C. or about
      55[deg.] C. In general, lower temperatures may be used to produce
      smaller clusters, while higher temperatures may be used to produce
      larger clusters. The reaction time may range from a few minutes to
      a few hours, including but not limited to, about 5 minutes to
      about 24 hours, about 10 minutes to about 12 hours, about 30
      minutes to about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In other methods, the Au25SG18 sub-nanoclusters are
      dissolved in aqueous solution. Excess thiol is added (e.g., up to
      about 4 equivalents or from about 1.5 equivalents to about 3
      equivalents, or about 2 equivalents per mole of SG in the Au25SG18
      sub-nanoclusters) and the reaction mixture stirred for several
      hours at or near room temperature (e.g., about 20[deg.] C. to
      about 30[deg.] C., or at about 25[deg.] C.). The thiol, such as
      MPTS, should be readily soluble in water. Reaction times similar
      to those for the two-phase system may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Core-etching methods typically provide predominantly a
      single species of sub-nanoclusters rather than the spectrum of
      species that result from some other methods. However, in the event
      that further purification is needed, PAGE may be used. Purity may
      also be assessed using PAGE, optical absorption spectroscopy,
      and/or mass spectrometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Various gold nanoclusters may be produced by the present
      methods. In some embodiments of the methods, the gold
      sub-nanocluster produced consists essentially of 23 atoms of gold
      and one or more thiolates such as, e.g., glutathione thiolate. In
      some embodiments, the gold sub-nanocluster produced has the
      formula Au23SG18. In other embodiments, the gold sub-nanocluster
      produced contains 22 or 33 gold atoms. In some embodiments, the
      gold sub-nanoclusters produced have the formula Au22(MPTS)10(SG)7
      or Au33OT22.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The gold sub-nanoclusters of the present technology may be
      used for detection and imaging of biological and other targets.
      The methods include labeling a biological target with a conjugate
      of a gold sub-nanocluster as described herein, and detecting the
      conjugate by luminescence including but not limited to
      fluorescence and infrared. In addition, such conjugates may be
      detected using one or more of Raman resonance, NMR, EPR, mass and
      optical spectra. Such conjugates may also be labeled with a
      radionuclide emitting alpha, beta, and/or gamma particles. Thus,
      optical, electronic, ionic and radioactive signatures may be used
      to capture information.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In some embodiments of the present methods, the biological
      target may be a cancer cell such as, e.g., hepatoma. Many types of
      cancer cells may be targeted using target molecules of the present
      technology. For example, cancer cells containing folic acid
      receptors can be stained using clusters conjugated with folic
      acid. Thus, in some embodiments, the biological target is ovarian,
      kidney, brain, lung or breast cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Standard fluorescence techniques may be used for detection
      of the luminescent sub-nanoclusters in the present methods. For
      example, confocal fluorescence microscopy may be used in vitro to
      examine a suitable prepared sample. By way of non-limiting
      example, cells to be examined may be washed free of growth medium,
      fixed in a paraformaldehyde solution (e.g., 3%) and exposed to a
      solution of the present gold sub-nanoclusters. After the cells
      have been stained, they are washed and imaged with the confocal
      fluorescence microscope. The luminescence may be excited at any
      suitable wavelength such as one from about 400 to about 550 nm and
      the emission may be detected at a wavelength from about 600 nm to
      about 800 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The present technology may also be used for sensing certain
      types of metal ions in aqueous samples. Such samples may include,
      e.g., ground water, well water, or wastewater and may be performed
      in the context of pollution detection or other purposes. In
      particular, low concentrations of Cu&lt;2+&gt; in, e.g., the ppm
      range, may be selectively detected in water versus Ag&lt;3+&gt;,
      Ag&lt;+&gt;, Ni&lt;2+&gt;, Ca&lt;2+&gt;, Mg&lt;2+&gt;,
      Na&lt;+&gt;, Pb&lt;2+&gt;, Hg&lt;2+&gt; and Cd&lt;2+&gt;. When a
      sample containing Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions is treated with an effective
      amount of Au23 sub-nanoclusters of the present technology, the
      luminescence of the sample is decreased or even quenched. Thus, in
      some embodiments, a decrease in luminescence (e.g., fluorescence)
      indicates the presence of Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions in the sample. By
      "effective amount of gold sub-nanoclusters" is meant an amount
      sufficient (in comparison to the amount of Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions in
      the sample) to produce a detectable change in luminescence of the
      sample. In some embodiments, the luminescence of the test sample
      is compared to that of a control sample. The control sample may
      include the gold sub-nanoclusters but no Cu&lt;2+&gt; ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Luminescence of gold sub-nanoclusters of the present
      technology may be further enhanced upon phase transfer (e.g., with
      tetraoctylammonium bromide) from aqueous solution to an organic
      solution. The luminescence of the phase transferred cluster in
      toluene may be further enhanced upon the addition of alcohols. The
      luminescence intensity was enhanced according to the series:
      methanol&lt;ethanol&lt;propanol&lt;butanol. Thus, in some
      embodiments of the methods herein, the methods further include
      treating an aqueous solution of the gold sub-nanoclusters with a
      water-immiscible organic solvent (e.g., an aromatic solvent such
      as toluene, benzene or xylene) and a phase transfer catalyst. The
      luminescence of such phase-transferred gold sub-nanoclusters may
      be detected as described herein, optionally in the presence of
      alcohols, e.g., C1-4 alcohols.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0037] The present technology is further illustrated by the
      following examples, which should not be construed as limiting in
      any way.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Materials. Tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl2.3H2O)
      was purchased from CDH, India. Glutathione (GSH), 1-octanethiol
      (OT), 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTS), tetraoctyl
      ammonium bromide (TOABr), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were
      purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Streptavidin was purchased from
      Hi-Media Chemicals, India. All chemicals were used as such without
      further purification. Triply distilled water was used throughout
      the experiments. Solvents were analytical grade.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] Synthesis of glutathione-capped gold (AuSG) clusters.
      Glutathione capped gold clusters were synthesized according to a
      reported method. (Negishi, Y., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2005)
      127, 5261, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by
      reference.) Reduced glutathione (GSH; 20 mM) was added to a
      solution of HAuCl4.3H2O (100 mL, 5 mM) in methanol. The mixture
      was then cooled to 0[deg.] C. in an ice bath for 30 minutes (min).
      An aqueous solution of NaBH4 (25 mL, 0.2 M), cooled at 0[deg.] C.,
      was injected rapidly into this mixture under vigorous stirring.
      The mixture was allowed to react for another hour. The resulting
      precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with
      methanol/water (3:1) through centrifugal precipitation and dried
      to obtain the Au@SG clusters as a dark brown powder. This product
      is a mixture of small nanoparticles and different clusters.<br>

      [0040] Synthesis Au25SG18, Au25SG18 was synthesized from the
      as-prepared Au@SG clusters by core etching according to the
      literature procedure. (Shichibu, Y., et al. Small (2007) 3, 835;
      Habeeb, Muhammed, M. A., et al. Chem. Phys. Lett. (2007) 449, 186;

      entire contents of each of the foregoing are incorporated herein
      by reference.) Briefly, the as-prepared Au@SG clusters were
      dissolved in water (25 mL). GSH was added (614 mg) and stirred at
      55[deg.] C. The reaction was monitored by optical absorption
      spectroscopy. Heating was discontinued when the absorption
      features of Au25SG18 appeared in the UV/Vis spectrum. This
      typically took 12 hours (h) of heating. The solution was
      centrifuged and methanol was added to the supernatant to
      precipitate the cluster. The precipitate was dried to obtain
      Au25SG18 clusters in the powder form. The prepared Au25SG18 showed
      the characteristic UVN is (at 672 nm), FTIR, TEM, and NMR
      spectroscopic features described in the literature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] Synthesis of Au23 clusters. The cluster was synthesized by
      interfacial etching. Au25SG18 clusters (10 mg) were dissolved in
      distilled water (10 mL). Octanethiol (8 times more than the amount
      of GSH present in Au25SG18) in toluene was mixed with the aqueous
      solution of Au25SG18 clusters. The biphasic mixture was stirred
      for 5 h at 25[deg.] C. During this time the absorption feature at
      672 nm in the aqueous layer decreased and a new feature at 630 nm
      appeared. The aqueous and organic phases were separated and
      centrifuged. The aqueous layer contained Au23SG18 sub-nanoclusters
      (temporarily assigned as AuxSGy), while the residue was Au'SG
      polymer formed from the etched gold atoms. The organic layer was
      almost colorless and did not show any significant absorption
      feature. PAGE analysis of the aqueous layer showed only one
      fluorescent band, suggesting the presence of a single well-defined
      sub-nanocluster.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><br>
      <br>
      [0042] Synthesis of Au33 clusters. The cluster was also
      synthesized by interfacial etching. Au25SG18 clusters (10 mg) were
      dissolved in distilled water (10 mL). Octanethiol (8 times more
      than the amount of GSH present in Au25SG18) in toluene was mixed
      with the aqueous solution of Au25SG18 clusters. The biphasic
      mixture was stirred for 1 h at 55[deg.] C. The organic layer,
      which was initially colorless, turned dark brown. The aqueous and
      organic phases were separated and centrifuged. The toluene layer
      displayed an absorption maximum of 709 nm, similar to that at 710
      nm displayed by Au33SG22. After centrifugation, the aqueous layer
      contained only a deposit of Au&lt;I&gt;SG polymer. The isolated
      sub-nanocluster was temporarily assigned the formula Aux(OTy).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><br>
      <br>
      [0043] Synthesis of Au22 clusters. The synthesis was carried out
      by single-phase etching. Au25SG18 clusters (10 mg) were dissolved
      in distilled water (10 mL). 3-Mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane was
      added to the cluster solution (2 times more than the amount of GSH
      present in Au25SG18). The mixture was stirred for 7 h. During
      etching, the color of the aqueous layer became increasingly
      reddish compared with that of Au25. The solution showed an
      absorption feature of 540 nm and the characteristic absorption
      features of Au25 had disappeared completely. The solution was
      centrifuged and the supernatant separated from the insoluble gold
      thiolate. The absorption feature of the sub-nanoclusters is
      similar to that for Au22(SG)17, also at 540 nm. The isolated
      sub-nanocluster was temporarily assigned the formula Aux(MPTS)y.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Gold Sub-Nanoclusters. The
      sub-nanoclusters of Examples 3-5 were examined using matrix
      desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (Voyager DE Pro
      mass spectrometer of Applied Biosystems Inc).
      [alpha]-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) was used as the
      matrix. The spectrum was collected in the negative mode. The mass
      spectrum shows peaks with m/z values ranging from 100 to 10,000
      (FIG. 1A). Peaks at low m/z regions are very intense with huge
      background signals when compared to those at higher m/z values.
      There is a pattern of peaks between m/z 1800 and 5300 and another
      pattern from m/z 5500 to 9000. The second set of peaks can be due
      to the clustering of ions detected in the lower m/z values.
      Clustering of clusters was observed in MALDI-MS studies of
      clusters. (Cyriac, J., et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. (2004) 390, 181,
      the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by
      reference.) The mass spectrum is composed of several groups of
      peaks with spacing of m/z 197 or 229 between the major peaks, as
      shown in FIG. 1B. This corresponds to the loss of Au or AuS. The
      m/z spacing between isolated peaks in each cluster of peaks is 32
      on account of sulfur. These results are consistent with the
      earlier reports of laser-desorption mass spectrometry of gold
      clusters protected with thiolates. (see, e.g., Schaaff, T. G.,
      Anal. Chem. (2004) 76, 6187, the entire contents of which are
      incorporated herein by reference.) Each bunch of peaks can be
      assigned as [AumSn]&lt;-&gt;. Since laser irradiation cleaves the
      S-C bond of the ligands, we can observe only peaks due to Aum
      clusters covered with S, and not the entire ligand. The last group
      of peaks of pattern 1 is due to Au23S18-23 (FIG. 1A). It is worth
      noting that after the peak due to Au23, the intensity drops
      drastically. The major peak at m/z 5140 can be assigned to
      [(Au23S18)S]&lt;-&gt;; then addition of S leads to
      [(Au23S19)S]&lt;-&gt;, [(Au23S20)S]&lt;-&gt;, and so on (FIG. 1C).
      Such additions are observed in MALDI and laser desorption
      ionization (LDI). From these, we can tentatively assign a core of
      Au23 for the AuxSGy cluster.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7</b><br>
      <br>
      FTIR Analysis of Gold Sub-Nanoclusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FTIR was carried out on the sub-nanoclusters of Examples
      3-5. The FTIR spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum
      One instrument. KBr crystals were used as the matrix for preparing
      the samples, which were at 5 wt % in KBr. FTIR spectra of the
      three clusters were compared with those of parent Au25SG18 and the
      ligands used for etching (FIG. 2A-D). FTIR spectra of the ligands
      bound on the cluster surface are less intense than the free
      ligands, owing to the fact that these ligands are linked to the
      cluster surface through covalent bonds. They are also distributed
      non-uniformly on the cluster surfaces, hence their vibrational
      features are masked to some extent. FTIR spectra of Au25SG18 and
      AuxSGy match exactly with each other and therefore it can be
      concluded that the AuxSGy clusters are protected completely with
      glutathione as in Au25SG18, which makes them water soluble. The
      peak at 2526 cm&lt;-1 &gt;due to the -SH stretching of glutathione
      disappeared both in Au25SG18 and in AuxSGy, thereby suggesting the
      covalent bonding of glutathione with the cluster core through the
      thiolate link. The FTIR spectrum of AuxSGy shows features due to
      octanethiol. The peak at 2568 cm&lt;-1 &gt;due to the -S-H
      stretching mode of octanethiol disappeared in AuxOTy confirming
      the covalent binding of octanethiol with the cluster core through
      the -SH group. The presence of OT on the cluster surface can also
      be confirmed by the large intensity of the -CH2 stretching modes
      at 2846 and 2918 cm&lt;-1&gt;. Since single-phase etching was
      carried out in water, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane underwent
      hydrolysis to 3-mercaptopropyl trisilanol. FTIR spectra of
      AuxMPTSy showed features due to both 3-mercaptopropyl trisilanol
      and glutathione, which suggested that the cluster is protected
      with a mixed monolayer of 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilanol and
      glutathione. The features due to 3-mercaptopropyl trisilanol were
      more significant compared with the glutathione features. The
      ligand protection of the clusters can now be summarized as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 8</b><br>
      <br>
      [0046] Elemental Analysis of Gold Sub-Nanoclusters. Whereas AuxSGy
      is protected with glutathione, AuxMPTSy is protected with a mixed
      monolayer of 3-mercaptopropyl trisilanol and glutathione. AuxOTy
      is covered by octanethiol (all in thiolate form). To check the
      presence of gold and other elements, energy dispersive analysis of
      X-ray (EDAX) was carried out (data not shown) by drop-casting the
      aqueous solution of AuxSGy and solution of AuxOTy in toluene on
      indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass plates. Since AuxMPTSy was expected
      to have silicon, the EDAX measurements were carried out by pasting
      the powder of the cluster on a carbon tape. The elements present
      in the clusters were mapped. Whereas AuxSGy contained Au, C, N, O,
      and S, the elements present in AuxMPTSy were Au, C, N, O, S, and
      Si. The elements present in AuxOTy were Au, C, and S. Based on
      that information, the core and ligand protection of all three
      clusters are known. To assign chemical compositions to the
      clusters, elemental analyses (CHNS) were carried out. The results
      are given in the Table below. The molecular formulae of the
      clusters were found to be Au22(MPTS)10(SG)7, Au23(SG)18, and

      equipped with 532 nm excitation. The images in FIG. 3 show
      luminescence from Au23 and Au22 rich regions. Although there was
      luminescence from the red (bright) spots, there was no
      luminescence from the dark areas. The red spots are the islands of
      Au22 or Au23 clusters. These images show that the clusters are
      also luminescent in the solid state. Since Au23 is a completely
      new cluster and is brightly luminescent and water soluble, further
      investigation of its properties were undertaken.<br>

      <b>Example 10</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] Conjugation of streptavidin with Au23. Conjugation of
      streptavidin with glutathione-protected Au23 was carried out using
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) as the
      coupling agent. EDC (25 [mu]L of 10 mM) prepared in triply
      distilled water was added to a mixture of Au23 (2 mg) and
      streptavidin (1 mg) in triply distilled water (1 mL). The mixture
      was stirred for 3 h. The streptavidin-coated Au23 was subjected to
      dialysis for 2 d with a water change after every 6 h.<br>

      </b><b>Example 11</b><br>
      <br>
      [0049] Imaging of Hepatoma Cells with Streptavidin-conjugated
      Au23. Conjugated gold sub-nanoclusters of Example 10 were used to
      image human hepatoma cells (HepG2). These cancerous cells contain
      large amounts of biotin on their surfaces. Since biotin strongly
      binds with streptavidin, the cells can be imaged using the
      luminescence of the sub-nanoclusters in the form of a conjugate
      with streptavidin.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] HepG2 cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluency starting
      with 2*10&lt;4 &gt;cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates
      (in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
      fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37[deg.] C. in
      humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2). For the imaging
      experiment, the growth medium was removed and the cells were
      washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove the
      dye phenol red and various chemical reagents such as salts and
      glucose present in the growth medium. After this, the cells were
      fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Two-hundred microliters of a
      concentrated aqueous solution of streptavidin-conjugated Au23 was
      added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation
      the cells were washed several times with PBS to remove the unbound
      clusters and were imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. A
      very intense red luminescence was observed from the cells (see
      FIG. 4A-C). A control experiment was carried out to confirm the
      specificity of the streptavidin-biotin interaction. For this the
      fixed HepG2 cells were incubated with Au23 clusters without any
      streptavidin conjugation for the same period. No luminescence was
      observed from the cells after washing (not shown). This experiment
      confirms that the specific interaction of streptavidin and biotin
      allows the cluster to stain the cells.<br>

      <b>Example 12</b><br>
      <br>
      Detection of Cu&lt;2+&gt; Ions in an Aqueous Solution<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The effect of fluorescence of Au23 in the presence of
      various metal ions was studied. The ions selected were
      Au&lt;3+&gt;, Ag&lt;+&gt;, Cu&lt;2+&gt;, Ni&lt;2+&gt;,
      Ca&lt;2+&gt;, Mg&lt;2+&gt;, Na&lt;+&gt;, Pb&lt;2+&gt;,
      Hg&lt;2+&gt;, and Cd&lt;2+&gt; as their nitrates or chlorides.
      Next, 50 ppm of the aqueous solutions of Au23 was treated with
      metal ions so that the final concentration was 10 ppm, and the
      emissions of the clusters were measured immediately after the
      addition of ions. Au23 was found to be reactive towards
      Cu&lt;2+&gt;. The emission of the cluster quenched significantly
      (from an intensity of 4*10&lt;6 &gt;to essentially zero). Although
      cluster emission enhanced a bit in the presence of Ag ions (from
      an intensity of 4*10&lt;6 &gt;to a little more than
      5*10&lt;6&gt;), it remained unaltered in the presence of other
      metal ions.<br>

      will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing
      descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to
      fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present
      disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended
      claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such
      claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure
      is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds
      compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It
      is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for
      the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not
      intended to be limiting.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure

      will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in
      terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the
      Markush group.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any
      and all purposes, particularly in terms of providing a written
      description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and
      all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any
      listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing
      and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal
      halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting
      example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down
      into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will
      also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as
      "up to," "at least," "greater than," "less than," and the like
