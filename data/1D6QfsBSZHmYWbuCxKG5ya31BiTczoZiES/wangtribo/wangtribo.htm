      A hand-held triboelectric generator for harvesting energy from
      human motions. <br>

      <br>
      Out at sea, gentle waves provide power for thousands of homes. In
      cities, dancefloor moves generate electricity for nightclubs. In
      the countryside, hikers use leg power to recharge their phones.<br>
      <br>
      It is an alluring goal of clean, reliable power free from
      geo-political risks — and scientists in the United States said
      Tuesday it lies within reach, thanks to a smart way to harvest
      energy called tribo-electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology said they had
      built a simple prototype device that converts stop-start movement
      into power.<br>
      <br>
      Waves, walking and dancing — even rainfall, computer keys or urban
      traffic — could one day be harnessed to drive sensors, mobile
      gadgets or even electricity plants, they contend.<br>
      <br>
      Zhong Lin Wang, a professor of materials science and engineering,
      described the invention a "breakthrough."<br>
      <br>
      "Our technology can be used for large-scale energy harvesting, so
      that the energy we have wasted for centuries will be useful," he
      told AFP by email.<br>
      <br>
      "Tribo-electric" is a modern term with ancient roots — from the
      Greek word for "rub."<br>
      <br>
      Its electricity is created from friction between two substances
      causing a charge of electrons to be transferred from one to the
      other.<br>
      <br>
      It commonly happens, for instance, when plastic-soled shoes are in
      contact with a nylon carpet, causing the snap of static discharge
      when one's hand touches a metal doorknob.<br>
      <br>
      Because tribo-electric is so unpredictable, it has been generally
      shunned as a power source.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred method has been magnetic induction — a turbine
      driven by nuclear- or fossil-powered steam or water.<br>

      the triboelectric generator. <br>

      Nanoenergy and Nanosystems and Georgia Tech<br>
      <br>
      But, in a new study published in the journal Nature
      Communications, Wang's team said they had overcome key hurdles to
      converting a haphazardly-generated electrical charge into current.<br>
      <br>
      Their prototype comprises a disc about 10 centimetres (four
      inches) across, designed to show the potential from a small,
      portable generator moved by ambient energy.<br>
      <br>
      Inside are two circular sheets of material, one an electron
      "donor" and the other an electron "receiver," brought together
      through rotary movement.<br>
      <br>
      If the sheets are separated, one then holds an electrical charge
      isolated by the gap between them.<br>
      <br>
      Sandwiched between the two discs is a third disc with electrodes,
      which bridges the gap and helps a small current to flow.<br>
      <br>
      At a top speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute, the device
      generated 1.5 watts.<br>
      <br>
      This gave it an energy efficiency of 24 percent, three times
      greater than piezoelectric, the previously best source of
      mechanical electricity harvesting—and as efficient as
      magnetic-induction turbines.<br>
      <br>
      It can run on a gentle wind or tap water, or "random jerky
      motions," including human movement, to provide the rotation, Wang
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "As long as there is mechanical action, there is power that can be
      generated."<br>
      <br>
      The prototype used copper for the rotator and gold for the
      electrodes in lab tests, but these could easily be substituted for
      low-cost synthetics, he said.<br>
      <br>
      The team is working on ways to scale up tribo-electric energy for
      harvesting power from the ocean.<br>

      Harvesting mechanical energy is an important route in obtaining
      cost-effective, clean and sustainable electric energy. Here we
      report a two-dimensional planar-structured triboelectric generator
      on the basis of contact electrification. The radial arrays of
      micro-sized sectors on the contact surfaces enable a high output
      power of 1.5?W (area power density of 19?mW?cm-2) at an efficiency
      of 24%. The triboelectric generator can effectively harness
      various ambient motions, including light wind, tap water flow and
      normal body movement. Through a power management circuit, a
      triboelectric-generator-based power-supplying system can provide a
      constant direct-current source for sustainably driving and
      charging commercial electronics, immediately demonstrating the
      feasibility of the triboelectric generator as a practical power
      source. Given exceptional power density, extremely low cost and
      unique applicability resulting from distinctive mechanism and
      structure, the triboelectric generator can be applied not only to
      self-powered electronics but also possibly to power generation at
      a large scale.<br>

      A triboelectric generator includes a first contact charging member
      and a second contact charging member. The first contact charging
      member includes a first contact layer and a conductive electrode
      layer. The first contact layer includes a material that has a
      triboelectric series rating indicating a propensity to gain
      electrons due to a contacting event. The conductive electrode
      layer is disposed along the back side of the contact layer. The
      second contact charging member is spaced apart from and disposed
      oppositely from the first contact charging member. It includes an
      electrically conductive material layer that has a triboelectric
      series rating indicating a propensity to lose electrons when
      contacted by the first contact layer during the contacting event.
      The electrically conductive material acts as an electrode. A
      mechanism maintains a space between the first contact charging
      member and the second contact charging member except when a force
      is applied thereto.<br>

      U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/754,992, filed
      Jan. 22, 2013, the entirety of each of which is hereby

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0003] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention relates to electric power generators
      and, more specifically, to generators that derive power from
      mechanical contact between surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Wireless, portable and multi-function electronic devices
      require independent and maintenance-free power sources. The
      emerging technologies for mechanical energy harvesting are
      effective and promising approaches for building self-powered
      systems, because of a great abundance of mechanical energy
      existing in the environment and the human body. Piezoelectric
      nanogenerators have been developed to convert tiny-scale
      mechanical energy into electricity. Another approach to providing
      power is though triboelectric nanogenerators based on the
      contact-electrification effect. Triboelectric nanogenerators
      harvest mechanical energy through a periodic contact and
      separation of two polymer plates. However, most triboelectric
      nanogenerators have limited power output.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Therefore, there is a need for triboelectric nanogenerators
      with increased power output.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the
      present invention which, in one aspect, is a triboelectric
      generator that includes a first contact charging member and a
      second contact charging member. The first contact charging member
      includes a first contact layer and a conductive electrode layer.
      The first contact layer has a contact side and an opposite back
      side. The first contact layer includes a material that has a
      triboelectric series rating indicating a propensity to exchange
      electrons due to a contacting event. The conductive electrode
      layer is disposed along the back side of the contact layer. The
      second contact charging member is spaced apart from and disposed
      oppositely from the first contact charging member. The second
      contact charging member includes an electrically conductive
      material layer that has a triboelectric series rating indicating a
      propensity to exchange electrons when contacted by the first
      contact layer during the contacting event. The electrically
      conductive material layer is configured to act as an electrode. A
      mechanism is configured to maintain a space between the first
      contact charging member and the second contact charging member
      except when a force is applied thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another aspect, the invention is a triboelectric
      generating device that includes a first contact charging member
      and a second contact charging member. The first contact charging
      member includes a substrate layer having a first side and a second
      side, a first contact layer and a conductive electrode layer. The
      substrate layer is configured to maintain a concave shape unless a
      force is applied thereto. The first contact layer has a contact
      side and is affixed to the first side of the substrate layer. The
      first contact layer includes a material that has a triboelectric
      series rating indicating a propensity to gain electrons due to a
      contacting event. The conductive electrode layer is affixed to the
      second side of the substrate layer. The second contact charging

      contact charging member. The second contact charging member
      includes an electrically conductive metal layer that has a
      triboelectric series rating indicating a propensity to lose
      electrons when contacted by the first contact layer. The second
      contact charging member defines a concave shape that is reflective
      of the concave shape of the substrate layer.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0020] U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/598,132, filed on Aug.
      29, 2012 by Wang et al. discloses methods of making triboelectric
      generators and components thereof and is incorporated herein by
      reference for the purpose of disclosing such methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] As shown in FIG. 1A, one embodiment of a triboelectric
      generator 100includes a first contact charging member 110that has
      a first substrate material layer 112, which could include
      poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide) (which is sold under the
      trademark "Kapton"), adjacent to a second substrate material layer
      113, which can include a material such as SiO 2. The first contact
      charging member 110also includes a first contact layer 114, which
      could include, for example, PDMS, PTFE, FEP, PVC, and a Polyimide,
      or any material that has a triboelectric series rating indicating
      a propensity to gain electrons due to a contacting event. The
      first substrate material layer 112and the second substrate
      material layer 113are applied to each other at an elevated
      temperature and then cooled so that differential shrinkage during
      cooling causes the contact charging member to have a concave
      shape. The first substrate material layer 112can include a polymer
      sheet having a first thermal expansion coefficient and the second
      substrate material layer 113can include a ceramic film having a
      second thermal expansion coefficient that is less than the first
      thermal expansion coefficient. A second contact charging member
      120includes an electrically conductive metal layer (which could
      include a material such as aluminum, a metal or a conductive
      polymer) that has a triboelectric series rating indicating a
      propensity to lose electrons when contacted by the first contact
      layer 114. The second contact charging member 120defines a concave
      shape that is reflective of the concave shape of the substrate
      layer so that when the second contact charging member 120is placed
      adjacent to the first contact layer 114, the two layers define a
      space 122therebetween unless a force is applied to the layer to
      bring them together. A first conductive electrode 116, which is
      applied to the second substrate material layer 113, and the second
      contact charging member 120, which acts as an electrode as a
      result of its conductivity, can be coupled to a load 10to apply
      current thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As shown in FIGS. 1B-1E, triboelectric nanogenerator
      100generates current by applying a cycled compressive force onto
      the whole area of the device, so that the bending plates will be
      periodically pressed to flatten and contact closely with each
      other, as shown in FIG. 1B. Once released, as shown in FIG. 1C,
      the two plates will separate apart due to the stored elastic
      energy and revert instantaneously back to their original arch
      shape due to resilience. A cycled generation of the potential
      difference between the two electrodes 112and 120drives the flow of
      electrons through the load 10. At the original state before the
      contact of the triboelectric films (as shown in FIG. 1A), there is
      no charge transferred, thus no electric potential. Upon the
      pressing of the two films towards each other, they will be brought
      fully into surface contact (as shown in FIG. 1B) and possibly
      relative sliding would occur, which results in electrons being
      transferred from a material in the positive side of the
      triboelectric series to the one in the negative side in the
      series. Accordingly, electrons will be injected from the aluminum
      surface 120to PDMS surface 114, leaving positive charges on
      aluminum foil 120. The positive triboelectric charges on the
      conductive aluminum foil 120attract the electrons in the opposite
      electrode to flow through the external load 10. After cycles of
      deformation, when the device is press and the surfaces with
      charges are in close contact with each other, all of the
      triboelectric charges will stay on the inner surfaces with the
      same surface density ([sigma]0). Once the pressing force is
      released, the triboelectric nanogenerator 100will immediately
      rebound back to its original arch shape due to the elasticity of
      the film so that a gap 122will form again between the two plates,
      as shown in FIG. 1C. The electric field generated by the separated
      surface charges will then give rise to a much higher potential on
      the aluminum foil side 120than the top electrode 116. Such a
      potential difference will drive the flow of positive charges from
      aluminum foil to the top electrode through the external load
      10until the potential difference is fully offset by the
      transferred charges, rendering the top electrode with a surface
      charge density of ([Delta][sigma]), while the aluminum electrode
      120is left with ([sigma]0-[Delta][sigma]), as shown in FIG. 1D.
      Subsequently, when the triboelectric nanogenerator is pressed
      again to reach the close contact of the two plates, as shown in
      FIG. 1E, these redistributed charges will inversely build a
      positive potential on the top electrode 116, which will drive all
      of the transferred charges ([Delta][sigma]) to flow back to the
      inner surface of the aluminum foil 120. Then a cycle is achieved
      and the device will go back to the equilibrium state depicted in
      FIG. 1B.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Both the voltage and current outputs are related to the
      amount of charges transferred (A[Delta][sigma], A is surface area
      of the plate), which is determined by the triboelectric charge
      density ([sigma]0) and the separation distance of the two plates.
      The results of an analytical calculation 200based on a simplified
      model of quasi-infinite flat plates, indicates the magnitude of
      the distance required for the optimum output, as shown in FIG. 2.
      When the separation distance starts to increase from 0 to 0.7 mm,
      [Delta][sigma] keeps a very rapid increase from 0 to ~90% of
      [sigma]0. Then, the slope of this curve starts to decrease. Thus,
      both an intimate contact and a subsequent separation of nearly 1
      mm result in the phenomenal transferring of charges.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In one experimental embodiment, the electric output
      measurement was performed on an arch-shaped triboelectric
      nanogenerator device in a size of 3 cm*2.8 cm, with the triggering
      frequency of 6 Hz and controlled amplitude. Since the accumulation
      of the triboelectric charges increases and reaches equilibrium in
      a certain period of time after multiple cycles, the output will
      gradually go up in the first stage upon deformation. Then, the
      open-circuit voltage (VOC) will stabilize at 230 V, measured by an
      electrometer with infinite input resistance. When the bottom Al is
      connected to the positive probe of the electrometer, upon the
      release of the pressing force a positive voltage is generated
      because of the immediate charge separation. Since the electrons
      cannot flow in an open-circuit condition, the voltage will hold at
      a plateau unless there is a quick leakage. The peak value of the
      short-circuit current (ISC) reaches 94 [mu]A, corresponding to the
      half cycle of pressing that is in higher straining rate than
      releasing. The integration of the each current peak gives the
      total charges transferred in a half cycle of deformation.
      Moreover, when the connection polarity to the electrometer is
      switched, both the voltage and current signal will be completely
      reversed. The gap from the arch-shaped structure is an important
      factor for the enhanced output, because without the
      SiO2-film-introduced bending, there will be much smaller and
      unstable electrical output.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As shown in FIG. 3, the triboelectric effect can be
      enhanced by using texture patterned surfaces on the first contact
      layer 114and the second contact layer 120. For example the
      surfaces can employ an array of pyramid structures 310or an array
      of box-like structures 312, or a combination of these structures
      or one of many other shaped structures formed in the surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Fabricating one experimental embodiment began with
      photolithographic patterning of 4 in. (100) Si wafers with
      thermally grown SiO 2on top. The patterned wafer with the array of
      square window openings was firstly etched by
      buffered-oxide-etching process to transfer the pattern onto the
      SiO 2layer. Then, the wafer was etched in KOH solution to
      fabricate the recessed features of pyramid. After cleaned with
      acetone, isopropanol and ethanol in sequence, the Si molds were
      treated with trimethylchlorosilane (Sigma Aldrich) by gas phase
      silanization to enable the easy peel-off of the PDMS film from the
      Si mold in the following step. In preparing the patterned PDMS
      film, the elastomer and the cross-linker (Sylgard 184, Dow
      Corning) were mixed in a 10:1 ratio (w/w), and then casted on the
      Si mold. After the degassing process under the vacuum, the mixture
      was spin-coated on the Si mold at 500 rpm for 60 s. After the
      thermally curing process at 85[deg.] C. for 1 hour, the PDMS inked
      with pyramid patterns was peeled off from Si mold. The surface
      without patterns were glued to the inner surface of the bending
      Kapton substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The triboelectric nanogenerator can be integrated with a
      battery, such as a lithium ion battery. In assembling such an
      embodiment, two different slurries for the two working electrodes
      were made, which contain 70 wt % active material (LiCoO 2for
      cathode and graphite for anode), 10 wt % carbon black powders as
      conductor, 20 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder and
      N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma Aldrich) as the solvent. Then the
      slurries were cast onto the current collectors (Al foil for
      cathode and Cu foil for anode) respectively with a uniform
      thickness of 10 [mu]m. The electrodes were baked at 110[deg.] C.
      under vacuum for 12 hours. Stainless-steel coin cells were used
      for the battery assembly. The cathode and anode electrodes were
      stacked with a piece of polyethylene (PE) separator (MTI
      Corporation) in between. After the system was filled with
      electrolyte (1M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 ethylene carbonate: dimethyl
      carbonate: diethyl carbonate, Novolyte Technologies), the
      coin-cell was finally sealed.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In another embodiment of a triboelectric nanogenerator 400,
      as shown in FIGS. 4A-4D, the first contact charging member
      410includes a first rigid substrate 412to which a conductive
      electrode layer 414is applied. The first rigid substrate 412can
      include a material such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The
      conductive electrode layer 414can include, for example, a material
      such as gold, a metal, ITO, or a conducting polymer. A first
      contact layer 416is applied to the conductive electrode layer 414.
      The first contact layer 416is made from a material that has a
      triboelectric series rating indicating a propensity to gain
      electrons due to a contacting event, such as, for example, PDMS,
      PTFE, FEP, PVC, or a polyimide. A second contact charging member
      420includes a second rigid substrate 422, which can include can
      include a material such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). An
      electrically conductive material layer 423is applied to the second
      rigid substrate 422. Electrically conductive material layer 423has
      a triboelectric series rating indicating a propensity to lose
      electrons when contacted by the first contact layer 416. In one
      representative embodiment, the electrically conductive material
      layer 423includes a gold film 424and a plurality of gold
      nanoparticles 426disposed thereon on. One or more springs
      430maintain a space 432between the first contact charging member
      410and the second contact charging member 420except when a force
      is applied thereto. The springs 430may be held in place by
      receptacles 434defined by the rigid substrates 412and 422.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Compression of the first contact charging member 410and the
      second contact charging member 420is shown in FIG. 4B. The use of
      nanoparticles 426increases the contact are substantially,
      increasing the triboelectric effect. This embodiment of a
      triboelectric nanogenerator 400offers a substantially higher power
      output due nanoparticle 426-based surface modification. In one
      experimental embodiment, short-circuit current reached a peak
      value of 2.0 mA, which corresponded to the instantaneous power
      output of 1.2 W and power density of 322.7 W/m &lt;2&gt;. Average
      power output and energy conversion efficiency at device level was
      calculated to be 132 mW and 9.8%, respectively. This embodiment
      also realized scaling up of nanogenerator power output, making it
      power not just a single electronic device but hundreds of them
      simultaneously. Triggered by a commonly available mechanical
      source such as footfalls, the nanogenerator was capable of
      instantaneously lighting up 600 commercial LED lamps in real time.
      This indicates the practicability of harvesting mechanical energy
      by the nanogenerator on a large scale. The working mechanism
      demonstrated here can be further applied to potentially harvest
      large-scale mechanical energy such as from rolling wheels, wind
      power, and ocean waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In one experimental embodiment, the nanogenerator has a
      layered structure with two substrates. Polymethyl methacrylate
      (PMMA) was selected as the material for substrates due to its
      decent strength, light weight, easy processing, and low cost. On
      the lower side, a layer of contact electrode is prepared. The
      contact electrode plays dual roles of electrode and contact
      surface. It consists of a gold thin film and gold nanoparticles
      coated on the surface. Alternatively, nanoparticles of
      non-precious metals can also be used as replacements. They modify
      the surface both physically and chemically. On the other side, a
      thin film of gold is laminated between the substrate and a layer
      of polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS). This electrode is referred to as
      the "back electrode" for later reference. The two substrates are
      connected by four springs installed at the corners, leaving a
      narrow spacing between the contact electrode and the PDMS.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The electric energy generation process can be explained by
      the coupling between triboelectric effect and electrostatic
      effect. At the original position, a separation distance is
      maintained by springs. When an external impact is applied onto one
      of the substrates, the gold and PDMS are brought into contact.
      According to the triboelectric series that ranks materials'
      tendency to gain or lose electrons, electrons are injected from
      gold into PDMS, resulting in surface triboelectric charges, which
      are retained on the PDMS. As the impact is withdrawn, the
      contacting surfaces move apart due to restoring force from the
      springs. Once a separation forms, the back electrode possess a
      higher electric potential than the contact electrode, producing an
      electric potential difference. Such a potential difference drives
      electrons through external loads and screens the positive
      triboelectric charges on the contact electrode. When the
      nanogenerator reverts back to the original position, positive
      triboelectric charges on the contact electrode are completely
      screened, leaving equal amount of inductive charges on the back
      electrode. Subsequently, mechanical impact once again shortens the
      separation, producing an electric potential difference with
      reversed polarity. In consequence, electrons flow in a reversed
      direction. They keep screening inductive charges on the back
      electrode until a direct contact is again established. The
      insulating PDMS allows long-time retention of the triboelectric
      charges on its surface even through the triboelectric charges on
      the metal side are periodically screened by inductive charges. In
      this process, the nanogenerator acts as an electron pump that
      drives electrons back and forth between the two electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The nanogenerator's electric output is strongly related to
      the contacting force, yielding higher output with larger force. At
      a force as small as 10 N, the nanogenerator can still produce I
      scranging from 160 [mu]A to 175 [mu]A. When the force increases to
      500 N, the electric output reaches a saturated value, producing a
      peak I scof 1.2 mA. This result is due to increased contact area
      with larger force. The two contacting surfaces are neither
      absolutely flat nor smooth. Surface roughness may be caused by
      inherent curvature of the substrates, nanoparticle modification,
      and fabrication defects such as particle contamination from the
      air. At small contacting force, the surface roughness prevents
      fully intimate contact between the contact electrode and the PDMS,
      leaving some areas untouched. With increased force, due to elastic
      property, the PDMS can deform and fill more vacant space, thus
      leading to larger contact area. As a result, the electric output
      increases until all the vacant space is completely filled by the
      PDMS, reaching a saturated limit.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As an important figure of merit, energy conversion
      efficiency of the nanogenerator was calculated. The conversion
      efficiency is defined as the ratio between the electric energy
      that is delivered to load by the nanogenerator and the mechanical
      energy the nanogenerator possesses. FIG. 4 ais a current pulse
      output produced by human footfall at load resistance of 1
      M[Omega]. The time span between t 1and t 2represents a single
      contact. With an external load of pure resistance, the electric
      energy delivered by the nanogenerator is equal to the Joule
      heating energy, which is presented below.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      E electric =Q=[integral] t1 &lt;t2&gt; I &lt;2&gt;
      .R.dt=R.[integral] t1 &lt;t2&gt; I &lt;2&gt; .dt=1*10
      &lt;6&gt;([Omega]).[integral] 22.7144 &lt;22.7200&gt; I &lt;2&gt;
      .dt=0.74 mJ (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where Q is the Joule heating energy, I is the instantaneous
      current, and R is the load resistance. Consequently, the average
      power output (W average) can be obtained by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As soon as the mechanical energy is introduced, it presents
      in two forms, i.e. elastic energy stored in the springs and
      kinetic energy carried by a moveable substrate of the
      nanogenerator. The elastic energy is later released without
      converting into electric energy, which is calculated by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where k is the spring constant (k=1278.88 N/m), x is the
      displacement of a spring that is equal to the spacing between the
      two contacting surfaces (x=1 mm), and N is the number of springs
      (N=4).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] For kinetic energy, at the moment when the two substrates
      make a contact, it completely transforms to other forms, including
      electric energy and thermal energy. It can be calculated by the
      following equation.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where m is the mass of the moveable substrate (m=13.45 g,
      the mass of gold thin film and PDMS layer are negligible), and the
      v is the velocity of the substrate when a contact is just about to
      be made (v=0.86 m/s).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Therefore, the energy conversion efficiency ([eta]) is
      calculated as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] It is to be noted that the above result is the overall
      efficiency at device level. However, at conversion process level,
      the elastic energy stored in the springs does not participate in
      energy conversion. Therefore if we solely take into account the
      kinetic energy that actually partially converts to electric
      energy, the direct efficiency at conversion process level is<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The unprecedentedly high power output of the nanogenerator
      is mainly attributed to three factors. Firstly, the contact
      electrode plays dual roles of electrode and contacting surface.
      Compared to previously reported designs in which both of the
      contacting surfaces are made of polymers, more inductive charges
      will be generated for the new design. Secondly, the elastic
      property of PDMS enables conformal contact despite of surface
      roughness. The PDMS can easily deform in response to small
      pressure and fill the otherwise vacant space that result from
      substrate curvature and fabrication defects. The tolerance on
      surface roughness ensures as much contact area as it can be
      possibly obtained. Also, the surface modification by gold
      nanoparticles plays an important role for the output enhancement.
      It can offer five-fold increase on the current output compared to
      the device without modification. Physically, the bumpy surface of
      the nanoparticle provides a larger contact area than a flat
      surface does. Chemically, the as-synthesized gold nanoparticles
      are positively charged in nature. The pre-carried positive charges
      may be able to add up with triboelectric charges upon contact,
      leading to a largely enhanced surface charge density and thus a
      substantially higher electric output.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one experimental embodiment, the following fabrication
      methods were employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Materials: Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (&gt;=99%)
      was purchased from Sigma. Sodium tetrachloroaurate dihydrate (99%)
      and 1,4-Benzenedithiol (99%) were purchased from Aldrich.
      Hydrazine hydrate solution (78-82%) was purchased from
      Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water was obtained using a ultrapure
      (18.2 M[Omega]-cm) system.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Synthesis of gold nanoparticles: A solution (50 mL)
      containing Sodium tetrachloroaurate dihydrate (1 mM) and
      hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (10 mM) was brought to a
      vigorous boil with stifling in a round-bottom flask fitted with a
      reflux condenser; Hydrazine hydrate solution (20 [mu]L) was then
      added rapidly to the solution. The solution was heated under
      reflux for another 8 min, during which time its color changed from
      pale yellow to pale red. The solution was cooled to room
      temperature while stirring continuously. The average size (56 nm)
      of the synthesized gold nanoparticles was verified through SEM
      analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Self-assembly of gold nanoparticles onto Au thin film: Au
      films were derivatized by immersion in a solution of
      1,4-benzenedithiol for 12 h and rinsed with methanol and then
      water. The derivatized Au films were then immersed in a solution
      of gold nanoparticles for 12 hours to allow for complete
      adsorption of a single gold nanoparticle layer. Before the SEM
      characterization and electrical measurement, non-adsorbed gold
      nanoparticles were removed by rinsing with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Fabrication of the triboelectric nanogenerator: To
      fabricate the nanogenerator, two pieces of cast acrylic glass were
      prepared as substrates with dimensions of 3 inch by 3 inch by 3/32
      inch. Four half-thorough holes were drilled at corners as houses
      for spring installation. 50 nm of gold was deposited on both of
      the substrates by e-beam evaporator (2 inch by 3 inch). On one of
      the substrates, fluid PDMS that consisted of base and curing agent
      in a ratio of 5:1 was spin-coated to form a 10 [mu]m-thick layer.
      Then it was cured at 100[deg.] C. for 45 minutes. On the other
      substrate, gold nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on gold
      surface by self-assembly. Subsequently, four springs (spring
      constant=7.3 lb/inch) were installed in the houses to connect the
      two substrates together, leaving a spacing of 1 mm between the
      gold and the PDMS. The spacing is required to be substantially
      larger than the polymer thickness to ensure effective generation
      of inductive charges. Finally, conducting wires were connected to
      the two metal layers as leads for subsequent electric measurement
      or for connection to an external load.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to generators and, more
      specifically, to a system for generating voltage and current using
      the triboelectric effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Energy harvesting by converting ambient energy into
      electricity may offset the reliance of small portable electronics
      on traditional power supplies, such as batteries. When long-term
      operation of a large number of electronic devices in dispersed
      locations is required, energy harvesting has the advantages of
      outstanding longevity, relatively little maintenance, minimal
      disposal and contamination. Despite of these benefits, superior
      performance, miniaturized size and competitive prices are still to
      be sought after in order for energy harvesting technology becoming
      prevalent.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The triboelectric effect is a type of contact
      electrification in which certain materials become electrically
      charged after they come into contact with another such as through
      friction. It is the mechanism though which static electricity is
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      Triboelectric effect associated electrostatic phenomena are the
      most common electrical phenomena in our daily life, from walking
      to driving, but the triboelectric effect has been largely ignored
      as an energy source for electricity. Some electrostatic
      microgenerators have been developed and used in research relating
      to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), but such designs tend to
      be based on inorganic materials and the fabrication of such
      devices requires complex processes. [0007] Therefore, there is a
      need for a reliable, small and easily manufactured system for
      harvesting triboelectric energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the
      present invention which, in one aspect, is a generator that
      includes a thin first contact charging layer and a thin second
      contact charging layer. The thin first contact charging layer
      includes a first material that has a first rating on a
      triboelectric series. The thin first contact charging layer has a
      first side with a first conductive electrode applied thereto and
      an opposite second side. The thin second contact charging layer
      includes a second material that has a second rating on a
      triboelectric series that is more negative than the first rating.
      The thin first contact charging layer has a first side with a
      first conductive electrode applied thereto and an opposite second
      side. The thin second contact charging layer is disposed adjacent
      to the first contact charging layer so that the second side of the
      second contact charging layer is in contact with the second side
      of the first contact charging layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another aspect, the invention is a triboelectric
      generator that includes a first conductive electrode layer, a
      second conductive electrode layer, a first contact charging layer
      and a second contact charging layer. The first contact charging
      layer has a first side and an opposite second side. The first
      conductive electrode layer is disposed on the first side of the
      first contact charging layer. The first contact charging layer
      includes a first material that has a first rating on a
      triboelectric series. The first contact charging layer has a
      thickness sufficiently thin so that a positive excess charge on
      the second side induces an electric field that induces negative
      charge carriers to form in the first conductive electrode layer.
      The second contact charging layer has a first side and an opposite
      second side. The second conductive electrode layer is disposed on
      the first side of the second contact charging layer. The second
      contact charging layer includes a second material that his a
      second rating on the triboelectric series wherein the second
      rating is more negative than the first rating. The second side of
      the second contact charging layer is disposed against the second
      side of the first contact charging layer. The second contact
      charging layer has a thickness sufficiently thin so that a
      negative excess charge on the second side induces an electric
      field that induces positive charge carriers to form in the second
      conductive electrode layer. Relative movement between contacting
      portions of the second side of the first contact charging layer
      and the second side of the second contact charging layer results
      in excess positive charge on the second side of the first contact
      charging layer and excess negative charge on the second side of
      the second contact charging layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of
      generating an electrical current and voltage in which a first
      contact charging layer is brought in contact with a second contact
      charging layer. The first contact charging layer has a first side
      and an opposite second side. A first conductive electrode layer is
      disposed on the first side of the first contact charging layer.
      The first contact charging layer includes a first material that
      has a first rating on a triboelectric series. The first contact
      charging layer has a thickness sufficiently thin so that a
      positive excess charge on the second side induces an electric
      field that induces negative charge carriers to form in the first
      conductive electrode layer. The second contact charging layer has
      a first side and an opposite second side. A second conductive
      electrode layer is disposed on the first side of the second
      contact charging layer. The second contact charging layer includes
      a second material that his a second rating on the triboelectric
      series wherein the second rating is more negative than the first
      rating. The second side of the second contact charging layer is
      disposed against the second side of the first contact charging
      layer. The second contact charging layer has a thickness
      sufficiently thin so that a negative excess charge on the second
      side induces an electric field that induces positive charge
      carriers to form in the second conductive electrode layer.
      Relative motion between the first contact charging layer and the
      second contact charging layer is caused. A load is applied between
      the first conductive electrode layer and the second electrode
      layer, thereby causing an electrical current to flow through the
      load.<br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0024] A preferred embodiment of the invention is now described in
      detail. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like
      parts throughout the views. Unless otherwise specifically
      indicated in the disclosure that follows, the drawings are not
      necessarily drawn to scale. As used in the description herein and
      throughout the claims, the following terms take the meanings
      explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates
      otherwise: the meaning of "a," "an," and "the" includes plural
      reference, the meaning of "in" includes "in" and "on."<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As shown in FIG. 1, a triboelectric energy harvesting
      system may be embodied as a generator or a sensor unit 100 that
      includes a first contact charging layer 110 that has a first
      conductive electrode layer 113 disposed on a first side 112 and
      that has an opposite second side 114 that has a textured surface.
      The first contact charging layer 110 includes a material with a
      relatively less negative triboelectric series rating. Examples of
      suitable materials can include: polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
      poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a conductor, a metal, an alloy
      and combinations thereof. A first conductive electrode layer 116
      is applied to the first side of the first contact charging layer
      112.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A second contact charging layer 120 is disposed against the
      first contact charging layer 110. The second contact charging
      layer 120 includes a material that has a rating on the
      triboelectric series that is more negative than that of the
      material of the first contact charging layer 110. Examples of such
      materials can, for example, include poly-oxydiphenylene-
      pyromellitimide (such as Kapton), polydimethylsiloxane, a
      conductor, a metal, an alloy and combinations thereof. The second
      contact charging layer 120 includes a first side 122 and an
      opposite second side 124 and a second conductive electrode layer
      126 is applied to the second side 122. The first side 122 also
      includes a textured surface. In one embodiment, the textured
      surfaces may include nanoscale or microscale texture. The
      electrode layers 116 and 126 can include materials such as gold,
      silver, aluminum, a metal, indium tin oxide (ITO), and
      combinations thereof. If ITO is used, the resulting device can be
      transparent.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Relative movement between the second sides 114 and 124 of
      the first contact charging layer 110 and the second contact
      charging layer 120 can be caused by applying a force to one of the
      layers. This causes electrons to be transferred from the second
      contact charging layer 120 to the first contact charging layer
      110. This causes the second surface 114 of the first contact
      charging layer 110 to be negatively charged and the second surface
      124 of the second contact charging layer 120 to be positively
      charged. The charges on the second sides 114 and 124 generate
      respective electric fields that induce charge accumulation in the
      electrode layers 116 and 126 and when a load 150 is coupled
      therebetween, electrons will flow through the load 150.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] A unit 100 can be made as a sandwiched structure with two
      different polymer sheets stacked alternatively without interlayer
      binding. In one experimental embodiment, a rectangular (4.5 cmx l
      .2 cm) Kapton film (125[mu][iota][eta] in thickness, Dupont 500HN)
      was placed onto another flexible PET substrate (Dura-Lar,
      220[mu][iota][eta] in thickness). The two short edges of the
      device were sealed with ordinary adhesive tape and to ensure an
      adequate contact between two polymer sheets. Both of the top and
      bottom surfaces of the structure were covered with a thin layer of
      Au alloy film (100 nm in thickness) by sputter coating. The metal
      films play two important roles here: (1) producing equal but
      opposite sign mobile charges via the electrostatic induction of
      the tribology generated potential at the interfacial region; and
      (2) serving as common electrodes for directly connecting the
      device with an external circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of units 100 can be stacked
      and coupled in parallel to generate an increased current, or in
      series to generate an increased voltage. By stacking two thin
      polymer films, for example Kapton and polyester (PET), a charge
      generation, separation and induction process can be achieved
      through a mechanical deformation of the polymer film. In one
      experimental embodiment, a power output density of about 10.4
      mW/cm &lt;3&gt;was achieved with an output voltage of 3.3 V. This
      is a simple, low-cost, readily scalable fabrication process of a
      generator or sensor can convert random mechanical energy found in
      many environmental sources (e.g., rotating tires, wind, etc.) into
      electricity using conventional flexible/foldable polymer
      materials. This technology has a great potential for scaling up to
      power mobile and personal electronics used in environmental
      monitoring, personal medical networks, electronic emergency
      equipment and other self-powered systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The operating principle of the system can be described by
      the coupling of contact charging and electrostatic induction, as
      shown in FIG. 3A-3G in an embodiment in which the first contact
      charging layer comprises a Kapton film and the second contact
      charging layer comprises PMMA. In FIG. 3A, at the original state,
      no charge is generated or induced, and no electric potential
      difference (EPD) exists between the two electrodes. When an
      externally introduced displacement is applied to the unit 110 in
      the direction of the arrows, as shown in FIG. 3B, the two contact
      charging layers are brought into contact with each other. Surface
      charge transfer then takes place at the contact area due to
      triboelectric effect. According to the triboelectric series,
      electrons are injected from PMMA into Kapton, resulting in net
      negative charges at the Kapton surface and net positive charges at
      the PMMA surface, respectively. The insulating property of theses
      polymers allows a long-time retention of triboelectric charges for
      hours or even days.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As the displacement decreases, the unit 100 starts to be
      released and the Kapton film begins to revert back to its original
      position due to its own resilience. Once the two polymers
      separate, an EPD is then established between the two electrodes,
      as shown in FIG. 3C. Defining electric potential of the bottom
      electrode (UBE) to be zero, electric potential of the top
      electrode (UTE) can be calculated by:<br>
      [deg.]0<br>
      <br>
      where [sigma] is the triboelectric charge density, [epsilon] 0is
      the vacuum permittivity, and d' the interlayer distance at a given
      state.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Here, a forward connection is defined for measurement as a
      configuration with positive end of the electrometer 150 connected
      to the bottom electrode (BE). (All electric measurements herein
      are based on the forward connection unless otherwise stated.)<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, as the unit 100 is being released, V oc(as shown in
      FIG. 3F) keeps increasing until reaching the maximum value when
      the Kapton film fully reverts to the original position, as shown
      in FIG. 3D. Theoretically, such a voltage would remain constant
      provided that the input impedance of the electrometer is infinite.
      If renewed pressing is immediately followed, as shown in FIG 3E,
      the EPD starts diminishing as the two polymer layers get closer to
      each other. As a result, V ocdrops from the maximum value to zero
      when a full contact is made again between the two polymers, as
      shown in FIG. 3F.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As shown in FIG. 3G, if the two electrodes are shorted, any
      established EPD shown in Equation (1) as the two polymers separate
      drives electrons from the top electrode (TE) to the bottom
      electrode (BE), resulting in a nearly instantaneous positive
      current during the releasing process. The net effect is that
      inducted charges accumulate with positive sign on the TE and
      negative sign on the BE. The inducted charge density ([sigma].)
      when the generator is fully released can be ex ressed as below:<br>
      <br>
      where s rk, and [epsilon] [psi]are the relative permittivity of
      Kapton and PMMA, respectively, di and [upsilon][3/4] are the
      thickness of the Kapton film and the PMMA layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Once the unit 100 is pressed again, reduction of the
      interlay er distance makes the TE possess a higher electric
      potential than the BE. As a consequence, electrons are driven from
      the BE back to the TE, reducing the amount of inducted charges.
      This process corresponds to the nearly instantaneous negative
      current shown in FIG. 3G. When the two polymers are in contact
      again, as shown in FIG. 3B, all inducted charges are neutralized.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one experimental embodiment, as triggered by a vibration
      source with controlled frequency and amplitude, the unit 100
      produced an open-circuit voltage and a short-circuit current as
      predicted in the above analytical model. Electric output with
      opposite sign was obtained by switching the polarity for electric
      measurement. The peak value of the V ocand I scwere up to 110 V
      and 6 uA, respectively. Substituting the experimentally determined
      V ocinto Equation (1), a theoretical triboelectric charge density
      was obtained according to the following:<br>
      =97.39 [mu][sigma][iota] (3)<br>
      d.<br>
      <br>
      Then based on Equation (2), the maximum inducted charge density
      ([sigma] max) was theoretically calculated to be: [sigma] [Mu]=
      &lt;G&gt;/ &lt;d ri[pound]rp&gt;, =73.72 [mu][theta] m
      &lt;2&gt;(4)<br>
      d ls v+ d 3[pound] rks rp+ d 2[pound] rk<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, electrons are pumped back and forth between the two
      electrodes as a result of contact charging and electrostatic
      induction. For one cycle of contacting-sliding-separating the
      integration of current over time for releasing has the same value
      as that for pressing, indicating that equal amount of electrons
      flow in the opposite direction. The current peak corresponding to
      releasing has a smaller magnitude but lasts longer than that for
      pressing. Such an observation can be explained by the fact that
      pressing is caused by the external vibration source while it is
      the resilience of the Kapton film that leads to releasing.
      Therefore, it is likely that releasing corresponds to a slower
      process and thus a smaller but wider current signal. Having the
      maximum inducted charge (Q'), the corresponding charge density was
      obtained as:<br>
      &lt;r~ = = &lt;87&gt;- &lt;23&gt;^ &lt;C/ m2&gt;(6)<br>
      <br>
      where S is the electrode area. The experimental result in Equation
      (6) is only slightly larger than the theoretically calculated one
      in Equation (4), indicating that the model is fairly valid for
      explaining the working principle.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] External load matching for the generator was studied in the
      experimental embodiment. With an increase in the load resistance,
      the maximum current decreases due to ohmic loss, while the maximum
      voltage across the load has an opposite trend. Accordingly, the
      electric power exhibited an instantaneous peak value of 110 [mu]W,
      in correspondence to a power density of 31.2 mW/cm &lt;3&gt;. The
      measurement results reveal that the generator is particularly
      efficient provided that the load has a resistance on the order of
      mega ohms.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] One embodiment can be employed in a sensor system, such as
      a self-powered touch screen. To make the device transparent and
      improve the power generation density, three approaches were used
      in an experimental embodiment: (1) using a transparent PDMS film
      as one of the contact charging layers; (2) using transparent ITO
      for the electrode layers, resulting in a flexible and transparent
      structure; and (3) fabricating various PDMS pattern arrays to
      enhance the friction effect, resulting in a high-output generator
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Such an embodiment can be made of two sheets of polymers
      that have distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with
      one easy to gain electrons and the other one easy to lose
      electrons. By stacking the two sheets together with flexibility of
      relative sliding, two insulating polymeric materials are touched
      and rubbed with each other when deformed by an external mechanical
      deformation. Thus, electrostatic charges with opposite signs are
      generated and distributed on the two surfaces of the polymer films
      due to the presence of the nanometer scale roughness, and an
      interface dipole layer is formed, which is called a triboelectric
      potential layer. Such a dipole layer induces an inner potential
      layer between the planar metal electrodes. The induced charges
      will not be quickly conducted away or neutralized owing to the
      insulative nature of the polymer films. To minimize the energy
      created by the triboelectric potential, electrostatically induced
      free-charges will flow across the external load between the two
      electrodes coated on the top and bottom polymer sheets,
      respectively, to reach equilibrium. Once the structure is released
      and the tribologic force is removed, the two polymer films recover
      their original shapes, and the tribologically generated positive
      and negative charges may neutralize, and the electrostatic induced
      charges across the two electrodes recombine.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As shown in FIGS. 4A-4E, patterns can be fabricated on the
      polymer surfaces to increase the triboelectric power output. To
      make patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films, Si wafer molds
      210 are fabricated by traditional photolithography methods,
      followed by a dry or wet etching process to fabricate different
      recessed features 212 onto the surface, as shown in FIG. 4A.
      Examples of such features include pyramids 216, rectangular prisms
      226 (as shown in FIG. 6A) and rows 236 (as shown in FIG. 6B). The
      surface of the molds is initially treated with
      trimethylchlorosilane to prevent the PDMS film from sticking to
      the recessed features 212. As shown in FIG. 4B, liquid PDMS
      elastomer and a cross-linker are mixed, degassed and uniformly
      spin-coated on the surface of the mold 210. As shown in FIG. 4C,
      after curing thermally, a uniform PDMS layer 214 is peeled off,
      including inverse 216 of the original pattern features 212 on the
      surface of the mold 210. As shown in FIG. 4D, the PDMS film was
      fixed on the insulation surface of a clean indium tin oxide (ITO)-
      coated 219 polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate 217 by a
      thin PDMS bonding layer, and then the entire structure was covered
      with another ITO-coated 215 PET film 213 to form a
      sandwich-structured device. A schematic view of the resulting
      structure is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] One advantage of this technique is that hundreds of
      replicas of patterned PDMS films can be produced from one single
      mold. Silicon-based molds can be replaced by metal molds (e.g., Ni
      or Al) due to their excellent mechanical properties and longevity.
      The entire preparation process of the device is simple and
      low-cost, making it possible to be scaled-up for large-scale
      production and practical applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, micrographs of the resulting PDMS
      pattern arrays show that the above-described fabrication method
      yields regular and uniform microstructures across the whole area
      of a 4-inch wafer mold. The shape and lateral dimensions of the
      polymer structure are well controlled by the initial patterns on
      the surface of the wafer mold. As shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, the size
      of single PDMS features is limited to about 10 [mu][iota][eta].<br>
      <br>
      Smaller features down to 5 [mu][iota][eta] can also be produced
      with consistent quality. As shown in FIG. 8A, the pyramid features
      400 have a near perfect geometric structure and a sharp tip, which
      can be beneficial for increasing the friction area and the
      efficiency in the power generation process. A micrograph of a
      rectangular prismatic embodiment 402 is shown in FIG. 8B and an
      embodiment employing elongated rows 404 is shown in FIG. 8C.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It should also be noted that the resulting PDMS film is
      stretchable and transparent, as illustrated in Figure 2D. Given
      that the electrode layers include transparent ITO, these
      embodiments are especially applicable to touch sensors, such as
      touch screen displays.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As shown in FIG. 7, one embodiment includes a triboelectric
      generator 300 wherein a side of one of the contact charging layers
      310 includes a texture formed by a plurality of elongated
      nanowires 312 extending outwardly therefrom. This embodiment can
      result in a substantial charge density during use.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Dry etching is applied on the Kapton surface 310 to create
      vertically aligned polymer nanowires 312. Use of these nanowires
      312 results in increased surface friction as they are brought in
      contact with the opposite polymer layer 328. A spacer structure
      326 improves electric output.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In one experimental embodiment, the fabrication process
      starts with a square glass sheet 320, on which is deposited with a
      thin layer of aluminum 322 as the bottom electrode using electron
      beam evaporator. Then a thin layer of PMMA 324 is spun-coated,
      followed by adding a spacer layer 326 at the edges, leaving a
      square cavity 328 at the center. One side of a Kapton film 310 is
      deposited with a layer of aluminum as the top electrode 311, while
      the other side was dry-etched to create vertically aligned polymer
      nanowires 312. Then the Kapton layer 310 was anchored on the
      spacer 326 with the top electrode 311 facing up. The spacer 326
      can be made of an insulating polymer with double-sided adhesive,
      keeping the Kapton film 310 at a fixed distance away from the PMMA
      layer 324 underneath.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The above described embodiments, while including the
      preferred embodiment and the best mode of the invention known to
      the inventor at the time of filing, are given as illustrative
      examples only. It will be readily appreciated that many deviations

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0003] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention relates to generators and, more
      specifically, to a system for generating voltage and current using
      the triboelectric effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Energy harvesting by converting ambient energy into
      electricity may offset the reliance of small portable electronics
      on traditional power supplies, such as batteries. When long-term
      operation of a large number of electronic devices in dispersed
      locations is required, energy harvesting has the advantages of
      outstanding longevity, relatively little maintenance, minimal
      disposal and contamination. Despite of these benefits, superior
      performance, miniaturized size and competitive prices are still to
      be sought after in order for energy harvesting technology becoming
      prevalent.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The triboelectric effect is a type of contact
      electrification in which certain materials become electrically
      charged after they come into contact with another such as through
      friction. It is the mechanism though which static electricity is
      generated. Triboelectric effect associated electrostatic phenomena
      are the most common electrical phenomena in our daily life, from
      walking to driving, but the triboelectric effect has been largely
      ignored as an energy source for electricity. Some electrostatic
      microgenerators have been developed and used in research relating
      to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), but such designs tend to
      be based on inorganic materials and the fabrication of such
      devices requires complex processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Therefore, there is a need for a reliable, small and easily
      manufactured system for harvesting triboelectric energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the
      present invention which, in one aspect, is a generator that
      includes a thin first contact charging layer and a thin second
      contact charging layer. The thin first contact charging layer
      includes a first material that has a first rating on a
      triboelectric series. The thin first contact charging layer has a
      first side with a first conductive electrode applied thereto and
      an opposite second side. The thin second contact charging layer
      includes a second material that has a second rating on a
      triboelectric series that is more negative than the first rating.
      The thin first contact charging layer has a first side with a
      first conductive electrode applied thereto and an opposite second
      side. The thin second contact charging layer is disposed adjacent
      to the first contact charging layer so that the second side of the
      second contact charging layer is in contact with the second side
      of the first contact charging layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another aspect, the invention is a triboelectric
      generator that includes a first conductive electrode layer, a
      second conductive electrode layer, a first contact charging layer
      and a second contact charging layer. The first contact charging
      layer has a first side and an opposite second side. The first
      conductive electrode layer is disposed on the first side of the
      first contact charging layer. The first contact charging layer
      includes a first material that has a first rating on a
      triboelectric series. The first contact charging layer has a
      thickness sufficiently thin so that a positive excess charge on
      the second side induces an electric field that induces negative
      charge carriers to form in the first conductive electrode layer.
      The second contact charging layer has a first side and an opposite
      second side. The second conductive electrode layer is disposed on
      the first side of the second contact charging layer. The second
      contact charging layer includes a second material that his a
      second rating on the triboelectric series wherein the second
      rating is more negative than the first rating. The second side of
      the second contact charging layer is disposed against the second
      side of the first contact charging layer. The second contact
      charging layer has a thickness sufficiently thin so that a
      negative excess charge on the second side induces an electric
      field that induces positive charge carriers to form in the second
      conductive electrode layer. Relative movement between contacting
      portions of the second side of the first contact charging layer
      and the second side of the second contact charging layer results
      in excess positive charge on the second side of the first contact
      charging layer and excess negative charge on the second side of
      the second contact charging layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of
      generating an electrical current and voltage in which a first
      contact charging layer is brought in contact with a second contact
      charging layer. The first contact charging layer has a first side
      and an opposite second side. A first conductive electrode layer is
      disposed on the first side of the first contact charging layer.
      The first contact charging layer includes a first material that
      has a first rating on a triboelectric series. The first contact
      charging layer has a thickness sufficiently thin so that a
      positive excess charge on the second side induces an electric
      field that induces negative charge carriers to form in the first
      conductive electrode layer. The second contact charging layer has
      a first side and an opposite second side. A second conductive
      electrode layer is disposed on the first side of the second
      contact charging layer. The second contact charging layer includes
      a second material that his a second rating on the triboelectric
      series wherein the second rating is more negative than the first
      rating. The second side of the second contact charging layer is
      disposed against the second side of the first contact charging
      layer. The second contact charging layer has a thickness
      sufficiently thin so that a negative excess charge on the second
      side induces an electric field that induces positive charge
      carriers to form in the second conductive electrode layer.
      Relative motion between the first contact charging layer and the
      second contact charging layer is caused. A load is applied between
      the first conductive electrode layer and the second electrode
      layer, thereby causing an electrical current to flow through the
      load.<br>

      apparent from the following description of the preferred
      embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings. As
      would be obvious to one skilled in the art, many variations and
      modifications of the invention may be effected without departing
