          device he developed with Leslie Bromberg (left), Daniel Cohn
          (right) and colleagues that could significantly reduce the

      <br>
      MIT engineers and colleagues are perfecting a device that could
      turn that foodstuff and various "biocrude" oils into fuel that
      could reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil and decrease
      emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The same device
      could also significantly reduce the amount of smog-producing
      pollutants generated by vehicles running on traditional fuels.<br>
      <br>
      All that from a contraption the researchers believe will be
      relatively inexpensive--only a few percent of the cost of a car or
      truck. They also believe that it could be introduced into present
      vehicle technology with only minor modifications, and that it will
      only need to be replaced a few times over the lifetime of a
      vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Essentially the device, which is about the size of a large soup
      can, works as an onboard "oil refinery." It converts a wide
      variety of fuels into high-quality hydrogen-rich gas. Adding only
      a small amount of such gas to the fossil fuel powering a car is
      known to make possible a significant decrease in emissions of
      pollutants like nitrogen oxides.<br>
      <br>
      "This device might dramatically reduce air pollution from autos
      and trucks without a major increase in costs and inconvenience,"
      said Daniel R. Cohn, a senior research scientist at the MIT Plasma
      Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). "The device has near-term
      applications. No major advances are needed in internal combustion
      engine design to incorporate it."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Cohn's colleagues on the work are PSFC principal research
      engineer Leslie Bromberg, PSFC research engineer Alexander
      Rabinovich, and Jeffrey E. Surma and Jud Virden at the Battelle
      Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The team will present a
      paper on the work October 28 at the DOE Automotive Technology
      Development Customers' Coordination Meeting.<br>
      <br>
      The new device is a kind of electrical gas heater known as a
      plasmatron. Fuel injected into the plasmatron is exposed to an arc
      of electricity that turns the fuel and surrounding air into an
      electrically charged gas, or plasma. The plasma accelerates
      reaction rates allowing the production of hydrogen-rich gas in a
      compact device--the plasmatron.<br>
      <br>
      Plasmatrons have traditionally been used to produce hydrogen-rich
      gas for industrial applications like metallurgical processing.
      They are usually quite large--about the size of a car engine--and
      require large amounts of electrical power. "We're the first to
      develop a compact, low-power plasmatron," said Dr. Cohn. "To our
      knowledge no-one has created one that's this small (you can hold
      it in your hand) and that operates at low power (around one
      kilowatt)."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers noted that conventional ways to produce
      hydrogen-rich gas involve devices that, among other limitations,
      are presently bulky, heavy, and can't effectively process biocrude
      oils. "They can basically do gasoline, methanol and, with a
      stretch, diesel," Dr. Bromberg said.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, the new plasmatron works well with a variety of
      fuels. "We've shown a very high degree of conversion (over 90
      percent) of gasoline, diesel, and biocrude fuels into
      hydrogen-rich gas," Dr. Cohn said.<br>
      <br>
      Although in principle the plasmatron could process all of the fuel
      for a vehicle, the researchers say that at present it's most
      cost-effective to convert only a fraction of the fuel into
      hydrogen-rich gas. That's because even though such gas increases
      the efficiency of an engine, the plasmatron itself consumes
      energy. "Processing a fraction of the fuel should prevent any
      decrease in net fuel consumption efficiency, and may in some cases
      improve net efficiency," Dr. Cohn said.<br>
      <br>
      Pollution reduction is significant. For example, converting 25-50
      percent of gasoline into hydrogen-rich gas "could reduce nitrogen
      oxide levels by a factor of five to ten relative to operation
      without hydrogen-rich gas," Dr. Cohn said. For natural gas, even
      less fuel need be converted for similar pollution reductions.<br>
      <br>
      Biocrude oils have their own environmental benefits. "Such oils
      might be produced by fast-growing trees or other crops that absorb
      carbon dioxide, compensating for the carbon dioxide produced by
      combustion," explained Dr. Cohn.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are currently working to increase the efficiency
      and yields of the plasmatron. They are also developing designs
      that will give a longer lifetime for the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In a parallel effort, they are conducting experiments on the
      effects of hydrogen-rich gas on internal combustion engines. The
      original experiments to this end that found significant benefits
      to the use of such gas were conducted in the 70s. "We want to
      reexamine engine performance with hydrogen using modern engines,"
      Dr. Cohn said.<br>
      <br>
      The new plasmatron grew out of work conducted over 15 years ago by
      Dr. Rabinovich, who was then an engineer in the former Soviet
      Union. Drs. Rabinovich, Cohn and Bromberg have written several
      papers on this topic, and in 1995 received a patent on using the
      plasmatron in internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      The work is supported by the DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle
      Technologies. Dr. Cohn noted that "we'd been considering these
      applications for some time, but it wasn't until we received this
      DOE funding that we could really move forward to try to validate
      our concepts for vehicular applications."<br>

      <br>
      The world's smallest oil refinery sits in a first-floor lab at
      MIT. Called a plasmatron, it looks a bit like a spark plug that
      ate too much. And what an appetite it has! MIT researcher Daniel
      Cohn has fed the plasmatron gasoline, diesel, even canola oil.
      Eagerly swallowing anything that burns, the device lets go with a
      belch of electricity that turns the fuel and surrounding air into
      plasma, a hot collection of charged atoms and electrons. What
      comes out is a hydrogen-rich gas that burns far more cleanly than
      garden-variety gasoline. <br>
      <br>
      Cohn and his colleagues are betting a version of their device
      would work wonders on the family automobile. Tucked beneath the
      driver's door, a soup-can-size plasmatron could siphon off a
      fraction of the fuel traveling from the gas tank, refine it in
      just a second, then send it to the engine. Together, the
      charged-up gas and untreated fuel would burn so readily that the
      engine would in turn run more efficiently, producing only a
      fraction of the normal smog-causing pollutants. Best of all, the
      microplasmatron works with ordinary gasoline — no fancy new fuels
      required.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers have known for years that adding hydrogen to fuel makes
      an engine run cleaner. "The trick was figuring out how to produce
      hydrogen quickly and compactly on board," Cohn says. He and his
      researchers got the plasmatron idea from colleagues working in
      metallurgy who mix hydrogen-rich gases with oxygen-rich compounds
      to extract metals. In miniature form, the plasmatron would
      function as a kind of super-carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype plasmatron at MIT could convert about one-quarter of
      a typical automobile's fuel into hydrogen. Enough, Cohn says, to
      cut emission of smog-causing nitrogen oxides by 90 percent. Having
      proven the plasmatron works in the lab, researchers now plan to
      try it in a stationary engine. If they're successful, the device
      could be cleaning up cars, trucks, and buses around the world in
      less than a decade.<br>

          is significant step closer to road tests </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An MIT device that could drastically cut smog-producing emissions
      from cars and other vehicles is a significant step closer to
      moving from the lab to the road. The device, known as a
      plasmatron, is expected to be inexpensive and readily compatible
      with present engine technology.<br>
      <br>
      Recently the plasmatron was installed in a commercial car engine
      for the first time. It operated reliably over two weeks, and met
      its inventors' expectations for reducing emissions of pollutants,
      particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx). NOx emissions were reduced by
      two orders of magnitude compared to the normal emissions of an
      engine running on gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a major milestone in showing the feasibility of a
      plasma-boosted fuel reformer for reducing vehicle pollution," said
      Daniel R. Cohn, head of the Plasma Technology Division at the
      Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). Dr. Cohn will be
      presenting the work November 18 at a meeting of the American
      Physical Society.<br>
      <br>
      Now that the researchers have successfully coupled the plasmatron
      to an engine, the next step is to install the device in an actual
      vehicle. "We're ready to take the show on the road," Dr. Cohn
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Cohn's colleagues on the current work are PSFC principal
      research engineer Leslie Bromberg, PSFC research engineer
      Alexander Rabinovich, PSFC visiting scientist Nikolai Alexeev, and
      five engineers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where the
      engine tests were conducted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW IT WORKS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Essentially the plasmatron, which is about the size of a wine
      bottle, works as an onboard "oil refinery." It converts a variety
      of fuels into high-quality hydrogen-rich gas. Adding only a small
      amount of such gas to the fossil fuel powering a car is known to
      significantly decrease emissions of pollutants like NOx.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel injected into the plasmatron is exposed to an electric
      discharge that turns the fuel and surrounding air into an
      electrically charged gas, or plasma. The plasma accelerates
      reaction rates allowing the production of hydrogen-rich gas.<br>
      <br>
      Plasmatrons have traditionally been used to produce hydrogen-rich
      gas for industrial applications like metallurgical processing.
      They are usually quite large--about the size of a car engine--and
      require large amounts of electrical power. "To our knowledge we're
      the first to develop a plasma-boosted fuel reformer that's this
      small and that operates at low power (less than one kilowatt),"
      said Dr. Cohn.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CURRENT RESULTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "The real achievement of the recent tests was our ability to run
      our new plasmatron connected to an engine for long periods of
      time," Dr. Rabinovich said. "We ran it reliably for four to six
      hours a day over two weeks, with no traces of deterioration."<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the researchers found that emissions of key
      pollutants were significantly reduced. For example, NOx was
      reduced from an average 2,700 parts per million without the
      plasmatron to 20 ppm with the device.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first time anyone's been able to integrate a compact
      plasma-boosted fuel reformer with an auto engine and show a large
      reduction in pollutants," Dr. Cohn said. In an actual vehicle
      these reductions will not be as dramatic (due to help from the
      catalytic converter), but the researchers still expect to reduce
      NOx emissions by a factor of 10.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers believe that the plasmatron used in the current
      tests has the basic features needed for commercial attractiveness.
      For example, they estimate that the entire plasmatron system could
      cost no more than two to three hundred dollars. Moreover, the only
      component that may need to be replaced-an electrode-is very
      inexpensive and can be changed as easily as a spark plug.<br>
      <br>
      The next step in the work-placing the plasmatron in an actual
      vehicle-will require integrating the system to the vehicle's
      onboard computer. Dr. Rabinovich also notes that "the plasmatron
      will require some additional room, but there's no need for a major
      redesign of the vehicle." The team hopes to put the device in a
      bus within a year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VARIETY OF FUELS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The recent engine tests were conducted using gasoline. However,
      laboratory tests with the plasmatron alone have shown that the
      device can also process diesel and biocrude fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Although in principle the device could process all of the fuel for
      a vehicle, the researchers say that it's most cost-effective to
      convert only a fraction of the fuel into hydrogen-rich gas. That's
      because even though such gas increases the efficiency of an
      engine, the plasmatron itself consumes energy. The best results in
      the recent tests were achieved by converting 25 percent of the
      gasoline into hydrogen-rich gas.<br>
      <br>
      The plasmatron grew out of work conducted over 15 years ago by Dr.
      Rabinovich, who was then an engineer in the former Soviet Union.
      Dr. Alexeev, a colleague of Dr. Rabinovich's at the time, came to
      MIT this year to join his friend on the team (he has since
      returned to Russia). The plasmatron also owes a debt to basic
      research at MIT on fusion power, which uses plasmas.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have five patents related to the plasmatron. The
      work is supported by the DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies.

          Engine Efficiency</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A plasmatron is a device that can convert gasoline and diesel fuel
      into hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used in diesel engines to reduce
      nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers and colleagues from industry report that the
      plasmatron, used with an exhaust treatment catalyst on a diesel
      engine bus, removed up to 90 percent of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from
      the bus’s emissions. Nitrogen oxides are the primary components of
      smog.<br>
      <br>
      The plasmatron reformer also cut in half the amount of fuel needed
      for the removal process. “The absorption catalyst approach under
      consideration for diesel exhaust NOx removal requires additional
      fuel to work,” explained Daniel R. Cohn, one of the leaders of the
      team and head of the Plasma Technology Division at MIT's Plasma
      Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). “The plasmatron reformer reduced
      that amount of fuel by a factor of two compared to a system
      without the plasmatron.” <br>
      <br>
      In gasoline engines the use of plasmatrons will boost car fuel
      efficiency by 20 percent.<br>
      <br>
      "If widespread use of plasmatron hydrogen-enhanced gasoline
      engines could eventually increase the average efficiency of cars
      and other light-duty vehicles by 20 percent, the amount of
      gasoline that could be saved would be around 25 billion gallons a
      year," Cohn said. "That corresponds to around 70 percent of the
      oil that is currently imported by the United States from the
      Middle East."<br>
      <br>
      The Bush administration has made development of a hydrogen-powered
      vehicle a priority, Heywood noted. "That's an important goal, as
      it could lead to more efficient, cleaner vehicles, but is it the
      only way to get there? Engines using plasmatron reformer
      technology could have a comparable impact, but in a much shorter
      time frame," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Our objective is to have the plasmatron in production—and in
      vehicles—by 2010," Smaling said. ArvinMeritor is working with a
      vehicle concept specialist company to build a proof-of-concept
      vehicle that incorporates the plasmatron in an internal combustion
      engine. "We'd like to have a driving vehicle in one and a half
      years to demonstrate the benefits," Smaling said.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, the team continues to improve the base
      technology. At the DEER meeting, Bromberg, for example, reported
      cutting the plasmatron's consumption of electric power "by a
      factor of two to three." <br>

      Substantial progress in engine emission control is needed in order
      to meet present and proposed regulations for both spark ignition
      and diesel engines. Tightening regulations throughout the world
      reflect the ongoing concern with vehicle emissions. Recently
      developed compact plasmatron fuel converters have features that
      are suitable for onboard production of hydrogen for both fuel
      pretreatment and for exhaust aftertreatment applications. Systems
      that make use of these devices in conjunction with aftertreatment
      catalysts have the potential to improve significantly prospects
      for reduction of diesel engine emissions. Plasmatron fuel
      converters can provide a rapid response compact means to transform
      efficiently a wide range of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen rich
      gas. They have been used to reform natural gas [Bromberg1],
      gasoline [Green], diesel [Bromberg2] and hard-to-reform biofuels
      [Cohn1] into hydrogen rich gas (H2 + CO). The development of these
      devices has been pursued for the purpose of reducing engine
      exhaust pollutants by providing hydrogen rich gas for combustion
      in spark ignition and possibly diesel engines, as shown in Figure
      1 [Cohn2]. Recent developments in compact plasmatron reformer
      design at MIT have resulted in substantial decreases in electrical
      power requirements. These new developments also increase the
      lifetime of the electrodes.<br>

      A plasmatron fuel reformer has been developed for onboard hydrogen
      generation for vehicular applications. These applications include
      hydrogen addition to spark-ignition internal combustion engines,
      NOx trap and diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration, and
      emissions reduction from spark ignition internal combustion
      engines First, a thermal plasmatron fuel reformer was developed.
      This plasmatron used an electric arc with relatively high power to
      reform fuels such as gasoline, diesel and biofuels at an oxygen to
      carbon ratio close to 1. The draw back of this device was that it
      has a high electric consumption and limited electrode lifetime due
      to the high temperature electric arc. A second generation
      plasmatron fuel reformer was developed. It used a low-current
      high-voltage electric discharge with a completely new electrode
      continuation. This design uses two cylindrical electrodes with a
      rotating discharge that produced low temperature volumetric cold
      plasma., The lifetime of the electrodes was no longer an issue and
      the device was tested on several fuels such as gasoline, diesel,
      and biofuels at different flow rates and different oxygen to
      carbon ratios. Hydrogen concentration and yields were measured for
      both the thermal and non-thermal plasmatron reformers for
      homogeneous (non-catalytic) and catalytic reforming of several
      fuels. The technology was licensed to an industrial auto part
      supplier (ArvinMeritor) and is being implemented for some of the
      applications listed above. The Plasmatron reformer has been
      successfully tested on a bus for NOx trap regeneration. The
      successful development of the plasmatron reformer and its
      implementation in commercial applications including transportation
      will bring several benefits to the nation. These benefits include
      the reduction of NOx emissions, improving engine efficiency and
      reducing the nation's oil consumption. The objective of this
      program has been to develop attractive applications of plasmatron
      fuel reformer<br>

      Today's form of jet engine power comes from what is called a gas
      turbine engine. This engine is on average 14% efficient and emits
      great quantities of green house gas carbon dioxide and air
      pollutants, Le. nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The alternate
      method being researched involves a reformer and a solid oxide fuel
      cell (SOFC). Reformers are becoming a popular area of research
      within the industry scale. NASA Glenn Research Center's approach
      is based on modifying the large aspects of industry reforming
      processes into a smaller jet fuel reformer. This process must not
      only be scaled down in size, but also decrease in weight and
      increase in efficiency. In comparison to today's method, the Jet A
      fuel reformer will be more efficient as well as reduce the amount
      of air pollutants discharged. The intent is to develop a 10kW
      process that can be used to satisfy the needs of commercial jet
      engines. Presently, commercial jets use Jet-A fuel, which is a
      kerosene based hydrocarbon fuel. Hydrocarbon fuels cannot be
      directly fed into a SOFC for the reason that the high temperature
      causes it to decompose into solid carbon and Hz. A reforming
      process converts fuel into hydrogen and supplies it to a fuel cell
      for power, as well as eliminating sulfur compounds. The SOFC
      produces electricity by converting H2 and CO2. The reformer
      contains a catalyst which is used to speed up the reaction rate
      and overall conversion. An outside company will perform a catalyst
      screening with our baseline Jet-A fuel to determine the most
      durable catalyst for this application. Our project team is
      focusing on the overall research of the reforming process.
      Eventually we will do a component evaluation on the different
      reformer designs and catalysts. The current status of the project
      is the completion of buildup in the test rig and check outs on all
      equipment and electronic signals to our data system. The objective

      feed to products. Hexadecane yielded products containing 60%
      hydrogen on a dry, nitrogen-free basis at 800 C. For the two
      diesel fuels, higher temperatures, &gt;850 C, were required to
      approach similar levels of hydrogen in the product stream. At 800

      Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process to convert
      hydrocarbon fuels to clean hydrogen feeds for a polymer
      electrolyte fuel cell. The process incorporates an autothermal
      reforming catalyst that can process hydrocarbon feeds at lower

      tested the catalyst with three diesel-type fuels: hexadecane,
      certified low-sulfur grade 1 diesel, and a standard grade 2
      diesel. Hexadecane yielded products containing 60% hydrogen on a
      dry, nitrogen-free basis at 850 C, while maximum hydrogen product
      yields for the two diesel fuels were near 50%. Residual products
      in all cases included CO, CO{sub 2}, ethane, and methane. Further
      studies with grade 1 diesel showed improved conversion as the
      water:fuel ratio was increased from 1 to 2 at 850 C. Soot
      formation was reduced when the oxygen:carbon ratio was maintained
      at 1 at 850 C. There were no significant changes in hydrogen yield
      as the space velocity and the oxygen:fuel ratio were varied. Tests

      A reformer is disclosed that includes a plasma zone to receive a
      pre-heated mixture of reactants and ionize the reactants by
      applying an electrical potential thereto. A first thermally
      conductive surface surrounds the plasma zone and is configured to
      transfer heat from an external heat source into the plasma zone.
      The reformer further includes a reaction zone to chemically
      transform the ionized reactants into synthesis gas comprising
      hydrogen and carbon monoxide. A second thermally conductive
      surface surrounds the reaction zone and is configured to transfer
      heat from the external heat source into the reaction zone. The
      first thermally conductive surface and second thermally conductive
      surface are both directly exposed to the external heat source. A
      corresponding method and system are also disclosed and claimed

      In this study, a plasmatron reactor was used for gasifying the
      waste of distillers grains at different temperatures (773, 873,
      973 K) and water flow rates (1, 2, 3 mL min(-1)), which were
      heated to produce steam. Among all the gas products, syngas was
      the major component (88.5 wt.% or 94.66 vol.%) with temperatures
      yielding maximum concentrations at 873 K with a relatively high
      reaction rate. The maximum concentrations regarding gaseous
      production occurring times are all below 1 min. With the increase
      of steam, the recovery mass yield of syngas also increases from
      34.14 to 45.47 approximately 54.66 wt.% at 873 K. Water-gas
      reactions and steam-methane reforming reactions advance the
      production of syngas with the increase of steam. Furthermore, the
      water-shift reaction also increases in the context of steam
      gasification which leads to the decrease of CO(2) at the same
      time. PMID:20163957<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Depending on the market, refiner`s plans to produce clean fuels
      and higher value petrochemicals will weigh heavily on the
      catalytic reformer`s flexibility. It seems that as soon as a
      timely article related to catalytic reforming operations is
      published, a new {open_quotes}boutique{close_quotes} gasoline fuel
      specification is slapped on to existing fuel standards, affecting
      reformer operations and processing objectives. Just as
      importantly, the petrochemical market (such as aromatics) that
      refiners are targeting, can be very fickle. That`s why process
      engineers have endeavored to maintain an awareness of the
      flexibility that technology suppliers are building into modern
      catalytic reformers.<br>

      In this paper a control system for autothermal reforming reactor
      for diesel fuel is presented. Autothermal reforming reactors and
      the pertaining purification reactors are used to convert diesel
      fuel into hydrogen-rich reformate gas, which is then converted
      into electricity by the fuel cell. The purpose of the presented
      control system is to control the hydrogen production rate and the
      temperature of the autothermal reforming reactor. The system is
      designed in such a way that the two control loops do not interact,
      which is required for stable operation of the fuel cell. The
      presented control system is a part of the complete control system
      of the diesel fuel cell auxiliary power unit (APU).<br>

      An apparatus for reforming fuel oil wherein ultrasonic waves are
      utilized. The apparatus comprises a closed vessel, a rotary
      collector formed in a cylindrical shape, an inlet conduit for
      supplying fuel oil to be reformed into the vessel, an outlet
      conduit for delivering reformed oil from the vessel, and a
      ultrasonic irradiating device. The rotary collector has a layered
      mesh structure of a fine mesh, preferably of mesh size between 2
      mu M and 20 mu m, mounted thereon so that sludge contained in the
      fuel oil to be reformed is collected on the layered mesh
      structure. One end of a horn connected to the ultrasonic wave
      irradiating device faces the layered mesh structure forming a
      small gap therebetween so that the sludge collected on the layered
      mesh structure is dissociated by the ultrasonic waves.<br>

      is operated at high pressure. To compensate for the negative
      effects of high pressure, various modifications to the plasma
      gasifier are disclosed. For example, by moving the slag, more
      material is exposed to the plasma, allowing better and more
      complete processing thereof. In some embodiments, magnetic fields
      are used to cause movement of the slag and molten metal within the
      vessel. An additional embodiment is to add microwave heating of
      the slag and/or the incoming material. Microwave heating can also

      The present invention provides a relatively compact and highly
      robust waste-to-energy conversion system and apparatus which has
      the advantage of complete or substantially complete conversion of
      a wide range of waste streams into useful gas and a stable,
      nonleachable solid product at a single location with greatly
      reduced air pollution to meet air quality standards. The gas may
      be utilized in a combustion process to generate electricity and
      the solid product can be suitable for various commercial
      applications. Alternatively, the solid product stream, which is a
      safe, stable material, may be disposed of without special
      considerations as hazardous material. In one embodiment of the
      invention, the conversion system includes an arc plasma furnace
      directly coupled to a joule heated melter. In an alternative and
      preferred embodiment of the invention, the arc plasma furnace and
      joule heated melter are formed as a completely integrated unit
      having circuit arrangements for the simultaneous operation of both
      the arc plasma and the joule heated portions of the unit without
      interference with one another. The apparatus may additionally be
      employed without further use of the gases generated by the
      conversion process.<br>

      The system includes a source of emissions and a catalyst for
      receiving the emissions. Suitable catalysts are absorber catalysts
      and selective catalytic reduction catalysts. A plasma fuel
      converter generates a reducing gas from a fuel source and is
      connected to deliver the reducing gas into contact with the
      absorber catalyst for regenerating the catalyst. A preferred
      reducing gas is a hydrogen rich gas and a preferred plasma fuel
      converter is a plasmatron. It is also preferred that the absorber
      catalyst be adapted for absorbing NOx.<br>

      A novel apparatus and method is disclosed for a plasmatron fuel
      converter ("plasmatron") that efficiently uses electrical energy
      to produce hydrogen rich gas. The volume and shape of the plasma
      discharge is controlled by a fluid flow established in a plasma
      discharge volume. A plasmatron according to this invention
      produces a substantially large effective plasma discharge volume
      allowing for substantially greater volumetric efficiency in the
      initiation of chemical reactions within a volume of bulk fluid
      reactant flowing through the plasmatron.<br>

      The plasma fuel converter includes an electrically conductive
      structure for forming a first electrode and a second electrode is
      disposed to create a gap with respect to the first electrode in a
      reaction chamber. A fuel-air mixture is introduced into the gap
      and the power supply is connected to the first and second
      electrodes to provide voltage in the range of approximately 100
      volts to 40 kilovolts and current in the range of approximately 10
      milliamperes to 1 ampere to generate a glow discharge to reform
      the fuel. The high voltage low current plasmatron of the invention
      is low cost, has long electrode life, utilizes a simple power
      supply and control and eliminates the need for an air compressor.<br>
