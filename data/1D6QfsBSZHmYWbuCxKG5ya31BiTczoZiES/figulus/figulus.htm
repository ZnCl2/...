      <p>We dissolve the living body with Apollo’s fire --- <br>
        So that what was before a Stone may become a Spirit. <br>
        From the inmost parts of this we extract Gold, <br>
        Which, with natal seed, cleanses impure ores from the dross of
        their mother. <br>
        After we have separated the bones, these kindred we then wash

        From them is born a Bird, arrayed in various colours, and, being
        made white, it flies into the air. <br>
        So we with new fire paint its wings, and, being coloured, imbue
        them with its milk: <br>
        As for the rest, we feed it with Blood, <br>
        Until, full grown, it may bear the fury of Mulciber (i.e.,
        Vulcan-fire). <br>
        This Bird, O Gulielmus! The Thrice Great Hermes called his own,
        <br>
        And the whole world has not its like. <br>
        O Christ, graciously grant that this blessed long-desired bird
        be born in our Garden! </p>

        Masters and Beneficient Patrons. </p>
      <p><i>Here Follows the Prolocutory, Dedicatory Speech.</i> </p>
      <p>Worshipful, Noble, etc., generous Masters and Patrons, when
        reviewing the whole course of my studies, from my youth up, I
        find ---- and have indeed hitherto found in my work, and clearly
        experienced more and more with the lapse of time, as daily
        experience shews is wont to happen to the true believer and
        right naturalist --- that there are three kinds of Philosophy or
        Wisdom, of which the world partly makes use, some more than
        others, some of this and others of that. Yet one of these Three
        alone is Eternal, Indestructible, and may stand before God
        Almighty (of which, however, but few students are found) because
        it proceeds and flows from above from the Father of Light. Now,
        the First is the Common Philosophy of Aristotle, of Plato, and
        of our own time, which is but a Cagastrian Philosophy,
        Speculation, and Phantasy, with which, even at the present day,
        all the Schools are filled, and by which they are befouled, and
        beloved youth thereby led astray. The same is inane, erroneous,
        empty chatter; and far removed from the foundation of Truth.
        Even at the present day it is blasphemously defended, tooth and
        nail, with all sorts of opinions, ideas, imaginations, and
        erroneous thoughts of the old heathen (who were held to be
        Sages), which were accepted as the Truth. For it is derived from
        an unpropitious Heaven and Stars, evil Influences, also
        Inspirations of Satan, and at that time was considered a great
        mystery and Sacred Thing, as it also is at this present by the
        great majority of learned me. But this is an erroneous, false,
        fatal, misleading sophistry, which, like the body in the grave,
        is brought to naught but dust and ashes, and is the same against
        which the inspired Apostle Paul warns us in his Epistle: “Beware
        of vain Philosophy”, and “Beware lest any man spoil you through
        philosophy and vain deceit”. </p>
      <p>This Philosophy, although, from my youth up, it was earnestly
        and diligently inculcated, and forced upon me, in the Schools
        (as unfortunately occurs to others at the present day), yet, by
        special interposition of the Holy Spirit, it became so suspected
        by me that I never would, nor could, torture my head, mind, and
        soul with it, nor persuade my heart that the same was a sacred
        thing, nor cleave unto it as others did; but, according to my
        childish judgment, let the matter rest there until, about the
        year 1587 or 1588, another philosophy came into my hands. At the
        same time I had, in my own mind, firmly resolved not to remain
        the least among my fellow scholars, but in due time to graduate
        in advance of all. </p>
      <p>But it has pleased God otherwise in His Divine Providence, and
        all sorts of impediments on the part of my superiors hindered on
        the part of my superiors hindered the course of my studies,
        until at last, in 1587-88, the books and writings of
        Theophrastus, of Roger Bacon, and of M. Isaac the Hollander,
        fell into my hands; in which I, especially in medicine) for they
        wrote about the Universal Stone and Medicine), saw and found a
        better foundation, and yet understood it not at first. But I
        took such a liking to the subject that I resolved not to die,
        nor yet to take my ease, until I had obtained this Universal
        Stone and Blessed Heavenly Medicine. However, the poverty of my
        parents and the impossibility of obtaining the necessary funds
        (for at that time but few princes and nobles patronized this
        study) compelled me unwillingly to relinquish my plan, although
        I was so eager for it that, for many months, I could not sleep
        on account of it. At last, in 1590, I found myself plunged by
        the devil and his friends into great misery, misfortune, and
        sickness, out of which God mercifully helped me when my death
        would have been preferred to my recovery, and when, from reasons
        of poverty, I had been held to commerce against my will, by my
        relatives, suffering all manner of persecution, partly from the
        Anti-Christian mob, partly from false brethren, wife and
        friends, tortured, plagued and agitated, and thus thoroughly
        tried by the devil. </p>
      <p>But having been rescued from the same by God’s fatherly care, I
        turned my attention for some years to poetry, whereunto, when I
        found that it was irksome to all, I said good bye; and, only
        three years ago, I returned to this true Philosophy, the Study
        of Medicine and the Theophrastic School --- for which God be
        praised --- and have publicly declared myself a disciple of
        Paracelsus. From this neither the devil nor the world, with is
        serpents and viper brood, shall, or can, ever turn me away. </p>
      <p>The other philosophy can never teach us the “know thyself”, nor
        the foundation of Natural Revelation, in which some heathen
        philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, had progressed so far
        that they might with reason be preferred to many professed
        Christians of today. He especially from the stars and the
        creatures of this earth learnt more about Nature than our
        arrogant, boasting philosophers, who, at bottom, understanding
        nothing themselves, would fain teach others. </p>
      <p>But this our Hermetic Philosophy, which comprises the true
        Astronomy, Alchemy, and magic, as also Cabala, etc., is an
        extremely ancient, true, Natural Science, derived from Adam,
        who, both before and after the Fall, had full knowledge of all
        things, and handed it down from father to son through the
        patriarchs and dear friends of God. After the Flood the general
        understanding and knowledge of this true natural philosophy
        became weakened in force and scattered in fragments in all
        directions; hence arose a subdividing of the whole into parts
        ---- and one has become an Astronomy, another a Magician, a
        third a Cabalist, a fourth an Alchemist, and especially did it
        afterwards flourish in Egypt. For instance, the smith, Abraham
        Tubalkain, past master in all kinds of brass and iron work, and
        also an excellent Astrologer and Arithmetician, brought these
        arts with him from Egypt into the Land of Canaan. And the great
        skill, wisdom, and knowledge in the above arts attained by the
        Egyptians was by them also communicated to other nations. </p>
      <p>The Chaldeans, Hebrews, Persians, Egyptians, have also always
        possessed and cultivated this knowledge, together with Theology
        and instruction in Divine things. Thus, Moses was so informed by
        all good arts in the schools of the Egyptians that he became
        perfect in wisdom, and therefore was not in vain chosen by God
        to be the leader f the people of Israel. </p>
      <p>Thus also Daniel, from his youth up, learnt and imbibed this
        art in the Schools of the Chaldeans, as his Prophecies, and his
        skill in all kinds of interpretation before King Nebuchadnezar
        and&nbsp; King Belshazar, clearly and wondrously testify. Such
        Philosophers and Magi were also the Three Wise Men from the
        East, who sought Christ Jesus from the Rising of the Sun, and
        found him in a manger at Bethlehem. </p>
      <p>But subsequent to the origin of this Divine Magic and natural
        true Philosophy, namely, 27 years after the Flood --- about the
        year 1680, A.M. --- among the Chaldeans, Persians, and
        afterwards in Egypt, the idolatrous and superstitious Greeks,
        having heard of the same, their noblest and sagest men proceeded
        to Chaldea and Egypt, in order that they might learn such wisdom
        in their Schools. But they did not relish the teaching of God’s
        word from the Holy Bible and the Law of Moses, and, depending
        upon their reason and understanding, wished to be cleverer and
        wiser than God Himself, as is the wont of Lucifer and his
        disciples; for it always happens that where God builds a Church,
        the devil sets his chapel up beside it; as is also recorded in
        the New Testament, for when Christ, the greatest Spagyric
        Philosopher and Heavenly Sower, sowed His good seed, the Enemy
        immediately threw his tares and weeds upon it, which, alas,
        happens to this day. Therefore have they fallen away from the
        foundation and essence of all Natural Mysteries and hidden Arts,
        and have sought wisdom in the senseless, stupid, erroneous, and
        deceptive Star of Satan, with which they have obscured and
        diluted the truth. For their own pride and presumption have
        hindered, befooled, and plunged them into error. For, after
        having learnt a little from the Chaldeans and Egyptians, they
        became to puffed up and proud, depending more than was meet on
        their own understanding, that they began to criticize things
        with many false and vain inventions, and took themselves to
        ascribe them to a false philosophy, concocted in their own
        subtle brains, under the influence of that evil star; which
        false philosophy not only go the upper hand among the Greeks,
        but spread from them to the Latins, who, not less than the
        former, also wished to shew their own understanding immediately
        they had acquired a kittle knowledge, whence, instead of
        improving, increasing, or adorning, they have only made things
        worse. </p>
      <p>Now, by these this so-called Philosophy has been disseminated
        throughout entire Europe. Almost all Academies and High Schools
        teach it, to the neglect of Moses and the Prophets , even of
        Christ Himself not only in Germany, but in almost all other
        nations. When anyone advances aught of the true Philosophy,
        grounded in the Word of God, but which is contrary to theirs, he
        is not only condemned, mocked, and laughed at, but is called an
        eccentric, a heretic, and haeresiarch --- as has happened to me
        at the hands of certain pseudo-Levites --- or is even
        persecuted. The old proverb remains true: “The world wished to
        be deceived”. Satan is a clever juggler, using many deceptions
        with which he leads astray all Christendom, shewing the way unto
        the eternal night of hell with his dark lantern, which they take
        to be a true guiding light. Let him who would be deceived
        continue in his present course; on a certain day he will find,
        with eternal lamentations, howling, and gnashing of teeth, how
        hot hell is. </p>
      <p>But, generous Masters and Friends, if we would follow after the
        true Natural Philosophy, founded on the Light of Nature; if we
        would acquire the same as our Spagyric Philosophy, true
        Astronomy, and Magic, where and under whom we shall study this?
        Shall we seek the teachers and professors in the Universities?
        Verily, we shall not find it there, for they are the true
        enemies, mockers and persecutors of our Philosophy, and of all
        its adherents. “Art has no haters but the ignorant”. They would
        rather remain with the husks and chaff, which the wind strews
        hither and thither, than with the good nourishing grain, ye, and
        wheat from the great store-houses or treasury of the Eternal God
        and Bountiful Lord, which He gives and invites us to partake of
        Where then, I ask, shall we seek it, and in what school? Dear
        Masters and Friends, we neither can, nor should, nor must look
        for it elsewhere than in the Stars; there is the school from
        which everything is learned. </p>
      <p>All Natural Art and Wisdom are given by the Stars to men, and
        we are the disciples of the Stars. The Constellations are our
        natural teachers. From the light of Nature we must learn as from
        our father from whom we are made and begotten. The Stars are our
        lawful instructors, for all understanding and Art come to us
        from them. God has so ordered it that the natural light is in
        the Stars, and in the same has He laid the treasure of men to b
        obtained from them. But what man learns from the stars in all
        temporal knowledge, reason, art; what also is of the light of
        Nature must be derived from the same source. In short, the
        firmament teaches us whatsoever pertains to things temporal. But
        that which pertains to the immortal soul, and to the godly
        conversation of the inner man, all that must be learned from
        God. For it concerns the Image of God, and it is the office of
        the Holy Spirit to instruct men in things eternal. </p>
      <p>Now, there are two bodies in man, one formed from the elements,
        and the other from the stars. Through death the elementary body,
        with its spirit, is brought to the grave, and the ethereal body
        and spirit are consumed in their firmament. But the spirit of
        the Image foes to Him in whose image it is. Thus each one dies
        in that of which he is, and is buried in the same. Thus, also,
        does death divide from each other the three spirits of man.
        Therefore, the wise man is he who lives in the wisdom of the
        Lord, the same ruling over his planetary and elementary body.
        But, brethren, man should walk, as regards his earthly body,
        according to the law of Nature, as did the old heathen Sages;
        and, for the rest, in the Will of God and the Holy Spirit, and
        not set the mortal body with its wisdom above the Immortal Image
        (as almost all the world now des, with its fancied, spurious
        wisdom). Neither should he reject the Eternal Image for the
        animal body in his fancied wisdom, wherefore the Lord Jesus has
        not said in vain in His Gospel, concerning the tax penny.”
        “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God
        the things that are God’s”. What did He mean to convey by that?
        Why this, that the body, according to the natural life, belongs
        to Caesar, and shall be subject to him as to its earthly head
        upon earth. But the soul belongs to God, and the same shall be
        given again to God, and shall make answer for its work. That is,
        he shall return Him His Image according to the spiritual life,
        as to his Heavenly Lord, from whom body and soul each separately
        come. Therefore he shall walk in His laws according to the Will
        of God, that he may return to God his Image, and the eternal
        fiery breath of life entrusted him, as it were, shall be given
        into Abraham’s bosom, and no be cast out from before His Face
        eternally into outermost darkness on account of godless,
        devilish life and conversation. Such was Christ’s meaning and
        object. Now, he who lives according to the Image of the Lord,
        overcomes the stars, and should with reason be considered a wise
        man, although by a blind and senseless world he may be held as a
        fool. </p>
      <p>But to philosophize further concerning these things belongs not
        in this place to mortal philosophy, but to the Eternal, Immoral
        wisdom, which we have alluded to, which has Christ Jesus as its
        Founder, concerning whom we have the voice of the Father,
        saying: “Hear ye him”; so also His own voice calls to us
        (Matthew xi.): “Come unto Me all ye who are heavy laden… Learn
        from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart”, etc. From Him must
        we derive the Heavenly and Eternal Philosophy in order that we
        may come to the Kingdom of Heaven. Of the above Philosophy we
        will, D.V., treat briefly elsewhere. But in this place we must
        consider somewhat more at length the Mortal and Natural
        Philosophy. For I am, and will remain to my grave, the fervent
        disciple and follower of the Natural and Mortal, and the
        Supernatural Heavenly Instruction, having totally repudiated the
        false, heathen wisdom which proceeds not from the true light and
        groundwork of Nature, since beside Christ and His Wisdom there
        is in the world only vanity of vanities. But to return to our
        intention of exploring Nature. Generous Masters and Friends,
        this cannot be done by sitting at the fireside nor by poring
        over philosophical tomes. No, if we would explore Nature in our
        Philosophy, and attain the desired successful results, we must
        tread the books of Nature with our feet. Writings are examined
        by means of letters, but Nature by going from land to land. In
        this way one finds occasionally pious and faithful Nicodemuses,
        Naturalists, Philosophers, Explorers of Nature, and Lovers of
        our Spagyric Philosophy (I speak not now of the knavish,
        vagabond, false Alchemists, on whose account I would not move a
        step). From such as these, in addition to one’s own
        observations, one can often obtain much useful knowledge. Hence
        each fresh country is a new leaf in the Book of Nature. Thus is
        our Codex Naturae sufficiently large and ample, the leaves of
        which must be turned over with our feet, and examined with the
        spirit of understanding, and, although we be called vagabonds
        and land loupers by the big wigged doctors and syrup boilers,
        that matters nothing to me. The disciple should not fare better
        than his master, and the same thing has happened to
        Theophrastus, our dear Preceptor and Monarch of Arts, also to
        Alex. von Suchten, Phaedro, and others. Therefore, on my
        journeys I regard but little what is made by men’s hands though
        others think much of it, but the works of God alone, these I
        regard, admire, and seek to explore. To find out their three
        principles, to separate the pure from the impure, and thereby,
        to the praise and glory of God, to benefit myself and my
        neighbors in body and soul, is my highest endeavor. For all
        created things are living letters and books in which can be
        deciphered the origin of man, in which also may be read what man
        is. Before al things, let everyone commend to himself the Nosce
        teipsum, that he may know himself, as Aristotle said to
        Alexander the Great: “Know thyself and thou shalt possess all
        things”; and Morienus: “Those who do in themselves hold all
        things, are in need of no other aid”. </p>
      <p>Therefore also am I content with these three books, from which
        I may learn every wisdom. </p>
      <p>The first is the great, full-meaning Book of Nature, written
        not with ink or stylus, but by the finger of God, wherein, lying
        open before our eyes, are inscribed and registered Heaven,
        Earth, and all creatures therein, through the sacred impress of
        the Three in One --- which volume is called Macrocosmus. </p>
      <p>The second is the Small Book, which with all its leaves and
        pieces is taken from the larger work, and this is Man himself,
        for whose sake all that God has ever created is there; the same
        also is called Microcosmus. And man alone is the instrument of
        Natural Light, to fulfill and shew by arts and wisdom what God
        has ordered in the firmament. Also He has further ordered that
        man have a twofold magnet --- viz., one composed of three
        elements (his body), and hence also he attracts them to himself
        --- another of the stars, by which he attracts from the stars
        the Microcosmic tense. Therefore, the Reason of man has a magnet
        which attracts into itself the mind and thoughts of the Stars.
        From these, I say, yet another arises in the true believers,
        Magi, and Cabalists, and this third magnet is hidden in the
        image of God, in man’s soul. The same penetrates, through faith,
        to Him from whom it came, and seeks eternal wisdom from the Holy
        Ghost, promised by Christ to it. It must be well remembered that
        there are two souls in man, the Eternal and the Natural, that
        is, two lives. One is subject to death, the other resists death.
        Thus there also are two souls, the Eternal and the Natural ---
        the Natural soul is the starry body, and the starry body in the
        fleshly, and these two together form one man but two bodies. </p>
      <p>There are also two heavens in man, the one is Luna Cerebrum,
        the Cagastrian heaven. But in the heart of man is the true
        Iliastic, Necrocosmic heaven. Yes, the heart of man itself is
        the true heaven of Immortal being, out of which the Soul has
        never yet come, which New Olympus and Heaven Christ Jesus has
        chosen for a dwelling in all true believers. The third Book is
        the Holy Bible, the Holy Writ of the Old and New Testaments,
        which explains to us the two preceding Books. The Divine
        Chronicles, inspired by the Holy Ghost, shew how the Great World
        was created for the Small World (Man), who in the great world is
        fed, nourished, and preserved by God the Father. The same, after
        the Fall, was by God’s Son delivered from everlasting
        punishment, who also has ben born again through water and the
        Spirit, is fed with the Heavenly Manna and Immortal Food of the
        new Creature, and is guided by the Holy Ghost to the knowledge
        of all truth. </p>
      <p>Generous Masters and Friends, from these three Books we can, by
        the grace of God and the Holy Spirit, learn that which will
        profit us in body and soul for Time and Eternity, and avoid all
        heathenish deceitful books, of which the world is full. </p>
      <p>But to return to our occult Hermetic Philosophy: Beloved
        Masters and Friends, we, with others, have to complain not a
        little that, although innumerable devilish philosophers have
        written about the Universal medicine and the Philosopher’s
        Stone, yet both Heathens and Christians have left us true
        writings, which godless Cacosophists and pseudo-sophists have,
        for the most part, either wholly kept back or altered. </p>
      <p>Truly this is a trick of the devil, that his jugglery and lies,
        with which he for many centuries dazzled and befooled the world,
        may not be brought to light. </p>
      <p>We have further to complain of those who mutilate and falsify
        the works of true seekers after natural Wisdom and Art, for I
        have clearly discovered defects, alterations, and foreign matter
        in the <i>Triumphal Chariot</i> of Fr. Basilius, and also in
        the writings of A. von Suchten and Theophrastus. More
        especially, dear Friends, have we to complain of the devilish
        cunning way in which the works of Theophrastus have hitherto
        been suppressed, only a few of which (and those to be reckoned
        the very worst) having appeared in print. For although they have
        been collected together from all countries in which Theophrastus
        has lived and traveled --- the books he has written in
        Astronomy, Philosophy, Chemistry, Cabala, and Theology,
        numbering some thousand volumes --- yet the same has only been
        done from avarice to get riches. For, having been trafficked in
        and sold for great sums, they have become scattered among the
        courts of princes and nobles, while Christendom at large, for
        whose use and benefit Theophrastus wrote, has no part in them.
        Particularly his theological works (because they annihilate the
        godless, and do not suit children of this world ---
        belly-servers, deceived by the devil), have hitherto been
        totally suppressed. For which devilish end Thurneyser, a true
        instrument of Satan, who with his lies and false Alchemy has
        cheated all the world, Electors and Princes, great and small,
        has (amongst others whom I will here spare) been made great us
        of. </p>
      <p>But, at the Last Day, before the Judgment Seat of Christ, I,
        together with all true sons of the Doctrine, shall demand an
        account of them for having stolen, sold, divided, and shut Truth
        away in boxes, walls, and vaults, and behind locks and bolts.
        Now, these precious and revered writings were ordered by God in
        our latter times, through Theophrastus, for the use and weal of
        the whole of Christendom. As regards our dear, highly-favoured
        Monarch and Preceptor, Ph. Theophrastus, of blessed memory, we,
        for our part, will not suppress his Life, his well-merited
        praise, and his immortal fame, given him by God, the Angels, and
        the whole Firmament, but will heartily the whole Firmament, but
        will heartily defend his honour and teaching to the very end of
        our life. Therefore (D.V.), we shall shortly endeavor to promote
        the same in an especial manner by publishing, to begin with, his
        Cabalistic and Theological Books, for the weal and salvation of
        Christendom, in order that the three-headed Antichrist, or three
        unclean spirits in the Apocalypse, may be right well recognized
        and avoided by all. Being therefore resolved, with the aid of
        Christ, to publish as many of Theophrastus’ works as can be got
        together, I shall do so in the comforting assurance and hope of
        cordial assistance and support from all zealous, Christian
        lovers and followers of the true and Christian Philosophy,
        derived from our Heavenly Philosopher, Christ Jesus. Therefore,
        for the Honour and Glory of Christ, and for the long-suppressed
        Truth, and for the sake of this beloved and noble Philosophy,
        Magic, and Alchemy, as also for God’s sake, I call upon persons
        of high and low degree to assist me with such writings. For the
        same they shall be humbly and gratefully rewarded when we (D.V.)
        shortly reach our goal in Philosophy and Medicine. For then
        shall they learn and appreciate the truth of that which we and
        others have long sought for. </p>
      <p>“What though adverse omens be scanned by a reprobate world! Yet
        the goddess will fully triumph at last. </p>
      <p>“Sacred Truth is always enshrouded in darkness”. </p>
      <p>Generous masters and friends, as regards the present little
        book, called by me <i>The New Golden and Olympic Pandora</i>, I
        have wished to publish the same (faithfully and without guile,
        jus as I have received it) for the benefit of disciples of the
        Spagyric Doctrine. It treats of the Philosopher’s Stone, and has
        never appeared in print before. And, seeing that your Worships
        have for many years been special patrons of Alchemy and the
        Spagyric Art, possessing no little information and understanding
        in the same, I have wished to publish this book under your noble
        patronage, humbly begging your noble patronage, humbly begging
        you to accept thereof as from a well-known, yet poor disciple of
        the Theophrastian and Immortal Christian Philosophy, and to
        defend me and this philosophical book against all slanderers,
        mockers, and persecutors of these beloved Arts, and to assist in
        promoting and confirming the truth in every way. For which
        protection and favour, I will, by God’s Grace and Blessing,
        faithfully testify my gratitude by word and deed. </p>
      <p>Herewith commend I all and each of us to the Gracious Ward and
        Protection of God. </p>
      <p>Done in our Scholarly Hermit’s Cell, near Hagenau, on the day
        after the Festival of the Birth of Jesus Christ, our

      <center><b><font size="+1">The Book of The Revelation of Hermes,</font></b>
        <p><b>Interpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus,</b> </p>
        <p><b>Concerning</b> </p>
        <p><b>The Supreme Secret of the World.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hermes, Plato, Aristotle, and the other philosophers,
        flourishing a different times, who have introduced the Arts, and
        more especially have explored the secrets of inferior Creation,
        all these have eagerly sought a means whereby man’s body might
        be preserved from decay and become endued with immortality. To
        them it was answered that there is nothing which might deliver
        the moral body from death; but that there is One Ting which may
        postpone decay, renew youth, and prolong short human life (as
        with the patriarchs). For death was laid as a punishment upon
        our first parents, Adam and Eve, and will never depart from all
        their descendants. Therefore, the above philosophers, and many
        others, have sought this One Thing with great labour, and have
        found that which preserves the human body from corruption, and
        prolong life, conducts itself, with respect to other elements,
        as it were like the Heavens; from which thy understood that the
        Heavens are a substance above the Four Elements. And just as the
        Heavens, with respect to the other elements, are held to be the
        fifth substance (for they are indestructible, stable, and suffer
        no foreign admixture), so also this One Thing (compared to the
        forces of our body) is an indestructible essence, drying up all
        the superfluities of our bodies, and has been philosophically
        called by the above-mentioned name. It is neither hot and dry
        like fire, nor cold and moist like water, nor warm and moist
        like air, nor dry and cold like earth. But it is a skillful,
        perfect equation of all the Elements, a right commingling of
        natural forces, a most particular union of spiritual virtues, an
        indissoluble uniting of body and soul. It is the purest and
        noblest substance of an indestructible body, which cannot be
        destroyed nor harmed by the Elements, and is produced by Art.
        With this Aristotle prepared an apple prolonging life by its
        scent, when he, 15 days before his death, could neither eat nor
        drink on account of old age. This spiritual Essence, or One
        Thing, was revealed from above to Adam, and was greatly desired
        by the Holy Fathers, this also Hermes and Aristotle called the
        Truth without Lies, the most sure of all things certain, the
        Secret of all Secrets. It is the Last and the Highest Thing to
        be sought under the Heavens, a wondrous closing and finish of
        philosophical work, by which are discovered the dews of Heaven
        and the fastnesses of Earth. What the mouth of man cannot utter
        is all found in this spirit. As Morienus says: “He who has this
        has all things, and wants no other aid. For in it are all
        temporal happiness, bodily health, and earthly fortune. It is
        the spirit of the fifth substance, a Fount of all Joys (beneath
        the rays of the moon), the Supporter of Heaven and Earth, the
        Mover of Sea and Wind, the Outpourer of Rain, upholding the
        strength of all things, an excellent spirit above Heavenly and
        other spirits, giving Health, Joy, Peace, Love; driving away
        Hatred and Sorrow, bringing in Joy, expelling all Evil, quickly
        healing all Diseases, destroying Poverty and Misery, leading to
        all good things, giving man his heart’s desire, bringing to the
        pious earthly honour and long life, but to the wicked who misuse
        it, Eternal Punishment”. </p>
      <p>This is the Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot comprehend
        without the interposition of the Holy Ghost, or without the
        instruction of those who know it. The same is of a mysterious
        nature, wondrous strength, boundless power. The Saints, from the
        beginning of the world, have desired to behold its face. By
        Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as the
        Soul moves all the limbs of the Body, so also does this Spirit
        move all bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the
        Body, so also is this Spirit in all elementary created things.
        It is sought by many and found by few. It is beheld from afar
        and found near; for it exists in every thing, in every place,
        and at all times. It has the powers of all creatures; its action
        is sound in all elements, and the qualities of all things are
        therein, even in the highest perfection. By virtue of this
        essence did Adam and the Patriarchs preserve their health and
        live to an extreme age, some of them also flourishing in great
        riches. </p>
      <p>When the philosophers had discovered it, with great diligence
        and labour, they straightway concealed it under a strange
        tongue, and in parables, lest the same should become known to
        the unworthy, and the pearls be cast before swine. For if
        everyone knew it, all work and industry would cease; man would
        desire nothing but this one thing, people would live wickedly,
        and the world would be ruined, seeing that they would provoke
        God by reason of their avarice and superfluity. For eye hath not
        seen, nor ear heard, nor hath the heart of man understood what
        Heaven hath naturally incorporated with this Spirit. Therefore I
        have briefly enumerated some of the qualities of this Spirit, to
        the Honour of God, that the pious may reverently praise Him in
        His gifts (which gif of God shall afterwards come to them), and
        I will herewith shew what powers and virtues it possesses in
        each thing, also its outward appearance, that it may be more
        readily recognized. </p>
      <p>In its first state, it appears as an impure earthly body, full
        of imperfections. It then has an earthly nature, healing all
        sickness and wounds in the bowels of man, producing good and
        consuming proud flesh, expelling all stench, and healing
        generally, inwardly and outwardly. </p>
      <p>In its second nature, it appears as a watery body, somewhat
        more beautiful than before, because (although still having its
        corruptions) its Virtue is greater. It is much nearer the Truth,
        and more effective in works. In this form it cures cold and hot
        fevers, and is a specific against poisons, which it drives from
        heart and lungs, healing the same when injured or wounded,
        purifying the blood, and, taken three times a day, is of great
        comfort in all diseases. </p>
      <p>But in is third nature it appears as an aerial body, of an oily
        nature, almost freed from all imperfections, in which form it
        does many wondrous works, producing beauty and strength of body,
        and (a small quantity being taken in food) preventing melancholy
        and heating of the gall, increasing the quantity of the blood
        and seed, so that frequent bleeding becomes necessary. It
        expands the blood vessels, cures withered limbs, restores
        strength to the sight, in growing persons removes what is
        superfluous and makes good defects in the limbs. </p>
      <p>In its fourth nature it appears in a fiery form (not quite
        freed from all imperfections, still somewhat watery a d not
        dried enough), wherein it has many virtues, making the old young
        and reviving those at the point of death. For if to such an one
        there is given, in wine, a barleycorn’s weight of this fire, so
        that it reach the stomach, it goes to his heart, renewing him at
        once, driving away all previous moisture and poison, and
        restoring the natural heat of the liver. Given in small doses to
        old people, it removes the diseases of age, giving the old young
        hearts and bodies. Hence it is called the elixir of Life. </p>
      <p>In its fifth and last nature, it appears in a glorified and
        illuminated form, without defects, shining like gold and silver,
        wherein it possesses all previous powers and virtues in a higher
        and more wondrous degree. Here its natural works are taken for
        miracles. When applied to the roots of dead trees they revive,
        bringing forth leaves and fruit. A lamp, the oil of which is
        mingled with this spirit, continues to burn for ever without
        diminution. It converts crystals into the most precious stones
        of all colours, equal to those from the mines, and does man
        other incredible wonders which may not be revealed to the
        unworthy. </p>
      <p>For it heals all dead and living bodies without other medicine.
        Here Christ is my witness that I lie not, for all heavenly
        influences are united and combined therein. </p>
      <p>This essence also reveals all treasures in earth and sea,
        converts all metallic bodies into gold, and there is nothing
        like unto it under Heaven. </p>
      <p>This spirit is the secret, hidden from the beginning, yet
        granted by God to a few holy men for the revealing of these
        riches to His Glory --- dwelling in fiery form in the air, and
        leading earth with itself to Heaven, while from is body there
        flow whole rivers of living water. </p>
      <p>This spirit flies through the midst of the Heavens like a
        morning mist, leads its burning fire into the water, and has is
        shining realm in the heavens. </p>
      <p>And although these writings may be regarded as false by the
        reader, yet to the initiated they are true and possible, when
        the hidden sense is properly understood. For God is wonderful in
        His works, ad His Wisdom is without end. </p>
      <p>This spirit in its fiery form is called a <i>Sandaraca</i>, in
        the aerial a <i>Kybrick</i>, in the watery an Azoth, in the
        earthly Alcohoph and Aliocosoph. Hence they are deceived by
        these names who, seeking without instruction, think to find this
        Spirit of Life in things foreign to our Art. For although this
        spirit which we seek, on account of its qualities, is called by
        these names, yet the same is not in these bodies and cannot be
        in them. For a refined spirit cannot appear except in a body
        suitable to its nature. And, by however many names it be called,
        let no one imagine different spirits, for, say what one will,
        there is but one spirit working everywhere and in all things. </p>
      <p>That is the spirit which, when setting incorporates the purity
        of Earth, and when brooding has embraced the Waters. This spirit
        is named Raphael, the Angel of God, the subtlest and purest,
        whom the others obey as their King. </p>
      <p>This spiritual substance is neither heavenly nor hellish, but
        an airy, pure and hearty body, midway between the highest and
        lowest, without reason, but fruitful in works, and the most
        select and beautiful of all other heavenly things. </p>
      <p>This work of God is far too deep for understanding, for it is
        the last, greatest and highest secret of nature. It is the
        Spirit of God, which in the beginning filled the earth and
        brooded over the waters, which the world cannot grasp without
        the gracious interposition of the Holy Spirit and instruction
        from those who know it, which also the whole world desires for
        its virtue, and which cannot be prized enough. For it reaches to
        the planets, raises the clouds, drives away mists, gives light
        to all things, turns everything into Sun and Moon, bestows all
        health and abundance of treasure, cleanses the leper, brightens
        the eyes, banishes sorrow, heals the sick, reveals all hidden
        treasure, and, generally, cures all diseases. </p>
      <p>Through this spirit have the philosophers invented the Seven
        Liberal Arts, and gained thereby their riches. Through the same
        Moses made the golden vessels in the Ark, and King Solomon did
        many beautiful works to the honour of God. Therewith Moses built
        the Tabernacle, Noah the Ark, Solomon the Temple. By this Ezra
        restored the Law, and Miriam, Moses’ sister, was hospitable;
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and other righteous men, have had
        lifelong abundance and riches; and all the saints possessing it
        have therewith praised God. Therefore is its acquisition very
        hard, more than that of gold and silver. For it is the best of
        all things, because, of all things mortal that man can desire in
        this world, nothing can compare with it, and in it alone is
        truth. Hence it is called the Stone and Spirit of Truth; in its
        works is no vanity, its praise cannot be sufficiently expressed.
        I am unable to speak enough of its virtues, because its good
        qualities and powers are beyond human thoughts, unutterable by
        the tongue of man, and in it are found the properties of all
        things. Yea, there is nothing deeper in Nature. </p>
      <p>O unfathomable abyss of God’s Wisdom, which thus hath united
        and comprised in the virtue and power of this One Spirit the
        qualities of all existing bodies! O unspeakable honour and
        boundless joy granted to mortal man! For the destructible things
        of Nature are restored by virtue of the said Spirit. </p>
      <p>O mystery of mysteries, most secret of all secret things, and
        healing and medicine of all things! Thou last discovery in
        earthly natures, last best gift to Patriarchs and Sages, greatly
        desired by the whole world! Oh, what a wondrous and laudable
        spirit is purity, in which stand all joy, riches, fruitfulness
        of life, and art of all arts, a power which to its initiates
        grants all material joys! O desirable knowledge, lovely above
        all things beneath the circle of the Moon, by which Nature is
        strengthened, and heart and limbs are renewed, beauty in its
        perfection preserved, and abundance ensured in all things
        pleasing to men! O thou spiritual substance, lovely above all
        things! O thou wondrous power, strengthening all the world! O
        thou invincible virtue, highest of all that is, although
        despised by the ignorant, yet held by the wise in great praise,
        hour and glory --- wakest the dead, expellest diseases,
        restorest the voice of the dying! </p>
      <p>O thou treasure of treasures, mystery of mysteries, called by
        Avicenna “an unspeakable substance”, the purest and most perfect
        soul of the world, than which there is nothing more costly under
        Heaven, unfathomable in nature and power, wonderful in virtue
        and works, having no equal among creatures, possessing the
        virtues of all bodies under Heaven! For from it flow the water
        of life, the oil and honey of eternal healing, and thus hath it
        nourished them with honey and water from the rock. Therefore,
        saith Morienus: “He who hath it, the same hath all things”.
        Blessed art Thou, Lord God of our fathers, in that Thou hast
        given the prophets this knowledge and understanding, that they
        have hidden these things (lest they should be discovered by the
        blind, and those drowned in worldly godlessness) by which the
        wise and pious have praised Thee! For the discoverers of the
        mystery of this thing to the unworthy are breakers of the seal
        of Heavenly Revelation, thereby offending God’s Majesty, and
        bringing upon themselves many misfortunes and the punishments of
        God. </p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg all Christians, possessing this knowledge, to
        communicate the same to nobody, except it be to one living in
        Godliness, of well-roved virtue, and praising God, Who has given
        such a treasure to man. For many seek, but few find it. Hence
        the impure and those living in vice are unworthy of it.
        Therefore is this Art to be shewn to all God-fearing persons,
        because it cannot be bought with a price. I testify before God
        that I lie not, although it appear impossible to fools, that no
        one has hitherto explored Nature so deeply. </p>
      <p>The Almighty be praised for having created this Art and for
        revealing it to God-fearing men. Amen. </p>
      <p>And thus is fulfilled this precious and excellent work, called
        the revealing of the occult spirit, in which lie hidden the
        secrets and mysteries of the world. </p>
      <p>But this spirit is one genius, and Divine, wonderful, and
        lordly power. For it embraces the whole world, and overcomes the
        Elements and the fifth Substance. </p>
      <p>To our Trismegistus Spagyrus, Jesus Christ, Be praise and glory
        immortal. <br>
        Amen. </p>

              Distinguished Man, Alexander von Suchten, Doctor of
              Medicine and Philosophy.</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>An Elegy to Charles of Salzburg</b>.</p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Song begun was left unfinished, for he, who was to all as
        the Sun’s light, perished. </p>
      <p>The Knowledge of Medicine, by which Podilavius, Machaon,
        Apollo, and Hippocrates were famous, is not to be sought from
        Galenus, Avicenna, Mesnis, and other writers of this stamp, but
        from Magic; and he, who shall have rightly perceived the same,
        shall at length cure all diseases admitting of cure from death.
        But Magic has three Books: </p>
      <p>Firstly, Theology; Secondly, Medicine; and Thirdly, Astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>Whence the Magus knows and worships Trinity in Unity, and
        imparts the power he receives from God to suffering mortals. And
        those, be they Theologians, Astronomers, or Physicians, who shew
        not by their works what they profess with their mouths, are
        Caco-Magi and Pseudo-Prophets. By their fruits shall ye know
        them! </p>
      <p>XVII. Positions by which it is clearly demonstrated what a
        Physician is, and what his Medicine, also by means of what
        remedies diseases are expelled from human bodies. </p>
      <p>1. All diseases, whatever their nature, have their origin, or
        lie hidden in one of the principal members. </p>
      <p>2. Diseases can only be expelled by the generation of good
        blood in the diseased member. </p>
      <p>3. Good blood is generated by the nourishing of the sick member
        by means of digesting heat. </p>
      <p>4. By sickness natural heat is impeded, whereby nourishment
        digests less. </p>
      <p>5. Unless food be digested, blood is not generated. </p>
      <p>6. Natural heat, by which everything is digested for sustaining
        and multiplication of individuals, is the heat of the Sun and
        Moon. </p>
      <p>7. If the heat of the Sun and Moon existing in human bodies be
        impeded by any diseases, whereby it does is office less
        effectually, it is to be comforted with the heat of the Sun and
        Moon of the greater world, or with those things in which is the
        most potent virtue of Sun and Moon, applied by art. </p>
      <p>8. The heat of the Sun and Moon of the greater world cannot
        comfort the heat of the Sun and Moon of the lesser world except
        it be conjoined with the same, i.e., be converted&nbsp; into a
        simple spirit, like the spirit of life, which is done by
        dissolving it in nutriment. </p>
      <p>9. Nutriment, or that matter remaining in the stomach after the
        separation of superfluities, is a crude and undigested thing,
        convertible by natural heat into the substance of our bodies. </p>
      <p>10. The heat of the Sun and Moon is extracted, by a wonderful
        and occult art, from those things through which matter is most
        simply generated by the great and good God, from the Spirit of
        the World, for the restoration and conservation of human nature.
        The same is entirely unknown to Galenus, Avicenna, and all the
        other physicians of our time, who seek medicines in
        apothecaries’ shops. </p>
      <p>11. The spirit of the World and the spirit of our bodies are
        one and the same spirit. Therefore the heat of the Sun and Moon,
        generated from the food itself of this spirit, is a thing more
        decocted and digested, and consequently more perfect, and is
        called, by Plato Nature of the World, and by Pythagorus
        Philosophers’ Primal Mind, Divine Intellect, Image of Divine
        Intelligence, Visible Son of God; Orpheus, a most ancient
        theologian, calls it Jupiter; Dionysius, a disciple of St Paul,
        names it a Visible Image of God. </p>
      <p>12. For that heat is a most perfect spiritual entity, the
        greatest among all God’s creatures, and the nutriment in the
        stomach is the imperfect, corporeal matter, undergoing
        transmutation. </p>
      <p>13. Therefore we have here a task which, in some measure, has
        reference to both, viz., Solar and Spiritual Heat, and Material
        Nutriment, which medium is also called by philosophers the Fifth
        Essence. </p>
      <p>14. The heat of Sun and Moon, Fifth Essence, and Nutriment,
        when thus mixed in our bodies, produces the purest blood in
        which is heavenly virtue, freeing us from all disease, which
        nothing else in the whole world can do. For there are in this
        compound the virtues of all celestial and terrestrial bodies, so
        that the whole world is present in one drop of this same
        medicine. </p>
      <p>15. The Fifth Essence alone, by the aid of the physician,
        brings about durable health, which physician, however, is not
        Galena, nor Avicenna, nor Rhasis, nor Mesne, nor Serapio, but
        the same heat of Sun and Moon, the treasure of the wise, and
        inestimable glory of the whole world. </p>
      <p>16. The Fifth Essence is neither known by apothecaries nor sold
        in their shops. Therefore, apothecaries prepared not medicines,
        but rather poisons, with which they corrupt the complexion of
        the human body. </p>
      <p>17. The heat of Sun and Moon is not to be met with in the
        Schools of Bologna, Padua, Ferraria, Paris Louvain, or
        Wittenberg. Therefore, Doctors of Medicine graduating there are
        not physicians, but impostors and cheats, who, entering the
        temple of Apollo, not by the door but through the roof, occupy
        his seat, even as did the Scribes and Pharisees the seat of
        Moses. </p>
      <p>Therefore, not without cause do those whose intellect is
        obscured by the precepts and traditions of fools, and are hence
        unwilling to follow the wise, knowing the secrets of Nature, and
        curing so-called incurable maladies by natural means, accuse
        them of having a devil. For if they owned that these cures had
        been effected by means of that Medical Science, the very
        threshold of which they have never crossed, then doubtless all
        men would know tem to be no physicians, but impostors and
        shedders of human blood. </p>
      <p>Christ, Theologian, Astronomer, Physician. <br>
        To Christ alone be Glory. <br>

      <p>Aristotle says that every form of every nature, animal,
        vegetable, and mineral, is produced by the power of matter,
        intrinsically, except the Human Soul, which, being of a
        different and higher nature than matter, is given,
        extrinsically, by the Prime Motor, God Himself. It is this thing
        concerning which, all theologians and physicians disputing,
        nevertheless mostly conclude the Soul of man to be not produced
        from a germ, but, as it were, to be inspired and poured into the
        foetus in its mother’s womb, by God the Author of all life. </p>
      <p>But, since two different things cannot be mixed or joined into
        one, and the Soul being a certain Divine light and substance,
        emanating immortal from Divine springs, so produced,
        incorporeally, that it is dependent on the virtue of the Agent,
        no on the bosom of matter, the same is a primum mobile, and. As
        they say, spontaneous and self-moving: And, on the other hand,
        the Body is wholly earthly matter, having its origin in gross,
        rank. Elementary matter, mortal of itself, unfit for motion, and
        therefore far inferior to the Soul; wherefore it can never be
        united to the Soul, so different from itself, except through a
        third, a medium participating in the nature of each, a
        quasi-body and quasi-soul, by which the Soul may be added and
        joined to the Body. </p>
      <p>But such medium they suppose to be the Spirit or Soul of the
        World, i.e., what we call Fifth Essence, because it consists not
        of the four elements, but is a certain fifth one, above and
        beside them. Such Spirit necessarily requires, as it were, a
        binding chain, whereby Celestial Souls may bestow on grosser
        bodies strength and wondrous gifts; as also God and Man cannot
        be united except through a Medium, our Savior Christ,
        participating in the two natures, Celestial and Terrestrial,
        Divine and Human. But this spirit is of the same form in the
        greater world as in the lesser, i.e., the human body, our
        spirit, which arises from the former, and is with it one and the
        same spirit. </p>
      <p>For, as the forces of our soul are through the natural spirit
        applied to the members, so is the virtue of the World’s soul
        diffused through all things by the same spirit, or fifth
        essence. For the life and forces of all inferior species, which
        philosophers are wont to call souls or lives, are distributed by
        that ethereal or celestial spirit throughout all the elements,
        as it were, by the members, into the body of the Universal
        World, first by God Himself, then by intelligent beings, then by
        the stars, and lastly by the Sun, as it were the Heart of
        Heaven. And again, this Spirit being taken away, bodies return
        to that whence they came; and thus the Human Soul, according to
        the Platonic School, proceeding from Highest Heaven, from God
        Himself, is, by proper media, joined to our viler body. In that
        first descent, also, the soul is enfolded in the ethereal and
        ardent corpuscle which they call the ethereal vehicle of the
        Soul, while we name it the Spirit of the World and Fifth
        Essence. Through this medium, by command of God, Who is the
        Centre of the greater world, the Soul descends and is poured
        into the heart, which is the center of the lesser world i.e.,
        the human body), and from thence is diffused through all the
        parts and members of its body, when, joining its vehicle (or
        chariot) to natural heat, through the spiritual heat born in the
        heart, the Soul is immersed in the blood, and by it equally
        diffused in the members. Thus it is patent how the Immortal Soul
        is enclosed in this viler body, viz., by means of the ethereal
        vehicle. But when the bonds between the Celestial Soul and
        natural vital spirit are loosened by disease, then the Soul,
        withdrawing from the members, flows back to the heart, the first
        receptacle of Soul and Life. From the heart, the Soul, leaving
        the vital natural spirit, flies away with its vehicle into the
        Heavens, when, being followed by guardian genii and demons, they
        lead it before the Judge. Then, according to the Sentence, God
        joyfully conducts the good souls to glory, but a raging demon
        snatches away the bad to punishment. And the Body returns to the
        earth whence it came. Thus man dies. Hence it is plain that the
        daily preserving of the Soul in the body --- that is, our life
        --- and the avoiding of diseases, and that the greatest
        dissolution of Soul and Body, called death, depend on the
        vehicle of the Soul, viz., the Celestial and our natural Spirit,
        and so the same has been by various authors called by different
        names. Some term it Spirit or Soul of the World, others
        Celestial Fire, others again Vital Spirit, Natural Heat, by
        which nothing else is denoted than that oft mentioned Spirit of
        things celestial and inferior, the gluten of Body and Soul. On
        examining the thing more fully, this is simply the heat and
        humour of Sun and Moon, for we know the administration of the
        Heavens and all bodies under the Heavens to be appointed to the
        Sun and Moon; the Sun is the Lord of al virtues of the elements;
        the Moon, by virtue of the Sun, the mistress of generation, of
        increase and decrease. Hence Albumansar says that life is poured
        into all things through the Moon and Sun; and therefore they are
        called by Orpheus the vivifying eyes of Heaven. Whence also the
        saying --- the Sun and man generate man; for the Sun sits as a
        King among the planets, in magnitude, beauty, and light
        excelling all, illuminating all, dispensing virtue to them as
        well as to inferior things, and abundantly bestowing light and
        life, not only in Heaven and the Air, but also in the earth and
        profoundest depths of the Abyss. Whatever good we possess is
        from the Sun whence Heraclitus deservedly calls it the Fount of
        Heavenly Light, and many of the Platonic School have located the
        World’s Soul principally therein, which Soul, filling the Sun’s
        whole globe, pours its rays (or spirit) everywhere, throughout
        all things, distributing Life, Sense, and Motion to the Universe
        itself. And as in animate beings the heart rules the whole body,
        so does the Sun rule and govern Heaven and Earth and all that in
        tem is. But the Moon, the Earth’s nearest neighbor, by the
        velocity of its monthly course, is joined to the Sun and other
        planets, and receiving their rays and influences as in an
        espousal, and, as it were, bringing forth, communicates to and
        shed upon its near neighbor, the earth, all life and motion. </p>
      <p>From these two founts arises that mundane, natural, and vital
        spirit, permeating all entities, giving to all things life and
        consistence, binding, moving, and filling all things, Immense
        Renewer in Nature’s charge, through whom, as a mediator, every
        hidden property, every virtue, all life, are propagated in
        inferior bodies, in herbs, in metals, in stones, in things
        inanimate, so that, in the whole world, there is nothing wanting
        in a spark of this spirit. For it is in all things, penetrating
        through all; it is diffused in stones (being struck from the
        same by steel); it is in the water (which smokes in ditches);
        and in the earth (which heats springs and wells). It is in the
        depths of the sea (becoming warm when agitated by the wind), and
        in the air (which we often perceive to grow hot); also all
        animals and all things living are nourished by heat, and all
        sentient beings do live by reason of their latent heat. Whence
        Virgil says this inward principle nourishes heaven and earth,
        the sunlit plains, the glowing orb of the Moon, and the
        Tithonian Stars. The same is elsewhere called: That Vigour and
        Celestial Origin. Therefore this spirit, when whole and
        undiminished in our bodies, and not impeded by things
        extraneous, is our natural heat, by which everything is digested
        for the sustenance and multiplying of individuals. </p>
      <p>For it digests man’s food, generating good blood in all his
        members. Now, with pure blood there is a strong, pure, and
        healthy vital spirit of the heart, and thus the whole body is
        healthy. But if, by some impediment, it does its office less
        fully, there arises bad decoction of nutriment, whence
        generation of impure blood. By this the heart’s vital spirit is
        weakened, whence arises old age and, at length, full extinction,
        consumption, and dissipation of that spirit, which is natural
        death. Therefore, to avoid this, the said spirit and natural
        heat, thus diminished, or impeded, must be increased and
        comforted that it may better and more strongly perform its
        functions. But as agents act not with inferiors but with equals,
        so also must this comforting take place through the spirit’s
        equal, viz., through the celestial heat of Sun and Moon and
        other planets, or with those things in which the virtue of Sun
        and Moon are most potent, abundant, and least bound up with
        matter. For these things act more quickly and effectually; they
        generate their like more promptly, and from them is more easily
        obtained that Spirit or Celestial Fire whose properties are
        heat, not consuming like the elementary, but fructifying all
        things; and light, bestowing life on all things. But the
        properties of elementary and inferior fire are burning,
        consuming all things, and filling them with barrenness and
        darkness. Therefore is the same excluded, as also all other
        inferior and elementary subjects. For all these things of
        natural composition, and not freed from grosser matter, are
        subject to corruption and transmutation. Now, medicines ought,
        all the more, to be durable and free from corruption, since they
        are to cure the human body from corruption; otherwise they would
        do more harm than good. I add that it would be vain to preserve
        the corruptible body by a putrid and corruptible thing, or to
        attempt to heal an infirm nature with a thing inform, or yet to
        fashion a thing by deformity. For the corruptible, inform, and
        weak added to its like increases the corruptibility and does not
        diminish it. Thus we see many, and even most, of the physicians
        of our time in vain attempt to heal, and secure immunity from
        disease, by means of the crass and corporeal compositions of
        their medicaments. But this speculation goes farther. For all
        diseases which are spiritual, not corporeal, also demand
        spiritual medicines. Therefore, to those wishing to preserve
        that vital spirit in the young (which is the humid and warm
        radical), to restore the lost powers in old men and to bring
        them back, as it were, to youth, and to educe to their highest
        perfection the powers of man’s life, I would say that such will
        do well to seek, no the Elemental, but that Celestial heat of
        the Sun and Moon, dwelling in a more incorruptible substance,
        under the Moon’s intermittent orb, and to make this similar to
        our heat or spirit; so that, prepared as medicine and sweet
        food, when taken into the mouth it may immediately penetrate the
        human frame, greatly holding to itself every fleshly thing,
        increasing, restoring, and nourishing the incorrupt virtue and
        spirit of life, digesting the crude and undigested, removing the
        superfluous, making natural water abound, and augmenting,
        comforting, and inflaming natural heat or fire. </p>
      <p>The above will be the duty of the true physician and sane
        philosopher. For thus will he be able to preserve our body from
        corruption, to retard old age, retain florid youth in full
        vigour, and, if possible, to perpetuate it, at least to preserve
        it from death and destruction. But here we speak of natural
        death philosophically, which is only a natural consumption of
        moisture and heat, as is demonstrated by a lighted lamp; not
        theologically, of that fatal death and last end of Nature
        destined by God for each one, by which we are compelled not only
        to pay our debts, but also, by reason of our sins, to suffer
        punishment. For we know that, for his sins, man must once die,
        Job saying: “Seeing his days are determined, the number of his
        months are with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that he
        cannot pass”, --- which text plainly sets forth that these
        bounds, once constituted by God, cannot be passed by human aid
        or skill; for which cause also Adam was driven forth from the
        paradise of Joy, lest, after the Fall, he should become equally
        as immortal as before by eating of the Tree of Life. Neither is
        it credible that, outside Paradise, God should have given Adam
        anything whereby he and his descendants might live for ever,
        when by the very expulsion he forthwith deprived Adam of access
        to the Tree of Life. Therefore no aid can be found, still less
        invented, beyond those last bounds set us by God. On the other
        hand, there is a remedy against many infirmities, and against
        the weakening of radical moisture and innate heat. </p>
      <p>For Adam, created by God full of understanding and perfect
        knowledge of natural things, doubtless knew those which were
        capable of prolonging human life and securing immunity from
        disease. Doubtless he also taught the same to some of his
        descendants, and they again to others. Hence many of the fathers
        lived to the age of 700, 800, and more years; but some did not
        live so long, this secret not being revealed to all. </p>
      <p>Therefore it is conceded that (on this side of that limit of
        death) there may be found something to restore our sick body.
        For just as man, through disease and other causes, often fails
        to reach to the appointed limit of life, so, on the other hand,
        by removing these impediments, he may prolong life to the very
        utmost limit set him. </p>
      <p>But some may affirm that such a medicine cannot be found in the
        whole sphere of this nether world, because all things created,
        being either elements or composed and congenital with them, are
        therefore corruptible, and hence that this medicine and
        incorruptible root of life can nowhere be found. Those speaking
        thus learnedly, without having ever entered the Sanctuary of
        Nature, fail to consider there is in the elements something
        besides corruptible qualities. For the elements and their
        compounds, in addition to crass matter, are composed of a subtle
        substance, or intrinsic radical humidity, diffused through the
        elemental parts, simple and wholly incorruptible, long
        preserving the things themselves in vigor, and called the Spirit
        of the World, the one certain life, filling and fathoming all
        things, so that from the three genera of creatures,
        Intellectual, Celestial, and Corruptible, there is formed the
        one Machine of the whole world. </p>
      <p>This Spirit by its virtue fecundates all subjects natural and
        artificial, pouring into them those hidden properties which we
        have been wont to call the Fifth Essence. We do not say that
        Medicine is quite as incorruptible as Heaven (or I could not in
        the stomach be converted into nutriment), but being generated
        from matter above all others and incorruptible with respect to
        them, and simply formed b y the separation therefrom of all
        corruptible elements, it could be kept, if necessary, 10,000
        years. </p>
      <p>For this cause skillful physicians advise us to use less
        incorruptible (indigestible?) food. This thing has the same
        bearing with respect to the four qualities of our Body as Heaven
        has with respect to the four elements. For Heaven is called by
        philosophers the Fifth Essence with respect to the four
        elements, because Heaven is in itself incorruptible, immutable,
        not receiving foreign impressions, unless acting on the elements
        by God’s command. </p>
      <p>Thus the whole thing we seek is, in relation to the four
        qualities of our body, a Fifth Essence, incorruptible in itself,
        made by art. It is not hot and dry like fire, for it cools hot
        things, diminishing and expelling fevers; nor does it cool humid
        tings like water, for it burns, which is repugnant to the
        element water. Nor, again, does it moisten hot things, like air,
        for it corrupts not like air, which is easily decomposed, as we
        see in the generation of spiders and flies; nor is it cold and
        dry like the earth, for it sharpens and warms. But it supplies
        to each a contrary quality, like unto the incorruptible Heaven,
        which, according to necessity, furnishes the hot, cold, moist,
        or dry quality, and just as Supreme Heaven does not by itself
        alone preserve the world, but through the virtue of the Sun,
        Moon, and other Stars, so also does this our Heaven, or Fifth
        Essence, wish and deserve to be adorned by a splendid, wondrous,
        and occult Sun, from which it has incorruptibility, virtue and
        heat. </p>
      <p>But this is the root of life, i.e., the Fifth Essence, created
        by the Almighty for the preservation of the four qualities of
        the human body, even as Heaven is for the preservation of the
        Universe. Therefore in this Fifth Essence and Spiritual
        Medicine, which is of Nature and the Heat of Heaven, and not of
        a mortal or corrupt quality, is indeed possible the Fount of
        Medicine, the preservation of life, the restoration of health,
        and in this may the cherished desire for the renewal of lost
        youth and serene health be found. For, briefly, in the whole
        world there is no better medicine than this. Even as in every
        genus there is something holding the first rank in that genus,
        so also this medicine, being prepared from the most efficacious
        and incorruptible matter under Heaven, viz., from the Soul and
        Spirit of the World, containing within itself the virtues of all
        things celestial and terrestrial, will hold first rank among
        medicines, and man, by using the same, together with other food,
        in moderation, may attain to the age of the Patriarchs. For of
        this composition, combining as it does the virtues of all
        things, there may truly be said that in one drop the whole world
        is present. It is this most famous medicine which philosophers
        have been wont to call their Stone, or Powder. This is its fount
        and fundament, and the Medicine whereby Aesculapius raised the
        dead. This is the herb by which Medea restored Jason to life.
        This is the secret substance brought from Colchis by the
        Argonauts under Jason with so much journeying and pains, and
        hence called the Golden Fleece; partly because this Science
        excels in virtue all others, as the Sun does the stars and gold
        the other metals; and partly because that Fleece was a Book
        written with golden letters (according to the testimony of
        Suidas, Historiographer of the Chemical and Medical Arts) and
        containing a full account of the preparation of the Medicine.
        For in that Book is the first material for the creation,
        restoration, and preservation of our most true Medicine. </p>
      <p>Chemistry can be easily understood by the intelligent, and
        chemistry, i.e., altering metals, may properly be including in
        the teaching of the theory of the True Medicine aforesaid, both
        flowing from the same fount, namely, the World’s Soul, which,
        being as it were, the only life of things, and the author of
        generation, will contain within itself the seeds of all inferior
        natures. </p>
      <p>In harmonious order it rules, vivifies, and fecundates. But,
        for younger disciples, it has pleased us to describe somewhat
        more fully the principles of chemistry, which each one may
        easily prove for himself. For, when he has considered the
        matter, he will perceive that God would be compelled,
        perpetually and each moment, to create new creatures, lest the
        species of all things in that beautiful house, the universal
        world, should perish entirely, had He not, when breathing the
        breath of life into man and all other beings, at the same time
        given them the command: “Increase and multiply in the earth”. By
        which breath and command He imparted unto them not only natural
        life, or a living soul, but also the power, which may be called
        the generative spirit, whereby every genus may preserve and
        perpetuate its race eternally. For everything which may generate
        is necessarily alive, as, on the other hand, that having life,
        unless prevented, will generate. Therefore, at the Creation the
        generative spirit began the order of continuous production which
        shall only cease with the world. Hence God commanded Noah to
        build so great an Ark that it might receive and save from
        destruction some of each species and both sexes, which, after
        the Deluge, should again propagate their kind. </p>
      <p>And everyone attentively observing the universal world will
        doubtless perceive this perpetual order of generation
        everywhere, not only in these crass, inferior, elementated
        bodies, but also in the simple celestial bodies and in the
        elements themselves. Elements generate their own kind, as we are
        taught by the infallible rule of daily experience. A fire
        converts the matter it consumes into its own nature, viz., fire,
        thereby augmenting itself. Air does likewise, easily corrupting
        things and dissolving them into air like itself. Earth, foul and
        dissolved, becomes water; the latter through heat made gross and
        dense, becomes earth; but evaporated by heat, is changed into
        air, and this again, by overheating, into fire. Fire, when
        extinguished, returns to air, cooled air becomes water, and that
        again, by coagulation, earth. But the natural order of
        generation is more plainly perceived among inferior and
        composite bodies, which philosophers have divided into the three
        orders: Animals, Vegetables, Minerals. For these have their own
        seed, implanted by Nature herself, by which they manifestly and
        visibly produce similar fetuses, thus augmenting their kind by
        propagation, From horse, man, bull, are respectively generated
        horse, man, and bull. Likewise all vegetables, herbs, trees,
        shrubs, cast their own seeds on to the ground, which, in course
        of time, produce species similar to themselves. Indeed, the
        minerals and metals lying hid in the very center of the earth
        have also undergone the same changes, although their seed and
        generations are not visibly shown, as in the preceding orders
        --- for, by reason of the great mass of the earth concealing the
        hidden, contained seed, the same is by many believed neither to
        grow nor to generate. </p>
      <p>But the attentive observer of Nature, it origin, increase, and
        incrementation, will certainly not dispute its possession of
        vital spirit and generative power, by which it not only
        originates and has nutriment, life, and consistence, but also
        must be admitted to possess the power of generating its kind.
        For everything increasing, originating, growing, and receiving
        nourishment has vegetative life, hence propagating power. And
        the reason of the generation of minerals being so patent to the
        eye as that of vegetables and animals, is the earth’s great and
        abundant fecundity, its vast mass, by which that spirit is
        restrained and impeded as in a prison and chains, by which it
        can less perform its functions and generate its kind. The same
        when freed by art from its terrestrial house and sepulcher,
        doubtless, like others, sharers of generative virtue, will be
        able to bring forth fruit by its seed, and thus metal will
        produce metal and gold generate gold. </p>
      <p>From this it is manifest that the generation of metals, and
        especially of gold, is not only permitted by God, and possible
        to Nature, but also to human art. Consequently the Art of
        Chemistry is not fictitious, not detestable, not base, as today
        it is falsely called by many, but true, admirable, holy, and
        well proven. For by natural means seeding out the invisible,
        impalpable, generative spirit, elsewhere called the Seed of
        Metals, it so treats the same that it bears fruit similar to
        itself, etc. Therefore, many philosophers, moved by this
        argument, have sought that golden seed in gold itself; and
        having found what they wished, have cut out, or extracted, the
        same from a mass of gold. As it were, from the stones placed by
        Nature about it, which, being thus separated, and afterwards
        applied by them to anything of a similar nature --- i.e., any
        metal --- has immediately changed the same into gold and silver.
        Hence they have proved by experiment that gold can generate its
        like, but have thereby gained no lucre or emolument. For this
        spirit, or seed, of gold, when mixed with any of the other
        metals, can convert into gold only a quantity equal to the gold
        whence the seed was extracted, and not more. Hence the process
        was a tedious and most difficult one, requiring much time and a
        large outlay. That, therefore, this generation and manufacture
        of gold might be carried on more easily and abundantly, with
        less expense and yet more profit and utility, the Ancient Sages
        were compelled to relinquish common gold, and, with the spirit
        of which we in this place treat, viz., the generating spirit of
        all creatures, were forced to seek a method of making gold
        elsewhere; in respect of which they spared neither labour, nor
        time, nor expense, and a length arrived at one thing in which
        all their wishes were fulfilled, for they obtained a nature, or
        body, or certain compound, in which the metallic, gold-producing
        spirit was unlimited and unstraitened, not limited in quantity
        proportionate to the matter, but so intense, exuberant,
        possessing more of form (essence) than of matter, that , by
        artificial fire, it may be reduced to its greatest purity, and
        may be so treated, diffused, extended, and multiplied that,
        after completion, it is a thousand thousand times stronger than
        bodies naturally perfect, i.e., gold and silver. --- For the
        more form a thing has, the more entity, virtue, and operation it
        has. Those things in which the idea (which is the form) is least
        merged into the body, or matte, have the most potent virtues,
        because being the most formal (spiritual), they can with very
        little matter effect very much. This matter thus formed and
        taken possession of by all sons of this science, lest it should
        become known to the unworthy, and equally that it might be known
        by the worthy, we read of as described by the sages in divers
        enigmatical ways only to be understood by the initiated. The
        following are some of the principal circumlocutions designed
        indirectly to make known this great secret: What is the
        strongest creature in the whole world, the most conservative,
        most penetrative, most volatile, the most unalterable and fixed
        in fire? The thing that fire has not touched is accessible and
        known to all men, of much superfluity, to be found everywhere,
        and by all. It is a part of man, begets and is begotten by man,
        is heavy in weight, soft (or at least not hard) to the touch,
        not rough, sweet to the taste but of a sharp nature, sweet to
        the smell but at the same time having a fetid and sepulchral
        odour, pleasant to sight and hearing, yet of obtuse sound, not
        the less fire for being almost wholly earth, nor yet simply
        water, neither very acute nor obtuse but mediocre in quality,
        revealed by reflection, various in colour, white, black, and
        last red, most easily fusible, and also of metallic fusion,
        without much sound, in action animal, vegetable, and mineral. It
        is a thing which the earth produces and which descends from
        Heaven, both active and passive, masculine and feminine,
        consisting of Soul, Spirit, and Body. </p>
      <p>It is the one subject of everything wonderful in Heaven and
        Earth, without which neither Alchemy, Medicine, nor Natural
        Magic can exhibit their complete aim. It is also the first and
        last, greatest of all creatures, by most commonly called red, or
        Adamic Earth. From these and similar attributes, or
        circumstances, and in no other way, may this matter be known and
        prepared by a proper, natural method, at length excelling in
        that naturally desired by all, and pursued by all with great
        eagerness, viz., daily and healthy life, without all infirmity,
        until natural death. And it will further afford gold, silver,
        pearls, gems, and such precious things, as well as all that is
        necessary to the hones sustenance of life, abundantly and
        affluently. Thus the object of Chemistry is identical with that
        of Medicine, the same Spirit, same Heat, same Quintessence, the
        same Soul, Medium of Nature, which permits one thing to be
        converted into another; finally there are the same uses,
        rewards, and emoluments for the disciples of either science who
        shall have known how to separate this Quintessence from its
        defilements and impurities, and to reduce it to pure simplicity.
        For he who shall have been able, from its impure and manifold
        elements, to convert it to purity and simplicity, discerning the
        nature, virtue and power of these elements in their number,
        degrees and order, without division of substance, the same is
        truly a Physician, natural Magus, and consummate Philosopher.
        For by the same heat of Sun and Moon, the same Spirit of the
        World, by which human bodies are healed from infirmities and
        accidents, he can restore imperfect or impure metals to True
        Health --- which is Conversion into Gold --- and his he will
        have thoroughly discovered the whole virtue of Nature’s occult
        operations, and will easily obtain a perfect knowledge and grasp
        of all natural and celestial secrets. On the other hand --- if
        ignorant of all these things --- he can attain to no knowledge
        of such wonderful agencies. </p>
      <p>Hence it is plain that this art, and most secret of Nature’s
        secrets is in vain attempted and sought by those who daily join
        themselves to princes and magnates, and immediately attempt
        Hermes’ Stone, the Sacred Stone, Philosophers’ mercury, all
        kinds of furnaces and burnings, strong waters, King of Antimony,
        perpetual fire, and many more inept things of that sort, and,
        with this gullible art in their mouths, [promise whole mountains
        of gold; knowing, nevertheless, not a single word of Latin, and
        still less having tasted a single drop from Nature’s hidden
        founts. For unless one be instructed in the discipline of the
        great arts, he can become but little proficient therein.
        Wherefore the above has been collected from Natural,
        mathematical, and Supernatural Precepts, etc. </p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> That is the cause of my departure. I
        therefore beg you to give me the good counsel you have already
        been asked for by me. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Why do you, an old Physician and Chemist,
        allow yourself to be misled by the popular cry? Know you no the
        way of the world, that he who praises not himself has no
        consideration? The popular cry should not have moved you to
        leave wife and child at home, wandering about and seeking in
        other lands what you might perhaps have found sooner and better
        at home. For old acquaintance sake, I will no refuse you the
        desired counsel. For, as you say, we were good friends in Italy,
        at Padua, Ferraria, Bologna, and Rome, when seeking there what
        we did not find. But, before I speak further with you, tell me
        what god you have experienced and learned at Basel, Cologne, in
        Switzerland, on the Rhine, in Silesia, in the marches
        (Brandenburg), and in Denmark, where you were with the
        Paracelsian doctors? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> As I came to them, so I left them; what they
        told me I had already read in Paracelsus, where he speaks of
        Flowers of Antimony, of Matter of Pearls, of Juice of Coral, of
        the virtues of hellebore, of Potable Gold, and of the
        Quintessence. But I thought to hear from these learned persons
        what Paracelsus means by those names and terms. For I had long
        remarked that his Vitriol and Tartar were not sulphuric acid and
        common tartar; and so on with the other names. But I saw the
        good gentlemen still read it literally. Hence I did not learn
        from them the mysteries hidden by Paracelsus under the said
        names. Each one has his preparations, highly praised by himself;
        but I ask not for preparation, knowing that in the things
        prepared by them there are not the secrets sought by us. I have
        spent much time and labour over the substances they occupy
        themselves with, which they, as Chemists of the new School, hold
        in great honour. But I think nothing of all that, as they also
        will find out in time. Hence you can easily guess what I have
        learnt from them. </p>
      <p><i>Berhardus:</i> But I hear they do much with their Chemical
        medicines? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Yes, as luck would have it, sometimes much,
        sometimes little; as also happens with us Galenian doctors,
        Parcelsus writes that Medicine is a certain art, which a
        physician must be as fully master of as a tanner of his trade.
        He says not it is easier to learn than the tanner’s trade. But
        such perfection have I found in none, and they all speak of
        different things and long labor. What shall I, then, think of
        these professors? I know you have earnestly occupied yourself
        with the secrets of medicine of the last 27 years, and I pray
        that you do not refuse your old true comrade what you, in that
        long period, have learn concerning these hidden matters. </p>
      <p><i>Berhardus:</i> Vitriol, Tartar, Coral, Pearls, Jewels, are
        not that upon which the medicine of Paraceslsus is built. For
        the first philosophers and inventors of medicine have spoken
        concerning weighty things in parables and other figures of
        speech Thus also Paracelsus, who, in his teaching, has invented
        some names, having received others from the Ancients ---
        excepting some in which Medicinal Virtues, but not perfections,
        are found. Marvel no that Paracelsian doctors take the
        similitude for truth. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> But I have left home to discover the same,
        yet have found no one to teach me. I well know there is
        something in Vitriol, also in Tartar, Antimony, Mercury, but
        find not in them what Paracelsus ascribes to them. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhadus:</i> Perhaps you know not the proper preparation
        of these substances. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Bother the preparation! I see others do as
        little with their preparations as I with mine; therefore, there
        must be another reason for it. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Have you read the chapter in Paracelsus
        concerning Dropsy? Therein you find the simples which may help
        to cure your brother of this complaint. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Certainly, I have read it more than once, but
        what simples are there in it other than Mercurium Columbinum,
        Crocus, Sulphur, the Element of Fire, and Diaphoretic Gold? I
        would not put Mercury sublimated, precipitated, sublimated,
        etc., into my brother’s mouth, neither would I Sulphur; and when
        I apply Columbinum, or Gallinaceum, and other poultices,
        according to our custom, they are of no avail. What Element of
        Fire is I know not. I do know that Diaphoretic Gold, as
        Alchemists make it, with Mercury, acids, oil of salt, and with
        urine, is a poison – and tat the Diaphoretic Gold of Paracelsus
        mus be something else. Are Crocus and Sal Martis burnt iron,
        which us used by the doctor for restoring health? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I plainly perceive that since you have taken
        a wife, are laden with domestic cares, and are practicing
        according to the Galenian method to keep a family, you have
        ceased to reflect on these matters. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I must make shift with Galenian Medicine
        until I can get a better master. Nevertheless, I always am
        working and seeking the arcane, but I have hitherto had little
        success; why, I know not, for I am not wanting in diligence. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I will tell you, God is a Searcher of all
        minds, and Medicine is in His hand: He grants it according to
        our heart. When we were at Padua I know you took the opinions of
        Galenus for Gospel, that you graduated in the same, and that you
        then went with some other doctors to Friaul, there to try the
        new medicine. But what happened to you and your comrades? You
        thought you had collected from your professors the golden fleece
        of medicine, --- no disease could resist you. Then you found
        that your fleece was nothing but asses’ figs, and the peasants
        who ate the same died, or were rippled and lamed. Do you
        remember what a quarrel you thereupon had with your preceptors?
        But what answer did you get? That you were only a young doctor;
        that Practice was not so easily learned; that you must exercise
        yourself therein, and go on killing people, and at last you
        would become a clever doctor. That is also the experience of
        others who get their medicine from the universities. Hence it is
        a Gift of God, and comes not from Padua, Paris, or Wittenberg.
        He Himself has created and compounded medicine, not Galenus, not
        Avicenna, not Paracelsus, but He alone, and from Hi we must
        learn the Truth --- not from this or that author. Each one has
        written according to the measure of Truth he has found. We may,
        therefore, take them for guides, but not for the way itself, as
        we did when spending our youth so uselessly at the High Schools.
        Since Galenus knew and described medicine, and his professors
        made a physician of thee, tell me, when thou seekest information
        from others, what does Paracelsus concern thee? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Everyone knows that Paracelsus was a learned
        man who has written many clever things, but he invented not
        Medicine himself, having received it from Hippocrates and
        others. Therefore, God has bestowed upon him great
        understanding, whereby he has brought Medicine into a right
        order and one method, through which it has acquired a reputation
        no possessed by it before. Hence Galenus is so highly considered
        by the learned, and alone taught in the Schools. The reason for
        my having go into the Medicine of Paracelsus is this: I have
        long been a Chemist, seeking that which others seek, and yet I
        cannot attain it, but find in Paracelsus that, by Alchemistic
        preparation, medicine should be made to act. I have also in High
        Germany heard of incredible cures effected by Paracelsus --- as
        his Epitaph also testifies --- and, therefore wished to make use
        of my chemical studies in preparing medicaments, thinking to
        discover the secrets of medicine of I might not make gold and
        silver. For I cannot deny that, since we have mighty principles
        and authors of our medicine, and yet can do so little in
        dangerous sickness, we must be, for some cause, deficient in
        medicine. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Yes, truly, a great deficiency. You write
        and chatter much, and when at the patient’s bedside, you cannot
        drive away a fever. You purge, anoint, and poultice in vain,
        putting hi off with fine words and dieting, until Nature herself
        overcomes the disease; then you have excellently shown your
        skill. But if he dies, killed by your quackery, the disease was
        incurable. What shall I say of other maladies ore serious than
        fevers? As you understand and treat the one, so you so the
        others. Tell me, on your conscience, can you, with your Galenian
        method, drive away a fever? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I cannot do so with certainty. A doctor is
        but the minister of Nature, not her master. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> We know well that Nature herself is our
        medicine, and that she helps the sick person when the
        impediments are removed. With respect to these impediments we
        must assist Nature, but I have never seen one who could cure a
        fever, without fail, in a certain fixed time. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have known one, but cannot sufficiently
        wonder at the medicine. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> What think you is the cause that you
        Galenians cannot do so? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> That our theory has a false foundation I
        cannot assert, but must confess that the result does not
        correspond with the principles. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Were the principles good, the result also
        could not fail to be so. But your principles were invented by
        phantastic, unlearned scatterbrains, who knew not Nature. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> You must not thus despise the famous and
        praiseworthy doctors; they are, after all, very learned men. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I despise no one, but it is my duty to
        rescue the Truth. As the Greeks say: I am a friend of Socrates
        and Plato, but still more so of Truth. If Nature have not taught
        their principles, they are learned but with their own sort. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Not only with their own sort, but at the
        courts of Emperors, Kings, and Princes, and with many honest
        men. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Your citing mighty Potentates only shews
        they know nothing about Medicine; if they did, you would soon
        have other news. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> High Potentates of Christendom have other
        things to do; hence they have learned person to serve and help
        them. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Yes, certainly help them --- from this life
        into the next. I could tell you something about Princes, did I
        not wish to spare the heads of those who have driven them from
        one illness into another, and, at last, even killed them. I
        myself have been present when a young prince was sick, and not
        knowing what to do, one of them said: Let us proceed according
        to the method and we shall be excused. How like you this advice?
        Your method must be right, should every prince give up the ghost
        under it. What says Paracelsus of the physicians of the Emperor
        and great lords? Does he not declare that they know less than
        peasants, rather helping their princes to death than to life,
        and that, having such physicians, it is impossible for them to
        reach old age? Have you never heard a prince lament: This
        multitude of physicians has destroyed me? Also, what said the
        Emperor Adrian when about to die? The concourse of physicians
        frequently changes the Emperor! But what sort of doctors were
        these? Just the same who the Burgomaster of Rome drove away and
        forbade the city. The truth about medicine was not discovered at
        that time, when the phantasy concerning humours was believed in.
      </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> From the beginning of the world this Medicine
        has been held in high honour; that it should now be brought into
        contempt and replaced by another is difficult to believe. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Adam, our first father, who had knowledge of
        all arts, also received that of Medicine from God, and it was
        kept secret by the learned (as the great gift of God) until
        Noah’s time. When God destroyed the world by the Flood, the art
        of Medicine, with many other controlled arts, was lost. No one
        remained who knew them except Noah, called by some Hermogenes,
        or Hermes, to whom Antiquity ascribes the knowledge of all
        things celestial and terrestrial. The same Noah, before his
        death, described Medicine, skillfully concealing it among
        another matter. After his death this knowledge returned to God,
        and thus, through the Flood and Noah’s death, was taken away
        from the Human Race. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Who can believe God to have been so
        ungracious to man as to have taken from him this knowledge of
        Medicine? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Tell me, does God think more of our Souls’
        salvation than that of our mortal bodies? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Doubtless most of that of our Souls. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Why, then, has he concealed Salvation during
        the 5000 years before Christ was made man? When Christ was
        revealed to the world, then men heard the news of their
        Salvation, and there fell to the ground hundreds of idols,
        raised by men according to their own imaginations, although they
        knew not what was their souls’ salvation. For the notion of the
        Deity is naturally innate in man, which is even a better idea
        than knowledge; by which is incited the natural desire of good,
        reasoning, and judgment. Thus do idols spring from the
        imagination of men. And, forasmuch as human reason, the origin
        of philosophy, of which Erastus and writers of his stamp boast
        much in our time, need not necessarily be without deceit and
        guile, it has always fallen short of the truth until God assumed
        human reason through the mind, and His Word became flesh and
        man. It s not possible for our Reason --- although mind --- to
        grasp the Truth, until our intellect has been lighted by God’s
        Word, and Reason receives Divine Illumination through the mind,
        which then took place when the Word became flesh and dwelt in
        us. Before that time Theology was man’s vain suppositions (I
        speak not of the few enlightened by God through the Holy Ghost
        before the incarnate Word), and he understands not his soul’s
        salvation. If God has concealed the same from humanity for 5000
        years, is it incredible that he should withhold the body’s
        salvation --- i.e., Medicine --- for 4000 years? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> If Medicine, as you say, has only appeared in
        our own time, whence comes the medicine which has been practiced
        during the last 4000 years? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Whence came the idols which, before Christ,
        were in Europe, Africa, and Asia? Our human reason has
        speculated them out, and thus also has it happened with
        Medicine. After Noah’s time, men, harassed by diseases, sought
        refuge, one in herbs, another in animals, a third in stones and
        metals, and thus one thing after another was tried, without full
        knowledge of the same, which had some appearance of virtue. But
        there was as yet no doctor. The sick were carried to some public
        place, those who had had similar complaints shewing them the
        remedies used by themselves, which the patients tried on chance.
        Such was Medicine until the time of Apollo, i.e., 1915 B.C. This
        Apollo was a clever and learned man, and carefully noting those
        things which proved efficacious in diseases, he began to visit
        the sick, and thus became a public physician, to whom, after his
        death, a temple was erected and divine honours were paid. In
        such honour was medicine then held which today begs its bread.
        Aesculapius succeeding his father, also treated the sick with
        skill and knowledge inherited from his father, and to him there
        was a temple erected, as to a god. After his death the kings
        commanded that all medical discoveries and observations should
        be written down and publicly exhibited on the walls of the
        Temple of Aesculapius. 457 years after came Hippocrates Cous,
        who was commanded to arrange the experiments in the Temple of
        Aesculapius, which he did; and, from these experiments, first
        invented methodical Medicine. Hence from him Medicine, as now
        taught in the schools, derives its origin. When Empirical
        Medicine thus came into great honour in Greece, many physicians
        arose, as Diocles, Chrysippus, Coristinus, Anaxagorus,
        Erostratus. 500 years after Hippocrates came Galenus, a
        plausible man who described the Hippocratic Medicine, painting
        it in beautiful colours, inventing causes and symptoms of
        diseases, ascribing virtues to herbs, and teaching the cure of
        feverish illnesses by cold, that of cold ones by heat. Thus did
        Human Speculation, from experiments, deduce the Science of
        medicine --- yet, at bottom, it was no Science, but mere
        opinions, accepted as Truth itself. But God, who is not always
        wrath with man, has, in our own time, chosen Philip Theophrastus
        Bombast, of Hohenheim, to rekindle the light of Medical Science,
        and to expose the deceit practiced in his day. Therefore, this
        Theophrastus is the True Monarch of Medicine, and will remain so
        until the end of time. Therefore, it behooves us to thank God
        and his chosen man, and not lightly reject or revile what we do
        not understand. This science is above human knowledge, a gift
        and miracle of God. He errs that would grasp the same with human
        understanding, for, without the Revelation of the Holy Ghost and
        Inspiration of God, no one will obtain it --- be he bachelor,
        master, or doctor. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How can Paracelsus have rediscovered the true
        medicine, since he has written so many contradictory things
        about which his very disciples are not agreed? One says his Art
        is in Antimony, another in Mercury, Gold, Pearls, and Corals, or
        in Vitriol, Tartar, and many other poisonous things, that
        destroy men’s lives. I know princes and lords who are terrified
        at the very mention of Paracelsian doctors. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>Only those who do not understand the
        writings of Paracelsus call them contradictory. But Holy Writ
        also must suffer the same imputation; as, for instance,
        Sebastian Franck exclaimed with regard to it: But is it true?
        However, I cannot deny that much is attributed to Paracelsus
        which he has never written. So also he himself, in a Theological
        Treatise, confesses that in his youth, when seeking the first
        principles of Medicine, he had written things afterwards
        repudiated by himself, and doth warn us against the same, which
        (he says) had in time come to be accepted as true and perfect
        books. What you advance against his disciples is not the fault
        of Paracelsus. But what think you is the cause of their
        disagreement? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I would hear it from you. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> You know that Christian Theology is one and
        united; whence come so many Sects among Christians in Europe? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> There have always been Sects in our Religion.
        I hold God permits this the better to prove the Righteous; but
        what has that to do with Medicine? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The fact of there being so many heretics in
        our Religion is a sure sign and argument that the instigators of
        the Sects understand not theology. Thus also in Medicine --- the
        letter is the cause of all errors, yet no one will see that the
        letter is dead. What has Paracelsus written other than the
        letter, the right understanding of which comes from God? If it
        comes from ourselves, the medical heretics are there. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Many laud Paracelsian Medicine. Who shall say
        which of these understand Paracelsus aright? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> What says Christ, when asked by what false
        prophets shall be known? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> “By their fruits shall ye know them”, Christ
        replied. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Thus also shall a physician be discerned by
        his works, not words. By works Paracelsus proved that he had
        received Medicine from God, and was a physician born, whom also
        hypocrites hate. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> But what think you of the Medicine derived
        from the Experiments arranged and methodized by Hippocrates ---
        is it good for nothing? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I say not so; they are to be praised who
        have made known to us herbs and natural simples. But philosophy
        is not necessary for the sick, as Serapion testifies. For the
        causes of serious diseases, as Apoplexy, Paralysis, Podagra,
        Dropsy, are all not natural but metaphysical, having their own
        Medicine as regards the fleshly body and vital parts, as heart,
        lungs, liver, etc., and for them Medicines enough are found ---
        but what is taught concerning the causes of disease is all mere
        opinion. Since Noah’s time no one has understood the causes of
        so-called incurable diseases, but Paracelsus alone.Therefore, to
        Hippocrates and Galen, but also to Paracelsus, let due praise be
        given according to the respective merits of each. With regard to
        the internal organization of man, Galenus was blind, as are also
        his disciples. Paracelsus has been the first Medicus Microcosmi
        (physician of man’s body). Hence, he rightly calls himself
        Monarchus Medicorum, at which title Erastus the Calumniator is
        like to burst. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Paracelsus ascribes the cause of diseases to
        the Stars, administering such poisonous Medicines against these
        Stars that the Galenists doctors are aghast. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The inner man is astral, hence he must have
        astral medicine. What Medicines have you in which there is not
        poison, of which people die who would otherwise live? Take, for
        instance, wine. Is that not a necessary and useful thing? And
        yet how great poison there is in it! </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Those who swill wine every day find no poison
        in it. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> They have to thank their strong constitution
        for that. When weakened they will soon find out whether there be
        poison in it. Know you not that the less poison there is, the
        less Medicine, and the stronger the poison, the stronger the
        Medicine. But you Galenians will not recognize poison, speaking
        of phlegma, melancholy, and cholera --- wherein is nonsense ---
        knowing not that the poison in medicine and food does
        everything. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have long noticed that the excrements of
        food and drink produce many diseases in us. Paracelsus has also
        written much concerning Tartar. But what the excrements in us
        are composed of, how they become a disease, what transmutes them
        into another substance, I know not, and cannot learn from his
        writings, much less understand the fabricator of the disease,
        the instrument with which it works, and the subject out of which
        it is made and multiplied. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The true doctor must know more than of
        melancholy and cholera; with them the patient is not served. We
        thank God, are better acquainted with man, and with what
        constitutes his sickness and health. Therefore we may well laugh
        at Erastus, Bernhardus Dessenius, Croneburgius, Lucas
        Stengeleinus, and other pseudo-doctors like them. Did not
        Christian love, and the misery and need of the sick, so compel
        us, we had rather be silent than mention the true Medicine to
        such blind, stubborn persons. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> It is our duty to assist our neighbor where
        we can. Medicine, which, next to God, should be man’s refuge in
        sickness, is despised in our time. The peasants, observing that
        doctors understand it not, prefer to die than to entrust to them
        their bodies. Be not afraid because some rail at the truth. Help
        those who seek it. Let the choleric and melancholic dogs bark;
        they cannot harm you. Not everyone may understand the truth, yet
        it must be taught, should but one in a thousand receive it.
        Therefore, for our old friendship’s sake, I beg you to instruct
        me concerning the simples enumerated by Paracelsus in the
        chapter about Dropsy, what they are and where to be found. Also
        shew me how to get to the bottom of the matter, since Galenus
        knew the true cause of disease, and the Stars of Paracelsus are
        beyond me. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Paracelsus prescribes three things for the
        cure of dropsy. The same cannot be explained in a few words.
        Natural Magic is extinct in our day, hence also its terms are
        not understood. I will tell you as much as necessary for this
        time. In order that the ignorance of doctors concerning the
        cause of dropsy may be plainly shown, let us examine the cure
        set up by Erastus in vol. iv of his Disputation against
        Paracelsus! You will then perceive the hideous labyrinth of
        doctors, and what a coarse fellow Erastus is, wholly ignorant of
        man’s creation and composition. Therefore, say on about what you
        would know; this afternoon I will devote to our colloquies;
        tomorrow I have other things to do. What says Paracelsus
        concerning the cure of dropsy? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> He divides the same into Diagnosis,
        Purgation, and Strengthening. The disease is to be resolved into
        water, without which it cannot be cured. But how shall the
        medicine resolve into water a disease consisting of water? I
        have myself seen more than a pailful of water taken from a
        dropsical patient. If the disease be water, what is to be
        digested? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The water can and ought not to be digested,
        but that which is not yet water, and which clings to the
        nutriment of the blood. That is the excrement of food, called
        Tartar by Paracelsus. This Tartar is the disease to be resolved
        by digestion. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How does this resolution take place? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Through digestion. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is digestion? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> It is a medicinal power, separating Tartar
        from Nutriment, bad from good, disease from health. In this
        separation Tartar --- which is a mucilage or viscous matter ---
        melts into water. For Tartar in its first matter is nothing but
        water. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> In what form does this medical force act? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Its action is like the Sun. Thus, Medicine
        is a Sun, and is called the Earthly Sun, or Sun of the Lower
        Firmament. That Tartar melts into water is well known to all
        experts in Natural Medicine, but when melted in water it still
        remains Tartar, even as salt cast into water remains salt. Hence
        as Astrum (Star) must be there </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is an Astrum? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> That you will learn when we speak of
        medicines to be taken from the excrement. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>I understand that the Tartaric Phlegm is the
        matter of disease, and that this phlegm is an excrement of food.
        Does this matter proceed alone from food? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> No; also from the air, poisoned by the
        vapours of the Earth, Water, or Firmament, which in us becomes a
        Tartar. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Does Tartar come from every, or from one
        particular, food? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Herein lies not a little philosophy. The
        Humorists are not worthy to learn it. However, I will discover
        to you somewhat of this secret. The Tartar of Dropsy is the
        excrement of various foods, as bread, fruit, and all kinds of
        roots and herbs. This Tartar is, in its essence, cold. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How should his Tartar be cold when we in
        preparing it see that it is nothing but water, and sharper, more
        burning, than salt? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Every essence is water, and externally hot
        from the resolution of the elemental body; therefore this Tartar
        is cold fire. Now, these Tartars which come into us through meat
        and drink are divided into four genera. One kind is in the
        fruits of the earth; another in the food obtained from water,
        such as fish, etc. The third is in the flesh of animals and
        birds. The fourth is from the firmament. Each king has its place
        in the body which it possesses. Had philosophers rightly
        apprehended these excrements, Melancholy and Cholera had never
        been imported into Medicine. They were good, lazy fathers,
        judging things by external. It is not written on everyone’s
        forehead what in him is. Virtue must be sown ex radice centri,
        not by its superficies. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Can one detect the kind of Tartar present in
        the patient, or must it be assumed? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> In Medicine what cannot be understood should
        not be assumed, for Medicine is subject to its works, as
        Theology is to Faith, which, however, must be confirmed by
        works. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Where does one find the Tartar of Disease? Is
        it found in Urine? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> It is present in urine, but is
        imperceptible. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>Why? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:&nbsp;</i> Urine there is not Tartar alone, but
        many other things in which Tartar is hidden. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How is it detected in Urine? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The art of separation distinguishes the
        parts from one another, viz., Fumus Salis (Smoke of Salt),
        called gore by Paracelsus; water from food; superfluous salt;
        Sulphur; finally we find Tartar in its four kinds. He who can
        distinguish them perceives of what kind the Tartarus Morbi is. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have never heard of this separation, nor do
        I know how it is done, but I admit that this art is most
        necessary to a physician. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> He who is unacquainted therewith will remain
        a Melancholic or Choleric doctor, for he cannot thoroughly
        understand the matter of the disease, and therefore it is
        impossible for him to know wherewith the “fabricator of
        diseases” plagues us, breaking the machine of the Lesser World
        (human body) and driving out life. Now, no one can deny that
        Galenus, Avicenna, and all other doctors writing before
        Paracelsus, knew nothing of this Tartar, and a clever physician
        of Heidelberg would be equally ignorant. It is a great
        impertinence to belittle a thing one does not understand. It is
        just as of a cobbler wished to teach a tailor his trade. I tell
        you tat he who can find and judge this Tartar in Urine is more
        worthy in Medicine than if the four volumes written by Erastus
        against Paracelsus had wiped his posterior extremities. I
        mention not other secrets far greater than this. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> You said just now that each genus of Tartar
        possesses a particular portion of the human body. In what part
        is the Tartar we are now speaking about? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> In the part subject to Venus and Mars. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What and whence is this philosophy? I have
        never yet heard of this phantasy. </p>
      <p><i>Berhardus: </i>I believe you. Had you attended the School
        of Physic as long as that of Sophistry, you would not call it
        phantasy. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How shall I understand this? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Those are the places within us in which the
        spirits of the kidneys, mother, and gall rejoice and exult. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> The astronomers say dropsy comes from Saturn.
        What did you say about Venus and Mars? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>Although some astronomers subject dropsy to
        Mars, yet Saturn is the cause of disease when we come to the
        cause. I speak here not of the cause, but place. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is the place (locus)? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Open your eyes and search in Astronomy, and
        you will find it --- also from the following description --- </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Before proceeding to the means of cure, tell
        me, are there other excrements in food and drink besides Tartar?
      </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Food and drink have three excrements, viz.,
        (1) Water, (2) Salt or Tartar, (3) Sulphur. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>I understand the water. But what are Salt
        and Sulphur? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Salt is the earth found in every creature.
        Sulphur is a solid, burning when cast into fire, and is the fire
        in wood, in fishes, in stones, in metals. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> According to Paracelsus, there is in a body
        not more than three substances, Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. You
        say they are excrements. If there are but these three in food,
        what then is excrement? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>Now you ask me not a little thing. Rather
        tell me from Galenus what nutriment is. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>What should it be but the most subtle and
        purest (essence) in food, which “is assimilated to the body”, as
        Galenus says. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> A peasant, not a doctor, might put it so. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> One must speak according to one’s
        understanding. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Behold, is it not lamentable that all the
        lot of you know not what becomes flesh and blood in us? Why
        speak you of diseases and their origin, not knowing the least
        thing in Physics? All your writing and chatter is nought but a
        plausible deceit; how long have you befooled us! Think you, the
        world will always remain blind? O excellent man, that have not
        yet learnt the alphabet of Medicine, not to speak of anything
        more! Shame on you for opening your reviling mouths against the
        beloved man through who God has restored to us the Science of
        Medicine! What would you say to a cobbler boasting that he could
        make the best shoes and never having seen the leather they are
        made of? Would you not rebuke him? What shall be said of you,
        writing great books and chattering in your lecture-rooms? It is
        easy to preach about colours to the blind. You have never seen
        Medicine, and know not whether it be black or blue. I speak here
        of the Science of Medicine, not of local remedies --- called by
        you specifics --- that is, of things good for stomach, liver,
        etc., etc., aperients and so forth. These are not the things
        that dignify the physician, and whence he has his name. But you
        have set your specifics in the place of Medicine, and
        adulterated them by your own compositions. Is it not true that
        the Sisters of Ulm restore more sick persons with their
        specifics, than you by your method? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I know Princes of the Empire who have been
        treated and cured by Galenian doctors. </p>
      <p><i>Berhardus:</i> They use Simples as given by God. What the
        doctor and apothecary concoct often does more harm than good.
        But one dare not say so for fear of being called an idiot. Both
        are most honourable gentlemen who would fain blind these that
        see. Yet their wise Worships know not what is the nutriment in
        bread and wine. But, not knowing this, you also know not what
        are excrements, and what is the matter of many diseases. You see
        there must be something, you know no what, and therefore it must
        be Cholera, Melancholy, Phlegm, or Blood. Were you skilled in
        Physics, you would therein find --- not Cholera and Melancholy
        --- but excrements, comprised by Paracelsus under the name of
        Tartar. But, being ignorant of Tartar, you know not on what the
        Medicine must act, nor what that is which separates Tartar from
        Nutriment. Hence, as you will hear, the Resolution of Tartar is
        a mystery. I have thus described Tartar, what it is, into how
        many kinds divided --- to which certainly dropsy belongs ---
        that you may understand Paracelsus’s saying: Dropsy arises not
        from the element Water, but from the Earth. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have often wondered at that saying since
        the disease is dropsy. Now, I see that Tartar --- the disease in
        man --- proceeds from the products of the earth used as food by
        him. But I should have thought that our nature would remove the
        excrements and feces. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> That it does when well, but when infected,
        or impeded by outward accident, it cannot perform its office,
        and the excrements remain in the chyle. Hence in stomach and
        liver proceed stomach and liver complaints, in the kidneys
        diabetes, calculus, putrefactions, in the joints Podagra,
        Arthetica, etc. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Is everything we eat and drink mingled with
        these excrements, i.e., Tartar? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Everything. God has so ordered it that no
        food is free from this poison. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Can the excrements be separated from food
        outside of man’s body? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The grossest can be separated, viz., those
        falling out of the stomach into the intestines --- not the
        others. Hence also the juice of herbs should be extracted, the
        rest thrown away. Look at rectified spirits, how subtle they
        are, yet in them is still the Tartar which Nature alone
        separates. This Tartar, by reason of its subtlety, is most
        similar to Tartar of the Firmament, a strong kind, whence arise
        plague, pleurisy, and various fevers. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>Is the water in dropsical patients resolved
        Tartar? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> In a patient who has been tapped, and in
        whom the water reappears not, in that water is resolved. But
        where the water reappears in the patient, the Tartar remains in
        him. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> But what is the water? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Our blood and flesh, and the nutriment of
        the food, together with its liquid excrement. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How are these changed into water? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Through water. Thus, in Tartar is (1) its
        own Elemental Water, (2), Astral Water which is the cause of
        disease. These two waters untie in Tartar, like male and female
        semen, producing a poison fatal to our flesh and blood. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How is this fatal result produced? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>The Salt in flesh and blood being the
        medium of the other two, when the former is in health flesh and
        blood remain whole; on the separation of salt destruction
        begins. The same can be converted into all kinds of salts.
        According to the transmutation of the disease. Thus, in dropsy,
        the microcosmic salt is melted, by the above poisons, to water;
        now flesh and blood lose their being, and are changed into
        water, their primary matter. The Nutriment (which is not yet
        blood) is not water, but a viscous liquor, a medium between
        primary and final matter, i.e., between water and blood, or
        flesh, or whatever else was to become of the Nutriment. This
        medium is also resolved into water. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> How comes it that Nature resolves some
        Tartars, driving them out with the water, and others not? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>In the Tartar resolvable by Nature, the
        elemental poison alone does the mischief. This your laxatives
        and herbs may expel. Hence you may cure such dropsy. But when
        the elemental poison is united to the firmamental, then Nature’s
        laxatives have no power, and --- the water reappearing after
        tapping --- you call the disease incurable. Hence it is evident
        that you understand not medicine and the causes of diseases. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have seen some dropsical patients cured,
        and also many die. Now, I understand that elemental diseases are
        cured with elemental Medicines. But firmamental ones alone with
        firmamental remedies, of which we Galenists know nothing. I
        understand also what Paracelsus calls elemental disease. I would
        know something more concerning Tartar before we come to the
        Medicine for Tartar. </p>
      <p><i>Berhardus:</i> How can I treat of all the mysteries of
        Tartar in a single disease? Tartar is a wonderful creation of
        God’s --- in it is the mother of all creatures. The upper Heaven
        procreates from it wondrous things on earth, and the Astra
        Microcosmi (stars of the lesser world, i.e., human body), many
        diseases, of which I will now say nothing. Would that physicians
        knew Tartar --- not only its transmutations in food and drink
        --- but also what God has created from it in Nature! They would
        then behold great wonders, daily before our eyes but not
        recognized. Hence many despise Paracelsus’s writings through
        ignorance, not knowing Tartar more than the peasant who says
        Tartar is the crust in wine barrels. The time has come when
        this, and other, blindness must be exposed, to the praise of God
        and weal of the sick. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> In the future I will pay more attention to
        Tartar and its diseases. Tell me, now, how is it resolved and
        expelled? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Paracelsus names two Medicines, an external
        and an internal one. The former is to digest, mature, and
        resolve the disease, expelling the inward, viscous Tartar. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> He says the Medicines to expel Tartar are
        dung, and come from dung, as: Columbinum and Gallinaceum; what
        these things are I know not, e.g., Rebis! </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The learned are wont, when treating of
        Nature’s secrets, to wrap up the truth in other matter. Here he
        gives the Medicine its right name, i.e., Rebis, adding
        Columbinum and Gallinaceum to mislead his enemies. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I doubt whether external poultices are able
        to resolve Tartar, which lies so deep in the body. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Poultices, liniments, etc., are not to be
        rejected; although they resolve not the Tartar, they promote the
        action of the medicine. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Must Rebis be applied externally, like
        Gallinaceum and Colubinum? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Know that man is divided into inner and
        outer man. Each has its Medicine, and, since the outer man is
        but dust and ashes, and of a like nature is the Materia Morbi
        which plagues us, so also must the Medicine consist of things
        similar to these --- called by Paracelsus stercora (filth). Not
        that the Medicine is filth, but it arises in filth, as the inner
        in the outer man; and, even as death divides the inner and outer
        man, so does art separate Medicine from filth. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is this dung from which the Medicine to
        cure Tartar is taken? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> You may learn this from Paracelsus who says:
        External and Internal Medicine are similar; both have a head;
        one helps the other. From these words it follows that Columbinum
        and Gallinaceum are not the external Medicine, for, how are they
        similar to Mercury? And how have they a head? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I don’t know what he calls Mercury. Mercury
        is commonly called Quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Mercury is a general term; it exists in all
        creatures, and is water. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Here he means metallic Mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Not at all, although it may appear so. That
        is not our Mercury which is found in Quicksilver and all other
        metals. The matter (primary) of Quicksilver and metals is water
        --- frozen water, like crystal. Thus, also, there is water in
        metals. A mineral, sulphureous, igneous Spirit pervades this
        water and transmutes it into a metal. Chemists call it a
        generating spirit, and say: Dry water and the generating spirit
        are Nature’s principles. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I see I must have a better knowledge of
        metals to thoroughly understand this Mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Many, both Ancients and Moderns, have
        written about the metals. Read them. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>I have read them long ago. They differ. I
        fancy they have had but little experience. By reading and
        speculation Truth cannot be attained. Seeing and handling is
        necessary. You have seen and experienced a resolution of metals.
        Hence you can inform me correctly. Seeing is Believing! As the
        Proverb says: The ocular witness of one is better than the
        hearsay evidence of ten. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I admit you cannot discover the truth about
        Tartar without knowing what Mercury is. But what shall I tell
        you about secrets which are said to be unfathomable? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Let a thing be hidden ever so long, it must
        come to light at last. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>It is said: Time brings Roses. Time also
        reveals nature’s secrets. Time has given me knowledge which I
        will here impart to you. Basel, Cologne, Denmark, Silesia, and
        where else the great Paracelsian doctors dwell, wish to reveal
        nothing before the time. I like not these long prefaces. They
        affirm that our Autumn is not yet come, and therefore are our
        fruits sour. That is not bringing Paracelsian Medicine to light.
      </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have heard many learned men say the same. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Wherefore much talk and no instruction. Who
        would guess we had tasted a drop of Paracelsian Truth? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I should think more highly of it, were the
        students first taught the right foundation on which Occult
        Medicine stands. But one chatters of Antimony, another of Gold,
        Pearls, Coral, etc. I know Antimony is a strong emetic and
        purgative, as also Hellebore. I know that Pearls comfort, as
        also Melissa, Crocus, etc. Here in dropsy Mercury cures, but so
        also does Coloquint. Although I am acquainted with this, yet my
        knowledge is no knowledge, since I am ignorant of the basis and
        cause. Hence those who are instructed should lecture and write
        concerning the foundation, that young doctors might understand
        Paracelsus’ books. If that be not done, the Paracelsian tree,
        which began to flourish Anno ’58, will bear no fruit for many
        years. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> You are right. Our opponents believe us to
        have no other foundation than what we know concerning the three
        principles, S., Sulphur, and Salt. But these learned gentlemen
        are so misled by their envy and hatred, that they judge of
        unknown matters as a blind man of colours. The lost art of
        Medicine --- recovered by Paracelsus --- had an externally sure
        foundation, against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail, let
        alone the trashy books which Erastus, with his blind, stubborn
        adherents, has vomited forth against God and the truth. The true
        principles will remain as we teach them, but it is untrue to say
        that they are our foundation. I well know this house stands on
        the earth, and the earth is its foundation. But what the earth
        stands on, and what its foundation is, every peasant does not
        know, also not Dr Fortyle at Heidelberg, although he be a good
        Dialectician and Rhetorician, and well read in Aristotle. He who
        is acquainted with the basis of our three principles, knows our
        foundation, not Galenus and his spawn, Erastus. Be not surprised
        that many followers of Paracelsus are ignorant of this
        foundation. Remember rather the text: “Many are called but few
        chosen”. Medicine comes not from seeing and hearing, or much
        reading, but from God, through inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
        It is in God, and comes from Him. From Him we should speak and
        write, not from ink and paper, as many of our followers do. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have read in Paracelsus that many would
        adopt his practice, did he not beg them not to attempt this
        until after long experience. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> We wish to fly before the time, hence we
        must drown with Cato in the deep sea. What think you, who shall
        explain the mysteries of Paracelsus? Truly we consider ourselves
        great philosophers, and yet our knowledge is nothing but vanity.
        Hence the proverb: The world is ruled by opinions. The present
        time is not ripe for the knowledge of these mysteries, for it
        has never tasted rest. When the time cones --- before the Day of
        Judgment --- in which the secrets of all hearts are laid bare,
        at that time, says Paracelsus: I order my writings to be judged.
      </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I understand not this passage concerning
        rest. Be that as it may, I know neither doctor nor master is
        born so. All must be learnt. In this is labour and trouble until
        one has understood what one would learn. Then one has rest from
        learning. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Happy is he who is at rest. He has conquered
        all labour and trouble. E now lives in knowledge; therein his
        heart abides, which in time was troubled and bound fast in woes.
        The physician must be at rest who expound Paracelsian to youth.
        Whether the doctor is at rest who spends much time in preparing
        Vitriol and Tartar, I leave to the judgment of every learned
        man. Our aim should be a very different one. Hence you must not
        take my speaking of these things in a manner beyond you
        comprehension amiss. What I know of these secrets I have
        acquired with great pains and labour. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I would have instruction from your
        experience, not from this or that author. When we were young
        comrades in Italy you would be subject to no sect, but you said
        with Horace: “A stranger I, whithersoever the winds may bear me;
        No lord claims my allegiance”. Hence I would listen to your
        views, not those of Galenus or of any other contained in Books
        and Writings. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> It would not be easy to do without books,
        but what is contained and hidden in books can only be expounded
        by those who have penetrated into the hidden meaning and spirit
        of the same. We all know that our Christian New Testament has
        been written by men full of the Holy Ghost. But when men,
        possessing little of the Holy Spirit and much of their own,
        approach these mysteries, what harm and trouble they cause in
        the world! Thus also must happen, in or Faculty, to those who
        --- knowing how to prepare Oil of Mercury or Vitriol, etc. ---
        would meddle with the medicine of Paracelsus. Hence I would beg
        every reasonable man not to attempt to discover the mysteries of
        Medicine with such vain and mechanical work, but to reflect on
        the names of the mysteries, what Oil of Mercury, Juice of Coral,
        Resin of Gold, really mean, for they must not be taken
        literally. Behold the disciples of Galenus, how many thousand
        books they have made out of a single one of his! Were we to do
        so, the literature of Paracelsus would soon grow up. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I believe Galenus is easier to understand
        than Paracelsus; hence easier to write about. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>What he says concerning the properties of
        Simples is plain. Also his phantasies concerning these
        properties are not hard to grasp. But it is different with the
        Books of Paracelsus. He writes concerning Nature’s Secrets and
        God’s Wondrous Works. Everyone cannot understand, nor write
        about, these. They must, indeed, be simpletons who imagine that
        Tartarus Auri is gold, Mercurius precipitatus quicksilver, etc.
        They give it to patients, saying they have it from Paracelsus,
        an excellent physician. O, you simpletons! These are secrets
        only to be understood by those who have received understanding
        from above. Hence no one will do much with Tincture of Mercury,
        Potable Gold, etc., until he has discovered their real
        signification. Since you also regard Science more for use and
        profit than for her own sake, think not that God will grant your
        wish! Therefore, I again beg of those called to these things to
        leave details and seek the foundation. They will thus gain a
        knowledge of the mysteries requisite for expounding the Books of
        Paracelsus, which should not continue in darkness, but be
        explained by us. I will be the first to tread this path, and, in
        the due measure that He shall grant me knowledge, so shall I
        interpret the same. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> A Parisian doctor, L.G. (calling himself Leo
        Suavius), has written a treatise on the Book De Vita Longa. How
        like you his interpretation of Paracelsus’ terms? He finds no
        difficulty in common names like Mercury, Vitriol, etc.; hence, I
        suspect, he has not yet discovered the secrets of Medicine. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>This good Leo Suavius has wished to
        communicate to others his opinion, derived from a study of
        Paracelsus, for them to accept or reject according to their own
        private judgment. He has made the first attempt to expound the
        magic words in Paracelsus. For this he is to be praised, but no
        one is bound by his opinion. As regards Medical Simples, perhaps
        he has never tried them, and believes the same to possess the
        virtues described by Paracelsus. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>I used to think in this way. Now I find it
        is different. Mercury puzzled me much before I found out that a
        secret was contained in the name. Some days ago I read in a
        Treatise (by Castner, of Hamburg) that Mercury is an Arcanum the
        like of which the world cannot shew. Hence I would fain know
        what it is. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>To come to the point! Listen to what I am
        about to say! You are a Chemist, and skilled in experimental
        work. Hence you will easily understand me. Had you been an
        armchair doctor, my speech would sound strange in your ears.
        Therefore will I here speak to you and your like, yet, not
        otherwise or father than is meet, and God’s Word permits. What
        says Paracelsus of Mercury in that Chapter? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> That it is the internal Medicine, having
        power to expel the resolved Salt. It is to be separated from its
        ore when dead, foe when dead it is mercury, when living
        Quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> How understand you this preparation? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Mercury --- i.e., Quicksilver, is to be
        extracted from its ore, and a precipitate made from it with
        Hydrochloric Acid. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> What is the ore of Mercury? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Red mineral earth. Some call it Cinnabar;
        some say it is the Minium of the Ancients. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> When Mercury is extracted from this ore, is
        it dead or living? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Living. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Is it living in the ore, or is it made
        living by melting? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Water makes it not alive, hence it is so
        created in the ore. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Behold paracelsus speaks not of such
        Mercury, but of that which in its ore is dead. Extraction from
        the ore neither kills it nor makes it alive. Hence it must be
        wither dead or living in the ore. The Mercury we mean must be
        dead, not living. Is not Erastus ashamed to accuse Paracelsus of
        purging dropsy with Hydrargyrum (Mercury), since Paracelsus
        publicly says it is the dead Mercury; speaking not of
        Hydrargyrum, i.e., Quicksilver --- as Erastus lies --- but of
        Mercury, which is no Hydrargyrum? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Erastus, like others, thinks Mercury is
        Quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Erastus, who sets up for a learned man,
        ought to understand this matter better than common people,
        ignorant of letters and science. For those who wander about,
        boasting of great arts, and promising to enrich others, whilst
        they are themselves beggars, are commonly a low sort. One is a
        goldsmith, another a tailor, a third is a cobbler, or runaway
        monk, or student. Some know a little Latin, some none at all. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Such artists have often caused me much loss.
      </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> It serves you and all others right, who
        think to discover the great mysteries of God from such
        indifferent folk. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Although they be unlearned, God often gives
        more grace to simple, common folk, than to the literate. It has
        often happened so. God’s grace is not restricted. He is a
        Searcher of hearts, and according to them does He shew his
        mercy, not according to external appearances, which we men alone
        regard. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> I have never seen roast pigeons fly into
        anyone’s mouth. When God gives understanding and grace in
        Magical mysteries, He also gives understanding in other Sciences
        belonging to magic. One finds not understanding with such
        people, let them therefore not boast of Grace! They poke about
        in Alchemistic books, saying Mercury is Quicksilver --- to be
        calcinated in Aquafortis, precipitate --- or boiled for four
        weeks with gold in a phial. Then it is an excellent medicine for
        all diseases, aurum vitae! Such a philosopher is Erastus (he did
        not get much from Paracelsus), who gave Oil of Vitriol to
        Excellent Councillor D. Alesius, thus sacrificing his life. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> He is a right learned man; the world has not
        his like; it is meet that he be spoken of respectfully; for he
        is a prefessor at Heidelberg, is well read in Zwinglis and
        Arrius. But what do I hear? Does he use Vitriol? I have never
        found any good in it. The Abbot of Fulda died of it. It ran
        through his penis into the bed and burned the sheets. I have
        also heard of a Queen who died shortly after it was given her by
        the physician. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> He has killed the good Alesius with it, and
        also others whose names I will not mention. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Since he uses the Simples of Paracelsus, why
        is he so bitter, writing so many lies angst him? </p>
      <p>Bernhardus: Paracelsus has no greater enemies than the Galenian
        doctors, who think that they have only to look at a book to know
        the contents thereof. But the learned asses reflect not that
        Paracelsus wrote in the Magic style. Hence their brain is so
        full of raillery that Magic knowledge cannot enter. Therefore
        they cry: “Magic is Sorcery! Beware, it is the devil’s work!”.
        Whereas Magic is no Sorcery, but the greatest wisdom in God’s
        works, and a penetrating into Occult Nature. So Erastus has read
        much of Oil of Vitriol! He understands not more than a layman,
        who knows that Vitriol is Copperas. Forsooth, a fine doctor!
        With respect to Mercury, he pretends Paracelsus means
        Quicksilver thereby, although he must have read in “The Book
        Concerning the Disease of the Gall” how violently Paracelsus
        wrote against Mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I know all, and think not other than that
        Mercury is Quicksilver. But Paracelsus might have prepared it
        medicinally so as to neutralize the poison. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> He is publicly against it in the Book
        Concerning Consumption”. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Since Mercury is nothing but Quicksilver, why
        does he use the name? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Why call a thing other than it is? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> We know that gold is killed Quicksilver, and
        Quicksilver living gold, but when speaking of gold, we call it
        gold and not Quicksilver. If Paracelsus did the same we should
        know what he meant. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>The Ancient Philosophers have named this
        matter Mercury; Paracelsus has retained the same, writing not
        for the common people but for philosophers. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Who are the philosophers? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>Those who know Nature better than
        bookworms. A Philosopher, hearing the name of Mercury, knows
        what it is; but he who knows not, holding mercury of physicians
        to be Quicksilver, is a Sophist. Hence, Erastus is a Sophist,
        not having even learnt what Mercury is; but he is proud of
        knowing Greek, and that he can speak of Hydrargyrum. Paracelsus
        says in many places that Mercury is not Quicksilver. Erastus has
        doubtless seen this, but suppresses the fact in order to
        prejudice Paracelsus. Here the reasonable man perceives why
        Erastus and his like rage against Paracelsus. The devil seeks
        ways and means to preserve his Kingdom in this world. But, as
        the Apostle says, when perfection comes imperfection will be
        destroyed. This will also happen here when all sects shall be
        annihilated. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Has Paracelsus not made Medicine from
        Quicksilver? What else is the Mercury of which he writes in this
        Chapter? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Just the same of which he says that it lies
        in the ore and is separated from the same, dead. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is the ore? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> A mineral in which the Philosophers’ Mercury
        has been created by God. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I thought Philosophers’ Mercury was
        artificial, and you say God has created it. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> God has created Mercury like other
        creatures. Art can do no more than extract and separate Mercury
        from its ore. Although God has created it, He has also created
        the physician who converts it into medicine. For as it is found
        it is rather a poison than a Medicine. Hence the physician
        should know the art of separating the poison from the medicine.
        Paracelsus here speaks of this separation, saying it is to be
        separated dead from its ore, for dead it is Mercury, but living
        Quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Quicksilver has also an ore from which it is
        extracted. Does Paracelsus mean this ore or another? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> In the ore of Quicksilver there is not the
        Sulphuric Spirit which kills Quicksilver; therefore he does not
        mean the same ore. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead, all
        come from ores, each metal having its own ore in which
        Quicksilver is dead. Does he understand these ores to be the
        ores from which Mercury is to be extracted? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> No. For metal-yielding ores possess not the
        Mercurial Sulphuric Spirit, but that of their respective metals.
        Paracelsus speaks here of the Quicksilver of Mercury, i.e., of
        the Quicksilver by which Sulphur of Mercury is killed. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>I know no other Sulphur which kills
        Quicksilver but the Sulphur which is in the ore of metals. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Hence you have paid but little attention to
        this passage in Paracelsus. Take and read the paragraph. What
        say you to it now? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I had not looked for Mercury here; I have
        often read the passage, but skipped over it. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Have you not read in Alchemistic books that
        there is a medium between Mercury of the metals and common
        Mercury? </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have never seen it expressly stated that
        the medium Mercury is to be found in this ore. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The reason for this is because there is in
        this ore much poison which, used by those ignorant of
        Alchemistic processes, might do serious harm to the sick. Hence
        it is not to be called by its name. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I know many Alchemists who prepare this
        Medicine, but all differently. Some use it for physic, others
        wish to make Gold and Silver of it. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> There is a great art in its preparation.
        First, it must b separated pure from its ore, and then digested
        in its full strength. This digestion is known to very few of
        those even who can separate it from its ore. Before digestion it
        is crude Mercury, and the crudity is poison, of which beware.
        When first discovered the way of separating this Mercury from
        the ore, I thought nothing more was wanting, But, from
        experiments, I found it to be crude Mercury, and that I had not
        penetrated into its Arcanum. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>Although I have never attempted the
        separation from the ore, I see that this can be done. But how it
        is afterwards to be digested and brought to perfection I know
        not. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> This digestion is effected only by the
        Tincture of the Sun and Moon, which digests not this Mercury
        alone, but transmutes all other metals and expels their poison.
      </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> These tinctures are beyond my comprehension
        --- much has been written concerning them, but methinks, by
        those who have never set eyes on them. I do not see how a
        physician in our time is to have these tinctures and perfect
        medicines therewith, seeing that few know more about them than
        about the Mercury of Paracelsus. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The tinctures cannot be spoken of too
        highly, but they can be easily understood by those who rightly
        use their understanding. But we are lunatic Alchemists, as
        Paracelsus says, threshing empty straw. God has given the
        tincture to the physician to purify unclean things, to transmute
        them into gold, and to expel from men all diseases arising from
        the influences of the stars. Hence it purifies not alone metals
        but also our blood. For it is the very essence of our life and
        the Anatomy in the Greater World --- an eternal unquenchable
        fire --- ignis non urens, ignis coelestis --- fructifying all
        things, restoring the dead to life. I will inform you further of
        these tinctures when treating of the Sun mentioned in this
        chapter. Here you shall learn of the dead Mercury, which is to
        be digested by these tinctures after separation from the ore.
        The same is the medicine which administered in dropsy expels the
        resolved salt. The other two medicines, viz.: --- the Element
        Water and the Sun, shall be explained afterwards. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Therefore this Mercury is to be our purge,
        expelling water in dropsy. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Before the water overflows the heart. It is
        to be administered when the influence is greatest, i.e., when
        the dropsical stone is in its greatest virulence. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> But --- if I understand this passage aright,
        nor purgation, but digestion by external medicine must take
        place. I will ask you concerning the external medicine later on.
        Please inform me now more fully concerning the generation of
        Mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Much has been written concerning this
        generation (as usual in our time) by those knowing little about
        it. But occult things are not to be fathomed by speculation, but
        by experience in the Art of Alchemy. Hence their writings are
        nothing but a misleading of youths who trust in them. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I cannot sufficiently lament the labyrinth
        such books have led me into. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Concerning the name Mercury, know that it is
        a matter of Gold, Silver, and of al the other metals. But the
        understanding of this is not according to the letter, especially
        not as regards our laxative Mercury. It is not a component of
        metals, but that which it was before its heaven --- i.e.,
        Sulphur --- decocted and prepared it in its ore, the same is the
        substance and matter of all metals. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> The philosophers say all metals are formed
        from Quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> That is false, for Quicksilver is a metal in
        gold as well as in silver, etc. But since it is living, it s not
        reckoned a metal in Adept Philosophy. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander: </i>Since Mercury is the matter of metals, as
        you have just said, what sort of thing is Mercury? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Just the same as the substance out of which
        Quicksilver, Gold, Silver, Lead, Copper, etc., and our Medical
        Mercury, are made. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> Has this matter no name? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>The inventors of this Art have called it
        Mercury. Their successors, interpreting Magic literally --- have
        supposed Mercury to be nothing but Quicksilver, which is the
        opinion of all book sages to this day. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> This matter must doubtless be in minerals.
        Paracelsus says metals are formed from water --- is it water? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> All these things are of water. But water is
        the first matter --- and the most remote --- of metals. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> What is mediate, and immediate, matter? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> Although one should not speak more clearly
        concerning these things than is taught in Magical Books, yet ---
        since some of these books treating of this generation have
        doubtless been lost --- consider it necessary to explain this
        matter to preserve youth from false Alchemists. Therefore,
        listen. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> I have occupied myself much with alchemistic
        books, but have never found that they inform us concerning the
        origin of metals. I have therefore lately concluded that it is
        all trash. </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus:</i> The same was my experience when trusting to
        books. But when I found it different in water, I let Aristotle,
        Albertus, and his like be, and followed after the truth, of
        which I thought more than all their books. You will also
        understand this secret by paying attention. The primary matter
        of Quicksilver and of all metals is, in the beginning, as an oil
        growing out of saltpeter in the hills. Now, all salts are
        nothing but water mixed with a little earth, which earth gives
        the water a taste. For according to the kind of earth is the
        taste of salts. There is one kind of earth in common salt,
        another in saltpeter, another in vitriol another in alumina,
        etc. In dissolving salts these earths are found and become
        visible. The salt growing out of saltpetre is dry, melts not
        when thrown into water, but is like glass or crystal. Chemists
        call this Mercurial Salt. Albertus was of opinion that the white
        earth in alum was most nearly related to this Mercury. But that
        cannot be, for aluminous earth has the nature of salts, but
        Mercurial earth that of stones. Mercury is composed of two
        things, water and earth. </p>
      <p><i>Alexander:</i> You mean here common water? </p>
      <p><i>Bernhardus: </i>Nothing else. But the earth is not common
        earth; it is the subtlest and purest of elements. It has many
        names which are daily in our mouths. But none save the Magus
        knows its true name. I should like to explain to you somewhat of
        this mystery, but you are too deep in the letter which blinds
        your eyes. Yet at the time of the New Birth I will not forget
        you. Understand that this earth is the subject into which flow
        all the influences of the whole firmament, the powers, virtues,
        and action of all the stars, an eternal dwelling of all earthly
        spirits, bad, good, sweet and sour, black and white, not alone
        the subject of all metallic forms, but also of all mineral ones
        in all things created by God under the Moon’s orb. New, I will
        speak here of metals alone to the exclusion of other things. </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>To come at once to the point, I will begin by saying that the
        nearer man was to the Creation of the World the greater was is
        desire for knowledge of Him who had created him, with heaven and
        Earth, and all that therein is. </p>
      <p>This desire was so strong that it left him no peace until he
        had found what he sought. At that time there was neither
        Theology, nor Astronomy, nor Medicine. Man knew no more than he
        had heard from his father Adam, how he had been created by God
        and placed in Paradise, had sinned therein, and had been
        expelled therefrom into the trouble and misery of this world. </p>
      <p>How, then, should man know his Creator? In Heaven God was far
        removed from mortal eyes. Man could not behold Him in flesh and
        yet live. What should he do to find his Creator? Whilst
        meditating thus he observed --- doubtless by Divine inspiration
        --- that the master can be recognized by Hi Masterpiece, in the
        great world and the little world (which is man) made out of the
        great world --- or rather taken from and separated from it.
        Thus, man acknowledged the Master in His works in that great
        world wherein he saw a small grain grow into a great tree. He
        reflected further that the world must once have been different
        from what it is now, and that the seed grain which grows into a
        tree must once have been something else than a grain. He could
        not understand these things with his human reason, but continued
        to seek, and invented many arts, among them “The Art of Water”.
        For he beheld how everything was, by fire, destroyed and reduced
        to what it had been, i.e., to earth. He therefore thought of
        separating things by means of water, not to destroy them, but to
        see whether hidden properties might be revealed to him by this
        separation. Thus, after much pains, he at length discovered The
        Art of Separation. Then he wished to know how everything in the
        great world was put together, and so divided that world into
        three parts --- Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, i.e., one
        part he gave to the animals; the second to things growing out of
        the earth; the third to things growing under the earth. Then he
        began diligently to investigate one class after another. Man he
        assumed to be the nobles and most intelligent creature of God.
        By farther using his Art of Separation, and by comparing one
        thing with another, he found that the primary matter of man and
        the primary matter of the great world are one and the same
        thing. </p>
      <p>But this primary matter of the world and of man is a
        Crystalline Water, of which the Holy Writ says: --- “Before God
        created Heaven and Earth, the Spirit of the Lord brooded over
        the Waters”. Thus water became a primary matter of both. But
        where remains the Spirit of the Lord, which brooded over the
        waters, after the two worlds, i.e., heaven and earth, and man
        had been created from the same? I reply, in the primary matter
        of man and of the world. God, who is Perfection, has wished to
        dwell in man. But here the following question might be put: how
        did man know --- since the primary matter of man and of the
        world is a crystalline water --- how could man know whether the
        Spirit of the Lord had remained in this primary matter of the
        world, or of man? I reply, he knew it by the Art of Water, for
        Water was his teacher. This teacher shewed him how the world
        dies, how the Spirit departs from it, how the body is without
        Spirit, and the Spirit without body. He saw how the Spirit
        returns to the body, and the body revives. He saw by the decay
        of the world that it did not become again what it had been
        before. Hence it became plain to him that God dwells not in that
        which passes away, but in that which is Eternal. </p>
      <p>Thus far I have recorded (1) how God Almighty in the beginning
        created two things: the Great and the Small World; (2) How man
        was taken from the Great World and became a separate world; (3)
        How he discovered the Art of Water and learnt what was the
        primary matter of both Greater and Lesser World; (4) the
        qualities of each; (5) How the world is temporal --- man
        eternal. </p>
      <p>Now I will speak of the things arising from the water --- i.e.,
        primary matter, as well as how the first man discovered and
        divided them, taught them to his children, and described them. </p>
      <p>But this I write from my experience, of which alone I make use,
        and of the Spirit given me by God. Did I write from Theology,
        Astronomy, or Medicine, I should have to employ their respective
        terms. But I am ere teaching according to the rules of no
        special art, but according to that Art which was before them
        all, and is the mother of them all, i.e., Magic, which in our
        time has gone into exile, and lies hidden, God knows where, but
        is quite unknown to men who, relying upon their understanding as
        upon the Holy Ghost, exalt themselves like Lucifer against
        heaven. But, banished from before God’s face for our pride, we
        may one day confess that our human intellect is naught, that by
        the same we cause ourselves much trouble, irritating the
        Celestial forces, whence arise plagues and pestilence. When we
        pray God for light --- not by words but deeds --- He will again
        turn His face towards us, and, putting an end to our misery and
        unreason, will restore to us the Light of nature that it may
        shine in our understandings as the Sun in the Heavens, without
        which the Stars give no light. For our human light, i.e.,
        reason, is by itself dark, and is illumed by this Sun, not by
        means of ink and paper, but by inspiration. By this Divine Sun
        alone can the magical Art be explained. </p>
      <p>When man by experience had learnt that, as God out of water had
        made the Great World, i.e., heaven and earth, with all that
        therein is, and out of the Great World had made man in His own
        image, He found that in the small world, i.e., in man, Heaven
        and Earth and all things contained in the Great World had their
        counterparts. He also found that all bodies contained three
        palpable and visible substances: (1) Water; (2) Salt; (3)
        Sulphur. These three things comprise everything created by God
        --- neither more nor less. </p>
      <p>When man learnt how, out of water, through corruption and
        generation, these three substances are born, he had not yet
        found his Creator, whose Spirit brooded over the water, as the
        Scriptures say. He therefore takes the three bodies, narrowly
        examines one after the other, reflects that God is a Spirit,
        invisible to human eyes, and that --- since He has created all
        things --- He must be a Living Power. Therefore man takes water,
        regards it, finds therein nothing but the four elements. Then
        again taking Sulphur, he finds also nothing therein but the four
        elements, that is, nothing stable. Lastly he takes Salt --- sees
        there is something more therein than in water and sulphur, yea,
        he finds two things: (1) A water not different from the former;
        (2) A Sulphur differing from the former, ie., a Sulphur which
        burns not. The third thing he found not, for it vanished from
        before his eyes. What should he do? It was gone. Where should he
        find it? He regarded the water, the sulphur, two fine, pure,
        white substances; but the third, which had lain among them and
        joined the two together, was departed, and it was the same he
        had been seeking. </p>
      <p>Hence he became very sad, crying say and night unto the Lord,
        until he found what he sought. But who shall describe how it was
        found? Or what ears may listen to so great a mystery? Verily, in
        this is contained the Wisdom of all Celestial and Terrestrial
        things! Here is the same mystery as when, in the latter times,
        the Word was made Flesh, the chosen partakers of which see
        Heaven open with St Stephen, and the Son of Man sitting at God’s
        right hand. And --- with St Paul --- they ascend into the Third
        Heaven. Hence it is permitted to none to reveal it. Through this
        mystery the Magi have known the Trinity, and the Incarnation of
        the Word, and have written concerning the same many centuries
        before the birth of Christ. But woe to the man who shall reveal
        this secret in any other way than it has already been revealed!
        Hence I am to be excused for being silent concerning this
        Arcanum, which God reserves for His beloved, and will in His
        mercy reveal to those honestly striving for the same. </p>
      <p>To speak farther in respect of the third substance, wherein is
        the salt that is water and earth --- and of the Spirit of the
        Lord brooding over the waters: when the Almighty had thus
        enlightened Man, shewing him how God gives Himself into our
        hands and dwells in us --- in short, with Heaven and Earth, is
        in us and about us --- He thus shewed him the great love that He
        bears to man, that He is always bear to him, delivering him from
        all evil so soon as Man knows His name --- i.e., knows where He
        is and when and where to find Him. Yet is this not in phantasies
        and thoughts, not in books, but in Heaven --- i.e., in Man
        himself --- not in subtle speculations, but with diligence and
        labour, in the sweat of his brow. Who can measure the joy of man
        when he had obtained a knowledge of his Creator, or comprehend
        the Grace communicated to him buy God through such knowledge;
        for what could he desire on earth that would thereby not be
        given him? He had for his bodily, human needs Medicine to
        restore his health. He had his daily bread, peace upon earth,
        and, after this life, Eternity. That was the fruit of the field
        he tilled in the sweat of his brow, that the reward of his Lord;
        for he served Him not by words, but deeds; not by speculation,
        but by his handiwork in the sweat of his brow. And as the
        service was, so the reward --- i.e., in works, not spiritually
        and phantastically --- as happens nowadays to many who, in
        armchairs and warm rooms, comfortable imagine remedies against
        diseases until they produce a phantastical recipe for their
        patient, which, however, does not help the sufferer. Thus does
        the Master of Lies recompense his followers. But the Master of
        Truth hates such chatter, and adorns his children with iracles.
        It is a great scandal that a sick man, created in God’s image,
        should seek that help from the creature which the Creator alone
        can give. But, as we know Him, so does He help us. </p>
      <p>Therefore Man was right to rejoice at having found his Saviour
        and Creator, who supplied all his wants. Therefore Man also
        helped his neighbor in his need, fed him when hungry, comforted
        him when dying. Therefore also he found ways and means to
        preserve this Divine knowledge for his descendants, and wrote
        three books: </p>
      <p>In the First he treated of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>In the Second of Heaven and its Stars. </p>
      <p>In the Third of the powers of the things growing out of the
        earth. </p>
      <p>These three subjects being: </p>
      <p>(1) Theology, (2) Astronomy, (3) Medicine. </p>
      <p>By means of Theology he teaches and describes the Middle
        Substance among the other three --- i.e., the Spirit of the
        Lord. </p>
      <p>Astronomy treats of the Water, over which the Spirit of the
        Lord brooded. </p>
      <p>By means of Medicine he describes the third substance --- i.e.,
        Earth --- which, through the Spirit of the Lord, was joined to,
        and made one ting with, water. Thus also Astronomy and Medicine,
        through Theology, are united into one --- i.e., are three in one
        substance. </p>
      <p>In order to communicate his knowledge aright he was obliged to
        arrange his subject into the above triadic divisions. For had he
        comprised everything in one Science, great confusion would have
        resulted. </p>
      <p>These three books were revealed by him to his children and
        kinsmen. </p>
      <p>Thus did the knowledge of Theology, Astronomy and Medicine
        grow. Each one studied what he was fit for according to his
        capacity. Now, these people were called Magi --- i.e., wise men
        --- who were of more account than others; hence, also, were they
        kings, princes, priests, and lords. These did great wonders
        among the people, curing the sick, restoring sight to the blind,
        cleansing the lepers, healing the dropsical, giving alms to the
        poor. </p>
      <p>The other people, who were not Magi, considered them more as
        gods than as men. </p>
      <p>Thus came Theology, Astronomy, and Medicine into the world. </p>
      <p>The Spirit, by inspiration of which these Magi wrote, remained
        with them alone; the books got amongst the people. When now the
        common man saw the wonders described by the Magi, he --- having
        possession of these books --- thought himself already a Magus,
        and wished to accomplish the works of one, especially in
        Medicine. But when it came to acts he found difficulties, and
        his ignorance of the hidden sense caused him to interpret these
        books according to his own imagination. </p>
      <p>For instance, when he read: “Scammony purges bile”, or
        “Wal-lwort (dwarf-alder) cures dropsy”, etc. --- he sought until
        he found some herb “rumbling through the belly”, and, jumping to
        the conclusion that bile was thereby purged, the same herb was
        in future his Scammony of the magi. Again, on discovering a herb
        of some little use in dropsy, he set it down as the wall-wort of
        the magi. A herb of some effect in fevers was the Chamomile of
        the Magi, and so forth. </p>
      <p>Thus were Commentaries on Medicine written, and there arose a
        Sect calling themselves physicians, multiplying as weeds are
        wont to do. When now the Magi died out (perhaps God would have
        it so), true Medicine also died out with them; and after their
        death there remained this Sect, who ignorantly arrogated to
        themselves a knowledge of the magical Books. They, however, were
        not kings, princes, priests, or lords --- they were beggars, who
        by their chatter sought money and goods and honours with the
        people. The greatest chatterer was accounted the best physician.
      </p>
      <p>These also wrote many books concerning herbs and diseases. In
        the course of time the true volumes of Wisdom got lost --- what
        could be done with them? They were too hard to understand! Thus
        it happens that in our own time we have none of them. </p>
      <p>In a similar way was Theology treated. Ignorant men intruded
        themselves into this Science also. Possessing the written words,
        they imagined they knew God, and farther study was unnecessary!
        So these were Mouth-and-Belly Theologians, making much noise
        among the people. But they healed no sick, restored not the lame
        and blind. It was not their province, but that of the
        physicians, to wit! </p>
      <p>The same thing happened in Astronomy. They beheld the Moon,
        Sun, and Stars rise and set, and, having made these elementary
        observations, straightway considered themselves Astronomers.
        Imagining many spheres and circles, they wrote many imposing
        volumes about them. Who could contradict or expose them? The
        Magi were dead, and the world was filled with lies; and so it
        remains to this day. How could God punish the world more
        severely than by permitting these false teachers, who knew not
        the true origin of the three Faculties? </p>
      <p>Thus came Theologians into the world. They have received their
        spiritual understanding, not from the Magi, not from the Light
        of Nature --- by the light of which we may know Him and His
        creatures, as the Magi found Him --- but from Theology, in which
        they have darkened the secrets of God to the utmost, so that the
        knowledge of God, i.e., the treasure of the whole world, might
        remain with them alone, when it should be the possession of all
        those whom God reveals Himself. Why then should he not also
        reveal Himself unto us? Are we no men as well as they? I reply,
        there is an impediment in our sloth. It is much easier to sit in
        church for an hour, listening to another, or at home to read one
        book after another, than with all the resources of body, mind,
        and estate, in the sweat of our brow, to seek diligently after
        the Living Spirit of God --- breathed by Him into the lump of
        earth when Adam was created --- which opens our eyes, revealing
        the secrets of Holy Writ, of Peter, of Paul, and of the
        Apostles. Thus may we become theologians, useful to the world,
        and able to help our neighbor in his need. Thus also may we
        receive from the Spirit of the Lord in us health and peace, may
        know the Sin of Man, and how His Flesh transmutes our flesh into
        His Flesh and Life Eternal. But, say the Theologians, we have
        read the Scriptures and theological works, we possess the plain
        truth --- what more would you have? And they testify as to their
        doctrine, and as to whom has made theologians of them, by
        stirring up one country against another, and by causing misery
        in the world. </p>
      <p>They have found a sign in the Church, viz., that of water. Had
        they sufficient understanding to know the meaning of this
        symbol, they would also know what their Theology was worth. But
        to this hour not one of them understands the mystery, which,
        according to their opinion, is a Jewish or Heathen thing. Thus,
        also, have they rejected many Magical and Apostolical
        observances. Had they inquired into the causes of these
        observances, they would have discovered them to be Magical
        books, which give us as deep an, or even deeper, insight into
        God’s Mysteries than written books. Such Magical books have been
        in the Church from the beginning. They are not hidden away in
        boxes, but are open to everyone; and are to be found among Jews
        and Heathens, Turks and Tartars, but chiefly among Christians.
        They are there for rich and poor, learned and unlearned, crying
        out every day, and teaching us the way to truth. But who hears
        them? Have we not eats to hear their cries? Priests, monks, and
        nuns go about amongst us, and know themselves what they do. The
        Ark of the Testament is covered; they know as much as you. But
        never heed them; they speak but as they have been taught. Look
        rather up on High, reflect why we are here, consider what He
        knows Who has willed that we also should have knowledge, and you
        will receive Salvation from God. Inquire not after them what
        they do; they must do this for their daily bread. Let their
        chatter be. You have Moses and the Prophets, Christ and the
        Apostles; hear what they say. They speak not with the mouth
        alone, but with hands and feet, with fire and water, with silver
        and gold, with salt, with silk, with velvet, with stone, with
        black, with white, with red, with yellow, with wax, and with
        oil, etc. Hear not alone what the mouth says, what the salt
        says. Hey also speak, but another tongue. Learn this, and then
        Scribes and Pharisees will not be able to lead you astray, nor
        cause strife among you; yea, you will have peace in your
        conscience towards God and your neighbor. </p>
      <p>But if you hearken not to what we say, holding their works and
        books as sacred, you will be led away from one Sect to another,
        and suffer damage and shame in your bodies, wife, children,
        land, and servants. Our enemies will consume you, and thus shall
        be your reward for the wisdom falsely imagined by from the
        letter of our books. Therefore, hearken to our words. Learn to
        read these books, in which are no allegories, no metaphors, no
        parables, but the naked Truth. We are able to expound the Old
        and the New Testament, Not this or that peasant who has just
        come from the plough. Thus is it written in the Book of
        Ecclesiastes: “Happy is he who knowest her voice” (the voice of
        Truth). </p>
      <p>Medicine has also its Revelations, which have brought it to
        honour. </p>
      <p>(1) The books written by the Magi themselves. (2) The Signs
        which they, for our benefit, have chosen and appointed. For,
        when in the beginning the three Faculties were described, to
        each were signs given by which it might be interpreted, and for
        this cause: that if the Books were lost --- as afterwards
        happened to the one Faculty of Medicine --- something should
        remain by which Truth might be learnt. Hence to each Faculty
        certain imperishable signs are appointed. </p>
      <p>Of all the theological books, the two Testaments alone remain
        to us. There are also theological signs (that we might have
        other books in case the written ones were lost), such as: the
        mass, Hymns, etc., of which we have sufficiently treated above.
        The Medicinal books, written by the magi, are all lost. We have
        the signs alone. These are: all herbs and trees upon the earth.
        These signs are now our books, written by God Almighty alone,
        Who, in His boundless mercy, has communicated to us such books;
        not that these books are our health --- just as in Theology the
        Church Ordinances are not our salvation --- but that from them
        we should find health and salvation, by a right knowledge of the
        God Who ordained them. Many self-styled clever people, seeing
        that masses, singing, and organ-playing, wax and oil, and salt
        cannot save us, have rejected them. Why do not the doctors of
        Medicine do likewise? They see that Elder, Saxifrage, etc., do
        not cure Stone and Podagra, as the books relate. Why do they not
        forbid the earth to bear such fruits, since they do not what is
        written concerning them? It is not thus. God has created the
        earth and adorned it with its fruit, just as God’s Houses have,
        by God’s learned people, been adorned, which ornaments also will
        doubtless remain. The earth will keep its flowers, although
        Podagra be not cured thereby. Thus, the herbs and flowers are
        not the medicines, but only signs to point Medicine out to us,
        just as the Sacraments point God out to us, not that they are
        God, but appointed by God’s Word, even as the herbs in the field
        are created by the same. It is written: “Chelidonia
        (Swallow-wort) cures jaundice”. A book-learned doctor taking
        Chelidonia fails to cure jaundice therewith. Whose fault is it?
        That of God’s creatures, or of the Magi, or of the doctor
        disappointed of his fee? Verily, although with Chelidonia
        jaundice cannot be cured, yet its praise will doubtless remain
        in the books of Medicine. Not in those studied by armchair
        students, but in the books written by God Himself. These are the
        earth, with its herbs and flowers, given us by the magi to teach
        us the Science of Medicine when their books were lost (which has
        now occurred). Thus Chelidonia indicates to us the remedy for
        jaundice; not that it is the remedy, but a Medicinal Sign. Thus
        also with other plants. But we wish to hear nothing of magic,
        writing stately volumes, according to our thoughts, concerning
        herbs --- taking the Sign for the thing designated, and filling
        books with the virtues of this or that plant. We give large sums
        for such books, go to Bologna, Padua, hear much chatter about
        Medicine, but see no leper cleansed, no dropsy or podagra
        healed. We spend much money, and at last get a red (doctor’s
        hat) for our pains. But in time of need, when a cure is to be
        effected, all such chatter is not worth an empty nut. </p>
      <p>What shall we say concerning the third Book of Wisdom,
        Astronomy? We have its Magical Books, although cruelly mutilated
        and sophisticated. We have also its origins, viz., Sun, Moon,
        Stars, and the whole Firmament. But this Faculty has fared like
        the other two. We confound the thing designated with the sign,
        i.e., the Firmament and magical Books --- not having yet learnt
        that a nut has both shell and kernel. But the kernel is not the
        shell, nor the shell the kernel. The Sun, Moon, and Firmament
        are the Signs which every peasant can see, but the thing
        designated is understood alone by the divinely taught man. He
        knows that there is another and different Heaven, Firmament, Sun
        and Moon from that which thy red hat can teach us. He knows that
        the Theology of the old world foreshadows its Messiah. He knows
        that God created two worlds, two Heavens, two earths. He knows
        also that one world has its Theology, Astronomy and medicine,
        and that the Astronomy of the Greater World indicates the Sun
        and Moon of the lesser (i.e., man); so also the Medicine of the
        Greater indicates that of the lesser. </p>
      <p>Thus the outward world represents and explains the inner one.
        The former is the sign, the latter the thing indicated.
        Therefore, also, church ceremonies, etc., are not my salvation,
        but God dwelling in me through Jesus Christ and Faith. </p>
      <p>The Sun and Moon I see above me influence me neither for good
        nor bad, but the Sun and Moon and Planets, with which God’s
        Providence has adorned the heaven in me, which also is the seat
        of the Almighty, these have the power to rule and reform me
        according to their course ordained by God. </p>
      <p>Wall-wort and Elder growing in the earth of the Great World
        cannot expel dropsy, nor the Strawberry plant cure leprosy. But
        the Wall-wort, Elder, etc., growing in the earth in our little
        world, they do so. But of this earth with its fruits, if this
        Heaven and Stars, of God and our salvation, one hears naught at
        Paris, Bologna, Louvain, Wittemberg, etc.. They have never
        tasted the sweetness of this Kernel, but have spread the
        bitterness of the husks over the whole world. I therefore
        conclude, having described: </p>
      <p>I. How the Spirit of the Lord brooded over the waters before
        God created Heaven and Earth. </p>
      <p>II. How, out of the same water, God created the Greater World,
        i.e., Heaven and Earth. </p>
      <p>III. How, out of the Greater World, He created the Small World
        (i.e., man), a small Heaven and small Earth. </p>
      <p>IV. How God has set His Seat in Heaven, that is, in the Heaven
        in man. </p>
      <p>V. I have shown that man, with his human understanding, could
        not comprehend God; but having sought his Saviour in the sweat
        of his brow, he at last found Him. That from Him he learnt all
        Nature’s secrets, writing an account of the same in books, and
        explaining the same to his children. That, by the dying out of
        his race, the common man had obtained possession of these books,
        and, in his ignorance, had retained the husk instead of the
        kernel. That through this many Sects had arisen, which continue
        to this day, and doubtless will remain to the world’s end. </p>
      <p>Therefore, those who would be professors of Theology,
        Astronomy, or Medicine, should learn magic before going to
        Bologna or Paris; that is, the Art of finding the Lord in His
        creatures, the Fiat by which the world was created; that is, the
        Seed of Heaven and earth, the Breath of God, which, breathed
        into a dead lump of earth, made of the same a living man. </p>
      <p>This Art knows all secrets in Heaven and earth, and can teach
        us to know God, to understand the Incarnation of Christ and all
        things in Theology. It shews us our Sun and Moon, Planets and
        Stars, as they rule in us, making peace and friendship with one
        another, according to the teaching of astronomy. The same also
        reveals to us the true Hermodactylus, cure for Podagra; the true
        Ebulus, healing dropsy; the Coloquint, expelling ague; the
        Crocus, strengthening the heart, etc. This Art is our
        Theologian, Astronomer, and Medicus, a right and true
        schoolmaster, crowning his disciples with miracles, standing by
        them in all needs; yea, leading them out of this life to Him out
        of Whose mouth it came into the world. </p>
      <p>Did but Theologians learn the interpretation of the Scriptures
        from this Art, and not from themselves, there would be no Sects,
        but all would be united, even as the Apostles were united when
        taught by the Holy Spirit sent to them by Christ. Even the
        Apostles could not fully understand Christ --- although he was
        daily with them, personally teaching them, etc. --- before the
        coming of the Holy Ghost. We also cannot understand the Sacred
        Scriptures except by interpretation of the Holy Spirit. </p>
      <p>Let us not dare to expound these Scriptures, unless Christ eats
        and drinks with us, that is, is personally with us as one man
        with another. Although we have books, let us not boast that we
        understand them. Why did not the Disciples understand? They
        heard the Doctrine of Christ from His own mouth, which, verily,
        is much more than reading it in books; had they understood the
        same, what need had they of the Holy Spirit? But it was
        impossible to them, and much more so to us. The Spirit of the
        Lord must first open our eyes and enlighten our understanding;
        then shall we know the One God, and have one Religion like the
        Apostles. What man learned in the Scriptures has ever discovered
        from the literal words that there are Arts by which Ma may be
        made a partaker if that Spirit which moved upon the face of the
        waters and was breathed into Adam? </p>
      <p>We know that St Paul --- when he, as a Pharisee, together with
        many other learned Jews, persecuted the Christians --- could in
        no wise be persuaded that Christ was made Man. But, having come
        to a knowledge of God through the Holy Spirit, he believed the
        same. We also know tat St Paul communicated this mystery to the
        highly learned Areopagite Dionysius, who believed, and became a
        Christian and an Apostle of the Gauls. </p>
      <p>It might be objected that, since the same concerns our Souls’
        Salvation, this mystery should have been plainly described. It
        is not necessary to put the food into the raven’s mouth. Let him
        fly to it! Thus, also, was it not necessary to reveal this
        mystery otherwise than through the three Faculties. But why this
        was not necessary I shall tell you as little as those have told
        who have gone before me. I may have erred in communicating to
        you as much as I have. It has been done for your sake, because I
        see you are a Christian man, earnestly seeking the Truth. For
        what I have revealed to you is more than I would to others.
        Accept this as an indication of my mind towards you --- for you
        have not deserted my brother in his need. Therefore have I
        thought it my duty to communicate to you, before all others,
        what God (without any boast of mine) has given me. Also, do not
        think I have written for anyone’s hurt; above all, not to injure
        the learned, to whom I would do all the good in my power. I have
        written for the simple Truth’s sake, and for your benefit, and
        therefore beg of you to accept it with a single mind. Most
        cordially commending myself, etc., etc. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">An Explanation of the Natural
            Philosopher’s Tincture, of Theophrastus Paraceslus</font></b>
        <p><b>By</b> </p>
        <p><b>Alexander von Suchten</b> </p>
        <p>Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine</p>
      </center>
      <p>The ancient teacher Hieronymus says that it was formerly
        ordained among the Jews that no one under the age of 30 years
        might read the first Chapter of Genesis. Be this true or not, it
        is certainly not the custom among the Jews at the present time.
        Yet it is undeniable that man by a right contemplation and
        understanding of this Chapter, may gain a knowledge of many
        Arcana and secrets of creation. Not to mention other things,
        this Chapter is especially suitable to our Chemical Art. Indeed,
        of all books concerning the Theory and Practice of the
        Philosopher’s Stone, I know not of one which, from beginning to
        end, could more plainly and graphically describe our Art, than
        the Almighty Himself has done in that whole process of His great
        Creation. Since, however, Theophrastus diligently, and above all
        others, in his book, <i>Tinctura Physicorum</i>, followed in
        the way prescribed by God, and in the aforesaid book has
        sufficiently described both the matter and Practice --- or
        handiwork --- both of the Ancient Philosophers as well as of his
        own new corrected opinion, I will in this place substitute no
        other practice, but simply give a short Guide for better
        understanding of his book in order that beginners in this Art (I
        write not for the learned) may, by diligent study, and God’s
        Grace, attain to, not alone an understanding of the above
        Theoretical Firmament, but also the necessary manual skill in
        this Art from beginning to end. </p>
      <p>Theophrastus, in describing this our philosophical work and
        creation (which is nothing other than a small world, since in it
        appear the participation and similitude of all things), follows
        the same method as Moses in describing the creation of the Great
        World. For, before Moses treats of the matter, he enumerates the
        three principles which indistinctly lay therein, but which, by
        God, were distinctly developed from the same. So also does
        Theophrastus, for, before giving the matter of his work, he
        indicates that, although it is one thing, three things lie
        hidden in it. These must, by fire or water, be extracted, and
        again be united into one being and substance, according to
        Christ’s saying: “He who knoweth not to extract many things from
        one thing, the same knoweth also not to make one out of many”.
        Now, Theophrastus says: “The matter of the Tincture is One Thing
        that, by fire, has been extracted out of three”. This is to be
        understood as the general concensus of all philosophers. What
        Theophrastus here affirms, Geber also substantiates. There is
        one Stone, one Medicine, to “which we neither add, nor take from
        it, anything”. </p>
      <p>Bernhardus says: “There is a single root from which the two
        Mercurial Substances and our whole work are extracted or made”.
      </p>
      <p>Morienus says: “The first and principal substance of this thing
        is one, and out of it is one thing”. </p>
      <p>Agadmon, in the Turba, testifies also: “Therefore dismiss all
        plurality, for Nature is content with one thing”, etc. </p>
      <p>Hermes, a father of all philosophers, also says in his Tabula:
        “Even as all things have been born from one, by the mediation of
        One, so also all things have been born from this one thing, by
        adaptation”. </p>
      <p>Hercules especially agrees with Theophrastus, saying: “This
        Magisterium proceeds from one root, which afterwards is expanded
        into several things, returning again to one”. (See <i>Pandor</i>.,


        fol. 8,706.). </p>
      <p>From all of which the Truth and foundation of this Art is
        apparent, for Truth is where there appears no contradiction. </p>
      <p>Therefore also can false Alchemists be easily detected in this
        one point alone. </p>
      <p>And since God Almighty Himself has created the whole great
        World, all Celestial, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Natures
        from one single thing and primeval root, how should Man be wiser
        than God, and for this work&nbsp; --- which, not less than the
        Great Outer World, contains within itself the seed and qualities
        of all creatures --- use more than one thing. </p>
      <p>For the said Art --- according to the testimony of
        Gerrariensis, Chap. 22 --- should imitate Nature. The matter of
        Art will be the matter of Nature and, since the matter of nature
        is unique, viz., the origin and matter of metals, therefore,
        also, the matter of Art will be unique. The Book of Genesis
        relates that this primary matter was of a moist nature, or
        water, for, when diligently reading the text, although the three
        principles are first enumerated, viz., Heaven, Earth, and the
        Spirit of God; yet there soon follows the matter out of which
        God created Heaven, viz., water, which God took and divided into
        two parts of pieces, as you will hear. Hermes, or Mercurius
        Trismegistus, although an Egyptian priest, without enlightenment
        from God, may yet have derived great wisdom from writings
        perhaps left behind by Moses after Exodus. Hermes names not
        alone the matter from which all elements are drawn, a moist
        nature, but alludes pointedly to the division. (Pymander, Chap.
        I.). This Word (Spirit), moving over humid nature, cherished it.
        But ardent and light fire straightway flew out from the bowels
        of humid nature; also light, air, obedient to the Spirit, took
        the middle place between fire and water. Earth and water lay
        mixed with each other, so that the face of the earth might
        nowhere appear, being drowned by the waters. Then these two were
        separated by the Spiritual Word”. </p>
      <p>Also Plato: “Water is the principle of the universe. For, from
        water are all things produced, and into water all reduced”.
        Hermes calls water the principle of all things. Theophrastus is
        herein of the same opinion, except that he does not expressly
        call matter water or moist nature. But he says it is composed of
        three substances, calling them here an Eagle, a Lion, and a
        Golden Glitter. </p>
      <p>In <i>Liber Metamorphoseos</i> he terms them: Mercury, Salt,
        and Sulphur. That is just the opinion of Hermes and other
        philosophers, speaking of Spirit, Body, and Soul. (See Key of
        Chemical Philosophy, by Dornaeus, fol. 411). How, now, these
        three can, by the artist, by means of Vulcan’s art, be extracted
        and freed from their prison, and again be united, will follow
        later. Remember, for the present, that he calls the one thing,
        from which shall be born the great and also the little world, a
        Red Lion. Had he desired to indicate it more plainly, he would
        have called it a moist nature, or water. He does this to prevent
        the unworthy from sharing this secret with the worthy. Other
        philosophers have exercised the same caution. For it is written,
        “This stone is hidden both from men and from demons”. But it is
        called a Lion on account of its great strength and power. For as
        a Lion is the strongest and fleetest animal, mastering the other
        animals, and therefore compared to a king of beasts --- so also,
        amongst things created, there will not easily be found a
        fleeter, stronger, more penetrating thing, subjugating,
        occupying, overcoming, and ruling, without exception, man and
        others. </p>
      <p>Hermes confirms such swift strength, saying: “This matter is
        the strongest strength of all strength”. This is also
        experienced by those who know this Lion, and by proper
        preparation have been instructed how to use it upon other
        creatures. Then one sees after what manner this thing occupies,
        conquers, destroys, kills all things, even changing them from
        one form into another, nothing being exempted from its rule or
        unterrified by its roars. Hence by philosophers it is named the
        Animated Thing. Hermes says: “Behold, it conquers every subtle,
        and penetrates every solid, substance!”. For this reason
        Dionysius Zacharias calls it a Governor, and Bernhardus a King.
        For there is nothing that can bear so much rain, wind, work,
        heat, or cold, while it can be conquered or killed by nothing
        --- except it be by water --- as those know who have had such
        monsters in their keeping. Therefore it may be rightly named a
        strong Lion, by reason of the temperate conjunction of the
        Elements. For those Elements are separated and purified, and
        alternately married in a suitable manner, there being generated
        from them a Tempered Substance, which the Violence of Fire
        cannot separate, nor earth’s corruption vitiate, nor the
        muddiness of Water condemn, nor the contact of Air cloud. In
        order that one should not imagine such Lion to be a strange,
        rare thing, he, Bernhardus says: “This Lion is named by many but
        known by few”. And it is true that it is at the present day
        carried about by all sorts of men in their mouths, although few,
        yea, only those whose eyes God has opened to Nature’s virtues
        and powers, can recognize and use it. Yet in its substance,
        nature, and matter it is so common, often-used a thing that
        Bernhardus says: “The whole world have it before their eyes”.
        Morienus asserts it to be so universal that Man could not live
        without it. Verily, “I declare to thee”, quoth he to King Calid,
        “that this Thing by Divine Will has been greatly used in
        Creation, and nothing made by God can exist without it”. Every
        person knows this thing, and whoso knows it not, he knows
        nothing else. I should like to see a child of 7 or 8 who is not
        acquainted with it, and is without a hearty appetite and desire
        for it immediately he beholds it. This inclination proceeds from
        man’s inner spirit, which well knows that all power to preserve
        health and long life are hidden in his one thing alone. And, in
        order that this substance be revealed and made known, he gives
        you another hint and sign whereby you yourself may recognize it,
        saying: “Such matter is the Greatest Pearl and Noblest Treasure
        upon Earth according to God’s Revelation and man’s desire”.
        These words are literally copied from the Lesser Rosary, which
        says: “For God has under Heaven created no more precious thing,
        except the rational mind”. Examine one after the other all
        creatures, you will find among them all no more precious,
        better, more lovely, or nobler creature created by God. An
        intelligent man can easily find bottom here by diligently
        observing the above explanations, together with the Sympathy and
        Disposition (Diathesis) of God’s creation with respect to man’s
        natural life. I will let the above instances and the guiding of
        Theophrastus suffice, and now refer you to our Author’s little
        Book, De Viribus Spiritualium, where he speaks of the Spirit of
        Life. There you will find that the Spiritis Vitae, or man’s
        life, is itself a celestial, invisible vapour; it is the
        temperament between the Elements, and is included in the Stars
        and all Heaven’s influences as far as the firmament stretches.
        Cornelius Agrippa, in Book I, “<i>Concerning Occult Philosophy</i>”,


        and the Spirit of the World, teaches how and by what means such
        Spirit is attracted from the Stars into nether corporeal bodies
        by their Magnetic Force. </p>
      <p>Richard, the Englishman, also teaches the same fully in his
        Corrector. Alchy., Part V, Chap. 8 and 9: “When you have now
        found which most abundantly partakes of this Influx and Spirit
        of life from other, the same you may use for your work, and
        apply it by right means and preparation, using its Spirit for
        the strengthening, preservation, and augmentation of you own
        spirit. This is more than enough concerning the matter”. </p>
      <p>Now he comes to the preparation, and to the before-mentioned
        three principles, saying: “That this Lion, by Nature’s aid and
        the artist’s art, may be transmuted into the White Eagle, and
        thus, out of one, two are made”. </p>
      <p>Here the Author has wished to signify that, in this Art, man
        must follow the rule left him by God, the First Chemist. For,
        God having created all Creatures and Elements out of one thing,
        viz., Water, it follows that He began by making two things out
        of the original one thing. The first He has taken up on high,
        making of it a heavenly water; the other was gathered together
        below, and by coagulation became Earth. St Peter, II, Chap. 3,
        briefly mentions these three principles: “By the Word of God the
        Heavens were of old, and the Earth standing out of the Water and
        in the Water”. Esdras, Book 4, the last chapter, says: “For God
        hands the Earth over the Waters by His Word”. </p>
      <p>Thus also in this work the Artist must divide his process into
        two parts: </p>
      <p>(1) By distillation conduct one part on high, making of it a
        clear, heavenly Spiritual Water, here called a White Eagle. For,
        as no bird is so keen-sighted, or soars so high as the eagle, so
        also we know of no water so volatile, so penetrating, as this,
        for it ascends to the Heavens; and, as the Lion’s father and
        son, penetrates his bone and marrow, as we shall presently shew.
        Our Eagle is the true key to human renovation, and the bath of
        new Birth and Rejuvenation, as saith the Psalmist: “Like the
        Eagle shall thou renew thy youth”. It is a white transparent
        Water of heavenly colour, according to Alanus and Bernhardus,
        and hence is by many called Heaven (Coelum) by reason of its
        lofty qualities. </p>
      <p>This Eagle is the first part of the water which ascends on
        high, the Ascendens of Hermes mentioned in his Tabula. </p>
      <p>Esdras, Book 4, calls it: “The Spirit of the Firmament”. Other
        philosophers term it Water, Spirit, or Soul of the World, the
        Middle Nature which is a quasi-body and quasi-not-soul, and
        quasi-soul and quasi-not body. It is the ligament and vinculum
        of all Elements --- also, the one universal, generative Nature,
        dispersed through all the parts of the world”. </p>
      <p>And, since it has its center in the Supreme Circle (as being
        very light), whence also it came in the First Universal
        Generation of things, so when freed it ascends towards Heaven to
        its Centre. Above it has been called Humor Lunae, or the Humid
        Radical of all Creatures. </p>
      <p>Compare Aurelius Augurellus, Book I, “<i>To the Lion</i>”, 10.
      </p>
      <p>For this (Anima Mundi) is diffused everywhere, </p>
      <p>And everywhere is active; </p>
      <p>In the winds of heaven, in the earth, and the bosom of the wide
        waters. </p>
      <p>They enclose the Soul, by which all things of earth do live.
        Thence the world itself derives its life. But, since the Sol is
        trammeled by no body, and the world, and all parts thereof, are
        in material form; therefore, between these two the Spirit is the
        intermediary, which is neither body, nor Soul, sharing in both
        these natures. </p>
      <p>Therefore in this live and increase Sea, Air, and Fire. This,
        embracing all things. Is always the Bird (Eagle), always the
        root, ever bringing forth and perpetuating life. </p>
      <p>At length, imprisoned in yellow gold, itself seeks the hand of
        the artificer, who may loose its bonds, and, by its virtue,
        become powerful. </p>
      <p>(2) The other part of the water --- or of our Lion ---
        according to the teaching of Moses, became corrupted and dry.
        That is now the second part of our Art, viz., the investigation
        of the substance of the Lion, when the aforesaid Eagle has been
        hatched out from his body, by warmth, as from an egg, and has
        flown away. To speak plainly concerning it, it is the dry, waste
        earth, and the cursed earth in Gen. V. It has its first name of
        Lion by reason of its aforesaid strength and sharpness. For, as
        a lion has sharp teeth, biting through that which he seizes, so
        also is this earth so sharp as to be unbearable on the tongue
        because of its penetrating nature. It cannot be touched without
        offence so the tongue, as saith the philosopher. Elsewhere
        Theophrastus calls it “An invisible, consuming fire”. </p>
      <p>Bernhardus retains its name of King, and says: “Although
        Fontin, the aforesaid Eagle, is the King’s Mother, yet is the
        King nobler than Fontin”. For, although he always retains the
        name of Lion, yet is he changed from his first nature, is no
        longer a virgin, but has been fructified by the Spirit brooding
        over the water --- his original first substance --- and has
        borne a heavenly, spiritual fruit, viz., the aforesaid Eagle.
        Hence these verses: </p>
      <p>A virgin, not one day old, <br>
        By Nature’s decree espoused a man, <br>
        And, before she had reached the age of one year, <br>
        To this man a child she bore, <br>
        Yet she died before she was born. </p>
      <p>And in The Song of Solomon, Chap. VIII, “I raised thee up under
        the apple tree, there thy mother brought thee forth; there she
        brought thee forth that bare thee”. </p>
      <p>Hermes calls the inferior substance gross or descending. For,
        being heavy, it has, and seeks, its center in the lowest circle,
        as it were, subject to the superior heaven and its influx, or
        the Soul of Middle nature, or Mundane Spirit. Above it has been
        called by its right name of Solar and Natural Heat of all
        corporal and natural things. </p>
      <p>Now, as to the third principle, viz., the Spirit brooding, etc.
        It is, according to Theophrastus the Glitter of Gold. For this
        Earth is but the real fine Gold, left imperfect by Nature, to be
        perfected by Art, as Ferrariensis says (Chap. 64): “The
        terrestrial parts are nothing else than the occult gold of
        philosophers”. </p>
      <p>Other sages define it as “The Soul of the World, whose colour
        is golden”. Now, since in the first Universal Creation, the
        third principle, the Spirit of God, has never been separated
        from the other two, but the two have remained in one as the
        Spirit above, and in the water, so also is it in our
        microcosmic, particularistic, and philosophical Creation. We
        cannot obtain this third principle, this golden flitter, this
        beautiful gold-red colour, separate by itself. “It shines not to
        the Spagyrus”, saith Theophrastus, i.e., it conceals itself and
        is lost when one is made into two. What, then, becomes of it?
        According to Gen. Chap. 1, and the opinion of philosophers, it
        remains with the aforesaid water, and since that water ascends
        towards heaven, this Golden Glitter must accompany it in its
        center. Theophrastus, however, considers that it remains with
        the earth, perhaps on account of the Old Testament saying that
        the Soul is in the Blood, wherefore the Israelites were
        forbidden to eat it. </p>
      <p>Now, it should be noted this Golden Glitter, as the third
        principle, is often called the Soul, and cannot be produced
        other than as a red, thick, stagnant blood --- sometimes called
        the Lion’s Blood by our author --- and Theophrastus ascribes it
        to that body which, in the first distillation, goes not over out
        of the retort (crucible). For herein, say Alchemists, is the
        whole art, that the gold go out of the retort. And this is true
        did they but understand the Gold and its Glitter aright. How the
        glittering spiritual Soul of this third principle --- when duly
        extracted from the Lon’s body --- hovers above the water, and
        there yet remain two in one, you will hear afterwards. For the
        soul cannot exist, out of its center, as an impalpable,
        invisible entity without a body. “For a spirit is neither
        visible nor palpable, except it hath assumed a body from some
        Element. Hence this spirit --- by reason of its noble nature ---
        receives a Body in the highest and noblest Sphere of the
        Elements, viz., in the Igneous Sphere. Yet, in the fire, this
        spirit loses not its nature, neither is it Fire, nor of an
        igneous nature; although it dwells in Fire, and by many is
        called Fire of Nature”. </p>
      <p>Aurelius Augurellus hath these words in his second book: “But
        another elicits these various hidden parts from pure Blood, and
        has ordained the Elements to lead them forth; </p>
      <p>“That thus these occult spirits might perchance be seen or
        touched with the hands, or enclosed in a vessel. </p>
      <p>“For otherwise they would straightway penetrate the vessel,
        although imprisoned in hard atrament. </p>
      <p>“By violence can no Spirit be forced to remain in any part of
        the Vast Orb, so greatly does it rejoice to dwell quietly in its
        own habitation:. </p>
      <p>Such external Body is the Lion, or dry earth, which retains its
        redness, its outward aspect, its stagnant blood, which has no
        exit, the body being not yet open --- as one sees in those
        hanged or suffocated, who stifle in their blood --- as the Book
        of the Trinity relates in Figures. Raymundus Lullius says
        briefly, in <i>Testamentum Novissimum</i>, thus: “My son,
        Quicksilver is water distilled from its earth, and similarly
        earth is Animated Quicksilver, while the Anima (Soul) is Natural
        Heat which is bound in the primary Essence of the Elements of
        Animated Mercury. </p>
      <p>Now that this jewel has been presented to you through the
        Faculty of Philosophy, you have a short guide to the teaching of
        Theophrastus. Having taken the right philosophical matter, you
        are now to extract from it two things contained therein, viz.,
        the Eagle (Mercury), and then the Body (the Salt), which, as
        Everlasting Balsam, contains also the third thing, the Spiritual
        Soul, the Golden Glitter, or true gold seed. These you shall
        extract according to the counsel given in Ovid by Medea to Old
        Jason, who would become young again, viz., that he --- by
        Anatomy --- should divide his limbs, and, reuniting them in a
        warm bath, he should become younger and of great strength. </p>
      <p>But that you may apply the theory, and learn the modus operandi
        whereby from Unity, two things, and from two, three are
        obtained. Theophrastus comes to the Practice. “It is the mark of
        a wise man first to know the causes before putting his hand to
        the task”. Theophrastus shews you two ways --- one Ancient, the
        other discovered and used by himself --- saying the Ancients had
        a very long way “before accomplishing the aforesaid separations
        and achieving their object”. In the beginning they, out of a
        Simplex --- or also out of a Subjectivum like God Himself ---
        and also Theophrastus, have made two things, viz., Water and
        Earth”. And he continues to say: “that Artists have to these two
        Simplices given the name Lili --- afterwards using the said
        Simplices and not one”. But know it is indifferent whether you,
        in the beginning, use one or two things. If our matter is found
        in one thing, it will equally well be found in two (Nature
        having already converted the original One into Two). Such
        simplicity of the subject Ferrariensis describes well, Chapter
        12: “The first radical Element, whence all the Elements derive
        their origin, is Humidity, or Water, i.e., liquefaction”. Or,
        according to others, it is the earth. </p>
      <p>Shortly after he says: “For the Beginning of the World there is
        One Sole Element, which is Primary Matter, from the Division of
        which, by reason of opposing qualities, were generated the four
        Elements, which were in it potentially”. </p>
      <p>Aurelius Augurellus, Book II, says: </p>
      <p>“Besides within there is ordained a double force, <br>
        Which always acts and suffers, <br>
        As a female and male when together --- <br>
        Even as a chicken grows in the shell, <br>
        By the action of the one and the suffering of the other in turn,
        <br>
        And by cherishing heat externally applied”. </p>
      <p>If you begin with one thing you must first make two of it. But,
        by taking two, such as Earth and Water --- Nature having educed
        this Binary from one --- you are saved the trouble, and have
        only to generate the third, which, as aforesaid, is always
        hidden in one of these two. Thus Lion’s Blood is the Bride
        around whom they dance, viz., the natural red Sulphur or Seed of
        Gold, ordained by God and nature to bear its like. But, being
        mixed and bound up too much with earth and superfluities, it
        cannot perform its office, except it be freed by one of Vulcan’s
        smiths from all bolts and bands of its natural prison. Therefore
        have both the Ancient Sages and Theophrastus taken great pains
        to liberate these Captive Souls from their Eternal Darkness by
        the Descent to Hell of our Heavenly Eagle --- according to
        Isaias: Those in darkness and the shadow of death see a great
        light. Thus have the Ancients united the two things, and, after
        a month’s putrefaction, extracted the spirit, that is, the
        water, with gentle fire by distillation. For this water will not
        stand a great fire, and if vexed with the same it becomes
        impatient, angry, and wrath to such an extent that it “knocks
        all of a heap”, as Bernhardus says, the residual matter they
        treated with strong water until the same went over as a dry
        spirit. Compare Solomon’s Song, II. C.: “Who is this that cometh
        out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh
        and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?”. </p>
      <p>Now, this dry spirit is the substance or body of the Lion
        himself, the sharp earth, the old, miserly, jealous man, who
        breaks not willingly into the treasury, or likes to give up his
        golden-yellow oil, and only by force will let his palace be
        plundered. It is called a dry spirit by reason of the quantity
        of dominating fire therein, which is none other than the true
        philosophical Sulphur, as Bernhardus relates in the <i>Book
          Concerning the Transmutation of Metals</i>. But sulphur is
        none other than the pure action of Air and Fire, heating and
        digesting, or decocting, Earth and Water proportionately and
        homogeneously to themselves. Richardus, the Englishman, also
        says: “Philosophers’ Sulphur is a simple, living Fire, vivifying
        and maturing, and nothing but a hot and dry vapour generated
        from the purest terrestrial dryness in which Fire rules in every
        way”. </p>
      <p>Now, since all the oil or spirit does not go over at once ---
        in order that none of this gold seed or potable gold as the
        Lion’s greatest treasure might remain behind --- they moistened
        the corpus mortuum (residuum) with spirits and, after a month’s
        putrefaction, again distilled over as at first, thus obtaining
        more of the oil. This moistening, putrefying, and distilling
        they repeated until the earth was wholly dissolved, and had
        given up its entire treasure, all the gold having distilled over
        and become a Mercury, i.e., Water, which has its coagulation or
        its sulphur in its depths, as Geber says: “Our Mercury has in
        its depths fixed Sulphur, and nothing sinks in it except Gold”.
        Dionysius well describes this process in this Practice: “After
        the Governor of the Firetown (oven, furnace) had retreated, his
        remaining warriors had long fought the enemy with fire, until
        they escaped the said enemy by retreating over the water and
        bridges which they had thrown up behind themselves”. </p>
      <p>That is the same thing that Aeneas did with the tree bearing
        golden branches. As often as he broke a branch off two grew in
        its place. Those are the lovely golden-yellow drops falling from
        the beak of the retort into the receiving vessel, one dripping
        down after the other, until the Lion has lost his whole heart,
        blood and strength. For that is the true Lion of Judah, sent by
        God to deliver His Peoples from their enemies and sins, in pain
        and torture to shed His Blood for them. The wound in His Side,
        whence flowing two long streams of Blood and Water, shall be a
        Fount of Purification to all those drinking therefrom. In these
        shall such water become the spring of a long, healthy life. </p>
      <p>Bernhardus goes on to relate that the Ancients --- having got
        so far that nothing further distilled over from the earth ---
        they again purified the water and oil, removing all remaining
        bonds, until they at length reached the Pure Fount, and the
        true, beautiful, golden leaves of the Golden Book. Here are our
        Adam and Eve naked, for their eyes are opened, and now they see
        themselves, what was good and bad in their own substance. This
        is the Rectification whereby they cleansed these two of the
        accidental impurities of the first Distillation (for the unclean
        Spirits guarding the treasure in the earth love not to leave the
        same). This is the first process of our Philosophical Birth, the
        Returning into the Mother’s Womb, whereby the Rule of God is
        followed, and the first precepts of chemists are fulfilled,
        viz., the Reduction into Primary Matter, into the Three Natural
        Principles, i.e., Animated Spirit, Mercury, and Sulphureous
        Vapour of Earth. Thereby are separated the Elements and the Pure
        from the Impure, and, finally, the Seeds of Gold are brought
        from the Darkness to Light, which is nothing less than the
        Generation of Nature in the Generation of Metals, and The
        Process with Double Smoke of Paracelsus. But the above method
        entailed heavy expenses and much time and labour, all of which
        the Ancient Sages could have avoided, and obtained the Lion’s
        treasure by a shorter cut, had they enquired into the matter as
        diligently as Theophrastus. </p>
      <p>Now, I wot there is no one who would not wish to know this
        shorter method; and that you may not have to complain of
        Theophrastus, he shews you another short way, admonishing you
        also to let the above tedious process be, and to take from the
        Lion nought but his rosy blood, and from the Eagle the white
        gluten. These two bodies you must coagulate together and bring
        into one body, as it were male and female seed. </p>
      <p>Now, someone might object thus. Dear Theophrastus, that is the
        old story which I have heard long ago. The Ancients took nothing
        more than the Lion’s blood and water, and coagulated them. Yet
        you tell me the same is a brief way to obtain the aforesaid two
        Mercurial Substances, with little labour and in a short time. </p>
      <p>Well, that is true so far. Theophrastus is not so clear here as
        he might be. But you may easily imagine what the mode of
        preparation must be if you have diligently studied
        Theophrastus’s other books and preparations, and are otherwise
        experienced in Chemical labours. You will then find that
        Chemistry, in the preparation of all arcana (secrets), has two
        methods, viz., Distillation and Extraction. Whatsoever is to be
        prepared by Chemistry and brought into its Arcanum, its
        Tincture, or Quintessence (in which is he power and virtue of
        all creatures), or is to be cleansed from impeding impurities,
        that must be done by Distillation or Extraction (which is the
        same as Solution). There is no other means. As Bernhardus says:
        “The King never goes forth except the Fountain attract him”. </p>
      <p>Now, having already heard that he rejects the tedious process
        of much distillation and purification by reason of its expense,
        etc., you perceive that he must have used the only other means,
        viz., Extraction by Solution. </p>
      <p>According to Calid, son of Jazichus: “Solution is the
        Extraction of the Interior of Things to their Superficies, so
        that the hidden become manifest”. Hence his (Theo.’s) meaning is
        this: When you of one thing have made two --- or have taken two
        things differently constituted by Nature --- let the old process
        alone; take from the Lion his blood only --- i.e., cut out his
        heart with his own sharp spear --- or as Bernhardus says: “Slay
        the King with his own sharp, poisonous Mercurial Water”. In
        plain words: Extract but from the earth its Tincture or Arcanum,
        and the blood, the sunshine, the dry spirit immediately all
        distills over. By such extraction or solution more will be done
        in a few hours than the Ancient Sages could effect in six
        months. By the above process the whole work may be completed in
        ten or twelve months, in which time the Ancients could barely
        achieve the first step --- i.e., Reduction into Primary Matter
        --- as all those know whom God has enlightened, and thought
        worthy you know this Solution and Extraction. </p>
      <p>But misunderstand me not! I speak here, not of the second
        solution of the earth, but of the first solution of the crude
        body. </p>
      <p>How this solution and extraction is effected it behooves not to
        tell here more plainly --- as our author says --- not to put the
        food right into the bad birds’ beaks. As the saying is: He who
        would reach the open sea must first pass through the narrow
        straits. That is the blessed place of which Esdras writes (Bk.
        IV, Chap. 2): The path to it is narrow, so that but one man can
        walk on the same. On one side is Fire, on the other Water. He
        who would inherit or possess these good things must first
        undergo much trouble and danger until he finds the narrow
        footpath between Fire and Water, and pass over. Now, having
        revealed this to you indirectly as far as may be, I would refer
        you to other philosophers. Remember Geber’s rule: “That no
        Solution should be made, except in its own blood, and that
        calcined things are more soluble than non-calcined. For, by
        calcinations, they are reduced to the natures of Slats and
        Alums, which alone are soluble”. If you are a true searcher
        after knowledge, the above will tell you more than too much. </p>
      <p>Compare Aurelius Augurell., Book 3: “First, taking thin plates
        and filings of pure gold, </p>
      <p>“Thou shalt crush and pound them into the form of fine powder,
        or river sand, with frequent blows: </p>
      <p>“Until, at length, they become liquid, dissolved by putrid
        humour from within themselves. </p>
      <p>“It will be well here sometimes to pour in large quantities of
        liquor of their own seed, but by no chance anything foreign”. </p>
      <p>This is also the aforesaid short process of Theophrastus,
        whereby you, in a short time, and with little trouble and
        expense, may find the two said things (of which one is the
        Father, or Sun, or Red Water, and the other the Mother, or Moon,
        or White Water) which are necessary for the perpetration of the
        miracle of the One Thing, and for which good counsel you owe
        Theophrastus many thanks. Thus, by God’s help, is effected the
        first step of this process, which is done by the hand through
        Sublimation and Purification. By this the fleshly, corporeal
        Adam is killed, and Body, Soul, and Spirit, by the natural
        death, are separated from one another. </p>
      <p><b>Second Operation: Conjunction ~</b> </p>
      <p>Now follows the second operation, in which are brought about,
        by rest and without labour, the fixation and stability of those
        things which are sublimated and purified. This is the
        Resurrection from the Dead, in which Soul, Body, and Spirit,
        after Purification, come together again; and --- on our
        philosophical Last Day --- will arise as a new glorified body
        and a new spiritual man without blemish and sin. In this
        conjunction of Resurrection are comprised the whole spiritual
        body and the soul, and thus form One --- even as water mixed
        with water --- and are not separated in all Eternity. For in
        them is no diversity, yea, a Unity and Identity of all three
        substances, Spirit, Soul, and Body. </p>
      <p>Even so it is plain concerning the Identity and Unity of the
        trinity in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which in the
        Deity are One and the Same, with distinction and diversity in
        substance. </p>
      <p>The aforesaid process would have been no use to the Ancients,
        or to Theophrastus, had they not known how to bring to fruition,
        in its due season, the seed thus obtained. But, in order
        successfully to effect this, they had again to learn from
        Nature, and more especially from God as a Preceptor, in Genesis,
        Chap. 2, for there it is written thus: Although God had caused
        the earth&nbsp; bring forth all kinds of grass, herbs and trees,
        yet they could produce no fruit or propagate and increase their
        kind, until God had first let rain again upon the earth, the
        water first separated and taken up to heaven by Himself. And
        daily experience teaches us that the earth, when dry, is barren,
        and that nothing can grow unless frequently refreshed by rain
        and dew. Hence God has again united the water --- which He, as
        the first Distiller, took up on high --- with the dry earth, the
        Inferior with the Superior. The Ancients, following this rule,
        have often united white water with the Red Lion’s Blood, as with
        the Earth (for, coagulated, such blood is earth), according to
        the teaching of Hermes: “It ascends from the earth into heaven,
        and again descends to earth, and receives the strength of
        inferior and superior things”. And elsewhere: “Red Sun is
        father, White Moon is mother; join them together in one life and
        disposition”. Morienus: Make the Red Smoke hold the White Smoke
        in a strong embrace and in a strong vessel, without exhalation
        of spirits”. </p>
      <p>Theophrastus also means that, when you have obtained the two
        things by the short method, viz., the rosy blood and the Eagle’s
        white gluten, you shall thereto add nothing foreign. Compare
        Solomon’s Cong, chapter 1:7: “Tell me, I thou whom my soul
        loveth, where thou makest the flock to rest at noon, for why
        should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy
        companions?”. Take these two things alone, and of them again
        produce Unity --- of two Mercurial Substances make one --- like
        body and soul. Of two waters make one by coagulation. For
        Quicksilver, or our Mercury, is not coagulated by the
        coagulation caused by extrinsic mixture (except for corruption);
        but the same is, by its intrinsic Sulphur, coagulated to
        perfection. This is the Union of Heaven and Earth, the marriage
        of Adam and Eve, the Conjunction of Sun and Moon, the right
        Union of the World’s Soul and Spirit with the Earth by the Union
        of their Centres, as Calid says: “Of all experiments there is
        none equal to that of conjoining two or more things whose
        centres are diverse, unless it be the conversion of their
        matter, and the mutation of their substance and properties from
        their original nature. Therefore, he who shall be able to change
        Soul into Body and Body into Soul, and to mix with the same
        subtle spirits, shall attain all things”. </p>
      <p>Compare Aurel. Augurellius, Book III: “Perchance here thou
        mayest seek the numbers and the weight of the things required by
        the for perfecting this work. </p>
      <p>“Remember, therefore, there are of Things Primordial but Three.
        <br>
        From these take two; and from these again --- if thou judge
        rightly – one more. <br>
        The Triple Thing will then consist of Gold alone. <br>
        The decocted substances will form one homogenous mass. <br>
        For, joined together, they differ among themselves in nothing. <br>
        Each ingredient fuses its mass with that of the others”. </p>
      <p>By this influx our earth is made fruitful, producing in due
        time all kinds of animal, vegetable, and mineral natures. This
        is the warm bath in the beginning of may of Bernhardus,
        expressed of old in the following figure of speech: “The Water
        of the Air between Heaven and Earth is of all things the Life.
        For, by its moisture and warmth, it is the medium between water
        and fire. The Heavens opening rained and dewed these Waters upon
        the Earth, rendering it moist and sweet as honey. Wherefore also
        the Earth blossoms, bringing forth divers colours and fruits;
        and, in the midst, there has grown up a great tree, with silver
        stem, stretching to the ends of the world; on its branches have
        sat many birds which have all flown away towards the East; and
        the raven’s head has become white”. All the above means but the
        spiritual generation and new birth of our Adam, through Water
        and the Spirit, for the same, in is former nature and earthly
        tabernacle, could not enter the Kingdom of heaven. Our old Adam
        must first put on its original pure nature, and thus, born again
        through spiritual water, and changed into a spiritual man, may,
        through much tribulation, enter the Promised Land. </p>
      <p><b>Coagulation and Imbibition ~</b> </p>
      <p>But how can such things be?, asks the learned and wise
        Nicodemus. Art thou a Master in Israel, taking upon thyself the
        highest works in Physics, and knowest not that? Well,
        Theophrastus tells it to you plainly in Chap. 3, viz., that it
        is done through the Pelican (for this is the grave in which
        shall rest our deceased Adam until his resurrection), even unto
        the third and fourth time, until the whole Lili, both matters,
        earth, and water, are dry on the ground. The words, “for the
        third and fourth time”, are to be interpreted as indicating the
        frequent rainfall necessary for fruition. </p>
      <p>The ancient philosophers in their Small World, following
        Nature’s example, have been wont to divide the white water
        (which they first produced from their matter) into two or more
        parts. The first portion they quickly coagulated with the Lion’s
        Blood, by circulation in the Pelican, according to the formula:
        “Nature knows Nature, Nature rejoices in Nature, Nature receives
        Nature, and yet there is but one Nature, One Genus, One
        Substance, and One Essence”. Song of Solomon, Chap. 3:4 --- “But
        I found him whom my soul loveth; I held him and would not let
        him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, into my
        mother’s chamber”.&nbsp; To this coagulated, dry earth they have
        added the other portion of the water, moistening and drying by
        heat three or four times, until the earth has again received
        into itself the whole of its white water, and thus the whole
        Lili has become a dry body, Thus the ancients augmented the
        stone for fixation in the very beginning.&nbsp; Bernhardus says:
        “The king’s bath may be repeated. For the more frequently he be
        bated in such saline, Mercurial water, or sulphureous baths, the
        purer and stronger does he become. It is optional to do this
        three or four times in the beginning with coagulation, or only
        once. By frequent moistening you will get more fruit, also the
        further advantage (by augmenting in the beginning) of not having
        to do so at the finish”. </p>
      <p>For the highest degree of purification, wash seven times in
        Jordan, and you will have many cwts. of water as your reward.
        Compare Solomon’s Song, Chap. 1: “Draw me, and we will run after
        thee; the King hath brought me into his chambers: we will be
        glad and rejoice in thee”. </p>
      <p>For our multiplication (according to Raymundus) is nought but
        the reiteration of the process of our primordial creation. So
        also Bernhardus, in his book Concerning the Transmutation of
        Metals: “As in this process nothing extraneous enters into its
        first composition, so also the same multiplies nothing that is
        not if its first composition” But since all generations and
        corruptions in nature are caused by heat; and, especially since
        Nature, in the bringing forth of metals and earths, has no other
        instrument but a steady, gentle heat, therefore, also, all
        imitators of this art have be obliged to follow Nature. The
        steady warmth of the sun ripens every fruit, and the warmer the
        sun (yet not too dry and alternating with due rains), the better
        do fruits mature and turn out. </p>
      <p>Hence the ancient sages have ever matured this our
        philosophical Seed by the heat of a sun shining steadily upon
        our earth and water, in which the other two are included, for
        “the virtue of fire and air cannot become apparent except in
        earth and water, virtue only acting through matter”. And, as the
        great world’s sun in summer gets hotter and hotter, until it has
        reached its highest ascension in the Zodiac, so also have all
        artists always augmented their “little Summer” in temperature
        until the matter, having been duly boiled and simmered, from
        black (through various changes of colour) became blood-red. We
        can assist our matter by heat alone. Hermes says: “Fire is the
        Regimen”. And Bernhardus also states: “That no one goes with the
        King to the bath but the stoker, whose sole duty it is to keep
        up the heat, and that his work is easily inflammable”.
        Ferrarianus is of the same opinion: “The whole strength lies in
        the fire. By this we discern and unravel the four Elements in
        that gross mass. By this we further join and combine things into
        one. By this we imitate the Sun, and perfect the imperfect”. In
        such warmth it attains maturity, ordained but never completed by
        Nature. For (quoth Theophrastus) Nature brings nothing complete
        to Light, but man, by spagyric preparation, must lead up to that
        ordained of Nature. Hence it is said: “Where Nature ends, there
        Art begins”. And: “Through God was our Philosophical Stone by
        Nature created, and to the same there is nothing wanting but
        purification and perfection”. </p>
      <p>It also learns to fight with the fire, so that the same ---
        however great --- may gain no advantage over it. Compare
        Farrianus: “It rejoices in its own fire, just as anything,
        Vegetable, Animal, or Mineral, is better preserved in the place
        of its generation than elsewhere”. </p>
      <p><b>The Foundation of Art ~</b> </p>
      <p>The contents and foundation of this Art consist in dissolving
        gold and silver by the right means --- with water, or drying
        with fire of the volatile Philosopher’s mercury --- until the
        same be changed into a powder which cannot be again reduced to a
        solid body. This powder --- if it smokes not when laid on the
        fire --- tinges every imperfect body and mercury with a lasting
        gold or silver colour. The gold colours not except it be first
        changed by the white gold --- i.e., by their Philosopher’s
        Mercurial Water --- into a black substance they call their earth
        and caput corvi crow’s head), giving the same many names, which
        white gold is further changed into a vapour, and is our
        Fortified Spirit. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i> --- Whether in the Antimony of Philosophers or
        marcasita the Philosophers’ secret is hidden? He white gold is
        the secret, for out of the antimony of our black earth is
        extracted the highest arcanum of Philosophers, which is in
        effect a ruby liquor, sweet, and red as blood. </p>
      <p>The Salt of Metals is the Philosopher’s Stone. Hence make salt
        of the metals without corrosives. </p>
      <p>“Adam”, said God, “in fixed and not fixed, in these two lie
        hidden all Secrets: Thou art the Lesser World”. </p>
      <p>Abel has written, that his father Adam gave names to all
        things. </p>
      <p>Noah praises the oilstone (soapstone?) saying there is no stone
        possessing greater virtues. </p>
      <p>Attain, therefore, in time a spiritual earth, not fleeing from
        fire: Because, among all elements the earth alone is fixed, and
        the Art of Alchemy wished that its Stone be fixed. Hence it is
        necessary that at the end of the operation all things should
        return to earth, i.e., fixation. Hermes’ dictum is true: Its
        strength is integral, if poured into the earth. In such coction
        or digestion divers colours are to be seen, not less than in
        Great Nature in the earth. </p>
      <p>For when the wet winter is passed, when the sun shines again,
        and the earth, during winter covered with water and snow,
        becomes dry, all manner of curious colours are seen, especially
        thee, viz., black, white, and red. Between these appear divers
        colours, as a yellowish colour after the virginal white or red;
        but this is not permanent. The other yellow remains longer, yet
        not so long as the black, white, or red. Crauser says, in Turba:
        “Know that it is a twofold thing to make white and red; the one
        thing is solution, the other decoction”. The former takes place
        in winter, when the earth is covered with snow and water, a
        certain indication of Putrefaction, a sign of commixture and of
        the changing of one thing into another, and is the colour of
        death. Solomon’s Song: “I am black but comely, O ye daughters of
        Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
        Look not upon me because I am black, because the sun hath looked
        upon me!”. </p>
      <p>The time of its duration is unequal. In the Bible one finds
        that the waters of the Flood lasted 156 days. </p>
      <p>Bernhardus says: “In 130 days the King puts off his blackness,
        and appears in his white shirt”. Scala Phil. gives 140 days for
        such putrefaction. Vide Pandor., fol 36. After these follow the
        other perfect colours, as the white of complete coagulation.
        Thus, putrefaction takes place in humidity, but the end of
        putrefaction is dryness; and inceration is a gentle induration,
        the occultation of humour, the fixation of spirit, the
        collecting of things diverse, the Renovation of Homogeneity, the
        adaptation to fire of things fleeing therefrom, and is the
        colour of regeneration and of semi-coction. It lasts also a long
        time --- according to Bernhardus almost 82 days --- which is a
        sign of fixation according to the Dictum of Lucas in the <i>Turba</i>:
        “When our Magnesia is white it lets not the spirit go from it”.
        Theophrasus sets no limit of time to such colours, as, in truth,
        none can be set, for it depends on the matter. </p>
      <p>Compare Aurel. Augurell., Book III: </p>
      <p>“Ye scarcely will anyone so exactly compute the years, <br>
        As not either to diminish or add to their number” <br>
        For suitable material will sometimes accelerate the process, and
        unsuitable retard the same. <br>
        Or intense heat will by a little exceed the measure, but water
        by much. <br>
        And time and place will vary”. </p>
      <p>The time will vary according as the artist tends his fire
        diligently or not. For this our work is a true woman’s or cook’s
        work. They simmer and boil and roast until the spit is done to a
        turn; they wash and dry the linen in the sun until it is snow
        white. Also this white colour is like unto the earth when dry;
        then the corn soon gets white also, and is no far from maturity,
        viz., from the third colour, the yellow. As soon as the same
        appears in the corn it is cut; the winter is past, the rain
        over, the flowers have appeared, summer is come, and the
        turtledove is heard in our land. Thus also is the maturing of
        our matter, when its yellow colour appears, As regards its
        metallic nature, and the perfection of the same, we must bring
        that to a higher grade, says Bernhardus, viz., to its red
        colour, that it may thus communicate to other imperfect metals
        some of its superabundant perfection. For this redness is the
        sign of incorruptibility and complete digestion. </p>
      <p>Just so Christ became more than perfect in the highest
        exaltation of His humanity through His rosy blood, in obedience,
        in fulfilling and satisfying the Law, and in love towards God,
        in order to communicate to us, His people, to its fullness,
        through the Holy Spirit, whereby we might become heirs and
        sharers of His Kingdom. In this our Elias goes up to Heaven in a
        storm and seated in a fiery chariot. Now go forth, ye daughters
        of Jerusalem, and behold King Solomon crowned by his mother on
        the day of his marriage and of his heart’s joy. Every diligent
        student will now, without further explanation, be able to find
        these colours. Consult the philosophers concerning the same:
        Bernhardus, Scala Phil., etc., etc. </p>
      <p>Attention must, during such coction, be paid to the proper
        order of the colours produced, for with them change the
        qualities of the active agent, demanding a corresponding
        mutation in the passive reagent. For, in our solution, the water
        is first active, the earth then attracting the King, but in
        coagulation it is passive. This change of mode cannot take place
        without development of divers colours, which is expressed by
        philosophers thus: “Heat acting on moisture generates blackness,
        and, acting on dryness, generates whiteness, in which redness is
        hidden. </p>
      <p>Solomon mentions such coction and colours in his Song, Chap.
        5:10 --- “My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
        thousand. His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy
        and black as a raven. His eyes are as doves’ eyes by rivers of
        waters, washed with milk and fitly set. His cheeks are as a bed
        of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping
        sweet-smelling myrrh. His hands are as gold rings, set with the
        beryl: is belly is as bright ivory, overlaid with sapphires. His
        legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold”.
        The ancient Sages have also mentioned the same in parables, as
        when they saw a mist rise in the distance (possibly the mist
        that watered the whole earth). They saw also the violence of the
        sea and of the water-floods upon the face of the earth, that the
        same stank in the darkness (putrefaction). They also beheld the
        King of the Earth sink, and heard him cry with a terrible voice:
        He who delivers me shall live forever, and rule in my glory on
        my royal throne, and all things shall be given into his power
        (i.e., blackness). On the following day they beheld above the
        King a most beautiful morning star, and the light of day
        illumining the darkness (i.e., whiteness), the bright sun rising
        through brilliant clouds of various forms and colours (i.e.,
        yellowness and redness). Then, in fullness of time, the King was
        crowned with three costly crowns, of iron, of silver, and of
        pure gold. In his right hand they saw a scepter with seven
        glittering stars, and in his left a golden apple, upon which was
        sitting a white dove, with silvery body and golden wings. </p>
      <p>But particularly is the frequent imbibition (moistening) of dry
        earth with water described and indicated in complete parables
        --- (Philosophers have given this process of imbibition many
        other names, such as Exaltation, Fermentation, etc., but they
        are all one, viz., the subtilization of White and Red, and the
        augmentation of excellence and quantity). They beheld a man, as
        black as a Moor, stuck fast in a black stagnant bog, to whose
        assistance came a young woman, beautiful of countenance, and
        clad in bright apparel. Her back was adorned with glorious white
        wings and golden feathers, and on her knees she wore fine
        pearls. On her head she had a crown of pure gold, set with a
        silver star, around her neck a necklet of gold, set with
        precious stones, and on her feet golden shoes. From her
        proceeded the most sweet scent, above all aromas. She clothes
        man with a purple robe, inspires him with highest wisdom, and
        leads him to heaven. By diligently exercising yourself in
        suchlike parables, and --- at the same time --- paying attention
        to the works of Nature in the great generation, you will not
        only be able to await a plentiful harvest in due course, but
        will so increase the store of you philosophical oil, or
        tincture, as to be sort of vessels into which to pour the same;
        even as the widow of Elisha. Thus shall you be free form debt
        and feed your house in plenty; for your meal shall not diminish
        nor your cruse be wanting. </p>
      <p>There is nothing said here of the fire whereby this artificial
        coction takes place. Perhaps it is the everlasting fire, of
        which many Alchemists boast, the fire used aforetime by the Jews
        for their burnt offerings, which burnt continually without
        becoming extinguished, which also was hidden by the Prophet
        Jeremiah before the first destruction of Jerusalem, and
        afterwards was discovered by Ezra. The same is said to have been
        thick and oily, like oil or honey, as Josephus describes it. If
        you can and will prepare I, good, If not, refer to the Turba,
        Chrysippus, etc., for they will give you a good account, saying
        that this fire may be prepared in many ways, always taking care
        not to let the active principle escape, or, as Bernhardus
        explains it: Not to let the bath take fire, and flee away like a
        fugitive eagle, thus causing a dissipation of seed and
        preventing generation. “For then the Elements will not combine,
        but will vanish by fire, on account of the strength of the
        spirit and of the dominating and operating volatile thing; so
        wilt thou become poor, and lose that which thou hast”. </p>
      <p>Hence the “triple vase” commonly used by Philosophers. And the
        “old hollow oak split through the middle”, viz., the oaken
        sphere of Bernhardus, in whose middle is the clear stone, in
        which stood the bath. All this was done to ward off the too
        strong rays of the Sun, that our male and female seed might,
        without hindrance, remain together to the birth: “For the
        separation of active and passive necessarily prevents
        generation”. </p>
      <p>Compare Solomon’s Song, Chap. 2: “I charge you, O ye daughters
        of Jerusalem, that ye wake not my love till he pleases”. </p>
      <p>When Theophrasus further speaks of Hungary, Istria, the South,
        or Cyprus, he gives you to understand in which countries our
        matter ought to be sought, and he leaves it to you whether you
        will have two different substances which, as regards their
        genus, are of one and the same nature. Therefore, seek the one,
        the Lion, in Hungary; but the Eagle in Istria. But if you rule
        your work through one thing, thus proceeding from Unity to
        Duality, and thence to three things, then travel to Cyprus.
        There you will be refused nothing. </p>
      <p>Bernhardus has traveled yet farther, saying that he fetched his
        man, viz., the chosen jewel, the golden book, from India.
        Christophorus Parisiensis also went far for the same, and says:
        “When you quit the town of Venice, go far to the right until you
        find a pleasant level country: there is our Mercury”. Whether in
        liquid or coagulated form, it is best to obtain it from the
        above-mentioned places, by reason of its beautiful red colour.
        Although found also in Germany and other countries ---
        Theophrastus saying elsewhere that of the perfect Medicine
        enough is found in Germany --- yet the native article is not so
        good and strong as the foreign. “For the virtue is dispersed,
        and less united, therefore less strong. For here masculine and
        feminine are substantively the same, and in the one subject are
        combined different and contrary virtues, since our Lion is
        hermaphrodite”. </p>
      <p>If you use but one thing, make of the same two, but, lastly, of
        one of these three. Afterwards for these three build a
        tabernacle, and diligently take heed that the sacred
        Threefoldness be reduced through Duality to Unity, the Author of
        all consummate perfection. So from our New Earth and New Heaven
        (the old Earth and heaven having been destroyed by fire,
        together with their works) you will have a New World, the Holy
        Place, the New Jerusalem, as a bride for the bridegroom, wherein
        all tears, lamentation, and sorrow shall be no more, whose gates
        also are adorned with all manner of precious stones and pearls,
        the streets are of pure gold like unto a beautiful mirror, and
        the names of the dwellers therein are all written in the Book of
        Life. </p>
      <p>There all things are new, for the former things have passed
        away; and, as Hermes briefly says: “Thou shalt have the World’s
        Glory and all thy desire”. </p>
      <p>Finally, as regards the utility of the Medicine thus prepared,
        the same is sufficiently described in other books. That this
        medicine is of great use with respect to the health of the human
        body may easily be gathered from the aforesaid Medicinal
        Foundation. For this our philosophical Son, a Son of Sun and
        Moon, which rule the whole world, as a learned Astronomer has
        traversed all planetary spheres and the whole firmament in his
        colours. He also is born out of the Adamic clay (which is an
        extract of the Fifth Essence --- quintessence --- of all
        creatures and of the whole world), ascending to Heaven and
        descending thence to Earth, and thus acquiring all power and
        might both in Heaven and Earth. Hence he is a Lord over all
        Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Natures, and can act according to
        his pleasure, and the same with his influence --- especially on
        man as the Microcosmus --- if applied to man’s Spirit of Life in
        an appropriate affinitive Vehicle. </p>
      <p>But, as regards his other powers and influence over the metals,
        a means is necessary whereby to reduce, punish, and humble his
        rebellious people. Theophrastus here indicates as this means.
        Our Stone is first to conclude unity and friendship with the
        same, i.e., they are both to be fused together. </p>
      <p>Aurel. Augurellius says likewise, in his third book: </p>
      <p>“First mingle a little of the prepared medicament with the
        yellow metal, and thou wilt presently see the same take to
        itself the strength of the Blessed Powder. <br>
        Or, when thou shalt have collected again, by great and difficult
        art, the teeming seed from the pure gold, <br>
        Then quickly mix with it an equal portion of purple powder, <br>
        And warm the same with gentle heat, simmering for two months; <br>
        In which space of time thou mayst behold produced the whole
        series of colours, <br>
        Which, otherwise, thou hadst marveled to see in three years. <br>
        As often as thou repeatest the operation again and again, so
        often shalt thou increase the virtue and quantity of thy
        powder”. </p>
      <p>But he conceals the important point, for this fusion suffices
        not, if such molten matter be not heated during the proper time
        in a vessel with philosophical coction. For by this means the
        operator obtains full power over his Lord the King, thereupon
        reducing the subjects to obedience, as related by Dionysius
        Zacharius, a knack unknown to many operators, who have
        consequently not known how to set about the projection. For,
        although our Stone of itself colours, yet, according to
        Theophrastus, it does this less than when the Medium of
        Incorporation and Ingression&nbsp; of the Stone --- i.e.,&nbsp;
        Fermentation --- is added. </p>
      <p>Different philosophers have used different Media, each
        according to his own opinion. Farreanus, Berhardus, Roger Bacon,
        etc., etc., having some applied augmentation by means of
        repeated solution, others by fermentation. Use which you will;
        either will lead to the desired result. (Vide <i>Pandor</i>.,
        Fol. 252). But here I call a Ferment a Stone already complete in
        its elements in comparison with the metals; Even as the ferment
        of dough overcomes the dough, converting it into itself, so also
        this stone converts metals into itself, just as dough is changed
        and converted by its ferment, because it derives its origin its
        ferment, because it derives its origin from the same, and not
        from anything foreign. Thus, also, the Ferment of metals is of
        their own substance, changing into itself. And since metals are
        generated from mercury and Sulphur, therefore, also, this
        ferment is generated from them; and because this our Ferment is
        of the form, nature, and digestion of gold, therefore, it will
        reduce metals to the nature and digestion of gold. For the form
        of individuals of the same species is one alone. </p>
      <p>As regards its third use, our Stone matures all immature
        precious stones, and brings tem to their highest perfection. For
        this I refer you to others, being of opinion that such great
        gifts are given by God to man more to assist his neighborhood by
        works of charity than to enrich himself. Would that man
        recognized the resources of Nature and God’s wonderful wisdom in
        the implanting of such powers in His creation! Then, by means of
        this Igneous Sulphur or Lion’s Blood, or Philosopher’s Stone, he
        might attain the highest Rubinical Gradation of all Jewels, as
        well as the White Eagle, making large pearls of small ones; and
        finally, might perform all philosophical works by the processes
        Theophrastus describes as digesting or putrefying sublimating or
        distilling, calcining, extracting, fermenting, etc., These are
        the steps by which you may attain to wisdom and to Solomon’s
        throne, on the right hand of which are found long life and the
        tree of life, and on the left, riches and honour. That is, says
        Theophrastus, the object of our art, viz., long life and the
        honourable maintenance of the same in this vale of tears. </p>
      <p>Now will I briefly recapitulate to you the whole process: Take
        first thy golden Man, thy red Adamic earth. For this earth is
        the middle nature between Mercury and metals, and the third
        composed of the same principles, Quicksilver and Sulphur. By
        noiseless metallic liquefaction of this earth the matter of its
        metallic ore acquires, virtues, and properties of the aforesaid
        principles, so that from it may be generated each and every
        metal, according to diversity of digestion; and to it is there
        nothing wanting but purification and complete digestion. This
        Red Adam lay in a warm bath that he may go to sleep. If he will
        not fall asleep, give him a good, strong, sleeping draught of
        his saturated liquor, which he loves to drink. Then, during his
        sleep, cut open his right side that the fair white woman,
        concealed within him, may come forth. When, now, this maiden has
        become marriageable, bring her to Adam --- lying on his bed and
        sick with love --- as his bed and sick with love --- as his
        daughter, sister, and wife. Whereupon Adam will know the woman,
        and she will become pregnant. Take then this pregnant woman ---
        letting the man go --- and guard her well for ten months, until
        the day of her parturition. She will then bear her first-born
        son, whom she has conceived from her father’s spirit, a young
        spiritual Adam, to whom no other man is equal in deeds and
        miracles, who --- if daily fed with his young mother’s milk ---
        when he reaches man’s estate, will subdue all his brethren, will
        deliver them from death, and bring them to eternal death, and
        bring them to eternal joy in the kingdom of Honour, in which all
        creatures under heaven will rejoice with joy unspeakable. And,
        finally, the whole world will become full of gold, and pearls,
        and precious stones. For Solomon’s vineyard bears him 1000, and
        to those that keep the fruit thereof, 200. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">Corollary Concerning Hyle</font></b></center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>To say what Hyle is, is not puerile. Hyle is the primary matter
        and the Philosopher’s Stone. Azoth is the seed of all metals,
        when it is extracted from magnesia and Silver. </p>
      <p>Hyle is the Beginning of all things, a confused mass and
        primary matter, which is neither moist nor dry, not earth nor
        water, not light nor darkness, not air nor fire. </p>
      <p>Philosophers’ Mercury is nothing else but a water or fire, both
        Elements having long been digested together with natural heat,
        resulting in a dry water, This Mercury is not common, but the
        Stars in the Firmament by their influence cause it to grow in
        the earth, the Quintessence of the Stars influencing the
        terrestrial Quintessence. You can drive them both into a water,
        and extract them therefrom, and they are to be observed in the
        Rainbow or Sun’s reflection. <br>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Conrad Poyselius</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take the strongest red subduer of men (cinnabar, red Mercurial
        earth) you can obtain, as it comes out of the earth. The
        Istrian, Candian, Hundraian, or Spanish kinds are the best.
        Distil the same three times, yet not too quickly, and put aside
        this thrice distilled spirit. Then of Red Royal Alum put several
        pounds into a vessel and calcine to blackness or greyness; pound
        also, and dissolve in warm water. Then extract the water per
        Alembicum, or evaporate in an open vessel till dry. Calcine
        again the residue, and again extract until it yields no more
        salt. Dissolve this salt, and coagulate for the third time until
        it ceases to yield a residue. Of this oil take one pound, place
        the same in a Waldburg or Hessian crucible, and set in a blast
        furnace until it fuses; add more oil if necessary. Allow it to
        fuse 24 hours in such furnace (if the crucible stand fire so
        long, even to three days); then take out and place in another
        crucible; fuse again, a repeat this operation a third time, The
        result will be a hard, green stone; pound the same, when warm,
        to pieces, place in a retort, and pour upon the stone of the
        above thrice distilled spirit three fingers’ breadth. Set it,
        well closed up, upon hot ashes for three days and nights. Then
        the Vegetable Spirit, or White Eagle, will extract the Green
        Lion’s rosy blood, and the superfluity and impurity will remain
        behind, partly as a scum and partly as a black, stinking oil or
        pitch. The scum swims upon the Aqua or Spiritus Vitae, and the
        red blood upon that, like oil upon water. Pour the essentiated
        spirit into a glass, away from the scum and black residue (weigh
        the glass first). </p>
      <p>The residual Stone can be further dessicated until it have an
        oily or dry consistency. Use the same for Calculus, Asthma, and
        other Tartaric diseases. The aforesaid Green Lion’s Blood is the
        true Philosopher’s Oil, above all aromas, always fixed and
        unalterable in fire. After remaining in the fire for a whole
        year it s still undiminished, looking like melted wax, as Geber
        testifies, saying he had seen nothing stable in fire except the
        viscous humidity, which is the root of all metals, and the true
        primary matter of Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables, as you,
        with God’s help, will yourself experience. </p>
      <p>Now, observe, when you have placed your Red Lion in the
        aforesaid weighed glass, distill the Eagle off in a bath, or
        over warm ashes. Collect the spirit by itself, putting away the
        phlegm, and you shall have the Lion’s&nbsp; Blood in the form of
        a fixed, stable, white salt. The Eagle goes off unwillingly,
        invisibly taking over the Anima or Soul in form of a sweet
        volatile salt, losing also its original scent. If you now will
        continue, and reach the desired goal, by God’s help, take of the
        residual salt one part, and of the animated spirit three parts.
        Place in the aforesaid glass, in such a way that the third part
        of the same remain empty --- as described by Poyselius in <i>Splendor


          Solis</i>. Seal hermetically, and, in God’s Name, place in a
        vapour bath, giving it such warmth as an egg, or a child in the
        womb, requires. You will then behold within 40 days how the
        soul, lying in his spirit, again assumes its body, and is the
        only medium for the reuniting of body and spirit. When the
        matter begins to get black, then the conjunction goes on between
        the two, for this blackness is the body, or fixed salt, the
        passive thing, dominated by spirit and soul, and can be fused by
        no force of fire. As Bernhardus says: They wondrously love each
        other, and, although, in the beginning, the fixed body may be
        overcome by the spirit and soul, yet it is so strong, and of so
        incombustible a nature, that they cannot kill it, but when it
        finds the soul and spirit pressing it so hard, the Lion feels
        its old strength, and takes away from them the dominion. Before
        passive with respect to Soul and Spirit, it is now active as
        regard these, converting them into its own nature, and producing
        a true and clear substance, called the true, white Magnesia. But
        every intelligent artist may imagine for himself what various
        colours must be exhibited before this result is attained, how
        also it must be brought from one extreme to the other, viz.,
        from white to black, and vice versa, which can only be done in
        several months. For Bernhardus says: “And I saw black clouds,
        but they lasted long; and, for the fire’s sake, you must not
        alter the temperature until necessary, when it shall have
        coagulated into a grayish, white ash. Hen you may increase the
        fire until the yellow appears, continuing to augment the
        temperature until you behold the desired perfect redness”. But
        it is unnecessary here to state the whole procedure. Read with
        diligence the <i>Tinctura Physicorum Solis</i> of Poyselius,
        Raym. Lullius, Bernhardus, Chrysippus, Farriarinus, Chris.
        Parisiensis, Morienus, <i>Rosarium Majus, The Epistle of Arnold

      <p>Rebis is making one thing of two. That is, philosophers’ gold
        and silver --- i.e., the Philosopher’s Stone --- make a sulphur
        called philosophers’ sulphur, and the secret of secrets. Gold
        generates gold, i.e., when Medicine is to be prepared, then it
        is projected over gold or silver, and it is projected over gold
        or silver, and it is the required Medicine. Then, the whole is
        projected over other, imperfect, bodies, and thus like generates
        like. </p>
      <p>Philosophers’ Mercury --- i.e., water out of the salt of metals
        --- is none other than a body dissolved in water. Aqua Vitae
        (Water of Life is the same as Permanent Water, and is a spirit
        extracted from a body; it is called Aqua Vitae and Quicksilver,
        and of it are all things are made. </p>
      <p>The spirit and soul are extracted from the body. The body was
        dead. Restore to it its soul! Then will it live and not die
        eternally, and then from these is made the stone which perfectly
        coagulates Mercury. The matter of the Stone is Philosophers’
        Salt, and Philosophers’ Salt is Sulphur of imperfect metals. </p>
      <p>The matter and form of the Stone: The form of the Stone is the
        same sulphur is the same sulphur of gold or silver reduced to

        Oleum Lunae to whiteness, and with Oleum Solis to redness.
        Likewise: of all things in the world --- after first being
        reduced to ashes --- there can be made a fixed Salt, fixing and
        really tingeing every metallic body. All salts have the same
        efficacy as dissolved Mercury. Likewise, Incineration is
        effected thus: Take a white or red stone, at the same time
        somewhat congealed and powdered; place over a fire, and, when
        the said salt is a little heated, add a little of the powder,
        with sulphur or Oleum Solis and Lunae, continually, until the
        mixture be a sort of thick honey. Then take of the fire and
        colour; and thus so with all salts. Salts are softened by
        dissolution in fire, and then by alternate solution in and
        recrystallization out of clear water. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">Concerning Common Salt for the
            Purification of Aqua Vitae</font></b></center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Take of Common Salt, prepared by solution and coagulation, and
        let it be many times dried; pour on it Aqua Vitae, and distill
        with a strong fire, the more the better, and it will be
        rectified, dissolving gold. It ought to be distilled with salt
        at least three or four times. </p>
      <p>Also: Pour out common salt, coagulate, and dissolve in common
        fresh water, repeating this until it be purified, and be
        obtained in crystalline form. Also: Let Antimony --- and the
        other things not destroyed by combustion in the crucible --- be
        dissolved in spirits of wine and distilled four days. Then
        extract therefrom the Salt and Oil. </p>
      <p>Note: Philosophical Fire --- which is called Nature and Soul
        --- can be extracted from all natural things, and is of their
        nature and condition, because, in earth is earth, in water is
        water, in air is air, in fire is fire; neither has it causes of
        corruption nor contrary qualities. </p>
      <p>Also: Of every Salt can a Tincture or Elixir be made, because
        an Elixir can be made of all things in the world, as has been
        said above, and hence also of Tartar, which Salt is a natural
        thing. </p>
      <p>Also: The Philosopher says: The Spirit enters not except by
        water, i.e., by Salt Water and the Regimen of fire, because
        whatever is dissolved out of Salts is done over a gentle fire,
        and whatever is dissolved by means of Salt Water remains, and is
        not altered. Hence, if you would be enriched, prepare Common
        Salt and Alkali, and reduce them into pure, sweet water, which
        is preparative and incerative water, in which --- if thou shalt
        have decocted the whitened spirits --- it will rectify and
        whiten the same, extinguishing therein all blackness. </p>
      <p>To be noted: Prepare Salts; make them liquid and commiscible
        with bodies, and --- if thou wouldst be enriched --- prepare
        especially Sal Alpoli. For its property is to retain volatile
        things, and hence they are more quickly liquefied and collected.
        For, whatever has been dissolved out of Salts over a slow fire,
        should afterwards be distilled over three times with a very slow
        fire. The residue in the still should be removed and preserved,
        and the said water be again redistilled until perfectly pure
        water passes over. In the fifth distillation the water will be
        pure, and then it is finished, as the Philosopher says. When you
        obtain water from air, and air from fire, and fire from earth,
        then you have the whole Art. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;From the above it is patent that salt enters not a body,
        neither are bodies mixed with it, unless the salt be made
        liquable, nor are those complexionable unless the saltness be
        purged away. Then will it be an Elixir, a most limpid Condiment,
        like the Coagulum of Milk. For the dryness of salt is the
        calcinative and parcher of all bodies and spirits. But the
        property of water is mild, purifying and rectifying bodies and
        spirits. Take care, for it is a light sort, that thou mayst
        collect gold and silver perfectly pure, for it rectifies and
        perfects whitened spirits. </p>
      <p>By boiling thou mayst obtain many things wherewith to coagulate
        Mercury and change it into perfect silver. Hence the
        Philosopher: If Quicksilver be joined to its own kind, it will
        doubtless flee away, but if quick when fleeing, suffering
        another union with water, it bears fire and hammer. </p>
      <p>Praise God in thy soul for what I have said, and praised be God
        who hath placed His Wisdom in Salt! Work with the same and thou
        shalt prosper. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Philosophical Rules or Canons Concerning
              the Philosopher’s Stone</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>What we seek is here or nowhere. </p>
      <p>1. Canon: The nearly perfect is easily brought to perfection. </p>
      <p>2. Imperfect things by no art can put on perfection, unless
        first purged from impure Sulphur and earthly grossness, which
        are mixed with Mercury and Sulphur; then are they accounted a
        perfect Medicine. </p>
      <p>It is wholly impossible to render imperfect bodies fixed
        without the Sulphur and Spirit of the perfect ones. </p>
      <p>4. The Philosophers’ Coelum (Heaven) reduces all metals to
        their primary matter, i.e., to Mercury. </p>
      <p>5. Those attempting to reduce metals into Mercury without
        Coelum Philosophicum, or metallic Aqua Vitae, or Tartar of the
        same, are greatly deceived, since the impurity out of other
        solutions swimming in Mercury is perceived by their own eyes. </p>
      <p>6. Noting is perfectly fixed, except it be indissolubly joined
        to a fixed substance. </p>
      <p>7. Fusible gold may be mutated, and changed into blood. </p>
      <p>8. To render silver stable it must be reduced neither to a
        powder nor to water --- for this would destroy it utterly ---
        but it must of necessity be reduced to Quicksilver. </p>
      <p>9. Silver cannot be transmuted into gold (except Physica
        Tinctura), unless it be reduced to liquid Mercury. The same is
        to be said of the other metals. </p>
      <p>10. Imperfect bodies, as well as silver, are endowed with
        perfection, and converted into pure gold; and this is done with
        white or red sulphur by the virtue of a suitable fire. </p>
      <p>11. Every imperfect body is brought to perfection by reduction
        into Mercury, after decoction with sulphurs in an appropriate
        fire. For out of the same are generated gold and silver; and
        they are deceived and labour in vain, who try to make gold and
        silver in any other way. </p>
      <p>12. Sulphur of Iron is the best, for thus, joined to Sulphur of
        Gold, brings forth a certain Medicine. </p>
      <p>13. No gold is generated, except it have first been silver. </p>
      <p>14. Nature compounds and prepares is minerals by a gradual
        process: and thus at length from one root it procreates all
        metals to the last limit of metals, which is gold. </p>
      <p>15. Mercury corrupts gold, changing it into Mercury, and
        rendering it volatile. </p>
      <p>16. The Stone is composed of Sulphur and Mercury. </p>
      <p>17. If the preparation of Mercuries be not taught by an
        experienced artificer, it cannot be learnt from books. </p>
      <p>18. The preparation of Mercury for the philosophical menstruum
        is called Morification. </p>
      <p>19. The practice of this great work remains our Grand Secret or
        Arcanum, and unless it be revealed Divinely, or by artificers,
        or in experiments, it also can never be learnt from books. </p>
      <p>20. Sulphur and Mercury are the ingredients of the stone. Hence
        a knowledge of Mercury is necessary, to select the best Mercury
        for the speedy perfecting of the Stone. </p>
      <p>21. A certain Mercury is latent in every body, but the art of
        extraction is most difficult. </p>
      <p>22. Mercury can only be changed into gold and silver by an
        abbreviation of the long process. </p>
      <p>23. Congealing and fixing necessitate but one and the same
        operation, in the same vessel, and with the same substance. </p>
      <p>24. What congeals and fixes Mercury also colours the same, in
        one and the same process. </p>
      <p>25. There are four degrees of fire to be observed in the
        process. In the first Mercury dissolves; in the second Sulphur
        dries up Mercury; in the third and fourth Mercury is fixed. </p>
      <p>26. Things radically mingled in their minutest parts afterwards
        become inseparable, like snow mixed with water. </p>
      <p>27. Different Simple Substances exposed to putrefaction give
        different products. </p>
      <p>28. It necessarily behooves form and matter to be of the same
        species. </p>
      <p>29. Homogeneous Sulphur is of that Mercurial Nature which
        produces gold and silver, not in the form in which they are
        perceived by the eyes, but in which Mercury is dissolved. </p>
      <p>30. Without Philosophical Solution of Gold in mercury, there
        cannot be extracted from gold the certain fixed unctuosity which
        acts the part of a ferment generating gold and silver, The same
        is effected by a short method described by Geber. </p>
      <p>31. Metals resolved into Mercury are again reduced to their
        original form by admixture of a small portion of this </p>
      <p>32. Coelum, or Tartar of Philosophers, which reduces all metals
        into Mercury, is metallic philosophers’ Aqua Vitae. </p>
      <p>33. Sulphur and mercury consist of the same homogeneous nature.
      </p>
      <p>34. The Philosophers’ Stone is none other than gold and silver
        endued with a more than perfect tincture and excellence. </p>
      <p>35. Gold and silver contain in themselves a superabundance of
        riches, which&nbsp; --- by preparation and digestion --- should
        be changed into a ferment, whereby the mass may be multiplied. </p>
      <p>36. The greatest extremities in Mercury are two, viz.,
        exceeding crudeness, and exceedingly exquisite decoction. </p>
      <p>37. Philosophers hold it as an axiom that every dry thing
        quickly drinks up the humidity of its own species. </p>
      <p>38. Lime of Silver alterated quickly drinks up its Mercury, the
        fundament of the minerals of Philosophers. </p>
      <p>39. Sulphur is the Soul, Mercury the Matter. </p>
      <p>40. Mercury, placed with the sulphur of imperfect bodies, is
        coagulated into an imperfect body, being transmuted into that
        imperfect metallic species, the sulphur of which is coagulated
        and concreted </p>
      <p>41. It is wholly impossible to make gold and silver with the
        sulphur of imperfect bodies. For nothing can excel that which it
        contains within itself. </p>
      <p>42. Mercury is the feminine seed and menstruum of all metals,
        suitably prepared by the good operator’s Art. For, by the
        projection of the great work, it receives and transmits the
        qualities of all metals, even to gold. </p>
      <p>43. As Red Tincture is elicited by the ferment of gold alone,
        Mercury can be animated only by the white ferment of silver. </p>
      <p>44. The Philosophers’ work can be carried on without much
        labour or expense at all times, in every place, and by all, if
        only the true and sufficient matter be forthcoming. </p>
      <p>45. The sulphurs of gold and silver stand the spirits of their
        species. </p>
      <p>46. The sulphurs of gold and silver are the true seeds,
        feminine or masculine, of the Stone. </p>
      <p>47. Everything conferring the virtue of stability and
        permanence necessarily possesses this virtue itself. </p>
      <p>48. The tincture imparting perfecting to the imperfect derives
        this perfection from the fount of gold and silver. </p>
      <p>49. Those are deceived who accept Venus as sulphur. </p>
      <p>50. Nothing has been granted by Nature to Venus which answers
        for the great Spagyric work, or which will serve in the making
        of gold and silver. </p>
      <p>51. Note: Gold converted into Mercury before conjunction with
        the menstruum, can be neither spirit, nor ferment, nor sulphur,
        and is good for nothing. </p>
      <p>52. The work brought to an end by reiteration cannot again be
        made hot. </p>
      <p>53. In abbreviating the work perfect bodies should be reduced
        to liquid Mercury and dry water, when they will easily
        assimilate the ferment. </p>
      <p>54. The preparation of Mercury effected by sublimation is the
        more excellent, and by it (after revivificiation) is
        amalgamation more easily and better carried out. </p>
      <p>55. The Soul cannot impress the Form, except by intervention of
        the Spirit, which is gold transmuted into Mercury. </p>
      <p>56. Mercury receives the form of gold through the medium of the
        Spirit. </p>
      <p>57. Gold resolved into Mercury is Spirit and Soul. </p>
      <p>58. Philosophers’ Sulphur, Tincture, Ferment, designate one and
        the same thing. </p>
      <p>59. Common Mercury is the equal of and nearly approaches the
        Nature and Similitude of all other Mercuries. </p>
      <p>60. Ferment renders Mercury heavier. </p>
      <p>61. If Common Mercury be not animated, it is unsuitable for
        philosophical purposes. </p>
      <p>62. The Soul is already impressed on Mercury properly
        mortified. </p>
      <p>63. Gold may be prepared in a ferment, so that one part shall
        animate ten parts of Common Mercury, but this work has no end. </p>
      <p>64. Mercury if imperfect bodies holds a middle place between
        common Mercury and that of perfect bodies; but the art of
        extraction is most difficult. </p>
      <p>65. Since Common Mercury, by projection of the Stone, can be
        changed into gold and silver, it can be made equal to all
        Mercuries of the Bodies. </p>
      <p>66. Animated Common Mercury is the greatest secret. </p>
      <p>67. The Mercuries of all metals, by abbreviation of the work,
        are changed into gold and silver. </p>
      <p>68. A humid and gentle heat is called by the name of Egyptian
        fire. </p>
      <p>69. It is worthy to be noted that Luna is not the mother of
        common silver, but a certain Mercury endued with the quality of
        the celestial moon. </p>
      <p>70. The Metallic Luna (silver) is of masculine nature. </p>
      <p>71. Common Mercury, from cold, assumes the nature of a sterile
        woman. </p>
      <p>72. The Mercuries of semi-minerals bear in their nature a
        similitude to Luna. </p>
      <p>73. All things are produced from Sol and Luna, viz., from two
        substances. </p>
      <p>74. Male and female --- i.e., Sol and Mercury --- coalesce into
        one. </p>
      <p>75. Common Mercury, without preparation, is unsuitable for the
        work. </p>
      <p>76. Four parts of Mercury and one of Sol --- i.e., of the
        ferment --- constitute the true marriage of male and female. </p>
      <p>77. The solution is complete when Sol is resolved into mercury.
      </p>
      <p>78. Without putrefaction is no solution perfected. </p>
      <p>79. Putrefaction extends and continues even unto whiteness. </p>
      <p>80. The great Arcanum is the maturing of the spirit, by which
        is prepared the menstruum, for in the same is Sol dissolved. </p>
      <p>81. Mercury dissolves gold into water of its own form, i.e.,
        into liquid Mercury. </p>
      <p>82. Dissolution is the principle of congelation. </p>
      <p>83. Gold transmuted into liquid Mercury, remains but a short
        time in that form. </p>
      <p>84. Ferment dessicates Mercury, rendering it heavier and sable.
      </p>
      <p>85. Sol (gold) is called the Philosophers’ Fount. </p>
      <p>86. Matter, by force of putrefaction, is converted into pulp or
        mud, which is the principle of coagulation. </p>
      <p>87. The long method is the open secret of Philosophy, but it is
        a veil and an evasion. </p>
      <p>88. There is a certain short method by which the Sulphur is
        removed from gold and silver, whereby every Mercury is
        permanently changed into gold and silver. </p>
      <p>89. When matter attains blackness of colour, the second degree
        of heat must be applied. </p>
      <p>90. Philosophers’ Laton is the similitude of fire, for that
        alone perfects and excels all things. </p>
      <p>91. Poison and stench are removed by fire, without other
        addition, and it alone cleanses all things. </p>
      <p>92. Fire, by its penetrative and acute virtue, purifies and
        matures a hundred times more than water. </p>
      <p>94. The Spirit is heat. </p>
      <p>95. Matter, when brought to whiteness, refuses to be corrupted
        and destroyed. </p>
      <p>96. All corruption of matter is marked by deadly poison. </p>
      <p>97. The glass, or vessel, is called the Mother. </p>
      <p>98. The virtue of Sulphur is not extensive, except to a certain
        limit of proportion, neither can it exceed an unlimited weight.
      </p>
      <p>99. The question is to be observed, wherefore Philosophers call
        the matter of the Stone a Menstruum. </p>
      <p>100. Sulphur merits the name of form, but menstruum that of
        matter. </p>
      <p>101. Menstruum represents the small and inferior elements,
        viz., Earth and Water --- Sulphur, the two superior ones, viz.,
        Fire and Air, as the masculine Agent. </p>
      <p>102. Thou canst not hatch the chicken by breaking the
        egg-shell; similarly, thou canst have no result by opening the
        vessel and exposing the matter to the air. </p>
      <p>103. The Calcination, by means of Mercury in a blast furnace,
        excels others. </p>
      <p>104. The Philosophers’ mode of speaking must be diligently
        noted. By sublimation they mean the dissolution of bodies into
        Mercury. By the first degree of fire they mean that which the
        second operation follows, viz., the inspissation (thickening) of
        Mercury with Sulphur. The third is the fixation of Mercury into
        a perfect and dissolved body. </p>
      <p>105. Infinite is the number of the erring who admit not that
        Mercury, as regards its form, when mixed with amalgamated chalk
        of perfect bodies, is the subject and matter of the Stone. </p>
      <p>106. White Medicine is brought to perfection in the third
        degree of fire, which must not be exceeded lest the work --- for
        whiteness --- be destroyed. </p>
      <p>107. The fourth degree of fire produces a red matter, when
        appear divers colour. </p>
      <p>108. It is necessary that whiteness, no yet brought to highest
        redness, should remain imperfect, both as regards the white and
        the red tincture. Therefore it is left dead until it ends in
        perfect redness. </p>
      <p>109. After the fifth degree of perfecting fire, the matter
        acquires new virtues. </p>
      <p>110. The work attains not perfection, unless the medicine have
        been incerated and rendered fusible like wax. </p>
      <p>111. The process of creation is repeated three times on a
        quantity of the Binary Mercury, which produces the Stone. </p>
      <p>112. The inceration of white Medicine is effected with white
        water or Mercury animated by Luna; but the inceration of Red
        Tincture with Mercury animated by Sol. </p>
      <p>113. After inceration it suffices for the matter to remain in
        the form of pulp or paste. </p>
      <p>114. Repeat the inceration&nbsp; until it stands the perfect
        test. </p>
      <p>115. If the Mercury, by which the Medicine is incerated,
        escapes as a vapour, the work has failed. </p>
      <p>116. Medicine, rightly incerated, explains to thee the enigma
        of the king returning from the fountain. </p>
      <p>117. Sol ---when converted into its primary water, or Mercury,
        by means of Mercury --- if it become cold, causes the work to
        perish. </p>
      <p>118. Philosophers, taking matter prepared and concocted by
        Nature, reduce it to its primary matter, since everything
        returns to that whence it derives its origin, even as snow is
        inseparably resolved into water. </p>
      <p>119. The Wise reduce years to months, months to weeks, weeks to
        days. </p>
      <p>120. The first decoction of Mercury --- which Nature effects
        --- is the sole cause of its simple perfection, beyond which of
        itself it can rise very little; and it is meet to assist its
        simplicity by sowing our gold in its proper earth; this is none
        other than pure Mercury, which Nature has digested a little, and
        not perfectly. </p>
      <p>121. But by this second decoction Mercury becomes multiplied in
        virtue tenfold beyond its primary nature. </p>
      <p>122. But the Stone Mercury is produced by repeated decoctions
        and mixing with Sol. Therefore, for this cause, man and woman
        follow twice. </p>
      <p>123. By addition of Sol to Mercury it is converted into
        sulphur, and then by decoction into the Philosopher’s Stone. </p>
      <p>124. He who contemplates Philosophers’ mercury but for a few
        moments, the same neither knows nor understands it. </p>
      <p>125. Every Mercury, of whatever origin, exhibits the matter of
        the Stone, when treated in the right manner. </p>
      <p>126. Everything from which Mercury is elicited is a subject of
        Philosophical Medicine. </p>
      <p>127. Those who understand the Philosophers’ Writings literally
        greatly err when they assert their Mercury to be One. </p>
      <p>128. One Mercury exceeds the other in greater heat, dryness,
        decoction, purity, perfection; it ought to be prepared without
        corruption or loss of form, and to be purged from superfluities.
        In this consist the treasure and mystery of the Stone. </p>
      <p>129. If the preparation of Common Mercury were known to
        students of Philosophy, no other Philosophers’ Mercury, nor
        Metallic Aqua Vitae, nor other Mercurial Water of the Stone,
        need be sought, since the preparation of Common Mercury includes
        all these things. </p>
      <p>130. Every Mercury of Metals and Minerals may, by successive
        stages, be raised, through the qualities of all other Mercuries,
        to the excellence of the Solar Body, and thence also be reduced
        to the degree and virtue of any metallic body one may choose. </p>
      <p>131. Common Mercury, before legitimate preparation, is no
        Philosophers’ Mercury, but after preparation it is called Mer.
        Phil., containing within itself the true method and way of
        extracting Mercury from other metals --- it is, as it were, the
        beginning of the great work. </p>
      <p>132. Prepared Common Mercury is held to be Metallic Aqua Vitae.
      </p>
      <p>133. Passive Mercury and Menstruum should on no account lose
        the external form of Mercury. </p>
      <p>134. Those who (for philosophical work), in place of liquid
        Mercury, use sublimate, or calcined powder, or precipitate, are
        deceived, and err greatly. </p>
      <p>135. Those who --- for the perfecting of the philosophical work
        --- resolve Mercury into clear water, err greatly. </p>
      <p>136. To compound and make Mercury of limpid water is in the
        power of Nature alone. </p>
      <p>137. In the Great Physical Work it is necessary that crude
        Mercury resolve Sol into Mercury. </p>
      <p>138. If Mercury be reduced into water, it dissolves Sol into
        water, and, in the work of the Stone, it is highly necessary tat
        it be dissolved into Mercury. </p>
      <p>139. It behooves the Sperma and Menstruum to have servile
        external forms. </p>
      <p>140. According to Philosophers, we should imitate Nature. Were,
        therefore, Menstruum dry, solution would be hoped for in vain. </p>
      <p>141. The seed of the Stone should be in form similar to metals.
      </p>
      <p>142. It is highly necessary to choose that seed of
        Philosophical medicine which bears Common Mercury. </p>
      <p>143. It is the mystery of all mysteries of the Stone to know
        Mercury to be the matter, menstruum, and form of perfect bodies.
      </p>
      <p>144. Mercury, of itself, brings nothing of moment to gradation.
      </p>
      <p>145. Mercury is the Element of Earth, in which a seed of Sol
        must be implanted. </p>
      <p>146. The seed of gold effects, not only the multiplying of
        quantity, but also of virtue. </p>
      <p>147. Perfected Mercury, for the generation of the work, has
        need of a female. </p>
      <p>148. Each Mercury is derived from, and participates in, two
        Elements --- Crude, from water and earth; decocted, from fire
        and air. </p>
      <p>149. If any one wish to prepare and exalt Mercury into a Metal,
        let him add a little ferment, whereby it may be raised to the
        required metallic degree. </p>
      <p>150. The highest mystery of the whole Work is the Physical
        Dissolution into Mercury, and the reduction into primary matter.
      </p>
      <p>151. The dissolution of Sol should be effected by Nature, not
        by handiwork. </p>
      <p>152. Sol, when joined or married to its Mercury, will be in the
        form of Sol, but the major preparation will be in chalk. </p>
      <p>153. It is an open question among Sages whether Mercurius Lunae
        contained with Mercurius Solis can be obtained in place of
        philosophical menstruum. </p>
      <p>154. Mercurius Lunae has a masculine nature. But two males can
        generate as little as two females. </p>
      <p>155. When eliciting the Elixir, the purest substance of Mercury
        must be chosen. </p>
      <p>156. He who wishes to be employed, let him be employed in the
        solution and sublimation of the two Luminaries. </p>
      <p>157. Gold imparts a golden, silver a silvery color. But he who
        knows how to colour Mercury with Sol or Luna, the same attains
        to the Arcanum. </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>My noble and dear Son, in order that I may communicate to you,
        in the briefest manner, my knowledge of the right, true,
        philosophical Stone, now know and understand that this Stone is
        composed of two things, Body and Spirit, to wit, male ad female
        seed, that is, Mercurial Water and Corpus Sols, as may be read
        in all philosophical works. </p>
      <p>And it is the general opinion that Mercury --- free from
        foreign admixture --- should first be dissolved in a spiritual
        water, called by philosophers primary matte of metals, Liquor
        Lunae, Aqua Vitae, Quintessence, with which water, or primary
        matter, the metals are delivered and freed from their rigid,
        frozen bonds, and are dissolved into their primary nature, like
        mercurial water itself. Hence philosophers, in their books, have
        illustrated their meaning by saying that ice dissolves into
        water by means of heat, because it was water before its
        coagulation. For everything is reducible to its primary
        condition. Therefore, also, philosophers have written that the
        species or forms of metals cannot be changed into gold and
        silver before being first reduced to their primary matter. </p>
      <p>With respect to this regeneration of metals, observe well, my
        son, that the same can take place by means of the primary matter
        of metals --- i.e., mercurial water alone, and through nothing
        else in the world. For this water has the greatest affinity to
        metallic nature, so that --- after equal mixture --- it can
        never be separated from the same. </p>
      <p>Therefore have philosophers, in the <i>Turba</i> and other
        books, indicated this water, saying: Nature rejoices in Nature,
        Nature preserves, improves, unites with, reduces, and exalts
        Nature. Hence it is necessary to know how to prepare the Blessed
        Water, which water is a fiery penetrating spirit, a
        philosophical water, and the hidden key to this Art. For,
        verily, without this water all Alchemy is vain. Therefore, my
        son, remember that the whole Fundament of the Philosopher’s
        Stone consists in bringing to a new birth the primary matter of
        metals --- i.e., Mercurial Water, the perfect Corpus Solis ---
        that it be born again by water and of the spirit, just as Christ
        says: “Except a man be born again by water and the Spirit, he
        cannot see the Kingdom of God”. So also here in this art, I tell
        thee, my son: except Corpus Solis be sowed, all else is vain,
        and there will be no fruit. Even as Christ says: “except the
        Seed fall into the earth and die, it shall bear no fruit”. When,
        now, Corpus Solis has been born again through water and the
        Spirit, it grows up a purified, astral, everlasting, immortal
        body, bringing much fruit and multiplying after the manner of
        vegetables. </p>
      <p>Concerning this Roger Bacon says: I declare unto you that if
        the Astrum (Star) turn its inclination to, and impress it on,
        this clarified gold body, I can nevermore lose its virtue and
        power. For the body is perfect, composed of, and agreeable to,
        all the elements. Therefore, my son, let him not attempt this
        Art who knows not of this new birth in nature, and this bringing
        forth of metals through the water and spirit of primary matter.
        For, believe me, all else is useless, vain, and deceiving. Hence
        philosophers have written that: “Everything brings forth its
        like; and what a man sows that shall he reap”. </p>
      <p>Therefore says the Philosopher Richard, the Englishman: Sow
        gold and silver, that they, by means of Nature, may bring forth
        fruit. </p>
      <p>Hence, my son, for thy work seek no other body but gold, as
        others are all imperfect. For gold is the most perfect of
        bodies, enlightening and vivifying all others, stable in fire,
        possessing a fixed, incombustible root; and, as Bacon testifies,
        one can alter nothing in the nobility and perfection of gold, it
        being free from all natural ferment, and no substance in the
        world is more perfect. Therefore, says Isaac the Philosopher:
        “The Stone can only be extracted from a perfect body, the most
        perfect in the world. For, were this body not perfect, how
        should we extract therefrom a Stone having power to give life to
        all mortal, to purify all corrupt, to soften all harden, and
        harden all soft bodies? Verily, it were impossible to extract to
        excellent a Stone from an imperfect body! Although many attempt
        it, yet they are fools”. Therefore, my son, understand that the
        red, philosophical, Sulphur is a gold, as Richard testifies, and
        King Calid also states: “Our Sulphur is no common Sulphur, but
        is of Mercurial nature, stable, fleeing no water”. Other
        Philosophers also bear witness that their Red Sulphur is gold. </p>
      <p>Now, my son, the Sages say in their books that common gold and
        silver are not their gold or silver, since theirs are living,
        wile the common are dead, and therefore incapable of imparting
        to others the perfection they themselves are wanting in. now, my
        son, those words of the Philosophers are true; it is impossible
        for common gold or silver to perfect other imperfect bodies,
        except --- as I have said before --- the Corpus Solis and Lunae
        be born again through the Water and Spirit of Primary Matter,
        and arise as a transfigured, spiritual, clarified, externally
        fixed, subtle, penetrating body, which afterwards shall have
        power to perfect and multiply imperfect bodies. Therefore have
        our Philosophers said: For this reason are such labours
        undertaken on our Stone, that its tincture may be improved, for
        our Stone must be much more subtle and decocted than common gold
        and silver. Bernhardus says: “We therefore take this body as
        created by nature. But it is necessary to more than perfect the
        masculine body by natural art in order that in its
        more-than-perfection it may render the imperfect perfect, by its
        superabundant fertility in weight, colour, and substance. And,
        if its perfection were not greater in degree than that imparted
        by Nature, what use would our time of nine-and-a-half months
        be?”. Hence Arnoldus de Villa Nova, in his Epistle concerning
        our Stone, says: “The power and virtue and nature of gold and
        silver are in the Stone, else no gold or silver could be made.
        But the gold and silver in our Stone are better than the common,
        since the former are living. Hence Philosophers call the Stone
        their gold and silver, because the same are in it potentially
        and essentially, but not visibly”. Euclides says: “A perfect
        thing is unchangeable. For example, bread. Bread, baked and
        kneaded, is perfect in degree and nature, has attained its final
        form, and of it can be made nothing but bread. Thus also with
        philosophical gold. Hence it is impossible to perfect other
        bodies with common gold, except the perfect Corpus Solis be
        again dissolved into its primary matter, whereupon it is
        converted by our Art into a veritable Ferment or Tincture,
        philosophers saying the process is not finished until Sol and
        Luna are joined into one body. My son, understand here the Luna
        Metaphorica, not the literal, since philosophers explain Luna to
        be of a cold, moist nature, giving the same definition also to
        Mercury. Hence by Luna is understood Mercury, or Mercurial
        Water, or primary matter, which is the Philosophers’ Luna, or
        Liquor Lunae of the <i>Clangor Buccinae</i>. </p>
      <p>Now, my son, you have a short explanation why it is impossible
        to do anything in this Art, except we reduce perfect bodies, by
        philosophical fire or mercurial water, to their primary nature,
        which primary nature is a Sulphureous Water, and not Quicksilver
        as Sophists assert. For the primary matter of metals is not
        Quicksilver, by a sticky, sulphureous steam, and a viscous
        water, in which water are united in the three principles, Salt,
        Sulphur, and Mercury. Therefore it is necessary to know the
        Blessed Water of Mercury, or celestial, supernatural fire, by
        which bodies are dissolved and fused. This knowledge is the
        greatest secret and is revealed by God alone. For the
        Philosopher Bacon says: God Almighty has created man above
        Nature and all creatures --- although man is of Nature,
        excepting the Breath of God breathed into him at the creation
        --- and he shall be the lord of Nature’s works. This Divine
        Spirit fashions the mind and thoughts of man, teaching him to
        perceive the first principles of Nature. The inspired Apostle,
        St Peter, tells us that the Earth and its work shall consume
        therein, and a new world shall be born, beautiful and good, as
        is described in the Apocalypse. Thence the Philosopher concludes
        --- like St Peter --- that the elemental world can only be
        destroyed by fire. Therefore, remember in this Art that fire is
        the instrument, according to Nature’s example, and, next,
        understand further that this water, whereby Corpus Solis (gold)
        --- which, as Roger Bacon testifies, is a world perfectly
        created --- is burnt, destroyed, and melted, is not a common
        fire --- since common fire can neither burn nor destroy gold ---
        but a supernatural, inconsumable fire, which alone has power to
        burn gold and release it from its hard, rigid bonds. Also, my
        son, understand that this supernatural fire, possessing such
        power over gold and other metallic bodies, is alone the
        spiritual, sulphureous, fiery water of Mercury, in which Corpus
        Solis is fused and burnt; and, out of this melting and
        destruction, is again born and created a new world, and the
        Heavenly Jerusalem, i.e., an eternal, clarified subtle,
        penetrating, stable body, which can penetrate and perfect all
        other bodies. Hence Bacon says: “Just as a supernatural or
        elemental fire is that which disintegrates and fuses the
        elements of the whole world, and as the new Creation will be
        born from the mortal, molten elements, and will be an eternal
        Creation; even so has the Holy Trinity in the Celestial Stone
        also revealed to us a supernatural fire. My son, philosophers in
        their books have concealed this Fire, describing it in parables,
        and by countless names; in particular, they call it Mary’s Bath,
        and a horse-dung, Menstruum, Urine, Milk, Blood, Aqua Vitae,
        etc.”. Concerning this Fire, Bernhardus says: “Make a vaporous
        fire, steady, digesting, not strong, subtle, airy, clear,
        condensed, inconsumable, penetrating, and equable”. And he
        continues: “Verily, I tell thee, all wisdom is in this fire, for
        the said vaporous fire performs all things”. Hence he directs us
        to copy his words concerning this fire, word for word.
        Therefore, a wise man will easily understand that such words
        refer not to a common, but to a supernatural fire. Hence Maria
        says: “The Element Water makes white and melts bodies”.
        Concerning the preparation of this fire --- which he calls
        menstruum --- Raymundus Lullius says in his books (which are <i>Testam.


          Test. Noviss., Codicil, Anima Metallorum, Lux Mercuriorum,
          Liber Mercurius,</i> <i>Liber de Secretis Naturae, de
          Quintessentia,</i> and especially in <i>Elucidarium
          Testamenti</i>, Chap. 4: That it is not of men but of Angels
        to reveal this Celestial Fire, for therein is the greatest
        secret; and he indicates in figurative words that such Fire of
        the Sages is composed of horsedung and living chalk. What living
        chalk represents I will explain elsewhere. As to “horsedung”, I
        have already indicated that it is the water of primary matter,
        for the same is warm and moist. But it is not common horsedung,
        as many ignorantly imagine. Therefore the Philosopher Alanus
        says: “Philosophers have named the moist fire horsedung, in
        which moisture is retained the latent heat; and it is the
        property of the fire in the horse’s belly not to destroy gold,
        but to multiply it by reason of its moisture”. Alchidonius says:
        “Verily our medicine is to be hidden in horsedung, which is the
        Sages’ Fire”. And Alanus: “Dear son, be diligent in
        disintegrating, and the same must take place in gentle heat,
        that is, in tepid horsedung”. So also Arnold de Villa Nova,
        Chap. 9 (Concerning Heat), says that “the heat of horsedung is
        its fire”. And Alphidius: “Let it be boiled and buried in the
        warmth of horsedung”. Alos Aristiteles: “The Earth, or body,
        will rejoice in no strength unless sublimated by horsedung”.
        Hermes: “Roast and boil it in the warmth of the horse’s belly”.
        And Morienus: “If thou find not what thou seekest in horsedung,
        spare thyself further expense”. Arnoldus: “And seek no other
        fire but this, for this is the Sages’ Fire and Furnace. This
        water dissolves and calcines all metals, and fuses them white
        and red”. Therefore say the Turba and Senior: Our water is the
        fire, and our water is stronger than all fire, making out of
        gold a pure spirit, which natural fire cannot do, although
        natural fire also belongs to it. For or water, penetrating the
        natural metal, converts it into primary water, and afterwards
        into an earth or powder, which burns gold more tan natural fire.
        Hence gold more than natural fire. Hence Calid says: “It is
        verily a fire burning and destroying all things”. But
        philosophers have concealed the preparation of this
        philosophical water or fire, i.e., Mercurial Water. Raymundius
        Lullius has written most plainly concerning the same: “And it
        will first be necessary to purify Mercury from its external
        moisture and earthy earthiness, but not with pernicious,
        destructive things, whereby its noble, fruitful, teeming nature
        would be destroyed”. Avicenna, Arnold, Geber, Raymundus in the
        Codicil, and others, assert that Mercury is best purified by the
        sublimation of common, prepared salt. By treating the sublimate
        with hot water, the spirit of salt is dissolved out. Dry the
        sublimate, and mix with Tartaric Salt. Heat several times in a
        retort, when the Mercury will distill over vivified, and in this
        way will be somewhat freed from external moisture and
        impurities. This purgation, says Bernhardus, is not injurious,
        since the hot water and salt penetrate it not. But, my son,
        understand that Mercury cannot be thoroughly purified by
        external treatment, since it is a homogeneous, indivisible
        substance, “whose impurities penetrate its inmost being, and can
        therefore be removed by no sublimation”. Hence another means
        must here be sought, viz., that of dissolving purified
        Quicksilver and loosing its natural bonds, and changing it into
        its primary, which is a sulphureous, spiritual water. Bacon and
        Raymundus Lullius both testify that unless purification and
        solution be effected, the menstruum will not be worth a fig. </p>
      <p>When now Mercury is freed from its bond and resolved into its
        primary water, we can inwardly purify it, and, by distillation,
        separate the spirit from the water and earthy earthiness.
        Concerning which separation the philosophers have written
        mysteriously, and in particular have discovered the same
        figuratively in the distillation of wine. For in vinous
        distillation we see that the spirit of wine is mixed with much
        water and earthy impurity. But, by artificial distillation, the
        spirit can be separated from phlegmatic wateriness and earthy
        impurity, a residue remaining. From which residue, after
        calcinations, is extracted a white salt which --- added to the
        spirit, and repeatedly distilled --- produces a spirit mightily
        strengthened and sharpened by this salt of nitre. Verily the
        above is a figurative description given us by philosophers,
        which we should follow in the preparation of Mercurial Water.
        Since the same --- after disintegration and solution, i.e.,
        similarly to wine --- can, by sublimation, be separated from the
        water or phlegm, rectified, etc. And, verily, no one has written
        more clearly concerning the preparation of his Mercurial Water
        than Raymund Lullius, viz., in <i>Test. Noviss.</i>, also in <i>Liber


          Mecurorium </i>(Test. I), etc., etc., in which he plainly
        enough declares that, after putrefaction, distillation, and
        separation of philosophical spirits of wine, the spiritual water
        is again mingled into its earth, and distilled over the alembic,
        further explaining how the said philosophical wine, or
        menstruum, is sharpened and strengthened with a salt. </p>
      <p>This Water Menstruum, or philosophical spirits of wine,
        therefore, dissolves its own body, or animated Mercury, into the
        primary matter, or water, by which it can then be indefinitely
        multiplied with the help of putrefaction and distillation.
        Arnold de Villa Nova writes concerning this water thus: “There
        is a crumbling substance containing a fatty mixture, from which
        substance the master separates Philosophers’ Liquid, which is
        suitable for the work and exceedingly clear. Therein dwells the
        Fifth Essence (Quintessence) Metallically, and the same has
        affinity to metals, and in it is the Tincture to be brought
        together, as being a perfect metal, for it has within itself the
        nature of Quicksilver and of Sulphur”. </p>
      <p>I will here (although forbidden) quote <i>Rosarium
          Philosophorum</i> concerning the distillation of this
        menstruum, or water: “In the distillation of the spirit care
        must be taken, and the vessels in which thou purifiest thy
        spirit must be of glass, that the spirit find not a place to
        flow out, by reason of its quickness. For if the Red Spirit
        escape, the Artist labours in vain. Artists call the Red Spirit
        a blood, and menstruum; therefore take heed with thy vessels
        that thou collect the dry spirit with its blood by itself in a
        receptacle, without diminution of its strength, so that thou
        mayst store up the same for future use”. But, in distillation,
        seeing is more than writing. Hence nobody should be a master
        before having been a disciple. Therefore be careful in the work.
        Place a receptacle beneath, and distil first --- with gentle
        heat --- the element of water. Set the same aside, substituting
        another receptacle; close well the joints, that the spirit
        escape not, and increase the fire a little. Then will rise in
        the helmet, and distill over, a dry, yellow spirit; keep the
        fire steady while the helmet is yellow. Afterwards, when the
        helmet begins to get red, increase the fire slowly, and deep it
        so until the Red Spirit and the Blood have quite distilled out,
        passing through the helmet like clouds in the air. When the Red
        Spirit has distilled over, the helmet will become white. Then
        cease quickly, and thou hast in the receptacle the two elements,
        Air and Fire, and thus hast extracted the right dry spirit, and
        hast separated the pure from the impure. Behold, thou hast now
        the primary matter of metals, having thus separated the pure
        from the impure! Behold, thou hast now the water in which all
        metals have their origin, which is of all metals the root! Hence
        are they dissolved into water, even as frozen ice is resolved
        into water, since the same clearly was water in the first place.
        Therefore marvel not at this, for all things upon earth have
        their root in water. Oh, how many are there that, working, never
        think of this root, which is the key of the whole work? The same
        immediately dissolves bodies, is father and mother, opens out
        and locks up, and reduces bodies to their primary matter. It
        dissolves bodies, coagulating itself with them, and the Spirit
        of the Lord is led forth upon the Water, i.e., the strength of
        the spirit is seen to be active therein, and this takes place
        when the body is placed in this water. And the philosopher adds:
        “Behold the base thing with which our Sanctuary has been opened!
        For it is a ting well known by everyone; ye, he who understands
        it not finds it seldom or never. The wise man keeps it, the fool
        throws it away, and its reduction is easy to the initiated”.
        But, my son, the freeing of this Stone, or Mercury, from its
        natural bonds, and its resolution into primary water, is the
        greatest and most secret of mysteries. And, without it, all else
        were vain, for we could not separate or extract the right spirit
        or Watery Essence that dissolves bodies. And this dissolving has
        been kept secret by all philosophers, and they have paced the
        revealing of the same in God’s hand, and have cursed the man who
        should punish it. Hence they have spoken briefly and with
        subtlety of this resolution, that the same might remain hidden
        from the ignorant. But, thou, my son, observe that such
        resolution of Animated Mercury can hardly be effected without
        the proper means (coagulation). But, observe further, that here
        are not to be used sophistical means, like those used by
        ignorant fools who, reducing common Mercury to water by
        sophistical contrivances, vainly imagine they possess the true
        water. They sublime Mercury with all manner of corrosive salts
        and vitriols (whereby the sublimate generates Spirits of Salt),
        and, afterwards, dissolve the sublimate into water in a bath,
        cellar, and otherwise. They also make it into a water by means
        of Salmiac, herbs, soaps, aquafortis, with strange vessels, and
        such like sophistical methods, which are, altogether, great
        phantasy, foolishness, and vanity; and then they imagine they
        can again separate such things from Mercurial Water, and thus
        obtain the true water desired of philosophers. But all is false,
        and they find not what they seek. And the cause of their failure
        is their neglect of the teaching of philosophers, who plainly
        declare that it should be mixed with no foreign matter.
        Bernhardus says in his Epistle: When Mercury is dried by Salt,
        Aquafortis, or other thing, it is no more suitable for
        philosophical work; for, dried by Salts, Alums, and Aquafortis,
        it dissolves not any more. But, thou, my son, remember what I
        now tell thee, and what philosophers have, in their books.
        Revealed to the understanding, that this water is to be prepared
        with no foreign matter in the world, but alone by Nature, with
        Nature, and out of Nature. These are to the understanding plain,
        clear words, which I will not in this place explain more at
        length, but will embody them in a Treatise. Yet as an aid to
        memory give you the following verses: </p>
      <p>Take it fresh, pure, living white and clear, <br>
        Then bind firmly both hands and feet <br>
        With the very strongest cords, <br>
        That it suffocate and die. <br>
        In the closed House of Putrefaction, <br>
        According to nature’s example, <br>
        Let the same Nature dissolve it <br>
        Into the same Nature dissolve it <br>
        Into pure and beautiful primary matter. <br>
        Then shall it be a living, spiritual Fount, <br>
        Flowing from heaven pure and clear; <br>
        Eating its own flesh and blood, <br>
        Whereby it is multiplied. </p>
      <p>He who, by Divine Aid, has attained this Blessed Water, let him
        praise God; for he holds in his hands the key with which he can
        unlock the treasure houses containing gold, silver, precious
        stones, honour, power, and health. This Blessed Water is by
        philosophers called Pluto’s Daughter, having power over al
        treasures. She is also called the white, pure, tender, undefiled
        Virgin Bega, without whom no bringing forth nor mingling can
        take place. Therefore have philosophers married this pure,
        tender Virgin to Gabricus, that she might bear fruit; and
        Gabricus, having known her, died. Bega, by reason of her great
        love, swallowed and devoured her great love, swallowed and
        devoured him, as Aristotelese cleverly shews in Turba
        Philosophurum; and Bernhardus in his Practica says: “The fount
        is to the king as a mother, whom she bears within herself, and
        kills him. But the king rises again, and becomes so strong that
        no man can wound him”. Hence philosophers say: “Although the
        king is, before the world, more precious and worthy than Bega,
        yet alone can he bear no fruit”. This Virgin and Blessed Water
        have philosophers in their books called by a thousand names, as
        a Heaven, Celestial Water, Heavenly Rain, Heavenly or May Dew,
        Water of Paradise, Aqua Regia, Corrosive Aqua Fortis, a sharp
        vinegar and brandy, a Quintessence of Wine, a waxy green juice,
        a waxy Mercury, a water becoming green, and Green Lion, a
        Quicksilver, a Menstruum, a Blood and Mesntruum, urine and
        horse-urine, Milk, and Virgin’s Milk, white <i>Arsenic</i>,
        Silver, a moon and a humour of the moon, a woman and woman’s
        seed, a sulphureous, steamy water and smoke, a fiery burning
        spirit, a mortal penetrating poison, a basilisk which kills
        everything, an envenomed worm, a poisonous snake, a dragon, a
        poisonous serpent which devours its offspring, a strong fire,
        and a clear fire, a fire of horse dung and horse dung, a sharp
        salt and sal armoniac, a saltary and common salt, a sharp soap,
        lye, and viscous oil, an ostrich-stomach which devours and
        digests an eagle, a vulture and hermetic bird, a seal and vessel
        of Hermes, a smelting and calcining stove. Innumerable other
        names of beasts, birds, vegetables, waters, humours, of milk, of
        blood, and of men have been given to it. Philosophers have
        spoken of it in their books, moreover, in a figurative manner,
        that such a water should be made out of such things, and all the
        fools who have sought it in such things, have never found the
        desired water. </p>
      <p>But, know this, my dearest son, that it is only made out of
        live Mercury, and from no other foreign thing in the world. The
        philosophers have given it these many names in order hat the
        unwise may never know it. And you, my son, will have concluded
        the first part of this treatise, when you understand and know,
        that without this fire all the toil of the whole world and of
        alchemy is mere loss, and all alchemical processes are a
        delusion, unprofitable and false. For the Great Rosary says:
        “The receipt consists of only one thing, and with this key all
        the books of the philosophers are particularly and universally
        closed, and surrounded and guarded as with a strong wall. He who
        has no yet acquired the key can never enter the fortified
        castle, or obtain anything profitable. For this water is the one
        only key for opening the metallic walls. Further, this water is
        the strong aquafortis which Isaac refers to in his fragmentary
        work, and wherewith he dissolved bodies and made them spiritual.
        Therefore, diligently note, all alchemical work without this is
        only lies and falsify, whether metallic, mineral, vegetable, or
        animal substances are used. It is dissolved, sublimated,
        distilled, calcinated, extracted, mixed, compounded, as one
        will. One may dissolve it in cellars, in the bath, in dung, in
        aquafortis, and in all manner of strong waters, in every
        possible way, as the alchemical processes direct. We may make
        oil, water, lime, powder, black, white, yellow, and red. We may
        burn it, we may melt it in any possible fashion, even as the
        alchemical receipts tell us, and call it the true means for
        making gold and silver, yet from beginning to end it is
        abomination and falsity. I myself, with my own hands (for once I
        disbelieved this), have experienced such loss and damage. </p>
      <p>Therefore, my son, be fully warned against the sophistry of
        Alchemy and all sophisticating, deceitful people. Beware of them
        as you would beware of the devil who works mischief. Avoid them
        as an impure, pitiless, and consuming fire, even as a deadly
        poison, for a man comes to destruction of both body and soul,
        honour, goods, through this sophistry and self-insinuating false
        Alchemy. It is worse than the devil himself, for it is possible
        to expend (the wealth of) a whole kingdom thereon; yet
        everything is destroyed, and no fundamental truth is found out.
        Accordingly, open your eyes. Recognize the only key; avoid
        falsity, for it is impossible in any other way to obtain
        anything true or profitable, save in that way which I have now
        shewn in this book. </p>

      <p>I do not personally know who the exceedingly propitious and
        beloved reader of the remarkable foregoing treatise may be, but
        I communicate what I have obtained to you, and would fain that
        the other portion of the small book were also forthcoming, and
        entirely printed. You will not, however, think that I withhold
        it from jealousy, as is the common case with others in their
        editions of such philosophical tracts. But because I have
        communicated to you the mercurial water and permanent water,
        wherein chiefly consists the key of this Art, and his has been
        done in a useful and faithful manner, I will give the further
        processes requisite in my other volume --- <i>Thesaurinella
          Aurea Olympica Tripartita</i>, which will come out next
        Easter, and will contain a collection of the writing of the
        Philosophers, printed for the first time, concerning the Blessed
        Stone of the Wise, so that you will have sufficient and useful
        instruction to your heart’s desire, and will know how to thank
        me for it. When I get the other part I will not keep it from

      </p>
      <p>Wilt thou, by God’s grace alone. <br>
        Obtain the Stone of the Philosophers? <br>
        If so, seek it no in vegetables or animals, <br>
        In sulphur, quicksilver, and minerals; <br>
        Vitriol, alum, and salt are of no value; <br>
        Lea, tin, iron, and copper profit nothing; <br>
        Silver and gold have no efficacy. <br>
        Hyle or Chaos will accomplish it all. <br>
        It is enclosed in our salt spring, <br>
        In the tree of the Moon and of the Sun. <br>
        I call it the Flower of Honey, <br>
        The Flower known to the Wise. <br>
        In fine, the Flower and Honey <br>
        Are the Sulphur and Quicksilve of the Wise, <br>
        Even water and earth, <br>
        With the whitish seed of all metals. <br>
        The water is volatile, the earth fixed; <br>
        One can effect nothing without the other, <br>
        Both are born of a root having a white exterior. <br>
        It produces all the virtues of the metals, <br>
        Yet it is not dug from the ore <br>
        Either with pickaxes or other instruments. <br>
        In the place and spot where our Matter is found <br>
        No other metal whatever exists. <br>
        It is produced, with its virtue and efficacy, <br>
        In Hyle or Chaos alone. <br>
        Homer knew it well, and called it Moly. <br>
        This, in its proper condition, <br>
        Has a root altogether black. <br>
        The god Mercury offered it to Ulysees, <br>
        Even unto Ulysses in his wanderings, <br>
        As a precaution against the sorcery of Circe. <br>
        The gods also have bestowed it upon man <br>
        As a singularly great gift, <br>
        Designed to assuage and comfort him. <br>
        Hence springs pleasing nectar, <br>
        The drink of the goddeses. <br>
        It is also termed Chelidonia, <br>
        As a singular gift of Heaven. <br>
        Solar Root is another name. <br>
        The root is known to the wise: <br>
        It receives high honours in astronomy, <br>
        Is metaphorically likened to the planets, <br>
        Lead, tin, copper, and iron, <br>
        Silver and gold, everything the wise have named. <br>
        In the tongue of Chaldea it is also called Azoth; <br>
        In German it is a blessed spirit; <br>
        In Latin, argent vive animate, <br>
        That is to say, Mercury of the Philosophers. <br>
        It is also named the herb Adrop, <br>
        A well-known Chaldean word, <br>
        Signifying in our speech Saturn. <br>
        Astronomically speaking, I must say <br>
        That Saturn rules the earth. <br>
        Metaphorically is our matter compared, <br>
        Being the Red Lead and Red Earth, <br>
        With Fools despised and valueless. <br>
        It is called the Red and Green Lion. <br>
        It is well known as the Adamic Earth --- <br>
        A skillful production of the Wise Creator, <br>
        Which doth contain and unite in one mass <br>
        The powers of all natures. <br>
        From this mass and red earth, <br>
        Almighty God creates Adam. <br>
        He has highly honoured our first father, <br>
        Who is also called Microcosmus. <br>
        You are to recognize the Red Earth as Adam; <br>
        We call it the First Matter. <br>
        Later on, I will likewise disclose its preparation. <br>
        With great courage kill the lion; <br>
        But take its coagulated blood, <br>
        The brilliancy of gold and its costliness, <br>
        Separated from the center of putrefying earth; <br>
        Dissolve it with the greatest diligence; <br>
        Imitate the Creator of Nature so wise, <br>
        Who will vouchsafe to enlighten our understanding, <br>
        That we may separate the dry from the moist. <br>
        Thus water is produced from earth, <br>
        The volatile from the fixed, <br>
        The animated spirit on the earth. <br>
        Water and earth, two invisible elements, <br>
        Have, by God’s grace and care, <br>
        Fire and air concealed within them. <br>
        They are also purely impregnated <br>
        With the fifth invisible nature. <br>
        But, to proceed to the end of the work, <br>
        Marry the woman with the man, <br>
        Our Adam with clear Eve, <br>
        Both being absolutely naked, <br>
        For then Nature herself, being clean and pure, <br>
        Rejoices with her own nature. </p>
      <p>The animated spirit dissolves the body, <br>
        The body coagulates the spirit. <br>
        This is the sole Mercury, <br>
        Which is the Foundation of the Stone of the Wise. <br>
        It becomes black, white, green, and red, <br>
        Is itself Proteus, the God of the sea, <br>
        Who, being caught, so wondrously <br>
        Transforms himself into a thousand shapes; <br>
        That is, it dissolves and coagulates itself, <br>
        Sublimates and calcines, <br>
        Mortifies and vivifies, <br>
        Washes and incerates, <br>
        Clarifies and fixes. <br>
        In all these things <br>
        Heaven and earth are concerned, <br>
        And the Sun and the Moon <br>
        Become dark and black as a raven: <br>
        Heaven and earth are melted quite away: <br>
        Truly, in the Hyle or Chaos <br>
        There is a most wonderful strife <br>
        Of the elements in all directions. <br>
        Water covers all the earth, <br>
        But, in order that the moist may become dry, <br>
        Our strong giants maintain <br>
        Incessant and unwearying contests <br>
        With our wondrously small dwarf, <br>
        Who, finally, by divine miracle, <br>
        Conquers and overcomes <br>
        And captures them all, both slays and binds. <br>
        Out of the destroyed rubbish <br>
        God creates a new Heaven and Earth. <br>
        The New Jerusalem is built <br>
        With transparent clear gold, <br>
        Also with pure precious stone. <br>
        Here is placed the famed Stone of the Wise, <br>
        The Unique bird, the good Phoenix, <br>
        Who by the glow of the fire <br>
        Is slain and born again, <br>
        And becomes a real Salamander, <br>
        Who now lives in the fire. <br>
        This is the filius solis, child of the sun, <br>
        Who with his singular power <br>
        Works miracles and great wonders, <br>
        And can expel all sicknesses <br>
        In human and metallic bodies, <br>
        With glorified body, flesh and blood, <br>
        He purifies all that is corporeal. <br>
        The immortal Adam, highly endowed, <br>
        Tinges common gold and silver, <br>
        So that they thereby may become fruitful, <br>
        To bear their blessed likeness on the Earth. </p>

      <p><i>Question the First.</i> </p>
      <p>All things are compounded in triads; <br>
        They also rejoice in thenuber four, <br>
        Yet they resolve themselves into unity, <br>
        For otherwise nothing could exist. <br>
        It is indeed a subtle vapour, <br>
        And proceeds from Divine favour. <br>
        Tell me, then, what is this art? </p>
      <p><i>First Answer.</i> </p>
      <p>A point which suddenly goes in a circle, <br>
        Wherein quadrant and triangle sand: <br>
        If you obtain it, you have the secret, <br>
        And escape poverty, want, and peril. </p>
      <p><i>Question the Second.</i> </p>
      <p>I am sprung from four. <br>
        Your war harasses and slays me, <br>
        Could I but end this war, <br>
        Then my soul would never depart from me. <br>
        Your war destroys the green grass. <br>
        Alas for advice! What good does that? </p>
      <p><i>Second Answer.</i> </p>
      <p>If you desire to unite the evil four, <br>
        That they may no depart from one another <br>
        Under the test of fire, then make them fire. <br>
        Thus you will possess a treasure richer far <br>
        Than Charles of Ghent could count, <br>
        Although he were a rich man. </p>
      <p><i>Question the Third.</i> </p>
      <p>At first, there were four, <br>
        Yet now are there only three. <br>
        Before, there were five, <br>
        Yet release the fourth; <br>
        Otherwise we cannot use them. <br>
        Instruct me, what kind of being is this? </p>
      <p><i>Third Answer.</i> </p>
      <p>One and four compose five completely, <br>
        But three and one make a bad four. <br>
        If you wish to reduce the three to unity, <br>
        And cannot, then make it nothing. </p>
      <p><i>Question the Fourth.</i> </p>
      <p>Who is it, whose war is readily <br>
        But with secrecy prepared? <br>
        Yet there cannot be war without warriors: <br>
        I need four of them for this strife. <br>
        Instruct me, now, where are there such people? </p>
      <p><i>Fourth Answer.</i> </p>
      <p>From the green meadows <br>

        Proceed our dwarfs. <br>
        Vesuvius and Etna furnish us <br>
        With the children of the fire. <br>
        The deep waters produce our nymphs; <br>
        Our water is not disagreeable. <br>

        Drinking with gusto a sour wine, <br>
        Ogling also a beautiful woman, <br>
        Whom they regard with looks of live. <br>
        This love befools their bodies, <br>
        So eagerly desire they the woman. <br>
        These men will expound thy questions, <br>
        And quickly answer the same. <br>

      </p>
      <p>Well-beloved Friend, Brother, and Reader, since this book is
        coming to an end, I have obtained the following description of
        the potable gold from my dear and most trusted friend, John
        George Cressius, citizen of Heidelburg, and lover of chemistry.
        He wishes me to append to it the statement that it is the work
        of Theophrastus. I cannot say for certain that it belongs to our
        dear Teacher, since many processes and writing appear among the
        lovers of Alchemy bearing his names, but such as he would never
        have though of writing in such a fashion. However this may be,
        may I prove not unpleasing to thee that I place after it a
        remarkable instructive tract of Dom. Jacob Montanus, Doctor at
        Konigsburg, Prussia. The treatise deals with the efficacious
        administration of the glorious antidote called potable gold, the
        highly desirable, universal medicine for all diseases. Take this
        Pandora for the present, and be welcome to it. As to what may be
        wanting in it, I will send thee it in our Olympic Golden
        treasure, to be printed at Frankfort, as also in our New Olympic
        Rosary, which, as an appendix to the Golden Fleece, is to appear
        a Basle, if God will, this Easter. If I find that this work
        which I dedicate to thee is acceptable, thou wilt see next
        Michaelmas, and the following Easter, four or five additional
        tracts, by ancient and modern writers, concerning the
        Philosopher’s Stone, if it be God’s will, if it please thyself,
        and the publisher sufficiently renumerates me. Vale. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Take an old Hungarian wine which has not been drawn off, but
        still remains on its stand, and is already clear, the older the
        better, and extract its spirit. At first there goes up a little
        phlegm, and shews itself with streaks. When the rectified
        spirits ascend, no streaks are to be seen, and when these
        recommence, and the evaporation leaves off, distill the spirit
        again, and leave a little behind; this is now phlegm. Repeat the
        process ix or seven times, in each case leaving a little behind,
        until the spirits be quite separated from their phlegm. </p>
      <p><b>Test for the Spirits ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take a small and fine linen cloth, moisten it with any spirit,
        set fire to the cloth, and when it is completely consumed, the
        spirit of wine is rectified. Next, drop in a drop of olive oil,
        as the spirit falls from the stand to the bottom, and remains on
        the bottom, as fast as one stirs up; then you will have
        completely and rightly distilled the spirit of wine. </p>
      <p>After this, take the extracted phlegm and distil it very
        slowly; at first a little spirit will evaporate; you may keep
        the same to drink; continue to distill the phlegm slowly, and
        there will remain at the bottom a beautiful white earth. Keep
        this, as also the phlegm; next, distill the remaining phlegm
        about tow measures; keep the phlegm, for it will serve you for
        the first phlegm. Afterwards, completely distill the matter; a
        black substance will remain at the bottom, smelling as
        offensively as pitch, while the black matter is still moist, In
        order to pour it out, pour it into a retort and distill it very
        slowly, when phlegm will at first arise; throw this away, and
        when the oil begins to dissipate, put it into another
        receptacle; distill the oil slowly, and carefully preserve it.
        After this, destroy the retort; take out the black matter; break
        it into pieces as large as beans; let a potter construct you a
        vessel shaped a Wallenburgian box, with a lid; put the black
        earth therein; elutriate the box well, and let it dry. Place it
        in a fire, at first gentle, afterwards strong, for his purpose
        covered with coals. Let it remain in this condition 12 hours;
        then let the fire cool so that the matter may become cold.
        Afterwards, put it on again, and calcine it as at first. Then
        the matter will become beautifully white like paper; pound it
        small; pour upon it some of the phlegm which I gave instructions
        should be kept hot; let it stand 24 hours, when a salt will be
        extracted from the earth; pour it away from its dregs, and again
        pour another phlegm upon it; then let it stand 24 hours while
        more salt is being extracted. Repeat the process till the
        extraction ceases. Then throw away the remaining earth, which
        looks like sand. After this, extract the phlegm, and a beautiful
        white salt will remain. Repeat the process six or seven times,
        so that it retains the moisture; otherwise it will not receive
        the spirit of wine. </p>
      <p>Now, pour upon the salt a little spirit of wine; shake it well;
        pour it into a phial in such a way that the spirit of wine may
        pass over it to the breadth of two or three little fingers. Then
        let it stand two months putrefying and the spirit of wine will
        acquire a beauteous red colour, and become even as an oil. After
        this, take as much gold from the goldbeater as you wish, put it
        in a phial, pour the spirit of life upon it, wherein its salt is
        dissolved; let it stand for about three months in a moderate
        heat, and the red will turn into a beautiful yellow, and will
        extract the soul of the sun into itself. Pour this away. Distill
        it by means of the alembic, and the spirit of the sun will arise
        with the spirit of water, and will be potable medicine. Its salt
        will remain behind, which you may keep. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">On the Power, Operation, and Exceedingly
            Beneficial Use of the Glorious Antidote Termed Potable Gold.</font></b></center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The worthies of antiquity, before as after Christ, have, with
        the greatest diligence, laboured in most searching enquiry and
        investigation into the nature of and concerning the property and
        potent efficacy which reside deeply hidden in gold, which also
        innumerable writings on the subject serve to demonstrate. </p>
      <p>Now, it is not without reason that their zeal has caused them
        to labour and toil so wearily, because they have seen that the
        greatest constant of all God’s earthly creation s lies hidden in
        gold, which by no element can be destroyed or broken without
        extraordinary skill. All other creatures, as silver, precious
        stones, pearls, corals, spices, vegetables, and all kinds of
        herbs, howsoever named, although Divinely endowed every one with
        great power and virtue, cannot, notwithstanding, resist fire and
        the other elements, but yield and are destroyed. </p>
      <p>In consequence, our ancient worthy men have made a
        commencement, and sought in many ways, and at great cost,
        wherewith, and by what means, the said noble creature of God
        might be compelled to yield its infinite power and virtue to
        succour human health, and become indisputable theirs. Many
        industrious investigators have diligently asked God for
        understanding, so as to arrive at the end they desire. Many,
        however, and the majority, have thought to force the sun by
        disgusting things, corrosive salt, urine, Mercury, and the like,
        but have accomplished nought, since, using, as aforesaid,
        noxious medicines, which cannot be employed without harm and
        damage. </p>
      <p>Thus, these unskillful workers, ignorant of the nature and
        property of this gold, can accomplish nothing, either by fire or
        any other way, and in consequence imagine that it is impossible
        to force the gold without the corrosives, and to reduce it to a
        potable gold. </p>
      <p>Yet is it manifest that God Almighty has created all creatures
        in the water and on earth solely for the use of man, and has
        appointed man as the ruler of them all. Hence it follows that
        there exists nothing so trifling and mean, but, applied
        externally or internally, it may be put to a medicinal use. </p>
      <p>However, the noble metal and medicine is never, as many
        suppose, to be sought in acids; still less from other species of
        metals can it be extracted, even with the aid of fire, for it
        resists all this, but must be compelled by a special subtlety,
        and be changed from its first form and metallic nature.
        Afterwards its power and virtue are extracted by means of a
        pure, specially prepared spirit of wine, in the same way as
        noxious herbs, without the use of any corrosive whatever. The
        potable gold prepared with corrosives cannot be used without
        great harm and damage. </p>
      <p>As to how, and in what manner, the sages thought that gold
        could be compelled to yield its power and virtue, a thing most
        people deem impossible, I ought to reveal to every considerate
        man, though, notwithstanding, little thanks will be gained, even
        when I have appealed to the uprightness of my life, and though
        the expenses I have incurred should be considered. I have no
        hesitation whatsoever to point it out, and thereby openly
        dissipate all suspicion. Consequently, I have, as soon as
        possible, made a short relation concerning the preparation,
        whereby anyone may know for whom this, my already prepared
        Potable Gold, may be used, in that it is prepared without any
        corrosive matter, and can be used with no risk whatever as a
        universal medicine in all serious maladies. </p>
      <p>Know, in the first place, that before the medicine can be
        properly used in long-standing sicknesses and weaknesses, it is
        necessary that the body be purified by proper medicines, as a
        learned and skillful physician directs. For with regard to
        sudden dangerous sickness, as apoplexy, epilepsy, cordialgia,
        syncope, tremor codis, and the like, it is permissible to use
        the tincture at once; yet in the case of such severe dangerous
        illnesses, when the attack itself is allayed, it is well, before
        further employment of this tincture of gold, that the body be
        none the less previously purified. </p>
      <p>In the next place, we must be careful concerning the amount of
        the dose, to avoid administering too much or too little; it is
        beneficial to give a full-grown adult guttae, or small drops. A
        person half-grown takes five or six; a child but one drop. The
        distilled water or wine that accompanies the dose must not
        exceed a single spoonful. </p>
      <p>In the third place, in the case of chronic sicknesses, it
        should be daily, early in the morning and about five or six at
        night, after four or five hours fasting. When necessity
        requires, and the sickness has obtained a firm hold, it may be
        used thrice a day, that is to say, in the morning, between the
        two meals, two hours before dinner, and in the evening, two
        hours after supper. If the patient wishes to sleep, no further
        meal must be taken for two hours. This daily use must be kept up
        8 or 14 days, according to the nature of the disease. </p>
      <p>In the fourth place, it is necessary that potable gold be taken
        with things appropriate to it. We must regard the qualities,
        effects, and position of the same; for this reason, various
        accompaniments are suitable. It must be used to allay pain of a
        headache with water of betony. In case of giddiness, balm is
        necessary. Insomnia requires aqua vitae, betony, or marjoram
        water. Apoplexy requires water with extract of lavender; also
        place separately two or three drops at first on the tongue. The
        same quantity is used for paralysis. For a bad memory use a
        decoction of the roots of fennel and acorns. </p>
      <p>Melancholy, sadness, and similar emotions of the mind, which
        are especially seated in the head, require betony and peony
        water, together with the potable gold, or liquor of oak
        mistletoe, but never anything hot, for this fills and oppresses
        the head. Should the malady arise from feverish blood, use water
        of common fumitory. Borage water dissipates and wards off all
        weakness and feebleness of the head, and preserves the
        constitution. </p>
      <p>In epilepsy, or falling sickness, the potable gold must be used
        with peony water, or with a decoction of the root of peony, or
        with a decoction of the root of peony, collected while the moon
        wanes; in the case of an old or full-grown man, at the beginning
        of the paroxysm. The same is required when the paroxysm has
        ceased. A child of a year or 18 months, and of corresponding
        size, must be given one drop. A very young child must, a the
        commencement, middle and end of the attack, only have the point
        of its tongue smeared by means of a piece of wood dipped in
        olive oil. Continue the application till the epilepsy ceases
        altogether. In cases of opthalmia, or abscess in the eye, use
        fennel, swallow-wort, or xeropthalmia water. For catarrh and
        rheum add violet root water. For toothache drop a little into
        the tooth. For bleeding of the nose, scabious or plantain water
        must be used. For phthisis or constipation use honey water or
        milk. For ulcer of the lungs, take water wherein crabs have been
        caught, well corrected, for offensive breath, orthopnoea, and
        other cold and rheumy diseases, use water of Marrubius, hyssop,
        fennel, and the like. In cases of trembling or palpitating of
        the heart, use balm or borage water. With pains of the stomach
        use balm mint water, or a decoction of balm mint. </p>
      <p>In fainting or heaviness place one or two drops on the tongue,
        with borage or sorrel water. For the iliac passion, or twisting
        of the guts, use plantain water. For the worm use a decoction of
        zedoary. In costiveness, pain or swelling of the liver, or
        dropsy, where external heat is the cause, use plantain or
        liverwort water. When the illness is occasioned by cold, use a
        decoction of spikenard and of cinnamon, for it removes the
        obstruction. In costiveness of the spleen use ash-tree water. In
        melancholy the potable gold must be administered with temperate,
        not with cold or hot, things, but with fumitory water, young
        hops, or nettlemoth water, or with liquor cornucervus, also with
        rose sugar, syrup of betony, after a slight purgation of the
        melancholy and morbid humour has been effected by the syrup of
        epithimum and cichorium, which humour produces the obstruction.
        Otherwise, the virtues of this potable gold would be
        extinguished and frustrated. This must also be understood of
        other medicinal extracts. For pain in the stones and the
        kidneys, use aquatic nut water, radish water, pimpernel water,
        or philanthorpist’s powder. In case of strangury or injury to
        the reins, employ fresh goat’s milk. With rupture use a species
        of woundwort or common comfrey water. In obstruction or
        retention of the menstrual course, taking place not only in the
        matrix but in all other parts of the body whence the matrix
        receives its nourishment, the channels which convey nourishment
        are choked up. Since there is no nutriment in the uterus, there
        is also no menstrual excrement, and alarming symptoms supervene.
        The potable gold, however, is most excellent in removing this
        evil, wine mixed with herbs being employed for a week, twice or
        thrice daily, early in the morning, and at night, about four or
        five drops being used at a time. It is a marvelous secret in the
        case of any menstrual flow, ensuring proper regularity. Women
        take it, as Theophrastus and others witness, even when 50 or 60.
        Moreover, because the potable gold sets right the flow of the
        white and red, not restraining it like the ordinary astringents,
        but separating the bad from the good, it assists Nature to expel
        the bad, retaining what is good for the nourishment of the
        uterus; it is utilized in suffocation of the uterus, as the case
        requires, with wormwood water, orange peel water, endive,
        wormwood, salt, etc. The potable gold is also used with wormwood
        in cases of difficult birth. For sterility, water of Neptune or
        lavender is required. In cases of gout of the foot or the hand,
        burning water, or water of paralysis, or lavender water, is
        necessary. </p>
      <p>When there is plague, it is good, if the malady and falling
        sickness permit, previously to administer a lenitive of cassia,
        manna, and the like, according as one ascertains from the
        symptoms what humour has infected the body and rules it,
        afterwards employing the potable gold with other purgatives. In
        cases of putrid fever, arising from humours, as takes place in a
        mild pestilence, antiseptics must be taken. When the
        putrefaction abounds in humours, then the appropriate lenitives
        must be used, but nothing acid. These humours must be dealt with
        in this manner since they would hinder the operation of potable
        gold. Various accidents originate them. We have here given the
        best instruction how the poison may be warded off, either by
        perspiration or vomit. Therefore this potable gold is in this
        case used with lemon water, liquor of Carduus Beneditus,
        sandalwood, sag’s head, syrup from the acidity of lemons, with
        water of citron, conserve of roses, of borage, water germander,
        in cases of heated paroxysms and with a warm condition of the
        body, etc. But if the heat were moderate, and the poison were
        situated in cold humour, it would be properly administered with
        theriacal water of pimpernel, vervain, angelica, and
        pomegranate. Moreover, pearls, corals, and salt of absinth may
        be added. </p>
      <p>In the case of gangrene, fistula, itches, the potable gold with
        aqua pedis Columbini and sorrel water, externally and internally
        used, has healing efficacy. As for poison, it preserves those
        who are poisoned or been by a mad dog. It cures them with white
        tormentil or snake’s root water. </p>
      <p>The gold must be administered in the case of quatrain and other
        fevers with water of Cpaones, theriacal water, water of Carduus
        Benedictus, or a sufficient decoction of the root of fennel,
        pimpernel, and salt of absinth. It is generally given at the
        commencement of the paroxysm, Perspiration must, if possible,
        follow. </p>
      <p>In certain complaints of the belly we require water of the
        dodder of thyme, fumitory water, with liquor in water
        Garyophyllorum Maris, with a decoction of Vincitoxicus and of
        Camaedius, with a syrup of the acidity or the juice of lemons.
        Finally, it may be used against all maladies which are formally
        named by physicians. Yet we must be careful that, together with
        these sicknesses, we take into consideration the other
        indispositions or diseases which humours originate, as when, for
        instance, heat and cold are present, that we may know the
        opportunity for using a suitable preparation. Thus the potable
        gold is powerfully conducive to preservation and cure in the
        case of miners, assayers, alchemists, goldsmiths, cannon
        founders, mint-wardens, and all those who have been poisoned
        with poisonous smoke, and especially with mercury sublimate,
        crude and precipitate, or however it may be termed. </p>
      <p>It is especially efficacious with those whose constitutions
        have been ruined by grease and fumes from the precipitate, and
        such matters. In this case the gold is accompanied with treacle
        water, scabious water, water of pimpernel, anthos with the sap
        of the holy wood, horn of sag, rhubarb, Muscat nuts, conserva
        anthos, syrup from the juice of lemons, bark of citron, of
        Mithridates, etc. We must also add, if necessary, the redness of
        pomegranate, and the pearl salt of absinth. </p>
      <p>Finally, this potable gold destroys all superfluous moisture in
        the body; when rightly used, externally and internally, it
        expels all impurities, is an excellent purgative of every
        poison, purifies the blood, not by evacuation, but passing
        imperceptibly through all the limbs, renews them, retains that
        which is good, expelling the bad, being the true tincture of the
        wise, for consuming the remains of diseases, and increasing the
        natural heat of the body, surpassing herein all other
        medicaments. It is also efficaciously employed for fistulas,
        gangrenes, and all incurable ulcers, externally applied. This
        potable gold is also used with wine for leprosy. So much for the
