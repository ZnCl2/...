      A new system devised by MIT engineers could provide a low-cost
      source of drinking water for parched cities around the world while
      also cutting power plant operating costs.<br>
      <br>
      About 39 percent of all the fresh water withdrawn from rivers,
      lakes, and reservoirs in the U.S. is earmarked for the cooling
      needs of electric power plants that use fossil fuels or nuclear
      power, and much of that water ends up floating away in clouds of
      vapor. But the new MIT system could potentially save a substantial
      fraction of that lost water — and could even become a significant
      source of clean, safe drinking water for coastal cities where
      seawater is used to cool local power plants.<br>
      <br>
      The principle behind the new concept is deceptively simple: When
      air that’s rich in fog is zapped with a beam of electrically
      charged particles, known as ions, water droplets become
      electrically charged and thus can be drawn toward a mesh of wires,
      similar to a window screen, placed in their path. The droplets
      then collect on that mesh, drain down into a collecting pan, and
      can be reused in the power plant or sent to a city’s water supply
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The system, which is the basis for a startup company called
      Infinite Cooling that last month won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship
      Competition, is described in a paper published today in the
      journal Science Advances, co-authored by Maher Damak PhD ’18 and
      associate professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi.
      Damak and Varanasi are among the co-founders of the startup, and
      their research is supported in part by the Tata Center for
      Technology and Design.<br>
      <br>
      Varanasi’s vision was to develop highly efficient water recovery
      systems by capturing water droplets from both natural fog and
      plumes of industrial cooling towers. The project began as part of
      Damak’s doctoral thesis, which aimed to improve the efficiency of
      fog-harvesting systems that are used in many water-scarce coastal
      regions as a source of potable water. Those systems, which
      generally consist of some kind of plastic or metal mesh hung
      vertically in the path of fogbanks that regularly roll in from the
      sea, are extremely inefficient, capturing only about 1 to 3
      percent of the water droplets that pass through them. Varanasi and
      Damak wondered if there was a way to make the mesh catch more of
      the droplets — and found a very simple and effective way of doing
      so.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for the inefficiency of existing systems became
      apparent in the team’s detailed lab experiments: The problem is in
      the aerodynamics of the system. As a stream of air passes an
      obstacle, such as the wires in these mesh fog-catching screens,
      the airflow naturally deviates around the obstacle, much as air
      flowing around an airplane wing separates into streams that pass
      above and below the wing structure. These deviating airstreams
      carry droplets that were heading toward the wire off to the side,
      unless they were headed bang-on toward the wire’s center.<br>
      <br>
      The result is that the fraction of droplets captured is far lower
      than the fraction of the collection area occupied by the wires,
      because droplets are being swept aside from wires that lie in
      front of them. Just making the wires bigger or the spaces in the
      mesh smaller tends to be counterproductive because it hampers the
      overall airflow, resulting in a net decrease in collection.<br>
      <br>
      But when the incoming fog gets zapped first with an ion beam, the
      opposite effect happens. Not only do all of the droplets that are
      in the path of the wires land on them, even droplets that were
      aiming for the holes in the mesh get pulled toward the wires. This
      system can thus capture a much larger fraction of the droplets
      passing through. As such, it could dramatically improve the
      efficiency of fog-catching systems, and at a surprisingly low
      cost. The equipment is simple, and the amount of power required is
      minimal.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the team focused on capturing water from the plumes of power
      plant cooling towers. There, the stream of water vapor is much
      more concentrated than any naturally occurring fog, and that makes
      the system even more efficient. And since capturing evaporated
      water is in itself a distillation process, the water captured is
      pure, even if the cooling water is salty or contaminated. At this
      point, Karim Khalil, another graduate student from Varanasi’s lab
      joined the team.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s distilled water, which is of higher quality, that’s now just
      wasted,” says Varanasi. “That’s what we’re trying to capture.” The
      water could be piped to a city’s drinking water system, or used in
      processes that require pure water, such as in a power plant’s
      boilers, as opposed to being used in its cooling system where
      water quality doesn’t matter much.<br>
      <br>
      A typical 600-megawatt power plant, Varanasi says, could capture
      150 million gallons of water a year, representing a value of
      millions of dollars. This represents about 20 to 30 percent of the
      water lost from cooling towers. With further refinements, the
      system may be able to capture even more of the output, he says.<br>
      <br>
      What’s more, since power plants are already in place along many
      arid coastlines, and many of them are cooled with seawater, this
      provides a very simple way to provide water desalination services
      at a tiny fraction of the cost of building a standalone
      desalination plant. Damak and Varanasi estimate that the
      installation cost of such a conversion would be about one-third
      that of a building a new desalination plant, and its operating
      costs would be about 1/50. The payback time for installing such a
      system would be about two years, Varanasi says, and it would have
      essentially no environmental footprint, adding nothing to that of
      the original plant.<br>
      <br>
      “This can be a great solution to address the global water crisis,”
      Varanasi says. “It could offset the need for about 70 percent of
      new desalination plant installations in the next decade.”<br>
      <br>
      In a series of dramatic proof-of-concept experiments, Damak,
      Khalil, and Varanasi demonstrated the concept by building a small
      lab version of a stack emitting a plume of water droplets, similar
      to those seen on actual power plant cooling towers, and placed
      their ion beam and mesh screen on it. In video of the experiment,
      a thick plume of fog droplets is seen rising from the device — and
      almost instantly disappears as soon as the system is switched on.<br>
      <br>
      The team is currently building a full-scale test version of their
      system to be placed on the cooling tower of MIT’s Central Utility
      Plant, a natural-gas cogeneration power plant that provides most
      of the campus’ electricity, heating, and cooling. The setup is
      expected to be in place by the end of the summer and will undergo
      testing in the fall. The tests will include trying different
      variations of the mesh and its supporting structure, Damak says.<br>
      <br>
      That should provide the needed evidence to enable power plant
      operators, who tend to be conservative in their technology
      choices, to adopt the system. Because power plants have
      decades-long operating lifetimes, their operators tend to “be very
      risk-averse” and want to know “has this been done somewhere else?”
      Varanasi says. The campus power plant tests will not only
      “de-risk” the technology, but will also help the MIT campus
      improve its water footprint, he says. “This can have a high impact
      on water use on campus.”<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Fog collection can be a sustainable solution to water scarcity in
      many regions around the world. Most proposed collectors are meshes
      that rely on inertial collision for droplet capture and are
      inherently limited by aerodynamics. We propose a new approach in
      which we introduce electrical forces that can overcome aerodynamic
      drag forces. Using an ion emitter, we introduce a space charge
      into the fog to impart a net charge to the incoming fog droplets
      and direct them toward a collector using an imposed electric
      field. We experimentally measure the collection efficiency on
      single wires, two-wire systems, and meshes and propose a physical
      model to quantify it. We identify the regimes of optimal
      collection and provide insights into designing effective fog
      harvesting systems...<br>
      <br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b>There are more than 1.1 billion people who lack access to safe
      drinking water worldwide, according to the World Water Council
      (1). Many remote drought-prone coastal areas have little or no
      rain and prohibitively expensive water transportation costs but
      have dense fog that occurs on a regular basis (2). Fog harvesting
      is a promising solution to provide clean water in these regions.
      Areas prone to dense fog formation are usually close to oceans,
      where fog clouds form over the water and are then transported by
      the wind (3). Fog is composed of tiny droplets with a typical
      diameter of 10 μm. Researchers have designed various artificial
      fog harvesting systems, some of which mimic natural fog collection
      mechanisms in animals and plants (4–11), and have successfully
      implemented small-scale fog collectors (12–14).<br>
      <br>
      The most common design for fog collectors is a mesh that stands
      perpendicular to the fog-laden wind (13, 15–17). Upon impact,
      droplets stick to the mesh and grow as they coalesce with other
      incoming droplets. When they reach a critical size, they shed by
      gravity into a container. Meshes are used because they cause a
      smaller deviation of the incoming flow streamlines by letting air
      pass through their openings. Nevertheless, field studies have
      shown that these meshes typically have very low efficiencies of
      around 1 to 2% (17).<br>
      <br>
      The main mechanisms that limit the efficiency of mesh-based fog
      collectors are the shedding rate and the aerodynamic deviation of
      fog droplets. The shedding rate can decrease the efficiency by two
      mechanisms. Water can clog the mesh openings, making the mesh
      locally act as a plate. Re-entrainment of the droplets due to wind
      drag may also occur before these droplets are collected.
      Researchers have developed coatings to improve the shedding rate,
      but the overall efficiency of these meshes remained low, around
      10% in laboratory setups, suggesting that the main limitation is
      not the shedding rate (7, 9, 17).<br>
      <br>
      The main limitation is the aerodynamic deviation of fog droplets,
      which can occur on two scales: the mesh (aerodynamic efficiency
      ηa) and individual mesh wires (deposition efficiency ηd). The
      overall collection efficiency is η = ηaηd. ηa is the number of
      droplets directed toward the mesh wires divided by the number of
      droplets that were directed toward the collector far upstream
      (15). It depends on the shading coefficient SC (surface fraction
      of the wires), and it has been shown that an SC around 55% gives a
      maximum ηa (16, 17).<br>
      <br>
      A more significant bottleneck in the fog collection process is the
      deviation of the droplets around the individual wires. ηd is
      defined as the ratio of captured droplets to those initially
      directed toward the wire. The flow through the mesh wires can be
      modeled as a flow past a cylinder (18). Close to the cylinder of
      radius Rc, in a region of characteristic size Rc, air streamlines
      start deviating and the flow separates, as schematically shown in
      Fig. 1A. The ability of droplets to follow streamlines is
      characterized by the Stokes number, which is the ratio of the
      droplet inertia to the drag force (18). Embedded Image, where Rd
      is the droplet radius, ρw is the water density, U is the air
      speed, and ηg is the air viscosity. At low Stokes number, the
      droplet trajectories follow the streamlines closely, and few
      droplets are collected. Figure 1B and movie S1 show the air
      streamlines and droplet trajectories around a cylindrical wire for
      St = 0.05. At high Stokes number, drag forces do not affect the
      trajectories, and droplets directed toward the cylinder continue
      along their trajectories and collide with the cylinder. An
      empirical formula has been established: Embedded Image (17).
      However, large Stokes numbers require very fine meshes, which are
      difficult to fabricate and lack structural integrity. Hence, low
      deposition efficiencies remain a significant challenge in fog
      collection. <br>

      studies by the UN and the US State Department, we are on the path
      to an extreme freshwater shortage by 2030. Power plants are the
      US’s largest water consumer - power plants use 161 billion gallons
      of freshwater per day, 39% of total US freshwater withdrawals.
      Power plants typically use evaporative cooling, where a portion of
      the water is evaporated to cool the remaining water. The vapor is
      released into the atmosphere, where it forms a plume. New water
      needs to be frequently added to the cooling system to account for
      the lost water vapor. The system's remaining water becomes more
      concentrated in salts and pollutants and needs to be treated, at
      an additional cost. A single 600MW power plant will consume the
      same amount of water as 100,000 residential users and spend
      $5M/year on water alone. Infinite Cooling can help power plants
      produce reliable electricity while using significantly less water.<br>

      <b>Novel water capture technology</b><br>
      <br>
      Our patent-pending technology developed at MIT reduces water
      consumption in evaporative cooling tower systems by over 20% by
      capturing water from cooling tower plumes<br>
      Water Savings -- 20-30% reduction in total plant water consumption
      (make-up and blowdown)<br>
      Costs Savings -- $1M annual savings in water sourcing and water
      treatment costs for a 600 MW system<br>
      Plume Abatement -- 100% plume elimination on cooling towers
      retrofitted with Infinite Cooling technology<br>

      Systems and methods related to the formation of a reaction product
      on a surface are generally provided. The systems and methods
      described herein may allow for collection of the retention of a
      fluid by a surface in a relatively high amount. Such systems and
      methods may be useful in various applications including, for
      example, agriculture. In some embodiments, the systems and methods
      enhance water retention on hydrophobic surfaces of plants.
      Advantageously, the methods described herein may, in some cases,
      result in the formation of reaction products on a surface that
      serve to prevent fluids from being removed from the surface.
      Advantageously, the systems and methods described herein may
      suppress the adverse effects of natural conditions such as high
      surface energies and wind. <br>
