      SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – June 25, 2013 – Lam Aviation, Inc., has
      successfully flown a Lancair Columbia (now Cessna Corvalis)
      airframe retrofitted with a new wing equipped with a simple
      version of the Lam Aileron. Flight test and evaluation show that
      the modified aircraft realizes improved performance by every
      measure when compared to the production Corvalis. The plane will
      be on display at the Innovations Pavilion at AirVenture.<br>
      <br>
      Flight test results have demonstrated dramatic improvements in
      fuel economy, cruise performance, rate of climb and flight
      handling, including roll rate, roll authority at slow speeds and
      stall speed. The modified aircraft also has an increased useful
      load and range.<br>
      <br>
      Key test results of the airplane equipped with Lam Aileron
      include:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Improved Cruise Performance – at equivalent power settings, the
        modified airplane cruises 12-16 knots faster.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Decreased Fuel Consumption – at equivalent airspeeds, the
        modified airplane consumes 20-30 percent less fuel with
        corresponding increases in range.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Increased Rate of Climb – 40-50 percent greater rate of
        climb after modification.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Increased Useful Load – aircraft useful load increased by
        200 pounds.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Improved Flight-Handling Characteristics – roll rate is
        increased and stick forces decreased. Roll authority and
        flight-handling characteristics are improved in slow flight.</b><br>
      <br>
      Commented test pilot Len Fox, a former naval aviator and US Navy
      test pilot: “From the pilot’s perspective, operation of the Lam
      Aileron is seamless. With the Lam Aileron, a slower stall speed
      was achieved with a smaller wing. The reduction in wing area
      contributed to a higher cruise speed. It was determined that the
      horizontal tail required to provide optimum stability will also be
      smaller, resulting in yet faster cruise speeds.<br>
      <br>
      The Lam Aileron uncouples the traditional interdependent
      relationship for sizing between ailerons and flaps, allowing wings
      to be equipped with ailerons and flaps of any span, without the
      use of spoilers or flaperons. The Lam Aileron enables aircrafts to
      use smaller wings that weigh less and produce less drag, yielding
      higher cruise speeds and rates of climb, lower fuel consumption
      and improved ride comfort through turbulence, while also improving
      roll control and slow-speed flight handling. The Lam Aileron also
      allows the traditionally separate functions of flaps and ailerons
      to be mixed, providing additional functionality for more
      operations including speed brakes and drag rudders, and may offer
      more effective methods of spin avoidance and recovery.<br>
      <br>
      “Our aileron increases the range of variable geometries for
      airplanes, helping to maximize the benefits of trailing-edge
      devices like flaps and ailerons,” said Michael Lam, CEO of Lam
      Aviation. “All aircraft designs that use flaps can gain
      performance, efficiency and safety from the Lam Aileron.”<br>

      </b><b>The LAM Aileron Innovation</b><br>
      <br>
      Aero-engineers have long struggled with the inherent competition
      between conventional flaps and ailerons for space on the trailing
      edge of the wing. The mutually exclusive relationship between the
      two dictates that installation of large flaps for good slow-speed
      performance mandate small ailerons with less roll control
      authority. Alternatively, large ailerons result in small flaps.
      Previous attempts to accommodate large or full-span flaps have
      included spoilers, flaperons, and tailerons, accompanied by their
      many compromises and disadvantages.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The Lam Aileron Solution</b><br>
      <br>
      Lam Aviation’s inventive aileron uncouples the traditional
      mutually exclusive relationship between flaps and ailerons. With
      the Lam Aileron, ailerons and flaps can each be of any span,
      including full span, and their separate functions may be mixed for
      additional modes of operation, such as speed brakes.<br>

      Left wing – upper aileron panel (green) and lower auxiliary flap
      (yellow) panels comprising the Lam Aileron deflected upward
      together as a unit for a left turn at cruise with the conventional
      main flap (red) in its stowed or neutral position on the left
      wing.<br>
      <br>
      Renowned aerospace engineer, designer and builder, Greg Cole of
      Windward Performance, has retrofitted a Lancair Columbia 300
      airframe, now Cessna Corvalis, with a new wing equipped with the
      Lam Aileron. Following initial test flight and evaluation in Bend,
      Oregon, highly regarded general aviation test pilot, former Naval
      aviator and US Navy test pilot Len Fox, will fly the Lam
      Aileron-equipped Columbia to Oshkosh, Wisconsin where the new
      aileron will be on display at the 2010 EAA AirVenture Convention
      July 26-August 1, 2010.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How the Lam Aileron Works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Lam Aileron replaces the conventional aileron with two panels
      approximately one on top of the other on the trailing edge of the
      wing. Both panels are deployed as a single unit upwardly only as
      an aileron. The upper aileron panel is deflected upward only from
      the neutral position; while the lower, auxiliary flap panel is
      capable of both upward and downward deflections from the neutral
      position. The upper panel is deployed independently as an aileron
      and the lower panel is deployed independently as an auxiliary
      flap. Deflecting the Lam Aileron (either the upper aileron panel
      by itself or both the upper aileron panel and lower auxiliary flap
      panel together) upward on one side only provides a rolling moment.
      Upward deflection only for roll control makes the entire trailing
      edge available for downwardly deflected surfaces such as flaps.
      This new aileron design releases flaps and ailerons from their
      traditional interdependence for sizing on the trailing edge and
      eliminates the compromises between slow flight capability and roll
      control authority that follow while improving flight handling
      characteristics. It also allows the usual separate functions of
      flaps and ailerons to be mixed for additional operations such as
      speed brakes or drag rudders.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lam Aileron – Modes of Operation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For roll control not requiring flaps, both upper and lower panels
      may be deflected upwardly together as a unit on one wing causing
      rolling moments.<br>
      <br>
      When flaps are scheduled, the lower auxiliary flap panels are
      extended on both wings downward (and outward if of the Fowler
      type) together with the main flaps to form large or full-span
      flaps, while the upper panels continue to move upward
      independently for roll control.<br>
      <br>
      Deployment of the upper aileron panel upward and the auxiliary
      flap panel downward on one wing yields a drag rudder.<br>
      <br>
      Simultaneous deployment of drag rudders on both sides enables the
      Lam Aileron to provide air braking with differential motion of the
      upper aileron panels superimposed for roll control.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;For maximum roll control authority for highly maneuverable
      aircraft, the Lam Aileron may still be scheduled to act as a
      conventional differential aileron.<br>
      <br>
      A small number of Lam Ailerons may be installed along the trailing
      edge to replace the many flap, spoiler, and aileron panels of
      large commercial aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The Lam Aileron will be investigated for stall/spin departure
      resistance and recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FAQs:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Q: Does the Lam Aileron require new materials or manufacturing
      processes?<br>
      A: No, the Lam Aileron is not dependent on any specific materials
      or manufacturing processes. The Lam Aileron is comprised of flap
      and aileron panels not much different than conventional aileron
      and flaps. It is their application that is new and unique.<br>
      <br>
      Q: How is the Lam Aileron different from a spoiler?<br>
      A: Just as conventional ailerons are trailing-edge devices, the
      Lam Aileron is a trailing-edge device and continuously modulates
      lift as it is deflected. Spoilers are mounted mid-chord on a wing
      and serve to disrupt, dump or literally “spoil” lift and are quite
      often problematic with their non-linear response.<br>
      <br>
      Q: What are the disadvantages of the Lam Aileron?<br>
      A: The Lam Aileron is more complex mechanically. Instead of a
      single aileron panel, the Lam Aileron requires two panels that
      operate both together and independently.<br>
      <br>
      Q: What kind of aircraft would use the Lam Aileron?<br>
      A: The Lam Aileron may be incorporated into any aircraft design
      that utilizes a conventional wing and tail configuration.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Is pilot flight control changed?<br>
      A: Pilot flight control input and experience are unchanged or
      improved similar to drivers finding automobiles with power
      steering, automatic transmissions and anti-lock brakes easier and
      more secure to operate than those without.<br>
      <br>
      Q: How do the failure modes of the Lam Aileron compare to those of
      conventional ailerons?<br>
      A: They should be similar and would depend on the specific
      installation, in some cases less consequential. For example, a Lam
      Aileron may have separate actuators for the aileron panels on each
      wing instead of one interconnected set. This might give twice the
      probability of an aileron failure but is offset by the continued
      function of the other aileron while failure of the interconnected
      arrangement would disable all roll control. The Lam Aileron might
      offer more options in the case of failure or damage to flight
      control surfaces by means of more adaptive solutions through its
      wider range of variable geometries. <br>

      An aircraft aileron system unique in its construction, method of
      deployment and the functional results obtained, is comprised of
      two panels located at the rear portion of the wing, in a spanwise
      direction and aligned with the wing's trailing edge. The panels
      are independently hinged at their leading edges and rotate to make
      angular deflections with respect to the wing. The upper, aileron
      panel is restricted to upward deflection only from its neutral
      position and in operation is deployed independently as an aileron.
      The lower, auxiliary flap panel is capable of both upward and
      downward deflections from its neutral position, and is deployed
      independently downward as an auxiliary flap. Both panels are
      deployed together upwardly only as an aileron. Alternatively, the
      aileron panel may be capable only of upward deployment while the
      auxiliary flap panel is capable of downward deployment only, to
      provide a simpler aileron system. For roll control of an aircraft
      during cruise, the aileron panel on one side only is deflected up
      while the aileron panel on the other side remains in its neutral
      position. The aileron system, in conjunction with flap
      arrangements, offers multiple aircraft control function with
      advantages over past and present systems for aircraft control.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to aircraft flight control devices,
      and more particularly to wing-mounted control devices. More
      specifically, the invention relates to an improved aileron system
      especially suitable for fixed-wing aircraft which provides a
      flight control system having improved efficiency and versatility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      Immediately obvious with the invention of the airplane was the
      importance of controlling movement in flight, as an uncontrollable
      airborne airplane will soon crash. Aviators soon settled on
      ailerons for roll control. An aileron is a hinged panel on the
      trailing edge of the wing, usually located at the outboard portion
      of the wing, which, when deflected downwardly, increases the lift
      of that wing, to roll or bank the airplane into a turn. At the
      same time, the aileron on the other wing is deflected upwardly, to
      decrease the lift on that wing and thus augment the rolling
      motion. The configuration and application of the conventional
      aileron system have changed little, if at all, over more than nine
      decades since the first fixed-wing aircraft were produced.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most objectionable features of conventional aileron
      application is a phenomenon known as "adverse yaw," and virtually
      all existing fixed-wing aircraft suffer disadvantageous
      consequences associated with adverse yaw. When a turn is initiated
      with conventional ailerons, the nose of the airplane turns first
      in a direction opposite to that of the intended turn. This is
      usually compensated by using rudder deflection to "coordinate" the
      turn. The adverse yawing motion is a direct result of aileron
      application. While producing more lift to bank the airplane into a
      turn, the downwardly-deflected aileron also produces more drag,
      which acts momentarily to cause the airplane's nose to turn in the
      direction opposite to the intended turn. That is, when one wing is
      lifted relative to the other wing by operation of a conventional
      aileron to bank the airplane into a turn, it is also pulled back
      away from the turn relative to the wing on the other side, causing
      the nose initially to turn, or yaw, in the direction opposite to
      the turn. This effect becomes increasingly detrimental as the roll
      rate increases and/or airspeed decreases.<br>
      <br>
      Adverse yaw produced by the conventional aileron contributes to
      spin entry. Instinctive application of conventional ailerons
      during attempted spin recovery merely aggravates the spin
      condition. When spinning, an airplane is descending and turning in
      a tight spiral flight path. The conventional aileron is not
      effective in spin recovery. In a left hand spin, for instance, the
      left wing is down and toward the center of the spiral.
      Instinctively, many pilots are tempted to initiate right stick or
      control yoke movement to roll towards the right and out of the
      spin. With conventional ailerons this will deploy the left aileron
      down and the right aileron up. The left aileron will create more
      drag than the form drag caused by the up-going right aileron and
      the spin will be further aggravated. For an airplane equipped with
      conventional ailerons application of rudder alone is used for spin
      recovery. Much of spin training involves conditioning pilots to
      avoid the instinctive attempt to roll out of the spin.
      Nonetheless, many pilots have aggravated spins by attempting such
      recoveries with conventional ailerons.<br>
      <br>
      Various methods and devices have been used to counter adverse yaw.
      Among them are the differential aileron with its finite deflection
      ratio, and the spoiler. The differential variation of conventional
      ailerons is the most commonly used solution and provides some
      marginal improvement, but has limitations. Use of spoilers may
      obviate adverse yaw, but spoilers present their own problems.
      Spoilers are so named because they spoil or effectively eliminate
      lift. Ailerons deliver continuously variable changes in lift
      within their operational envelopes, whereas spoilers operate in a
      step-wise manner, being functionally either on or off, and thus
      are difficult to modulate between full and zero effect. Roll
      control is difficult to achieve with spoilers without complicated
      sub-systems or augmenting devices.<br>
      <br>
      Another disadvantage of conventional ailerons is that they also
      require commitment of a sizable portion of the trailing edge of
      the wing that could otherwise be used for beneficial high-lift
      devices. Such devices allow lower approach, landing and takeoff
      speeds, especially advantageous for heavy, high-speed commercial
      and high-performance military aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      There are several prior-art devices which, at first glance, may
      appear very similar to the present invention. On closer
      examination, however, none of them yields the stated results or
      functional capabilities of this invention. Most of the previously
      employed devices are designed and applied as drag devices, such as
      ground control spoilers, drag rudders, dive brakes, or nominal
      flaps.<br>

      to provide aircraft control may be found in the following U.S.

      Pouit describes a flap which acts more like a present-day spoiler,
      to prevent aircraft capsizing. In a variation, the flap has
      separate upper and lower elements, of which the upper element is
      simply hinged, and can be extended upwardly only by the upper
      deflection of the lower, actuated element. The upper flap member
      is not capable of movement independent of the lower member. Both
      wing flaps are operated together. Perrin describes a glider
      control system wherein the aileron has a secondary aileron which
      can be extended up to act as a drag rudder for directional yaw
      control in place of a rudder.<br>
      <br>
      Fenton relates to a device which is basically a flap with small,
      subsidiary flaps on the upper and lower trailing edges. The
      subsidiary flaps are moved up or down through fixed, predetermined
      displacement, to control aircraft roll movement, with the
      deployment of the subsidiary flap on each side of the aircraft
      controlled such that when the subsidiary flap on one side is up,
      the corresponding subsidiary flap on the other side is down. Due
      to their small size, the effectiveness of the subsidiary flaps is
      doubtful.<br>

      Clauser et al. provides a lateral control arrangement having an
      airfoil member pivoted near the tip of the wing which functions as
      an aileron and a flap, or an "ailerflap," and a second airfoil
      member, or a "slot lip," pivoted above the ailerflap. Each element
      can pivot up and down about its neutral position. The slot lip
      regulates the slot spacing between the wing's trailing edge and
      the leading edge of the ailerflap, to alter the lift provided by
      the ailerflap during takeoff and landing. During flight, lateral
      control is achieved with the ailerflaps operated conventionally as
      ailerons. The slot lips move in unison with the ailerflaps, and
      are not capable of independent upward movement.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson relates to a landing control system having a spoiler
      located above a conventional flap. The downwardly extending flap
      is used to augment lift, and the upwardly extending spoiler act as
      a drag plate during landing approach. The flap and spoiler on both
      wings are actuated simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      Miller provides a split aileron which is a combination aileron and
      flap. Each wing has an aileron extending almost the full span, and
      a flap pivoted beneath the aileron. The aileron functions
      conventionally, and size of the flap is limited to that of the
      aileron. Wright et al. describes a split flap arrangement wherein
      a lower element pivots down as a flap and an upper element, which
      pivots up and down, serves as an aileron. Riviere, Taylor and
      Sepstrup disclose split aileron arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      Other examples of control surfaces which are formed of two,
      separately hinged sections and can be deployed together up and
      down as conventional flaps or ailerons, and are also capable of
      separating from each other to provide flap and air brake
      functions, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,427,980, 2,445,833,
      2,612,329 and 2,582,348.<br>
      <br>
      More recently flaperons have been employed which function both as
      flaps and ailerons, and offer pseudo-full-span flaps. They,
      however, greatly compromise the roll function and produce even
      greater adverse yaw than the conventional aileron when roll
      function is needed. Spoilers attempt to achieve objectives similar
      to those of the present invention, but at a great compromise in
      flight characteristics. Spoilers tend to have dead bands and are
      difficult to modulate. They, after all, "spoil" rather than
      modulate lift. Roll control systems involving spoilers have been
      used on aircraft with mixed results.<br>
      <br>
      The conventional differential aileron used on most existing
      aircraft lessens but does not eliminate adverse yaw. It occupies a
      sizable portion of the wing's trailing edge, thus preventing the
      installation of full-span flaps. With some aircraft designs, high
      roll rates have been sought with the use of full-span ailerons,
      thus obviating entirely the installation of flaps. Other aircraft
      designs have sacrificed ailerons for full-span flaps,
      necessitating the inefficient use of tail planes or wing spoilers
      for roll control. No other flight control devices have the
      versatility or efficiency of the present invention. The Frise
      aileron also claims to lessen adverse yaw by deliberately creating
      more drag on the upwardly-deflecting aileron. This device also
      does not allow installation of a full-span flap.<br>
      <br>
      The device closest in construction and function to the present
      aileron system was invented by the inventors of the present
      invention. Presented as the "Delta aileron" which was placed on
      top of a one-piece full-span flap, it has some of the features of
      this invention. But, it is not aerodynamically as efficient and
      offers less functional capability than the present invention. For
      example, it does not have an auxiliary flap and in its present
      form cannot be used as a drag rudder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The aileron system of the present invention simultaneously
      eliminates all the above problems while offering desirable
      features not possessed by conventional ailerons. Accordingly, an
      object of the invention is to provide an aileron system which is
      simple in design and construction, and more importantly, in its
      unique method of deployment and the functional results obtained.
      Other objects of the invention are to provide an aileron system of
      the foregoing type which: eliminates adverse yaw associated with
      previous aileron roll control systems; provides benefits in spin
      avoidance and spin recovery; can be deployed for flight path
      control, air braking and as a drag plate; results in a wing which
      is cleaner, with fewer actuating mechanisms, and is
      aerodynamically efficient and correct in operation; allows for the
      incorporation of full-span flaps and other high-lift devices on
      the trailing edge of a wing; and provides an overall aircraft
      control system which is simpler in construction and requires fewer
      components, is less expensive, reduces maintenance requirements,
      reduces weight, and provides the aircraft with lower takeoff and
      landing speed capabilities, with the advantages attendant
      therewith.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is basically used for roll control of
      fixed-wing aircraft around the longitudinal axis. It is a
      combination of aerodynamic control surfaces which deflect upwardly
      only when deployed for roll control. By operating these surfaces
      judiciously and in conjunction with their counterparts on the
      other wing, and the flap systems, many favorable results may be
      obtained for the control of aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The aileron system of the present invention is similar in shape
      and external appearance to the conventional aileron, but its
      construction and deployment are entirely different. It is
      comprised of two panels located at the rear portion of the wing,
      in a spanwise direction and aligned with the wing's trailing edge.
      The panels may be independently hinged at their leading edges or
      may be hinged on a common axis and rotate to make angular
      deflections with respect to the wing. The upper or aileron panel
      is deflected upwardly only from the neutral position, while the
      lower, auxiliary flap is capable of both upward and downward
      deflections from the neutral position. The upper panel is deployed
      independently as an aileron and the lower panel is deployed
      independently as an auxiliary flap. Both panels are deployed
      together upwardly only as an aileron.<br>
      <br>
      For roll control of an aircraft during cruise, the aileron panel
      on one side only is deflected up while the aileron panel on the
      other side remains in its neutral position. The auxiliary flap
      panel is arranged to move with the aileron panel as a unit, such
      that the two surfaces form an "aileron" in the usual sense. To
      roll left, for example, the aileron of the present invention on
      the left wing is deflected up, while the aileron on the right wing
      remains in the neutral position. The upwardly-deflected left
      aileron results in a negative change in the wing's lift
      coefficient, decreasing the lift on the left wing relative to that
      of the right wing, and producing a roll to the left. Effectively
      joining the upper and lower panels to move as a unit preserves the
      smooth contour of the airfoil. In the deflected mode it is the
      equivalent of an airfoil with a reflex camber. Aerodynamically
      this is a much more efficient "aileron" than that achieved by
      deflecting only the upper panel upwardly.<br>
      <br>
      During flap deployment, the lower auxiliary flap panel is
      disengaged from the upper aileron panel, and operated to move with
      the main wing flaps to form a full-span flap. The upper aileron
      panel is then moved independently to provide roll control. Only
      the auxiliary flap panel is arranged to move in conjunction with
      the aileron in the roll control mode. The panel used as a
      dedicated flap is unaffected. For use on small, general aviation
      aircraft, a simpler version of the aileron system may be utilized
      to facilitate construction and minimize weight. The auxiliary flap
      panel may be left to function completely independently of the
      aileron panel. Its stowed position would be the neutral position,
      and it would move downwards only as a flap. The auxiliary flap
      panel would not accompany the aileron panel in its upward
      excursions.<br>
      <br>
      The aileron system of the present invention is placed at the
      trailing edge of the wing in much the same location as a
      conventional aileron. However, the inventive aileron is deflected
      upwardly only. As with other ailerons, deflection results
      effectively in a change of the airfoil's camber and thus a change
      in the lift coefficient, CL. In the case of the present invention,
      the upward deflection of the aileron results in a negative change
      in CL. The wing deploying the present aileron then produces less
      lift than the other wing with its inventive aileron maintained in
      the neutral position. Thus, the wing drops and the aircraft is
      rolled toward the lowered wing into a turn. The upwardly-deflected
      inventive aileron protrudes into the stream of air flowing over
      the wing, creating form drag, to rotate the nose of the aircraft
      toward the turn. Unlike activation of conventional ailerons, this
      action produces favorable yaw.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention's functional property of favorable yaw aids
      in both spin avoidance and spin recovery. For an airplane using
      the present aileron system, the same stick movement used by a
      pilot to roll right and out of the left hand spin described above,
      results in only the right aileron going up and on the outside of
      the spiral. The outward yawing motion plus the outside wing being
      depressed will roll the airplane away from the spiral center and
      aid in recovering from the spin. This will augment the opposite
      rudder input usually used for spin recovery. The form drag
      associated with the present invention also aids in spin recovery.
      Depending on the installation, this effect may be accentuated by
      the simultaneous deployment of the auxiliary flap panel with the
      aileron panel, creating a drag rudder on one wing, in this example
      the right wing.<br>
      <br>
      Favorable yaw also ameliorates the difficulties associated with
      asymmetric loss of power during flight in multi-engine aircraft.
      The minimum controllable airspeed, Vmca, will decrease with use of
      the present invention, as will the required rudder authority and
      size, while aircraft performance will increase.<br>
      <br>
      Since it deflects upwardly only, the aileron system of the present
      invention frees up the entire wing's trailing edge for
      installation of high lift or drag devices to lower approach,
      landing and takeoff speeds. With lower approach and landing
      speeds, aircraft, particularly heavy commercial or high
      performance military aircraft, may gain access to shorter runways.
      Carrier-borne aircraft may have slower, safer approaches. These
      aircraft will have lower requirements for ground braking and the
      maintenance of such systems. Additionally, the invention may be
      deployed symmetrically on both wings for flight path control, or
      symmetrically in concert with flaps to function as air brakes or
      drag rudders.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a simple system. It results in aircraft
      control systems and overall operations that are safer, more
      efficient and aerodynamically correct, simpler and more economical
      to produce and maintain. It lends itself to systems of lighter
      weight, with the weight savings being traded for increased fuel,
      cargo or passenger capacity, or simply a lighter-weight aircraft.<br>
      <br>

      invention will be apparent from the foregoing and the following

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C each shows a cross section, or an airfoil
      section, of a wing W incorporating the improved aileron system 10
      of the present invention, illustrating different stages in the
      deployment of the system. The aileron system is shown to include
      an upper, aileron panel 12 and an auxiliary flap panel 14 stowed
      underneath the aileron panel. Both the aileron panel 12 and the
      auxiliary flap panel 14 are separately hinged to the wing's rear
      spar 16 or other hard points, and can be operated independently,
      but can also be made to operate in unison for certain functions
      when they are engaged. In FIG. 1A, both panels are shown in their
      respective neutral or retracted positions, in which they form
      smooth continuations of the respective upper and lower surfaces of
      the wing W. With the aileron panel 12 deflected upwardly, as shown
      in FIG. 1B, the auxiliary flap panel 14 also is made to deflect
      upwardly to form an aerodynamically efficient "aileron" in the
      usual sense. With the auxiliary flap panel 14 deployed downwardly,
      as shown in FIG. 1C, the aileron panel 12 can remain in the
      neutral position (shown in solid lines) or be deflected up only,
      as indicated by the broken line 17.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of separately hinging the auxiliary flap panel and the
      aileron panel, these panels may be hinged to rotate about a common
      axis, as shown in FIG. 1D. In this configuration as well, the
      aileron panel 12 can be deflected upwardly (FIGS. 1E and 1G), but
      is not deflected downwardly beyond its neutral position (FIG. 1F),
      whereas the auxiliary flap panel 14 can be deflected upwardly in
      unison with the aileron panel and down independent of the aileron
      panel.<br>
      <br>
      For small, general aviation aircraft, a simplified version of the
      aileron system illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1C may be utilized to
      facilitate construction and minimize weight. The auxiliary flap
      panel may be left completely independent of the aileron panel. Its
      retracted or stowed position would be the neutral position, as
      shown by the auxiliary flap panel in FIG. 1A, and it would move
      downwards only as a flap, such as shown by the auxiliary flap
      panel in FIG. 1C. However, the auxiliary flap panel would not move
      with the aileron in its upward excursions.<br>
      <br>
      In the following description, the term "aileron" will refer to
      both the aileron panel and the auxiliary flap panel when they are
      operated to move as a unit. The term "aileron panel" will refer to
      the upper panel when it functions as an upwardly-movable only
      aileron, independently of the auxiliary flap panel. Similarly, the
      term "auxiliary flap panel" will refer to the lower panel when it
      functions as a flap, independently of the aileron panel.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2, a general aviation type aircraft 18 is depicted making
      a left banking turn by rotating about the aircraft's longitudinal
      axis L. In this maneuver, the aileron on the left wing or left
      aileron 20 is deflected up while the right aileron 22 remains in
      its neutral position, as shown respectively by the wing cross
      section depicted in FIGS. 2A and 2B. The angular deflection
      required for a banked turn is comparable to that of a conventional
      aileron. The rate of roll can be modulated by varying the
      deflection angle. This illustrates the basic roll control function
      of the present invention in which no adverse yaw or rotation about
      the vertical axis Y is produced. On the contrary, favorable yaw
      results. With conventional ailerons, this same maneuver would be
      achieved by simultaneously deflecting the left aileron up and the
      right aileron down, resulting in the adverse yaw discuss above. In
      the present invention, the aileron panel is not deflected
      downwardly beyond its neutral position.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the ailerons 20 and 22 can be modulated independently to
      deflect to any degree in order to provide the roll rate desired,
      or be deflected simultaneously for flight path control or air
      brakes, including the extreme case of maximum upward deflection of
      both for ground control, for landing roll- out. Wing panels
      conventionally deployed for the latter mode are usually referred
      to as ground control spoilers. The inventors consider "spoiler", a
      term which originated in the glider or sail plane community, a
      misnomer for panels used in this mode as brakes. A spoiler is an
      aerodynamic obstruction positioned on top of the wing,
      perpendicular to the air stream, at approximately the mid-point of
      the wing chord. When deployed, a spoiler creates highly turbulent
      flow over the top of the wing and actually destroys, or "spoils"
      the wing's lift, thus the name spoiler. When the lift is spoiled,
      the weight of the wing exceeds the lift supporting it and causes
      the wing to drop.<br>
      <br>
      The ground control "spoiler" is an aerodynamic drag device
      primarily. It does create turbulence, mostly behind the wing. This
      drag panel acts effectively as a flap mounted and deployed on the
      upper surface of the wing, and instead of creating lift as a
      conventional flap on the wing's bottom, this panel behaves as a
      negative flap creating a downward force, or negative lift, which
      is beneficial in applying more force on the aircraft's landing
      gear to permit harder wheel braking. This is done best when the
      lower, auxiliary flap panel is retracted once the airplane is on
      the ground. If the upper drag panel and the lower flap panel are
      deployed at the same time the forces tend to negate each other.
      Under this circumstance the drag force of both panels are still in
      effect and become an air brake. It can become a drag rudder if
      only one wing's control surfaces are deployed in this manner.<br>
      <br>
      The present aileron system can be used for different modes of the
      flight regime. FIG. 3 shows a general aviation type wing 24, such
      as the wing shown in FIG. 2, with full-span flaps formed by the
      main flap 26 and the auxiliary flap 28 deployed together. Both the
      main flap 26 and the auxiliary flap 28 are shown in FIG. 3 at
      maximum deflection. In this mode the aileron panels 30 can remain
      stowed in the neutral position (FIG. 3A) or each can be deflected
      up individually for roll control. The ailerons 10' can be
      deflected upwards on both sides simultaneously to provide
      modulated flight path control when the main flaps 26 are
      retracted, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 4A. The auxiliary flap panel 28
      moves upwardly with the aileron panel 30 in this case. An
      alternate method is to deflect upwards only the aileron panels 30,
      with the auxiliary flap panels remaining in their neutral
      positions, as shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 depicts the control surfaces of the aileron system 10'
      deployed in the air brake mode. Actually, the air brake can be
      deployed in two ways. The first method is in conjunction with the
      full-span flaps, e.g., in preparation for landing, as shown in
      FIG. 5. When further reduction of airspeed is required, the
      aileron panels 30 can be deflected up simultaneously and
      symmetrically on both wings to form the air brake. The aileron
      panels continue to provide roll control by the superimposition of
      individual and independent further upward deflection. The second
      method is during level, or cruise, flight when a decrease in
      airspeed is desired. Both aileron panels 30 can be deflected up
      and both auxiliary flaps 28 deflected down to form an air brake.
      Note FIGS. 5 and 5A. A variation of the second method can be
      attained by deploying the aileron panel 30 and the auxiliary flap
      panel 28 together on one wing only, with the corresponding control
      surfaces on the other wing remaining retracted or in their
      respective neutral position, to form a drag rudder as shown in
      FIGS. 5B, 5C and 5D. The drag rudder, as the name implies,
      performs the same function as the tail rudder, by dragging, or
      yawing one wing to the direction desired.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 schematically depicts a general aviation type wing 24 with
      an example of an operating system to implement control of the
      ailerons. A cable or tubing linkage 32 is connected between a
      control stick 34 and a cam/pulley arrangement 36 coupled to a push
      rod linkage 38 to actuate the aileron 10'. As shown in FIGS. 6 and
      6A, the auxiliary flap panel 28 can be actuated by a cockpit lever
      40 connected by another cable or tube linkage 42 to transfer bell
      cranks 44 and 46 (shown in schematic form), which in turn actuate
      linkage 50 to move the auxiliary flap 28 up or down on command
      from the pilot. The push rod 48 is biased by a spring 49. Other
      mechanisms may perform the same functions by transducing the
      pilots actions through any means of control input, such as
      conventional stick or yoke movement, or pressure sensing device,
      or even neural impulse or electro-encephalographic interpretation,
      with physical implementation by any electrical, mechanical,
      hydraulic or other motive force.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the controls can be seen by referring to FIGS. 6, 6A
      and 7A-7C. The aileron panel 30 and the auxiliary flap panel 28
      are shown in their respective neutral position in FIG. 7A, and
      FIG. 7B shows the aileron 10' deflected up. With the auxiliary
      flap panel 28 not deployed in the flap mode, the auxiliary flap's
      control cable 42 is allowed to unload, and push rod 48 will engage
      transfer bell crank 46 to move a second push rod 50, which in turn
      moves the auxiliary flap panel up in concert with the aileron
      panel 30. In FIG. 7C, the aileron panel 30 is in the neutral
      position and the auxiliary flap panel 28 is deflected down. When
      the auxiliary flap lever 40 is actuated in the cockpit via the
      cable 42, tension will rotate transfer bell crank 44, to move push
      rod 48 sideways to disengage from transfer bell crank 46. Note
      that the auxiliary flap lever and the main flap lever can be
      combined. With the auxiliary flap panel 28 disengaged, the aileron
      panel 30 is free for independent deployment up, modulated for
      aileron roll function up to a position indicated by line 52 or
      modulated flight path control up to maximum deflection indicated
      at 53 for ground control drag panel functions.<br>
      <br>
      Cable or tubing arrangements comprise very simple control systems
      commonly found on small, light aircraft. They are by no means the
      only systems capable of performing the functions described, and
      are chosen only as examples. The controls can be actuated by any
      means capable of transducing a pilot's actions, including but not
      limited to conventional stick or control yoke and rudder, flight
      directors or other automated or computerized pilots, fly-by-wire
      or even voice command or neural impulse. Control actuation may be
      implemented via cables, tubings, pushrods, or electric servo
      motors, electromagnetic actuators, hydraulic cylinders, pneumatic
      systems, or any method of transferring force to cause mechanical
      movement of the aileron and flaps.<br>
      <br>
      For high performance aircraft, particularly heavy commercial or
      military aircraft, the number of possible configurations of the
      ailerons and flaps may be very large. Such complex configurations
      and deployment schedules might be best managed by pilot control
      commands implemented through a computer.<br>
      <br>
      A plan view of a commercial jet aircraft wing 54 is shown in FIG.
      8, with leading edge Krueger flaps 56, 57, 58, and 59. The inboard
      aileron 60 and the outboard aileron 62 line the wing's trailing
      edge. The broken lines indicate the extended position of a
      two-section Fowler flap 64 and 66 which form the auxiliary flap
      panel for the ailerons 60 and 62, respectively, and the extended
      position of the main Fowler flap 68. The full-span flap system can
      be comprised entirely of two-section Fowler flaps. That is, the
      lower auxiliary flap panel can be a Fowler flap. The aileron panel
      may extend from section 62 to section 60, with the aileron panel
      of the inboard section 60 being deployed as a flight path control
      and ground control drag panel only. In this application the
      auxiliary flap panel need not follow the aileron panel's upward
      movement, since in this particular application its function is to
      create drag. Any combination of flap types can be used for the
      main and the lower auxiliary flap panel of the aileron system as
      desired to suit the engineering, production, or performance
      objectives of individual applications.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows in schematic form an embodiment of the aileron system
      62 in which the lower auxiliary flap 66 is a two-section Fowler
      flap having sections 70 and 71. The broken lines indicate the
      upward deployed position of the aileron 62. An example of a
      suitable guide for the auxiliary flap panel 66 comprised of the
      Fowler flap is shown in FIG. 10, wherein a track 72 guides the
      deployment of the two-section Fowler flap. Track 72 is disposed in
      a fairing located on the wing, at the ends of the flaps, such as
      fairings 74 visible in FIG. 8. These Fowler flap sections are
      shown in the stowed positions as 70 and 71 and in the maximum
      extended positions as 70' and 71'. The larger of the Fowler flap
      sections 70 rides on a shuttle 76, shown in FIG. 11A, which is
      guided along the track 72. Flap deployment is accomplished by
      electrically-driven screw jacks 78, which are attached to the
      shuttle 76. Rotation of the screw effects a rearward push on the
      screw jack 78 to extend the larger of the Fowler flap sections 70,
      which in turn pulls out the smaller section of the Fowler flap 71
      via a connecting linkage 80 (FIG. 10.) A hydraulic cylinder 82
      actuates the auxiliary flap, which is the larger of the two Fowler
      flap sections, through a transfer bar lever 83.<br>
      <br>
      The aileron system is shown in the up deflected position in FIG.
      11B. The auxiliary flap 70 is hinged at the front end to the
      shuttle 76, and the rear part of the flap is lifted away from the
      shuttle. When the auxiliary flap 70 is in the fully retracted
      position (FIG. 11A) it is automatically released mechanically from
      the shuttle 76. When the auxiliary flap is ready for extension,
      electric microswitches (not shown) will signal the screw jack
      motor circuits (not shown) that the auxiliary flap is stowed in
      its neutral position. At that time the screw jack motor will begin
      operating. A mechanical device on the shuttle will automatically
      lock the flap to the shuttle and begin its deployment along the
      track. The broken lines 84 and 85 indicate the aileron panel and
      the auxiliary flap panel are in one of the air brake mode
      positions.<br>
      <br>
      The fully deployed auxiliary Fowler flap is illustrated in FIG.
      11C, which depicts the relationship between the two sections of
      the Fowler flaps. The aileron panel 62 can be operated
      independently in this situation, from its stowed neutral position
      (solid lines) to an intermediate upward deflection (phantom lines)
      and further to a maximally deflected position indicated by the
      line 84.<br>
      <br>
      A schematic drawing is presented in FIG. 12, to illustrate an
      alternate form of flap that may be utilized with the aileron
      system 62. In this embodiment a single-section Fowler flap 86 is
      shown. Phantom lines show the deployed position of the auxiliary
      panel (Fowler flap) 86 and the aileron panel 62. The broken line
      84 indicates the position of the aileron panel 62 in its
      functional mode as a ground control drag panel. The single-section
      Fowler flap is less complicated, and requires a smaller track and
      other deployment mechanisms which can be contained in a smaller,
      more streamlined fairing. This results in a lighter structure,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 13, a simple split flap arrangement is shown. The features
      of the present invention are still preserved. As above, this is a
      simpler construction but with a trade-off in efficiency and
      performance.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 is a schematic plan view showing the aileron system of the
      invention 70 installed on a swept-wing jet aircraft. The operating
      devices used to control the aileron system are similar to those
      described with respect to FIGS. 10 and 11A-11C. The auxiliary flap
      70 is retracted beneath the aileron (not shown), and each end of
      the flap is supported by a shuttle 76, which in turn rides on a
      track 72 guided by rollers 88. Hydraulic cylinders 81 and 82
      actuate the movements of the aileron panel and the auxiliary flap
      panel separately. The extension and retraction of the shuttles are
      effected by a pair of electromechanical screw jacks 78. Additional
      details of the shuttle 76 are shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. Two
      rollers 88 guide the shuttle 76 on the track 72. The leading edge
      of the flap 70 is pivotally supported on the shuttle 76 by a hinge
      90. Toward the rear of the flap, at about 1/3 of the flap chord, a
      locking mechanism is provided which includes a bolt 92 passing
      through a strong point bracket 94 attached to the flap structure,
      a spar, or some equivalent structure. A lever bar 98, hinged at 99
      to the shuttle, can rotate back and forth (arrow A) to actuate the
      locking bolt 92 via a linkage 100. The lever bar 98 is attached to
      a screw jack 78, and a detent block 102 attached on a lever 104
      with a roller tip 105, can rotate with an up and down motion,
      indicated by the arrow B. The roller tip 105 rides on a roller
      guide (not shown) which governs its movement to release the detent
      block 102 at the appropriate location.<br>
      <br>
      The sequence of auxiliary flap extension begins with the screw
      jack 78 being rotated to push back on the lever bar 98, which in
      turn pushes the linkage 100 to lock the bolt 92 onto the bracket
      94. Further movement causes the shuttle 76 to move and extend the
      auxiliary flap 70, such as depicted in FIGS. 11C and 12. At the
      same time the roller-tipped lever 104 is guided to rotate
      upwardly, to place the detent block 102 between the lever bar 98
      and a shuttle step 106. The lever bar 98 is then locked and
      prevented from rotating. The retraction sequence is the reverse of
      the above extension sequence. When the lower auxiliary flap panel
      70 is fully retracted, the roller guide will rotate the
      roller-tipped lever 104 downward, to extract the detent block 102.
      The lever bar 98 then can rotate forward to extract the bolt 92.
      The lower auxiliary flap panel 70 then is unlocked from the
      shuttle 76, but hinged at the forward end and is free to rotate
      around this hinge point 90.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the aileron system, in conjunction with an
      aircraft's conventional flap system to provide aircraft control
      can be better understood from the following description of its
      operation through a hypothetical flight of an aircraft from
      takeoff to landing, for example, a large commercial jet aircraft.
      Typically, the pilot would select flap deployment for takeoff.
      Here, both the main flap and the auxiliary flap panel beneath the
      aileron panel would be deflected downward from their stowed,
      neutral positions. During and after the takeoff the upwardly
      deflecting aileron panel would be deployed to maintain full and
      independent roll control authority.<br>
      <br>
      After gaining altitude and speed, the pilot would retract the
      flaps, with the auxiliary flap panel then moving to its stowed
      position where it effectively becomes one with the aileron panel
      to form an aerodynamically efficient "aileron." This integrated
      aileron will maintain roll control during cruise flight with a
      drag efficient aileron. To roll the aircraft to the left, for
      example, the pilot would raise the left aileron. The right aileron
      would remain in its neutral position. No adverse yaw would be
      experienced during this deployment, and the rolling motion would
      be modulated continuously by pilot control input.<br>
      <br>
      For descent, the pilot might reduce power. With this invention,
      however, the power settings could be left unaltered, or the
      descent rate augmented with the flight path control mode of the
      aileron system by raising the ailerons of both wings
      symmetrically. The aircraft could descend in this fashion with
      wings level, the degree of augmentation of the sink rate
      continuously modulated by the simultaneous deflection of the
      ailerons. Full roll control authority would be maintained by
      superimposing differential aileron deflection. During this
      maneuver the aircraft sinks or descends but remains in a level
      attitude or nearly so, the cabin floor likewise, a quality
      appreciated by flight attendants and passengers. Airspeed could
      remain constant during descent even with throttle settings little
      changed from cruise. On retraction of the ailerons, the aircraft
      would stop its descent and resume its previous level flight path
      and airspeed. Steeper descent rates could be obtained by
      symmetrical deployment of the drag rudders, that is, the aileron
      and auxiliary flap panels together, on both wings as air brakes.
      These air brakes with their outboard location on the wing would
      not be limited in deployment, as are many conventional speed
      brakes with their inboard location, by turbulent air flow created
      for the tailplane to fly through.<br>
      <br>
      During approach to landing, the auxiliary and main flaps would be
      deployed independently for small changes in wing camber, leading
      to deployment of both the main and auxiliary flaps together to
      produce full-span flaps for increased lift and/or drag at low
      speeds. Flap deployment may be combined here with symmetrical
      deployment of the aileron panels as in the above-described flight
      path control mode to provide an air braking function. Again,
      superimposing differential aileron deployment would provide roll
      control.<br>
      <br>
      On touchdown, the pilot would retract all flaps and raise the drag
      panels and the aileron panels as additional drag panels. This
      action would place additional weight on the wheels for better
      ground contact that would allow harder wheel braking and at the
      same time exert pressure (as a function of speed) to hold the
      aircraft on to the ground.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also offers advantages in dealing with asymmetric
      thrust conditions or power loss, a scenario that drives much of
      multi-engine aircraft design and certification requirements. With
      asymmetric engine power output, the aileron of this invention or
      the drag rudder function would provide directional control
      superior to that of current systems, with less compromise in
      aircraft performance and decreased need for rudder size and
      control authority. Asymmetric thrust, which occurs for example
      when there is greater power output by the engine or engines on the
      right side of an aircraft, or there is less power output by the
      engine or engines on the left side, will cause a yawing and
      turning motion of the aircraft to the left, towards the side with
      less power. This is usually considered an emergent situation. This
      yawing motion typically is counteracted with rudder input. The
      combination of asymmetric thrust and compensatory rudder input
      will allow the aircraft to hold a linear course, but the aircraft
      now also will be sideslipping, or have a sideways component to its
      motion. This sideslip induces a large amount of drag and may cause
      severe decrease in aircraft performance at a time of greatly
      reduced power and aerodynamic control authority. This is
      counteracted by banking or rolling the wings toward the side with
      more power. With conventional aileron control systems this will,
      as with normal flight situations, induce adverse yaw which will
      require even greater rudder deflection, with the demands on the
      rudder now including compensation for both the asymmetric power
      condition as well as the adverse yaw induced by banking the
      aircraft to eliminate sideslip.<br>
      <br>
      An aircraft with conventional empennage equipped instead with the
      present invention would still require rudder input to counteract
      yaw generated by the asymmetric thrust condition. But banking
      toward the side of greater thrust to compensate for sideslip would
      generate favorable yaw, aiding the rudder rather than demanding
      even more rudder input. The rudder then could be of smaller size,
      generating less aerodynamic drag in all flight conditions,
      weighing less. and costing less to produce and to maintain.
      Deployment of both the present invention and the rudder under
      these circumstances would induce less drag than conventional
      control surfaces, yielding greater aircraft performance under
      these worrisome conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Disclosed herein is a unique aileron system in conjunction with
      flap arrangements which offer multiple function with advantages
      over past and present systems for aircraft control. Among its many
      advantages, the present invention eliminates adverse yaw
      associated with previous systems of aileron roll control. Spin
      entry involves the creation of adverse yaw, usually at low flight
      speeds. The invention allows airplanes to maneuver well-controlled
      at lower speeds and provides favorable rather than adverse yaw,
      decreasing the likelihood of spin entry, improving safety. The
      present invention operates on the wing's upper surface only. The
      entire trailing edge is made available for high lift devices, e.g.
      flaps and other functionaries that deflect or move downwards. Any
      sort of high lift or drag device that requires varying the wing
      trailing edge downwards can be implemented with use of the
      invention. Full-span ailerons may be installed for higher roll
      rates desired for acrobatic or other aircraft demanding high
      maneuverability.<br>
      <br>
      The present aileron system can be employed to deploy
      simultaneously on both wings for flight path control. No rolling
      motion is caused by symmetrical deployment. The equal deployment
      results in an equal decrement of lift on both wings and a
      descending flight path with small changes in pitch attitude and
      power settings. This effect, as all others with the invention, can
      be modulated continuously in contrast to that of many conventional
      air or speed brakes. In this mode, control of the individual
      ailerons provides roll control.<br>
      <br>
      When the aileron system is used in concert with flaps, air braking
      results. Asymmetric deployment results in "drag rudders" and
      selective left or right yaw. With large deflection angles the
      aileron system may be used as a "drag plate", useful, for example,
      for braking on landing roll-out.<br>
      <br>
      The invention offers many favorable economies. It is simple in
      design and construction. No new technologies are necessary for
      production. It allows for full-span flaps, among other trailing
      edge devices. A typical commercial airliner could replace its dual
      conventional ailerons, multiple spoilers, complicated flap systems
      and all their attendant actuating systems with simply one aileron
      system of the present invention and one flap on each wing.
      Construction would be simpler and less expensive. Maintenance
      would involve fewer systems with fewer opportunities for
      malfunction. The wing would be cleaner, fitted with fewer of the
      multiple protruding pods now present for actuating systems, and
      more aerodynamically efficient and correct in operation. The
      weight saved could be traded for additional fuel, improving range,
      or additional cargo or passengers, or simply result in a lighter
      airplane with better performance. Lower takeoff and landing speeds
      impose less stress on landing gear systems, as well as pilots, and
      allow aircraft to use smaller airfields. Utility, is increased and
      safety enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      Implementation of the invention control system does not result in
      any compromise or negative trade-off in any aspect of aircraft
      performance. Neither is it more expensive to engineer or produce.
      To the contrary it results in performance increases and economies
      in production and operation under every consideration.<br>

      A mechanical control mixer configured to couple to an aircraft is
      provided. An axle is mounted to a frame of the mechanical control
      mixer, and a barrel is configured to rotate about the axle. A
      central rod is disposed within the barrel. The central rod is
      configured to rotate with respect to the barrel. A roll control
      input is connected to the central rod. The roll control input is
      configured to cause the central rod to rotate within the barrel.
      Output control rods are connected to the central rod. The output
      control rods are connected to at least one control surface of the
      aircraft. An air brake input is connected to the barrel. The air
      brake input is configured to cause the barrel to rotate about the
      axle to move at least one of the output control rods<br>

        <b>FLAP PANEL SHUTTLE SYSTEM AND METHOD THEREFOR</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An aircraft control system is presented. The system includes a
      wing including a flap track, and a shuttle connected to the flap
      track and configured to slide along a length of the flap track.
      The system includes a flap panel pivotally attached to the shuttle
      at a flap pivot. The flap panel is configured to rotate about the
      flap pivot. When the shuttle is deployed along a length of the
      flap track, the shuttle is configured to prevent rotation of the
      flap panel about the flap pivot, and when the shuttle is withdrawn
      into a stowed position, the shuttle is configured to allow the
      flap panel to rotate about the flap pivot.<br>
