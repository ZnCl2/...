      <p>The Prophecies of Paracelsus attracted my attention at an early
        stage of my studies in the Occult, which have now extended to
        over forty years, but I have only recently thought of bringing
        them to public notice, the extraordinary events of the present
        time acting as an incentive. </p>
      <p>The famous French Kabbalist, Alphonse Louis Constant, in <i>La
          Clef des Grands Mystères</i>, p. 378, wrote: </p>
      <p>'The Prophecy of Paracelsus, of which we here give the Preface,
        is composed of thirty-two chapters with allegorical figures. </p>
      <p>'It is the most astounding monument and indisputable proof of
        the reality and existence of the gift of natural prophecy.' </p>
      <p>Abbé Constant (born 1809, died 1875), better known by his
        Hebraistic pseudonym, Eliphas Lévi Fahed, was a distinguished
        Adept, Magus, and Writer on the Occult. Most of his works have
        been ably translated by Mr. A. E. Waite. </p>
      <p>The Preface Eliphas Lévi refers to is not given here, but will
        be found preceding the Predictions. </p>
      <p>Eliphas Lévi then continues: </p>
      <p>'Following this Preface commence a series of figures. </p>
      <p>'The first represents two millstones, the two powers of the
        state, the people and the aristocracy; but the people's stone is
        crossed by a serpent holding a bundle of birchrods in its jaws;
        a hand armed with a sword comes out of a cloud and seems to
        direct the serpent, which overthrows the millstone and causes it
        to fall upon the other. </p>
      <p>'The second figure represents a dead tree, the fruits of which
        are fleur-de-lys, and the text announces the exile of the family
        of whom the fleur-de-lys is the emblem. </p>
      <p>'Farther on the millstone, representing the people, falls upon
        a crown and breaks it. </p>
      <p>'Farther on still a bishop is shown immersed in water and
        surrounded by spears that prevent him from reaching the bank. In
        the text it says: </p>
      <p>"'Thou hast come out of thy bounds, now thou demandest the
        earth, but it will not be surrendered to thee." </p>
      <p>(The German text is slightly different.) </p>
      <p>'Then can be seen an eagle hovering over the Bosphorus, where
        the Sultan appears to be drowning.) </p>
      <p>And as this eagle has not two heads and is not black Eliphas
        Lévi considers that this excludes Russia and Austria. </p>
      <p>The great French Kabbalist then concludes: </p>
      <p>'It would perhaps not be prudent at present to publish the
        remainder. Curious persons can consult the Latin book printed
        with the title Prognosticatio eximii doctoris Theophrasti
        Paracelsi, which should be found in the National Libraries. </p>
      <p>'We possess two copies, one in manuscript and the other
        photographed after a copy printed in the sixteenth century.' </p>
      <p>Thus far Eliphas Lévi in 1861; this is the year 1915. </p>
      <p>Now the world is in the throes of a great European war, there
        is no reason why these pregnant Prophecies should any more be
        kept secret, and every reason why they should be widely known. </p>
      <p>Great changes in the world are before us, both in Religion and
        Politics. Considering the importance at the present critical
        time of a clearer outlook, this glimpse into the future coming
        from the past may not be inopportune, and the present
        publication of the Predictions of Paracelsus may assist and
        interest, both from a religious and political point of view, all
        who are concerned in the world's progress. It may also serve to
        aid the reader to a better acquaintance with the great Adept of
        the Renaissance, when his own quaint words on Past, Present, and
        Future are reproduced. </p>

      <p><b>I. CONCERNING PARACELSUS</b> </p>
      <p>THEOPHRASTUS BAUMBAST VON HOHENHEIM, commonly known as
        Paracelsus, the famous Swiss Physician, Alchemist and Occultist
        of the sixteenth century, was born on the 10th November, 1493,
        at Sihlbrücke, near Einsiedeln, Canton Schwyz, and died on the
        24th September, 1541, at Salzburg. </p>
      <p>Contemporary with Charles V, Luther, Erasmus, and Cornelius
        Agrippa, Paracelsus stands out as an extraordinary character
        that has been for a long time misunderstood by the majority of
        the learned and unlearned alike. </p>
      <p>Living in the age of the Reformation, siding neither with
        Catholic nor Protestant, he distinguished himself as a free
        lance in Medical Science and Occult Philosophy, and would have
        been known as a Mystic had his religious writings not been so
        carefully suppressed as to be altogether forgotten. Paracelsus
        then claims our attention as Alchemist, Physician, Occultist,
        Mystic, Astrologer and lastly as Prophet, and it is in this last
        capacity that we shall regard him, as we are about to study and
        thereby rescue from oblivion those at one time famous
        predictions, of which some have been remarkably accomplished,,
        while others may be considered to be still in actual course of
        fulfilment. </p>
      <p>Concerning the life of this remarkable man we are informed that
        his first teacher was his father, the learned Wilhelm Baumbast
        von Hohenheim, a physician, who took pains to instruct him in
        all the learning of the time, especially in Medicine. </p>
      <p>At the age of sixteen young Baumbast entered the University of
        Basle. But he soon abandoned academic studies, preferring the
        mystic and occult teachings of the famous Adept, Johannes
        Trithemius, Abbot of Spanheim, a noted Alchemist and Divine,
        whose ideas he absorbed. </p>
      <p>However, he soon forsook the Abbot, as he had previously
        forsaken University culture, to study Metallurgic Chemistry in
        the mines then owned by the Fuggers in Tyrol. </p>
      <p>It is not my intention to give a description of the Life of
        Paracelsus, as such an excellent account appears of him in the
        eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. </p>
      <p>Fuller biographical details are given in <i>The Life of
          Paracelsus</i>, by Dr. Edward Berdoe, M.R.C.S., in the <i>Life



          and Teachings of Paracelsus</i>, by Franz Hartmann, M.D., and
        in <i>The Life of Paracelsus</i> by Anne M. Stoddart. </p>
      <p>Those who read German will find interesting details in the
        little volume, <i>Theophrastus Paracelsus, sein Leben und seine
          Persönlichkeit</i>, by Franz Strunz. </p>
      <p>I must, however, differ from the last-named author, who would
        claim Paracelsus for the Pantheon of German fame and would
        endeavour to prove that he was a German. He was not. Paracelsus,
        although he preferred to lecture and write in German, was all
        his life, heart, soul and backbone, a Swiss. This en passant. </p>
      <p>Paracelsus, in his book <i>Von der grossen Wundarznei</i>,
        volunteers concerning himself the following information: 'From
        childhood upward have I followed these studies and received
        instruction from those experienced in Adept Philosophy.' </p>
      <p>He then mentions his principal teachers. 'First, Wilhelm von
        Hohenheim, my father, who never failed me. </p>
      <p>'I studied the writings of ancients and moderns, and had a
        number of teachers I can hardly name. </p>
      <p>'Some of them took great trouble with me, such as the Bishops
        of Stettgach, of Lavantall, and of Yppen, the Abbot of Spanheim,
        and further, Sigmund Fugger von Schwatz, and many workers in his
        laboratory.' </p>
      <p>Fugger may have largely influenced his mind in Alchemy, but in
        the recently unearthed theological writings of Paracelsus
        mentioned by Professor Karl Sudhoff in his learned work Versuch
        einer Kritik der Echtheit der Paracelsischen Schriften, 2.
        vols., Berlin, 1894-1899, we find a clear indication that he
        derived his prophetic gift from that source of all Prophecy ---
        Mystic Illumination. </p>
      <p>Paracelsus --- he assumed that name when he began to teach, to
        indicate his superiority to Celsus --- was for all his numerous
        instructors, to a great extent, like all adepts, self-taught and
        soul-inspired. </p>
      <p>A mystic leading a sexless life, he had glimpses of Cosmic
        Consciousness or Divine Illumination, far transcending the
        knowledge of his time, and while under such inspiration, that
        secret spring of all genius and prophecy, he wrote and said more
        than he knew in his mortal mind. </p>
      <p>Searching for knowledge and truth, roving through various
        countries, practising and teaching a system of empirical
        medicine which we will not here discuss, he got into touch with
        life in all its phases, and into a state of mind most favourable
        to the attainment of that Kabbalistic state of Cosmic </p>
      <p>Consciousness, or Divine Illumination, which rays forth
        throughout his luminous writings. </p>
      <p>Famous, yet hated and persecuted by unprogressive
        contemporaries, misunderstood by the unenlightened of the
        following centuries, posterity has at last vindicated the fame
        and character of this hero of Occult Science. </p>
      <p>Professor Strunz observes of Paracelsus: </p>
      <p>'His was a mind of mighty features whose rare maturity
        converted the stating of scientific problems into warm human
        terms, and we owe to him the realisation of a cultured human
        community based upon Christian and humanitarian piety and faith,
        which things we may well regard as the bases of his teaching
        concerning both the actual and the spiritual. His restless life
        never robbed him of that witchery which ever and again flushed
        the immortal impulses of his soul like golden sunshine; that
        vision which belongs to the great nature-poet. And yet few men
        of his time recognised, as he did, the incalculable result to be
        attained by the empiric-inductive method... Paracelsus felt like
        an artist and thought like a mathematician, just as he combined
        the laws of nature with the laws of the microcosm, that is of
        man with his consciousness, his feelings, and his desires. It
        was this delicate artistic sense which proved to be the daring
        bridge from the man Paracelsus to the keen-visioned observer of
        reality, a wondrous viaduct resting upon the traverses of the
        new humanity, the Renascence. For upon this viaduct moved
        forward that reconstruction of the universe of which Paracelsus
        was one of the greatest architects.' * </p>
      <p>The poet Robert Browning made Paracelsus the subject of one of
        his finest poems, describing him as an idealist and student of
        Nature's mysteries. </p>
      <p>Professor Dowden in his Biography 'Robert Browning' explains
        the poem 'Paracelsus' as follows: </p>
      <p>'The poem is the history of a great spirit, who has sought
        lofty and unattainable ends, who has fallen upon the way and is
        bruised and broken, but who rises at the close above his ruined
        self and wrings out of defeat a pledge of ultimate victory. </p>
      <p>'Paracelsus as presented in the poem is a man of pre-eminent
        genius, passionate intellect, and inordinate intellectual
        ambition. If it is meant that he should be the type of the
        modern man -of science Browning has missed his mark, for
        Paracelsus is in fact as much the poet as the man of science . .
        . </p>
      <p>'Paracelsus is a great revolutionary spirit in an epoch of
        intellectual revolution; it is as much his task to destroy as to
        build up; he has broken with the past, and gazes with wild-eyed
        hopes into the future, expecting the era of intellectual liberty
        to dawn suddenly with the year One, and seeing himself the
        protagonist of Revolution. </p>
      <p>'Such men as Paracelsus, whether their sphere be in the
        political, the religious, or the intellectual world, are men of
        faith; a task has been laid on each of them; a summons, a divine
        mandate, has been heard. But is the mandate indeed divine? </p>
      <p>'Very nobly has Browning represented the overmastering force of
        that faith, which genius has in itself, and which indeed is
        needed in the struggle with an incredulous or indifferent world!
      </p>

      <p><b>II. ON THE PROPHECIES OF PARACELSUS</b> </p>
      <p>'THE world, as the Eddas say, is ruled by three Fates, the
        Past, the Present, and the Future. The Present rests upon the
        Past and proceeds from it, the Future from the Present. But it
        is the Future that holds the ideal to which the world moves, and
        therefore it is she who conditions both the Present and the
        Past. The Three are inextricably One.' --- H. Fielding Hall, <i>The



          World Soul</i>. </p>
      <p>There is not the slightest doubt that if the Present is the
        result of the Past, the Future will be the result of the
        Present. The three being one, the Future should be as easily
        read as the Past. But this can only be done when the finite mind
        of the Seer becomes one with the infinite mind of the Seen, by a
        manifestation of the Soul, which is the Creator, and source of
        Truth. </p>
      <p>The Prophecies of Paracelsus are set forth in thirty-two
        'magical' or allegorical Figures with Prognostications to each
        Figure, a Preface and an Epilogue or Elucidation written by
        Paracelsus. </p>
      <p>The entire work evidently relates to predictions of mundane
        events, some to ecclesiastical affairs, others to social
        political upheavals and changes that have since happened, are
        actually becoming accomplished or may still come to pass. </p>
      <p>The Predictions, apparently limited to 24 or 42 years (both
        numbers are given) from 1530, about which time they appeared,
        were possibly occultly intended to mean mystic years, meaning
        either the fulness of time, or 240 or 420 years, which latter
        term would include the affairs of the present critical time. </p>
      <p>Whoever studies these predictions cannot fail to see how
        worldly affairs have followed the course Paracelsus foretold for
        them either by mystic inspiration or astrological calculation. </p>
      <p>Concerning the time when certain predictions should come to
        pass, an eminent seer of the Middle Ages, the Hermit Johannes
        Liechtenberger, aptly observed: </p>
      <p>'Although Almighty God alone has retained the time and hour in
        his power, and he alone knows future things, and although there
        is no one in this world who can predict anything with certainty
        for to-morrow, or for some days to come, nevertheless the same
        merciful Deity, of his overflowing Love, has poured various
        gifts unto his creatures, whereby in things that are still
        distant and in the future, He allows us to understand and know,
        not wholly, but in divers parables, symbols and comparisons of
        things already happened with those that are to take place in the
        future.' </p>
      <p>These Predictions were at their first publication in great
        demand and often reprinted. </p>
      <p>Professor Sudhoff mentions numerous editions and reprints, but
        they would have fallen altogether into oblivion had not the
        noted Kabbalist, Eliphas Lévi, drawn attention to them by
        counselling their suppression. </p>
      <p>True Initiates are ever on the side of Law and Order, and
        maintain that the secrets of the Occult should remain occult.
        But these are times when the old order changes and what has been
        kept occult must become manifested. </p>
      <p>The time has thus arrived for making known what has been kept
        in concealment or lapsed into oblivion for centuries; for as
        Paracelsus quaintly observes: 'when the time comes then comes
        also that wherefore the time has come.' </p>
      <p>In that extremely rare, because suppressed, occult book, <i>A
          Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery</i>, occurs the
        remarkable observation: </p>
      <p>'Many prophecies there are of times to come, and those days are
        even said to be at hand, when the Fourth Monarchy, which is the
        Intellectual reign of Truth and Peace, shall predominate, when
        the Mother of Sciences will come forth, and greater things be
        discovered than have been hitherto in the past monarchies of the
        world. But we do not tarry about these matters; the Revelation
        of all things is always at hand for him who knows how to
        investigate, and the rest will be always far behind. If truly
        there be minds prepared, or if the great era approaches more
        rapidly than is given us yet even in faith to foresee (for
        notwithstanding so many signs that are appearing, all signal
        rumours of a coming change, yet they are fewer and far between
        and more rare yearly which indicate the progression of Truth);
        but if, we say, a better age is approaching, which at some
        period of time must come, when abundance of all things by an
        equitable distribution of all, shall help to break down the
        competitive barrier of society, and introduce a co-operative
        alliance among mankind, then this incentive to inquiry may not
        be inopportunely offered in the self-discovery of truth.' </p>
      <p>Curiously enough Paracelsus also connects the establishment of
        the 'Fourth Monarchy' or Millennium with a rediscovery of
        Alchemy and a universal knowledge of the secret of transmutation
        of metals. </p>
      <p>'Then will the Old Art flourish, and no heed be given to the
        New. </p>
      <p>'Then shall the Pearl so long lost be found by an humble one,
        and will be set, as a jewel, in gold,' etc. </p>
      <p>What the world would be if gold had to be demonetised on
        account of its being as common as lead I must leave to the
        reader's imagination. </p>
      <p>The idea of the Millennium may also have served as an occult
        allegory for the Regeneration of Man, as every reborn Soul lives
        even now in the Millennium, the Fourth or Fifth Monarchy, or the
        Rule of Christ. </p>
      <p>The attainment of the Individual to the Divine mystic state of
        Illumination would in no wise impede, but rather hasten, the
        realisation of the Father's Kingdom on earth. </p>
      <p>Paracelsus calls the Power that rules the world's Fate, Magic.
      </p>
      <p>The Creator rules the world by Magic. He is the Divine Magician
        creating and sustaining the All by His omnipotent Word: Fiat!
        Be! </p>
      <p>Man, too, has the Soul-Power of Magic, but it extends no
        further than the potency of his trained will and the reality of
        his Thought. </p>
      <p>The Creator's Will being omnipotent, Man's will is only potent
        in as far as it is in unison with the Creator's. </p>
      <p>But Man by selfishness circumscribes his power and dissevers
        himself from the Eternal Unself, the I AM. </p>
      <p>Were Man to enter the plane of the Divine Unself his power for
        Good would increase in proportion to his attunement with the
        Father's Will. </p>
      <p>But clouded by ignorance and environed by sin, that has become
        his lower Nature, man's mind knows nothing of the Reality of the
        Eternal Mind nor of its Mastery over Fate. </p>
      <p>Man, as he now is, has depraved senses but no real Thought. He
        is but the creature of a day, and perishes like the beasts he
        devours, having fallen from Providence to Fate. </p>
      <p>Who can tell the extent of the faculties Man possesses when he
        is in his rightful state--the Immortal Mind? </p>
      <p>Who can even faintly foreshadow the vast power latent in his
        eternal Being? </p>
      <p>Can the son of the Infinite be finite? </p>
      <p>Is it not more probable that he too has faculties for infinite
        development? </p>
      <p>Why should the Future not be known to us as the Past? </p>
      <p>The Soul knows all things, the Soul being the Eternal Mind. </p>
      <p>The self-inflicted eclipse of the Soul will not last for ever.
      </p>
      <p>Sin is the result of Ignorance and Ignorance the cause of sin.
      </p>
      <p>Where true knowledge flourishes sin dies and man becomes a
        regenerate being. </p>
      <p>Let us therefore endeavour to understand the everpresence of
        the Creator in the World and in Nature. </p>
      <p>Wherever we rightly search Nature's phenomena we can infer from
        Manifestation to Cause, from Cause to Thought, from Thought to
        Law, from Law to Love. </p>
      <p>Nature, when rightly understood, will be seen to act upon the
        principles of Thought that we can follow, of Love that we can
        love and that loves us. </p>
      <p>By Nature we mean the creative Life in Nature. </p>
      <p>Man should not be subject to Fate, as he now is, but should be
        a Divine being guarded by Providence, the Divine Mind. </p>
      <p>If we could only realise that we are immortal beings, how
        differently we should live! </p>
      <p>Let us then, endeavour to understand the everpresence of the
        Creator in Nature. </p>
      <p>Underlying Phenomena there are Noumena, underlying Nature there
        is Nature's God--the Creator. Sustaining Matter there is the
        all-pervading Spirit. </p>
      <p>The Universe is not void, the Universe is full. Ether holds all
        things in solution. </p>
      <p>Wherever we can follow the Creator's footsteps in Nature or in
        History, we find revelations of Divine Thought. </p>
      <p>Nature's Law is animated by Divine Thought. </p>
      <p>He, the Creator, is united to us as the Spirit of Life, the All
        Soul, the All Life. Our Soul, our Life is a part of His. </p>
      <p>We are the Creator's offspring, but we can only become children
        of the Father's Kingdom by an act of mystic self-renunciation.
        The renunciation of Self--the lower Nature. </p>
      <p>We may now inquire how these predictions were given by
        Paracelsus. </p>
      <p>Although predictions can be made by the aid of Astrology alone
        and their subsequent accomplishment may be deemed marvellous,
        yet no one will have a correct foresight unless he sees with the
        eye of the Soul, whereby comes a true image of things seen in
        the Eternal Mind. </p>
      <p>Concerning this true Imagination Paracelsus says in his <i>Liber




          de Imaginibus</i>, Cap. XII: </p>
      <p>'Therefore should you also know that the perfect Imagination
        coming from the Astral, issues from the Soul, wherein all Astra
        lie occult, and the Soul, Faith and Imagination, are three
        things to count, for the names are different, but they have
        equal force and strength, for one comes from the other, and I
        cannot compare it otherwise than with the Divine Trinity. For
        through the Soul we come to God, through Faith to Christ and
        through the Imagination to the Divine Spirit. Therefore also is
        to these three, even as to the Divine Trinity, nothing
        impossible.' </p>
      <p>In the time of Paracelsus it was not safe to know anything
        beyond the dogmas of Mother Church. We find therefore that most
        real knowledge became occult. </p>
      <p>The Prognostications were given in signs and symbols and to
        interpret them we will let Paracelsus himself give us a few
        hints. </p>
      <p>In the same Book, Cap. V, he explains.: </p>
      <p>'When out of Magic a Prophecy is given by pictures and figures,
        on a city, country, government, principality or kingdom, it is
        indicated by the animals, arms, colours which the same city,
        country, prince, or king carries, and not described in plain
        words. </p>
      <p>'Therefore every one who would undertake to interpret such
        Prophecy, should not only be a good Astrologer but also a good
        Magnus and should know thoroughly what plant, animal or colour
        each city, country, prince or Lord carries in the coat of arms.
      </p>
      <p>'As an example, the Eagle means in Magic the Emperor, or only
        his Empire. </p>
      <p>'Three Lilies, or only one Lily, the King of France, or the
        Kingdom of France. </p>
      <p>'Three Crowns, one upon the other, or a triple cross, the Pope,
        or the entire Papacy. </p>
      <p>'A crown by itself, a King or a Kingdom. </p>
      <p>'A Half-Moon, the Sultan, or his Empire, and so on.' </p>
      <p>France, the Papacy, the German Empire, England, Russia, Turkey,
        &amp;c., appear in the Predictions many of which have been
        remarkably fulfilled. </p>
      <p>The 'Magic' Paracelsus speaks of is the occult Divine Power
        that rules the Destiny of the World and the Regeneration of the
        Individual Soul. It is the World Soul. I should prefer to call
        it the Creator's Everpresence. </p>
      <p>According to the Kabbala every Nation has a Ruling Angel,
        Prince or Lord. </p>
      <p>It is however also esoterically taught that the Archangels are
        not persons but dignities or grades which the Soul must attain
        before becoming united with the Creator. </p>
      <p>Thus might the whole set of Figures and Texts be esoterically
        interpreted as the phases of the Soul's course towards
        Perfection, and what exoterically treats of the world's course
        or destiny may esoterically teach the Regeneration of the Soul.
      </p>
      <p>This interpretation could be taken for each and all of the
        thirty-two figures and chapters. </p>
      <p>It was a common practice for mediaeval Occultists to write
        about one subject, teaching all the while another. </p>
      <p>Such policy was, in those times, necessary. </p>
      <p>Even as a treatise on the Occult may these Prognostics be found
        of interest to those who are mystically inclined. </p>
      <p>The XXXIInd Chapter is profoundly mystical. 'Blessed is he that
        is born during sleep' refers to the Divine re-birth, the birth
        of Cosmic Consciousness. </p>
      <p>Thus, although the chapters and figures openly refer to the
        world, secretly they may speak of the world in Man. </p>
      <p>Manifestly the Regeneration of the World is treated, occultly
        the Divine Re-birth in Man may be intended. </p>
      <p>The Power at work in the one as in the other is that Mystic
        'Magic,' the Divine Christ-Spirit. </p>
      <p>According to Hebrew Tradition, the Incarnations of the Messiah
        educate mankind for perfection, while Christian Mystics maintain
        that the world is under the guardianship of Christ. </p>
      <p>In the Occult Art of Regeneration it is the same Divine Spirit
        that teaches and guides the Soul in her course towards the
        'End'--'Nirvana' the Divine Re-birth. </p>
      <p>It is a peculiarity of true occult books that they bear looking
        into beneath the surface meaning, and the more their occult
        meaning is studied the more it will become manifest. </p>
      <p>The Smaragdine Tablet of 'Hermes', the Twelve Keys of 'Basil
        Valentine' and the <i>Amphitheatrum</i> of Khunrath are
        considered to teach simultaneously Alchemy, 'Magic,' and the
        Kabbala. </p>
      <p>These three are said to be not three Arts, but one Art relating
        to the body, spirit and soul of our being. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>III. ELIPHAS LÉVI'S PREFACE TO THE PROGNOSTICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>In <i>La Clef des Grands Mystères</i>, mentioned in the
        Prefatory Remarks, Eliphas Lévi gives: The Preface to the
        Prognostication of Doctor Theophrastus Paracelsus, of which the
        following is a translation: </p>
      <p>'Socrates, discoursing one day upon the too curious research of
        celestial things, during which one forgets the realities of
        human life, and of the earth that lies at our feet, exclaims:
        "That which is above our comprehension does not exist for us";
        wishing thereby to say that a timorous and superstitious
        consideration of the heavens is vain, useless and dangerous. </p>
      <p>'It may be indeed that a wise man warned by his reason of peril
        may be deterred from such study. Elsewhere Socrates, in the
        Dialogues of Plato, everywhere praises moderation and balance in
        all things. It is thus that the words of this great philosopher
        should be understood; for there is no reason to suppose that he
        would calumniate astrology, he being himself, according to the
        testimony of Plato, an excellent Astrologer. 'I will not here
        essay an apology for a science honoured by many learned men, I
        will only say one word: that there is not another art that can
        so justly be called divine in its source, in its tradition and
        in its theory. Read Moses, he will tell you why God has placed
        in the firmament the sun, the moon, and the stars to be for
        signs and for seasons, and for days and for years; which
        inspires Saint Paul to praise those wise men of the world who
        have found and known in visible things their invisible Creator.
        It is true that he continues to blame them for not having
        honoured him more than the creature. God wills, in fact, that we
        should be attentive to the law of the elements, in order to
        elevate ourselves from the work to its Author, to know and adore
        Him; for all appearances and all material forms are but marks
        and veils that allow the most intimate secrets of nature to be
        divined beneath them. </p>
      <p>'Thus were those magnificent sciences invented, thus were those
        marvellous arts born, that make us discover in roots, in stones,
        and even in men powers occult to the vulgar and revealed only to
        the sagacity of those sages named by Hesiod and by Homer,
        meropes, that is to say, great seekers. 'All the while let us
        not attribute too much to human intelligence. It is a divine
        Wisdom descending from the Father of Light, according to the
        text of St. James. God has given us characters forming letters;
        He has attached to them all the feelings of the Soul. Through
        them we can speak; through them as through a divine instrument,
        He transmits to us and teaches us every day the secrets of all
        sciences. </p>
      <p>'God having thus adapted the wonders of creation to the use of
        man, has established from the beginning a school of initiation
        for that. Wisdom which all may not comprehend. There we learn
        with care the things hidden from the multitude. Thus the
        fisherman draws his net from the depths of the sea filled with
        fish that he never saw; the miners bring forth masses of gold
        and silver from the depths of the earth where the eye cannot
        penetrate. In this wise in the school of Nature God teaches us
        and places before our eyes things altogether unknown. Thus there
        is nothing hidden which shall not become revealed and placed in
        the light; be it in the firmament of the heavens, be it in the
        sea, be it in the earth, all must be brought forth to the light
        of the day by those great seekers of whom I have spoken.
        'Meanwhile these celebrated men by their science cause their
        immortal names to pass from mouth to mouth; for they have in a
        manner cleared up Nature, and their memory should never become
        extinct. The muse never cedes her inheritance of glory to death.
        It is by genius that we live, all the rest belongs to death. </p>
      <p>'In same wise, according to our powers and the gift of
        Providence, have we desired to glean after those noble
        harvesters and explained to the world the threatenings of Nature
        and of the stars, for a period to come, which is to last forty
        (query 400) years, in order that men may find themselves
        informed, learning to fear God, and to prepare themselves for
        the future chastisement of great crimes. It is impossible to
        express up to what point all flesh has corrupted its way.
        Anarchy is everywhere. Heaven and Earth are confounded, and were
        God not to shorten the days of His wrath no flesh could be
        saved. The disorderly life of men of my time is that which
        specially determined me carefully to study the stars. </p>
      <p>'Now there are signs in the sun, the moon and the stars that
        announce the speedy coming of the judgment of God. The axe is at
        the foot of the tree, blood flows upon blood, and as the Prophet
        says, no one among men disturbs himself about God, there is not
        one who seeks Him. But the Prophets and Evangelists have at
        present the mission to recall us to charity, concord and unity.
        Unity is in the Divine Triad, and the Divine Triad is summarised
        in Unity. </p>
      <p>'It is in this wise that in human society, unity, peace, and
        tranquillity should arise. When unity is broken, plurality of
        power immediately engenders discord and war. There are as many
        opinions as there are heads; each one would make his own
        triumphant; then there is no more harmony possible, but in unity
        there is rest with abundance of peace. O how well and pleasant
        it is for brothers to dwell in unity! exclaims the prophet
        David. Unity is the happiness of all creatures. The Heavens have
        but one law of motion and harmony; the earth has but one law to
        produce love, and gives her fruit in season. All obey unity,
        except Satan and Man. Man, however, is sufficiently warned by
        the signs of heaven, by the sun, the moon and the stars . . .
        But what do these announce? He is too menaced with a sudden and
        quickly approaching end. Happy is he that sitteth not in the
        chair of pestilence, and walketh not in the counsel of scorners!
        The coming of God is at hand. The arm of the avenger falls on
        us; everyone feels the misfortunes coming which he cannot avoid.
      </p>
      <p>'Who will then struggle against God? One kicks not against the
        pricks with impunity. The God of Hosts is the strong God, the
        jealous God, who visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the
        children to the fourth and fifth generation. </p>
      <p>'Oppose God, what folly! Foolhardy Titans who would dethrone
        Jupiter were themselves overthrown by his thunder. It is time to
        show men their madness, and it is this we propose to do by
        thirty-two figures intelligible but to a small number of the
        elect. </p>
      <p>'We have seen the consummate iniquity of the people of Gomorha,
        carrying their blasphemies unto the heavens; but when things are
        pushed to extremes, the overbent bow breaks, and men are driven
        by a fatal law to a contrary extremity, whereby motion relaxes
        and the balance is established. </p>
      <p>'Thus by perpetrating crime after crime corruption shall
        exhaust itself; and who can sadden thereat? Behold the salvation
        of the multitude is coming and redemption shall overcome the
        kingdom of evil. </p>
      <p>'Who would not be impatient to see the days where unity shall
        be given unto us and we shall live in peace under only one
        shepherd! </p>
      <p>'Then no more troubles, no more injustice, the balm shall
        descend upon the venerable beard of the High-Priest, the
        blessing, light, gratitude to Heaven shall spread upon the
        children of unity. </p>
      <p>'Pride having made itself odious even in Heaven, the faithful
        angels did not weep at the fall of Lucifer, they affirmed the
        Divine sentence. </p>
      <p>'Let us therefore not grieve if God opens now His Hell under
        the feet of the haughty. </p>
      <p>'Let us rather rejoice, for the judgment has commenced in the
        House of God itself, and it will thence extend upon every kind
        of unjust pride. </p>
      <p>'Our prediction has hardly any other aim than to reveal, as we
        have said, the threatenings of Heaven against insolent heads. </p>
      <p>'God desires to deliver and avenge finally His oppressed
        children Himself, He wishes to cast down the powerful and to
        lift up the humble. . . . But it is not yet there that the pains
        begin. The greatness of evil has not yet revealed itself; it
        shall reveal itself, and with it a force shall become manifested
        that will prevent the just from being seduced and drawn into the
        ruin of the perverse. </p>
      <p>'We say that no one shall be named in our prophecy. God knows
        those whom He has resolved to chastise, men do not know Him, but
        they shall sooner feel that justice has overtaken them than we
        with our human sagacity can seek and divine. All is concealed
        and nevertheless revealed to us. </p>
      <p>'The Kabbala always veiled, never pronounces oracles without
        mysteries, and we are assured that it is of her we receive
        Astrology. God blinds the eyes and hardens the heart of those
        whom He has delivered to His vengeance, for He no longer wishes
        to save them. </p>
      <p>'In concluding this Preface I pray all those who will read
        these articles to interpret my words in simplicity and not to
        seek personalities under my emblems. </p>
      <p>'Let them keep their minds free from all thoughts of hate, fear
        or envy. The event will strike in justice and then those who
        will shall know. </p>
      <p>'I know many others have worked in the same direction, I do not
        despise either their knowledge nor their efforts, on the
        contrary I encourage them. </p>
      <p>'I see death flying over many monastic institutions, but if men
        would be wise and were to return to God, He is merciful and good
        and allows Himself to be moved by the importunity of prayers. </p>
      <p>'We do not attribute to the stars a fatal power, they impel us
        by their influence, but if the Master wills it, He alone can
        alter the direction and change all. Joshua prayed and the sun
        stood still to allow him to accomplish his victory. Hezekiah
        prayed and the shadow tarried on the sundial. Elijah prayed and
        the heavens closed. The continual prayer of the righteous is all
        powerful. Those who would avert the threatened danger have but

      <p>This Preface is imbued with the Spirit of Paracelsus but
        differs from the Preface in the German edition of the
        Prognostications given in the following section. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>IV. STRASSBURG EDITION OF THE PREFACE TO THE
          PROGNOSTICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>This Preface to the Prognostications was given in the
        Strassburg Edition of the Collected Works of Paracelsus, vol.
        ii, p. 594. It runs as follows: </p>
      <p>'It may be questioned whether we can at all describe the
        effects of the stars, since we do not see that which passes even
        upon earth and what lies at our feet, and often stumble and
        strike against it; far less can we know of the Heavens. But the
        reply thereto is, that for this purpose we do not use our eyes
        nor our feet. </p>
      <p>'Further can this instruction be given: it is God's will that
        we should have our experience in all His works, and that we
        should have knowledge in Nature's secrets, that nothing may be
        wanting, but that we should know it. </p>
      <p>'In this wise were discovered many great arts such as would be
        tedious to relate. </p>
      <p>'As it is God's will that we should know these things, He only
        can teach them to us, for such knowledge is not of man. Who can
        tell how letters were invented? Only by divine inspiration, for
        it pleased God that we should have such knowledge, therefore has
        man learned it. </p>
      <p>'Even as God created His miraculous works, that man should know
        them, He also created a school wherein we learn this knowledge,
        but this school is not visible or known to everyone. </p>
      <p>'The fisherman draws fish that he never saw from many fathoms
        beneath the water, the miner brings gold from the depths out of
        the earth, through which his sight cannot pierce. In this wise
        has God taught it. </p>
      <p>'As there is nothing so occult that it shall not become
        manifest, so the same must be made known. Be it in the celestial
        firmament, in the sea, in the earth, all things must become
        manifest; but through man who discovers all things. </p>
      <p>'Who will now show the first teacher and point with the finger
        at him? For he is not of Adam; but in him acts, and through him
        becomes manifested in his creatures all that is within him. He
        teaches it. </p>
      <p>'To describe the courses this world will pass through in 24
        years is lamentable enough. That man should have made himself so
        greedy and should have so wholly deluded himself and have failed
        to realise that his days must needs thereby be shortened; and
        that man should so wholly have forgotten God, his master, and
        should live not in accordance with His Law. To understand this
        requires the consideration of the mysteries shown by the signs
        of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. It is also a subject for
        contemplation in what manner the people on earth inflict misery
        on each other, whereby no one will grant his fellow that the Sun
        shall shine upon him. </p>
      <p>'There is but one number alone wherein we should walk upon
        earth, that is the One, and we should not count more. In God
        there are three, but the three are one. </p>
      <p>'Thus we men, as God transmutes Himself into one, we likewise
        on earth should resign ourselves and become one. </p>
      <p>'In that number and in no other is there rest and peace
        (Unity). </p>
      <p>'That which is more than this is full of unrest and contention,
        one against the other. </p>
      <p>'For if a reckoner puts a number and counts more than one, how
        many are the errors in root and result? Hence comes the dire
        distress and the worm gnawing us. </p>
      <p>'How pleasant and good it is when we walk in the One! Heaven
        has also its physical course in that number; the earth and all
        are therein contained. 'But when that is not, then the Sun, Moon
        and Stars appear as signs that have to be considered. </p>
      <p>'The end however is not yet, although there are signs thereof,
        but the calamity is only beginning. </p>
      <p>'Blessed is he that sitteth not in the chair of pestilence, and
        who doth not dwell with sinners, for they shall be visited. </p>
      <p>'Every man that is against God may know in his own conscience
        that he shall not prevail against nor overcome Him. </p>
      <p>'It is hard to oppose Him, and no one is able to overcome Him.
        Therefore it is a great folly that man should strive against
        what is impossible to overcome. </p>
      <p>'Thus there are 32 Symbols of that which is to be. May they not
        fly higher, so they but fall into the time for which they are
        intended. </p>
      <p>'They are brought forth in all humility, but their course is
        through much misery. For as a serpent will they wind and turn
        until the end comes. </p>
      <p>'But who would therefore grieve as the salvation from all
        arrogance and pride draweth nigh? </p>
      <p>'Who would not rejoice that again the One shall be the
        Shepherd, and in the One shall be set the habitation? 'How
        peaceful will it be when there shall be no need for counting and
        numbers. </p>
      <p>'Then will the precious ointment be poured upon the beard of
        Aaron, giving blessing from above. Then will the blessing issue
        from God. </p>
      <p>'Even as there was no weeping in Heaven at the casting out of
        Lucifer into the abyss of Hell, why should it trouble us if in
        like manner Pride fall, so that One only and not more be in the
        Government? </p>
      <p>'For many years past changes in the world have been foretold,
        but the signs indicated only the beginning. The end is not yet
        in operation, only the beginning. </p>
      <p>'But the time of the nations is now at hand that they shall
        come to an end. And also that the just may not be seduced must
        the breaking-up take place. </p>
      <p>'To me it is not known whom God will accept, but without regard
        to them all is the Prognostication set forth. </p>
      <p>'Others may better discern this than I and understand whom it
        concerns. </p>
      <p>'Thus hath the Kabbala given it, as a mother and beginner of
        Astronomy. </p>
      <p>'The course of things is however so secret that they are right
        before us and yet we know of them only when they are already
        past. </p>
      <p>'For everyone should know that it is not the Will of God they
        should not be converted and that they should not be saved from
        their doom. </p>
      <p>'Therefore are the things seen with seeing eyes, and yet they
        are not seen. </p>
      <p>'Let no one cast suspicion on anyone but let the End generate
        all things. </p>
      <p>'Many speak and write, each one according to his ability. What
        others have also in this wise made, I will not reject, for the
        forerunners are many when such Monarchy is to be dissolved.' </p>

      <p>These Elucidations of the Prognostications and Conclusion of
        Doctor Paracelsus are given in the Strassburg edition of his
        works: </p>
      <p>'The symbolical figures as above stated are 32 and will take
        their complete course in 42 (? 420) years. </p>
      <p>'It is not less; the least of them (<b>I</b>) would require a
        larger book to describe than the one wherein they are all
        comprised. </p>
      <p>'If all these symbolical figures were to be adequately
        described, with complete explanation, how much distress would
        there be found in them? Reedlike inconstancy, and the multitude
        of its associations will run into each other in such strange
        confusion and will happen in such an unexpected way as is hardly
        to be credited. </p>
      <p>'For many things are written in an occult sense which it is not
        well to relate. </p>
      <p>'Thus is the Symbol (<b>II</b>) compared to a Lily *; but it
        should not be lilies but Toads. For a toad is the first given
        Magic Sign. But it is changed from a toad into a flower. For
        even as a toad inflates itself with poison, likewise does he
        inflate himself who is given to pride. It is not a garden lily
        but a lily growing out of thorns, that refuses to grant her
        fragrance to anyone. </p>
      <p><b>III.</b> 'There will be distress and violence suffered. What
        follows, were it understood and believed, would never give rise
        to much laughter. For to be forsaken by the best companions
        makes a man weak and dull. And furthermore if he is to be
        attacked that was so well cared for, and who is the child of the
        house, it is well to remember that there is need of time,
        strength, cunning and watchfulness. </p>
      <p>'It would be well could the time be spared to describe it, not
        only in general terms but in particular detail; then would much
        distress become revealed. </p>
      <p><b>IV</b> to <b>VIII.</b> 'The other four symbols follow after
        the first mentioned, and will also demolish much, until each one
        in turn is fulfilled. </p>
      <p>'They will seek much assistance from strangers, and bind one
        chain into another, and will erect and again let fall, break and
        make, and seek hither and thither where shelter from the heat
        may be found. 'But the eighth symbol shall gain the victory and
        triumph. </p>
      <p>'For if that were not to come to pass it would be impossible
        that on earth there should ever again be rest or peace so long
        as the world endures. </p>
      <p>'So totally will everyone act according to his will and forget
        why the are on earth, but only declare: thus I will, thus I do.
      </p>
      <p><b>IX.</b> 'Although there is need to bend a rod firmly,
        otherwise it returns again to the straight line, it should be
        borne in mind that nothing crooked can so remain, but must be
        allowed to return again to its straightness. </p>
      <p>'Were this not to happen, very slowly wouldst thou be unbent,
        so that thou wouldst not be able to come to the length wherewith
        thou wouldst fain be contented. </p>
      <p><b>X.</b> 'The following symbol would do wisely to withdraw
        into itself, and contemplate itself, surrendering its own will,
        and seat itself in ashes and sackcloth. </p>
      <p>'For what is this but Nineveh? Would to God that by prayer the
        prophecy may be averted, as was the prophecy of Jonah. </p>
      <p><b>XI.</b> 'To munch the paws is a meagre diet, and it is
        painful to freeze after sunshine. </p>
      <p>'But what one does of one's own choice, one must one's self
        have. </p>
      <p><b>XII.</b> 'It is a great thing that the Virgin Mary has
        spoken, that He has deposed the mighty ones from the chair.
        Therefore let no one marvel that impossible things come to pass,
        for these are in the hand of God. </p>
      <p><b>XIII.</b> 'Therefore let him that is very proud humble
        himself, for the hungry are fed, and that which should not be is
        cut down. </p>
      <p><b>XIV.</b> 'Happy are the poor, they are not forsaken, and he
        who has no other aid than the Letter, and is bound to the
        Letter, how can he prevent that a hole be pierced therein? </p>

        has seemed to reach well nigh the height of the Tower of Babel.
      </p>
      <p>'Even as this Tower was forsaken miraculously amidst confusion
        of tongues, in the same wise a roof falls from above and higher
        than this it is impossible to build. </p>
      <p><b>XVI.</b> 'And although much is written, yet no one can
        triumph against the same. </p>
      <p><b>XVII.</b> 'Therefore must thou perforce be pleased to
        replace the stone from whence thou hast taken it. </p>
      <p><b>XVIII.</b> 'And thou must allow the winds to buffet thee
        about, for thou hast not built a wall against them. </p>
      <p><b>XIX.</b> 'And thy leap shall displease thee alone, and not
        many more. </p>
      <p><b>XX.</b> 'Who may know but only the wise man what aim is set,
        and how man of himself sets up what should not be? </p>
      <p>'Since all things stand in God's hand, how can man use his
        strength, which is nought but a reed? </p>
      <p><b>XXI.</b> 'Hence cometh failure. Then shall he be subdued who
        has secretly kept many in his pay, but before this befalls the
        next symbol will be fulfilled. </p>
      <p><b>XIII.</b> 'For if one does not cleanse his own house how
        shall he cleanse that of another? </p>
      <p>'If a man does not wisely manage that which is his own, much
        less can he manage that which is another's. </p>
      <p><b>XXIII.</b> 'Then the rivals shall cease to contend, for all
        things shall be settled in peace and concord. </p>

        what man would do, and how he would apply his wisdom, yet is it
        directed to nothing permanent nor certain, albeit he so
        persuades himself. This must cease. </p>
      <p><b>XXVIII</b> and <b>XXX.</b> 'Doubt not, for doubt is the foe
        of Faith. It must be firm as a rock and enlightened, as it was
        in the beginning, otherwise it is not enduring and is hurtful
        withal. </p>
      <p><b>XXVI.</b> 'For the Sun shall enlighten him that will be

        chains shall there be strong enough to hinder each from being

        thereafter brought peace to himself. But he has many times been

      <p>'He does not indeed each year do away with one symbol, but
        simultaneously fulfils them all and altogether as one, until all
        is completed and accomplished. </p>
      <p>'Who may understand who it is that is hereby intended? </p>
      <p>'Hence may none be named, and none be suspected, until all has
        come to pass. For thus it shall be. </p>
      <p>'Whoever therefore may read this Prediction should read it
        bearing in mind that he inform no one. For no one is in the
        knowledge. </p>
      <p>'But when a thing has been accomplished and has come to pass,
        everyone can afterwards understand it, but it is then no more of
        use. </p>
      <p>'Many a one will think to himself that it does not concern him,
        and yet perchance it may do so. </p>
      <p>'For it is usual for everyone to. wish to protect himself but
        no one is willing to know himself. </p>
      <p>'They ever place the interpretation as having allusion to those
        against whom they feel envy, opposing God even, and he who
        judges shall perhaps himself be judged, and he who deems himself
        to be perfect and whole, may possibly be ragged and torn at the
        sides. </p>
      <p>'May God give a good End.' </p>
      <p><b>Footnotes ~</b> * The Royal Symbol of France was in ancient
        times three Toads. It is not certain when Lilies were first
        adopted instead, but Charles VI introduced the three Lilies that
        have since then been identified with the French Royal Coat of
        Arms. See I. Chifflé, <i>Lilium Franciscum</i>, 1658.--J. K. </p>

      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>'I bear in mind that you may not believe me when I tell you
        that my (at this time) despised writings shall yet be held in
        great value and esteem by wise and judicious men. </p>
      <p>'It will, however, not happen until the great and fearful
        eclipse of the sun is past. </p>
      <p>'I say that then there shall overflow as the waters of a mighty
        river all kinds of revolts, riots, wars, slaughter, murders,
        conflagrations and all evil into the northern countries. </p>
      <p>'Then beware Brabant, Flanders and Zealand, and ye who like my
        Swiss countrymen feed upon cheese. </p>
      <p>'Then will the Lily be altogether decayed, exhausted and cast
        down. </p>
      <p>'In the same wise will the Eagle be plucked, dishonoured,
        insulted and despised. </p>
      <p>'Othman will be foremost and the Eagle shall cringe before him.
      </p>
      <p>'Good times shall then be. Fruit and what is necessary for life
        will thrive, but the poor will enjoy little thereof. </p>
      <p>'The Spiritual will grow and increase as the Moon. </p>
      <p>'Then those of the East will for a time have a great Victory
        and exalt the Golden Tower. </p>
      <p>'The people without a head will not remain untouched. </p>
      <p>'Then shall the high nobility be punished as though they were
        criminals. </p>
      <p>'The Lion having Blue and White for associates will march in,
        in a high manner. </p>
      <p>'Beware, thou beautiful City, that wast formerly a lustre and
        eye of Europe. </p>
      <p>'The Rue-wreath dwindles to nought. Doth there not remain of
        this conflagration one spark, that shall soon after begin to
        burn and light an inextinguishable fire? </p>
      <p>'Now when these things come to pass, neither truth, nor faith,
        nor fidelity, nor honour will be esteemed. </p>
      <p>'But there will be many truths, many fidelities, many honours;
        but they will be of such a kind that they may be known and
        considered as no faith, no truth, no fidelity and no honour. </p>
      <p>'The White will for some time overcome the Black with the Black
        and will accomplish great things. </p>
      <p>'The Pomegranate will burst and throw out his seeds and will
        let them perish. </p>
      <p>'Then shall the Rue-plant or Rue-wreath incline its root or
        natural origin to the Lily and shall stand as a shield before
        her, that the Wind of Health may not blow upon her. </p>
      <p>'The people of the earth shall then be in commotion, and no
        ties of brotherhood, marriage or friendship will be respected. </p>
      <p>'The Lion will join himself to the Fishes. </p>
      <p>'And the Crown will be subject to the Fine Hat. </p>
      <p>'Then will the Rue-wreath be soiled with Milk. </p>
      <p>'And the Pelican shall be devoured by his young. </p>
      <p>'But the Phoenix shall be consumed in the fire, and when the
        dew moistens the ashes he will again revive according to his
        Nature. </p>
      <p>'But he will become a noble Phoenix, and will press hard upon
        the Toad, and he will take to the Lion and will give him a
        choice. </p>
      <p>'The Lion will select the best and no more. </p>
      <p>'Upon the other Wild Horse this Phoenix will place a bridle and
        will ride it with spurs but without a saddle. </p>
      <p>'Then a new generation of beasts with various strange heads
        shall be born. They will have many mouths and stomachs, but only
        one natural draught. </p>
      <p>'The most profligate will maintain his magnificence, </p>
      <p>and his angels will be clothed in blood. They will be intent
        upon one work alone. </p>
      <p>'A pair of horses will appear and in all places will the wail
        of the fugitives be heard. </p>
      <p>'The Dragon of Sleep will cause the Eagle to become weary of
        all magnificence. </p>
      <p>'The Fountain of Life will commence to flow. </p>
      <p>'And a white Eagle will be changed into black. </p>
      <p>'Milk and Blood will decrease, and the animal Tree will begin
        to grow. </p>
      <p>'An old Lion will be bound and a young Lion will become free.
        He will please all those animals which the old had vexed. </p>
      <p>'He will do even more, for he will change his mane and hair
        into silk. </p>
      <p>'The Bear will lay snares, and the Ox-head will seek to gore
        him. </p>
      <p>'The Griffin will fly over him but will not harm him. </p>
      <p>'Then shall the Pearl, so long lost, be found by one of humble
        estate, and will be set, as a jewel, in gold. </p>
      <p>'It will be given to the Prince of all beasts, that is, to the
        right Lion. </p>
      <p>'He will hang it about his neck, and wear it with honour. </p>
      <p>'He will resist the Bear and the Wolf, and rend them asunder;
        so that the beasts of the forest shall be safe. </p>
      <p>'Then will the Old Art flourish and no heed will be given to
        the New. </p>
      <p>'Then will the New World begin, and the White and the Black
        shall disappear. </p>
      <p>'All Vain glory will be ended, and the plumes of the bird of
        the East shall be burnt by the Sun of the South. </p>
      <p>'How then will it be with thee, Oh thou Lion and earthly one
        who art painted and bound with gold? </p>
      <p>'All thy doings shall be changed, and the seven heads shall
        become one head. </p>
      <p>'Out of this one, a head shall be born that shall be armed with
        a horn. </p>
      <p>'This horn shall bruise all that which has so long brought
        sorrow to Iffinos. </p>
      <p>'And the great City shall be the head of the less and shall
        become free from servitude. </p>
      <p>'Europe shall be the head, Asia the crown, but Africa shall be
        the jewel.' </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Epilogue</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>These are the famous Prophecies of Theophrastus Paracelsus,
        considered by Eliphas Lévi to be 'the most astounding monument
        and indisputable proof of the reality and existence of the gift
        of natural prophecy.' </p>
      <p>The Prophecies or Prognostications do not merely relate to
        events that happened in the age of the Reformation, and do not
        refer strictly to 24 or 42 years after they were published, but
        suggest events that happened long after, some that are even now
        happening, and others that will happen in the future. </p>
      <p>Nearly four centuries have elapsed since these predictions were
        made. I have neither altered nor suppressed any of them, but
        only translated from the old German to the best of my ability. </p>
      <p>Whatever interpretation may be given to these predictions their
        ancient origin cannot be disputed. </p>
      <p>They were first published about the year 1530, and are extant
        in print of that period. It is true the first editions give no
        date, and it is uncertain whether the Latin edition preceded the
        German, as the latter shows more originality of expression. It
        is by no means improbable that the Latin version referred to by
        Eliphas Lévi may be only a translation. </p>
      <p>The German edition Of 1530, which is also found reprinted in
        the works of Paracelsus collected by Johann Huser and published
        at Strassburg in the year 1616, was taken as the original for
        the present translation. The Prophecies occur in vol. ii, pp.
        594-608. </p>
      <p>The Plates have also been reproduced from the old woodcuts of
        that edition. </p>
      <p>The original Manuscript of Paracelsus is said to be in the
        Court Library of the Grand Duke of Baden at Karlsruhe. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Interpretation</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>To interpret a prophecy is more hazardous than to make one, for
        a prophecy may be vague, but an interpretation is expected to be
        exact. </p>
      <p>I will not venture to interpret any of the predictions, but
        only chance to suggest the meaning of some of them. </p>
      <p>Ingenious readers are welcome to interpret each and all of the
        Prophecies in their own way. It may interest those fond of
        historical research or who are keenly following the course of
        political events. </p>
      <p>Religion also plays a large part in the predictions. </p>
      <p>As history repeats itself, a prediction thought to have been
        accomplished by a country, person or event,, may again be
        verified by another or similar occurrence. </p>
      <p>Paracelsus apparently saw the future as a series of
        cinematograph pictures before him, but describes without
        chronological sequence. </p>
      <p>As a whole the figures and chapters relate either to the Church
        or to the State. </p>
      <p>Thus IV, VII, X, XII, XV, XX, XXII, XXIII, XXV, XXVIII to XXXII
        apparently refer to religious or ecclesiastical affairs, while
        the rest of the figures and prognostications relate to social
        and political changes. Figures and Chapters I, II are evidently
        intended for France. </p>
      <p>VI is a striking prediction of Napoleon on St. Helena. The
        laurel branch on a rock. </p>
