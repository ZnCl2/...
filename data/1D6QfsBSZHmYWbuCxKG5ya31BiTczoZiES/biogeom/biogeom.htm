      </center>
      <p>Balancing the activities of daily life, achieving harmony with
        our inner and outer environments, humanizing modern technology,
        integrating science and spirituality, and discovering the
        unified scientific reality behind all religions is the work of
        the science of BioGeometry®. </p>
      <p>Just two decades ago everybody was afraid that the end of life
        on earth would come as a result of a Third world War. We thought
        that the global extinction of life on earth would come from
        nuclear warfare and our carelessness towards our environment,
        endangering plant and animal life; the ozone hole and global
        warming causing natural disasters everywhere. However, the real
        potential danger is one that we are barely aware lurking just
        around the corner. </p>
      <p>The age of information carries with it the potential to the
        global extinction of our civilization. We are continuously
        increasing the amount of carrier waves needed for the wireless
        technology of modern communication in the earth’s atmosphere
        every day. These electromagnetic waves are thousands of times
        stronger than the level used in the communication in our body
        cells. The problem is not the saturation of the earth’s
        atmosphere through quantity, but also a detrimental quality.
        Even people who avoid using high technology are not immune. No
        one is immune even if one lives at the far end of the world or
        on top of the Himalayas, because these are carrier waves with
        penetrating properties. It is like trying to move a breeze
        through a storm, our immune systems are continuously trying to
        correct the distortion in the transfer of inner information in
        our body; very soon the threshold will be reached when a total
        collapse of our body defenses will take place. </p>
      <p>BioGeometry® is a science that deals with the Energy of Shape;
        it uses shapes, colours, motion, orientation and sound to
        produce a vibrational quality that balances energy fields.
        BioGeometrical shapes are two or three-dimensional shapes
        specially designed to interact with the earth’s energy fields to
        produce balancing effects on multiple levels on biological
        systems. They were developed and patented by Dr. Ibrahim F.
        Karim, D.Sc. in Cairo, Egypt, during research since 1968. </p>
      <p>To understand the effects of BioGeometrical shapes on the human
        energy system, we have to recognize that the human body has an
        energy field around it, which has its own north-south axis. As
        we move around, the angle formed between our individual axis and
        that of the earth is constantly changing, and this in turn
        either strengthens or weakens our energy field. The positive
        range is very small, vulnerable most of the time, and is a major
        factor affecting our health and well being. BioGeometrically
        balanced energy, however, considerably strengthens our energy
        fields to such an extent that we are not detrimentally affected
        by changes of orientation. In fact, it appears to cancel obvious
        energy interactions predicted by currently accepted physical
        laws. </p>
      <p>Research in BioGeometry® was and still is mainly dedicated to
        the development of a new form of architecture that would enhance
        the human biological system and give a new meaning to the
        concept of "Home". To upgrade the energy quality of existing
        homes and cancel the potentially harmful effects of unchecked
        energy fields due to the architectural design, furniture layout,
        electrical wiring and modern appliances, specially designed
        decorative elements are strategically placed to neutralize
        negative energy and add a positive quality to it. BioGeometrical
        shapes when designed or engraved on jewelry have shown positive
        effects on the body’s energy field, and reduce considerably the
        potential health hazards caused by cellular phones, computers
        and all other modern appliances. </p>
      <p>The impact of geometrical shapes on human energy systems has
        always been universally recognized. This awareness gradually
        disappeared, and our "modern" approach is to consider these
        ancient forms either as symbolic art without function, or
        attribute them to magical practices. Although the modern
        development and practices are not directly derived from Ancient
        Egypt, a very advanced know-how in this field is evident when we
        analyze and use the shapes that they have developed thousands of
        years ago. </p>
      <p>They must have been able to interact with nature in a more
        advanced way than we do today, based on the study of the
        vibrational properties of the geometrical shapes they used in
        their monuments, art, statues, amulets, and many other aspects
        of life. The effects of energy went beyond the Pyramid shape;
        the Ancient Egyptians used it in a very practical way in all
        aspects of their life. Unlike our modern energy forms that are
        highly amplified states of energies occurring in nature, this
        science dealt with forces on a natural level as they occur in
        nature. That means that this Ancient Egyptian science was more
        like a language that they used to establish two-way
        communication with nature. This two-way information flow process
        was used to establish total harmony in all actions between man
        and nature, to acquire a deeper knowledge about anything by
        accessing information about it’s working principles on the
        energy level, and most important of all to influence any action
        in nature by manipulating its energy patterns to achieve the
        intended results. </p>
      <p>Pythagoras was the first to introduce to the western world the
        ancient Egyptian way of correlating musical qualities with
        quantifiable, numerical values. The golden ratio of 1.618
        expressed as the ultimate proportion of harmony, beauty and
        spirituality was used in the design of sacred buildings in
        Ancient Architecture to produce spiritual energy that
        facilitated connectivity with spiritual realms through resonant
        prayer. Popular among spiritually significant shapes are
        pyramids and hemispheres (e.g. the domes, that are the basis of
        religious buildings, be it a mosque, a church or a synagogue).
        These particular shapes are energy emitters; they are shapes
        that produce a type of penetrating carrier wave which Chaumery
        and De Belizal named, negative green, (which acts as carrier,
        like radio waves that carry sound information). The vibrational
        quality of negative green gives it very strong communication
        properties, which facilitate resonance with higher realms in
        prayer. Negative green turned out to have other properties,
        however, which make it very harmful under continuous exposure.
        Considerable research into this type of energy has been done by
        Dr. Karim, and the different components have been identified. </p>
      <p>A revival of the Ancient Design Criteria or Canons in modern
        architecture was attempted by the Swiss pioneer of the modern
        architecture, Le Corbusier, with his "modular" system, which
        comprised two scales of dimensions based on the golden ratio. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ibrahim F. Karim has done extensive research and found that
        BioGeometrical shapes have three primary vibrational qualities:
      </p>
      <p>1) Negative green. <br>
        2) A higher harmonic of ultra-violet. <br>
        3) A higher harmonic of gold. </p>
      <p>Only shapes, which produce energy fields with all three
        components, are BioGeometrical. </p>
      <p>The effect of BioGeometrical energy on health is not specific
        and not precisely predictable. It appears to amplify and balance
        the energy fields of the body on all levels, and thereby give
        the body greater power to heal itself. The healing process
        resulting from a strengthening and balancing of the immune
        system manifests differently from one person to the other;
        certain results, however, have been repeatedly observed. </p>
      <p>BioGeometrical shapes balance the body energies on different
        levels; positive effects are usually felt on the emotional,
        mental, spiritual as well as the physical level. They have been
        found to be effective over a very broad range, including the
        protection against harmful radiation emanating from the earth
        (believed to be a major cause of cancer) and different types of
        man-made pollution. For specific healing purposes, research is
        being conducted in collaboration with medical doctors in the
        science of BioSignatures®, which deals with energy of shape in
        relation to specific functions of the body organs. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">BioGeometry: The Egyptian Art of Energy
              Balancing</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Leanna Joyner</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>BioGeometry has been called the Egyptian version of Feng Shui
        but its unique methods and effects are not found in any other
        system. BioGeometry combines previously hidden methods used in
        the Inner Temple Sciences of Ancient Egypt with modern European
        subtle energy detection tools. Developed by renowned Architect
        and energy researcher Dr. Ibrahim Karim of Cairo Egypt,
        BioGeometry has been shown to have astonishing benefits for
        humans, animals, plants, and the environment. </p>
      <p>BioGeometry utilizes Nature's own design language of geometric
        form, color, sound and motion to balance the Energy in all
        living systems. It also features profound methods to transmute
        harmful environmental energies into beneficial ones. Robert
        Gilbert Ph.D., an expert in Sacred Geometry and the author of
        the only English language texts on BioGeometry, identifies
        BioGeometry as an essential key to understanding the Living
        Energies which every spiritual tradition uses for Healing and
        Spiritual Development. </p>
      <p>“Working directly with Dr. Karim and his experts, I found they
        had unique insights into practical energy work. I'm still in awe
        of how clearly they explain energy principles which are usually
        thought to be very mysterious; when you work with the Egyptians,
        one piece of essential knowledge after another just seems to
        fall into place. For example, virtually every tradition knows
        about the Golden radiance which appears in the energy field of
        great Saints and Masters, but only this group of Egyptians can
        show you simple methods anyone can use to detect that energy,
        create it with methods including movement and geometric forms,
        and also practically apply it to balance and heal a variety of
        energy problems. These Egyptian methods, now that they are
        finally becoming public, are going to have a powerful impact on
        how we understand and work with healing energies,” Dr. Gilbert
        explained. </p>
      <p>Although BioGeometry makes no claims, multiple scientific and
        medical studies suggest its potential to create powerful energy
        effects. Just a few examples: </p>
      <p>The Egyptian National Hepatitis C Research Project under Dean
        Taha Khalifa M.D. at Al Azhar University's Pharmaceutical School
        announced publicly that the best results in the entire study
        were enjoyed by those given the appropriate BioGeometry patterns
        to wear. Although Dr. Karim insists that BioGeometry is simply a
        supportive modality that he makes no medical claims for, the
        publicity led to Dr. Karim becoming a celebrity with his own
        television show on holistic health and spiritual development. </p>
      <p>The Egyptian National Research Centre discovered that simple
        BioGeometry forms could stop the replication of Bacteria, a
        result so astonishing that they created a special project to
        study the effect of Geometric Forms on Living Systems under the
        leadership of Dr. Karim. </p>
      <p>A project evaluated by an official of the Egyptian Department
        of Agriculture found that chickens grew healthier and faster in
        an environment which was energy balanced by BioGeometry methods
        than they did with antibiotics and growth hormones. </p>
      <p>Professor Peter Mols of Wageningen Agriculture University in
        Holland found that BioGeometry energy methods could be used in
        place of pesticides and artificial fertilizers to grow healthy
        organic crops. </p>
      <p>The Swiss village of Hemberg suffered both human and animal
        health problems after a powerful Microwave antenna array was
        placed in the center of town. Dr. Karim balanced the
        electromagnetic pollution problem for the entire area, leading
        to such a dramatic improvement in living conditions (and the
        return of birds and other animals which had fled the area) that
        he was given the Key to the City by the Mayor and featured on
        national Swiss news programs. </p>
      <p>”In my personal experience, I've used BioSignatures (precise
        BioGeometry energy patterns linked to different parts of the
        body) to help free me from the chronic neck and spine pain I
        suffered from a severe car accident,” said Dr. Gilbert. “We get
        incredible reports all the time from students regarding the
        power of the BioGeometry methods, but we don't make them public.
        Frankly, many just seem unbelievable if you don't understand how
        BioGeometry works. Also, we want everyone to understand that we
        don't make any medical claims whatsoever; we simply teach the
        principles and methods and leave it to the students to find out
        for themselves how powerful BioGeometry can be in many cases.” </p>
      <p>BioGeometry has only been taught publicly for a short period of
        time. But already several hundred Americans have been trained in
        the Art - first by Dr. Karim and now by Dr. Gilbert (Dr. Karim
        no longer teaches Foundation trainings in BioGeometry, and
        rarely teaches at all.) Students have applied BioGeometry to a
        wide range of fields including conventional and alternative
        Health Care, Environmental Restoration, Architecture and
        Interior Design, Feng Shui, Spiritual Practices, Landscape
        Design, Agriculture and Gardening, and Graphic Design. </p>
      <p>“Basically, BioGeometry teaches practical methods to work with
        the fundamental energies of Creation. It can be applied to
        virtually any field of work, and blends with any methods one
        currently uses. In collaboration with Dr. Karim, we've set up
        the Foundation Training so that we can teach all the essential
        BioGeometry methods to detect, create, and apply beneficial
        energies in just one week. We also make sure students understand
        what the Egyptians call Energy Alchemy, how to transmute harmful
        environmental energies into helpful ones. But perhaps most
        importantly, BioGeometry doesn't ask for students to take
        anything on faith. Rather it provides the tools to directly
        detect and monitor energies which shape the world around us,”
        said Dr. Gilbert. “I'm deeply grateful to the Egyptians who have
        made these secrets public for the first time. It's having a
        profound effect on a lot of people's lives.” </p>
      <p>Dr. Robert J. Gilbert is founder of Vesica: Spirit and Science
        Resources and the first non-Egyptian ever granted permission to
        teach certified trainings in BioGeometry. Vesica is offering a
        rare BioGeometry Foundation Training in San Diego from October 9
        -15, 2004. More information on BioGeometry, the foundation
        training and registration is available online at www.vesica.org

      <p>Those companies embracing the growing trend of custom designed,
        built-from-scratch workplaces might want to give Dr. Ibrahim
        Karim a call --- that is unless they want to risk spending
        millions to produce an office full of creativity-destroying
        energies. </p>
      <p>According to Karim, a proper office requires more than just
        comfortable chairs and soft lighting. As inventor of a science
        he calls biogeometry, Karim claims he can manipulate energy
        fields to create an office environment that produces healthy,
        happy, creative workers. </p>
      <p>“We can transform any building into an energy balancing and
        protective second skin,” he said. “You can raise the quality of
        life of [the employees]. They’ll feel more energized, more
        creative.” <br>
        Karim, a Zurich-trained architect and consultant to the Ministry
        of Scientific Research, said that the average office worker in
        Egypt or anywhere else toils away amid “architectural pollution”
        that can wreak havoc on both his body and mind. Each employee,
        Karim said, is like a “breeze trying to move through a heavy
        storm” of disruptive energy and electronic noise. “In any
        office, in any city, you’ll find a mess.” </p>
      <p>But biogeometry, Karim claimed, is the answer. After “measuring
        the interaction of energy fields” in a room or building, Karim
        will recommend changes in room color, furniture shape or
        orientation. Specially designed picture frames can be used to
        emit balancing energy. “Stand in front of one, and you’ll feel
        better within five minutes,” Karim said. Electronic devices such
        as computers or cellular phones inherently produce negative
        energy, but they can be rendered less disruptive by engraving
        special symbols into their sides. </p>
      <p>On the surface, biogeometry seems to borrow liberally from feng
        shui, an Asian design philosophy that attempts to manipulate
        energy through shape, color and decor. But Karim said
        biogeometry is based in modern physics, not feng shui, which
        anyway has become watered-down and faddish. “The old masters are
        gone, and the essence has been forgotten,” Karim said. <br>
        There’s another difference. Feng shui is an accepted part of
        Asian architectural practice, and a feng shui consultant is
        brought in at the start of construction projects in many Asian
        cities. Biogeometry isn’t quite there yet in the eyes of the
        local architectural or business community. Karim hasn’t been
        contracted to apply his philosophies that often in Egypt. He
        recently worked on energy adjustment at a Montessori school in
        Maadi, and he’s building his own re-sort in Ain Sukhna where
        everything from the furniture to the landscaping will be
        designed to give an energy boost. “We’re working on all levels,”
        he said. “It’s a health spa where the most important activity is
        just being there.” </p>
      <p>Karim gets a far more receptive reaction overseas. He’s spent
        several months working on energy modification at the industrial
        design building at Eindhoven in Holland, where he seems to be
        regarded as a genuine visionary. Most likely, Karim’s local
        profile will rise once Egyptians realize that the foreigners are
        taking him seriously. </p>
      <p>Among Karim’s architectural peers, reactions to his theories
        ranges from enthusiastic support to polite bemusement. Karim’s
        peers seem to give him a lot of leeway – partly because his
        father, Sayed Karim, is a legendary Cairo Uni-versity
        architecture professor who helped design Medinat Nasr, and
        partly because Karim carries the fervor of a true believer,
        offering free seminars and classes for curious architects and
        designers. Even architects who consider Karim a nut consider him
        a sincere nut. </p>
      <p>“Give the guy a chance,” said Cairo University architecture and
        urban planning professor Sayed Ettouney. “You know somebody is a
        crook when they’re after money or power. But he’s offering his
        knowledge as a service. He’s spending his own money on this.” </p>
      <p>Egypt’s medical establishment reacted less charitably when
        Karim ventured into their field by claiming he could regulate
        the body’s energy levels and heal the sick by using special
        “biosignature” symbols hung from necklaces or bracelets. In
        February, Karim appeared on the popular interview show Talk of
        the City, along with patients who said they’d been cured by his
        biosignatures. The response was immediate and twofold: first, he
        was denounced in print by the Doctors’ Syndicate and the
        minister of health; second, his Maadi office was swamped by
        desperate crowds seeking miracle cures. </p>
      <p>The controversy, and the fear that his office might be overrun,
        led Karim to cut back on seminars and medical treatments months
        ago. The gate of his Maadi villa now bears a large sign turning
        away medical cases with the blunt pronouncement, “This is an
        architecture office.” But the calls keep coming. </p>
      <p>“We get calls every day from people who think he can help them
        have children or cure their polio,” said Karim’s office
        director. “It’s like a he’s a fugitive. We have to hide him.” <br>
        Like any good magician, Karim is reluctant to get into the
        specifics of his work. Ask him to describe the basics of what
        shapes or colors create a healthy office energy level, and he’ll
        say he doesn’t want to get into “ready-made solutions.” Ask just
        how he discovered that this particular squiggly line can help
        cure liver failure or fight depression, and he’ll smile and say
        he worked on it for many years. Even his own students and
        devotees are stumped. </p>
      <p>“We asked where these come from, and he says, ‘Guys, that’s a
        very big subject. Let’s not get distracted,’” said Mu-hammed
        Samir, a young architect who took several of Karim’s free
        training seminars. But despite the absence of explanations,
        Samir believes that Karim is genuinely on to something. “People
        have been treated successfully. The re-sults are in front of
        us,” he said. “Where it comes from, we don’t know and he won’t
        say.” <br>

        <p><b><font size="+1">BioGeometry: The Egyptian Science of
              Energy --- An Interview with Dr. Robert J. Gilbert</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>[ Excerpts ]</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>What is BioGeometry?</b> </p>
      <p>BioGeometry is remarkable for how vast the possibilities are
        for applying it in virtually any field you can name! Because
        BioGeometry deals with the fundamental energies of Creation,
        those which are essential to human health and higher
        consciousness, it can be used to support and empower many
        different approaches to energy work. What I find particularly
        valuable are the tools which BioGeometry offers so that anyone
        can work tangibly with different energies rather than "assume"
        the energies are present or just follow someone else's
        techniques and hope for the best! BioGeometry offers methods to
        directly detect, measure, create, and transmute specific
        qualities of energy, so that you really know the effects you are
        creating with your energy work. It really is a huge step forward
        in the human race’s ability to understand and work responsibly
        with energy fields. And I believe this is just the beginning;
        many of those who train in BioGeometry will use this knowledge
        to further advance humanity’s work with energy into even more
        advanced levels which most of us can’t even imagine today. </p>
      <p>BioGeometry is a powerful science which shows how to use
        shapes, patterns, colors, sounds, and motion to create specific
        energy effects. It clearly identifies core principles as well as
        providing a wide range of practical techniques. BioGeometry does
        not ask for the student to take anything on faith, rather it
        provides the tools to directly detect and monitor the energies
        which shape the world around us. BioGeometry reveals publicly
        for the first time many of the ways which spiritual energy works
        in the world to create life, health, and consciousness,
        information which was previously restricted to small groups of
        spiritual initiates. Put simply, BioGeometry provides critical
        and unprecedented insights into the use of living energy for
        beneficial purposes; its simple but extremely powerful
        techniques can be used by anyone to help humans, animals,
        plants, and/or the environment. </p>
      <p><b>Can you give us any concrete examples of how BioGeometry has
          been applied in specific fields or projects?</b> </p>
      <p>Absolutely. BioGeometry has been studied and applied in a wide
        range of fields and projects, including studies at Egyptian and
        European Universities. Here is just a short list of successful
        studies: </p>
      <p>The Egyptian National Research Centre determined that
        BioGeometry forms could stop the replication of Bacteria, a
        result which they stated in their report that they could not
        explain according to modern scientific theory. </p>
      <p>Al Azhar University in Cairo conducted a national Hepatitis C
        Research Project under the sponsorship of the Egyptian
        Government, in which they evaluated a wide range of
        Pharmaceuticals and treatments that might help Hepatitis C
        sufferers. One of the methods evaluated was BioGeometry, with a
        particular group in the study given only a medallion with
        particular BioSignatures on it to correct their energy
        imbalances. At the end of 6 months, Dr. Taha Khalifa who headed
        the study announced on national Egyptian television that the
        most successful results in the whole study (with 90%
        normalization of enzyme levels on average, and some subjects
        with complete viral clearance) were enjoyed by the patients who
        were in the BioGeometry group. </p>
      <p>A project evaluated by an official of the Egyptian Department
        of Agriculture found that chickens grew up healthier and faster
        in an environment which was energy balanced by BioGeometry
        methods than they did with Antibiotics and Growth Hormones. </p>
      <p>Prof. Peter Mols of the Wageningen Agriculture University in
        Holland found that BioGeometry energy methods could be used in
        place of Pesticides and Artificial Fertilizers to grow healthy
        organic crops with a greatly extended shelf life. </p>
      <p>A 1998 agricultural project on the Red Sea headed by Adel Ammar
        discovered that crops could actually grow better in salt water
        than in fresh water if the salt water was treated with
        BioGeometry energy methods. </p>
      <p>This is not even to mention the tremendous amount of anecdotal
        evidence from people who report having all types of different
        conditions helped by BioGeometry methods; even a Reuters New
        Service article carried by CNN.com and ABCNews.com contained
        such reports. Of course we do not make any medical claims
        whatsoever for BioGeometry; no system that uses subtle energies
        can make such claims, since the dominant medical and scientific
        model asserts that these subtle energies don’t even exist. So we
        just tell people to learn the system and make up their own minds
        from the results they get! </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">What the Ancient Egyptians Knew... And
              Modern Scientists Can't Explain</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>CAIRO EGYPT, August 5 1993: A team of researchers at the
        Egyptian National Research Centre watches as an Egyptian
        Architect places a simple geometric form over a culture of
        bacteria. Reputed to be a master of the lost energy science of
        Ancient Egypt, the Architect has been brought to the Centre to
        test his ability to create specific energy effects through the
        use of shapes, sounds, colors, and movements. The researchers
        are certain that they will easily discredit such ‘nonsense’ by
        designing controlled experiments to test his abilities. </p>
      <p>To their amazement, the Architect’s claim to be able to stop
        the replication of the bacteria through the subtle energy
        emitted by a simple geometric form proves true. In the report of
        the experiment released by the Head of the Department of
        Microbial Chemistry, he notes “quite a noticeable cessation of
        the growth of Saccharomyses cerevisiae was observed... the
        essence of this type of interaction seems to surpass explanation
        through our traditional and classical knowledge in basic
        science.” </p>
      <p>After this success, other scientists and researchers took up
        the challenge of testing the Egyptian Architect’s energy
        methods; in every case they are confounded by the powerful
        effects: </p>
      <p>Al Azhar University in Cairo conducted a national Hepatitis C
        Research Project in which they evaluated a wide range of
        Pharmaceuticals and alternative treatments. One of the methods
        evaluated was a medallion which held hundreds of tiny energy
        patterns termed ‘BioSignatures’, which the Architect had
        determined would balance the energy of Hepatitis C sufferers. At
        the end of 6 months, Dr. Taha Khalifa, head of the study,
        announced on national Egyptian television that the most
        successful results in the whole study ––with 90% normalization
        of enzyme levels on average, and some subjects with complete
        viral clearance–– were enjoyed by the patients whose only
        treatment had been wearing the medallion. </p>
      <p>Professor Peter Mols of Wageningen Agriculture University in
        Holland found that BioGeometry energy methods could be used in
        place of Pesticides and Artificial Fertilizers to grow healthy
        organic crops with a greatly extended shelf life. </p>
      <p>An agricultural project on the Red Sea headed by Adel Ammar
        discovered that crops could actually grow better with salt water
        irrigation than in fresh water if the salt water was first
        treated with these subtle energy methods. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Geometric shapes and techniques, along with
        the methodology behind them, invented to produce a qualitative
        energy balancing effect on biological systems, be it human
        beings or otherwise. This results in a positive effect on
        biological functions, either preventative or healing, and
        protection from environmental energy disturbances. The
        methodology introduced by the inventor is the discovery of the
        qualitative energy components of earth energy power-spots
        {specifically those components are qualitative higher harmonics
        of the frequencies of gold and ultra-violet, and a carrier wave
        in the negative green of the energy spectrum} and development of
        geometric shapes and techniques to reproduce and amplify that
        energy balancing quality. This methodology has been
        termed/copyrighted "BioGeometry" by the inventor. The geometric
        shapes and techniques work either directly through proximity to
        the biological system or from within its surrounding
        environment, or by superimposing on a radiating energy source
        that reaches the biological system. The two techniques are: (1)
        Using two of the shape (Fig. 4) as geometric polarizers and
        orienting them in relation to a central axis to produce the
        energy balancing quality as in (Fig 7) and termed "BioGeometry
        Dial", (2) Using shape (Fig. 4) as an individual geometric
        polarizer and aligning samples of materials from the biological
        system itself or its environment to produce the energy balancing
        effect (Fig. 8) and termed "Energy Balancing Wheel" when in
        two-dimensional form and "Energy Balancing Sphere" when in
        three-dimensional form. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Linear diagrams (Figures 1 to 247) tracing
        and corresponding to the functional paths of subtle energy flow
        within the organs of the human body to restore proper flow and
        energy balancing through resonance. This results in a positive
        effect on biological functions, either preventative or healing,
        and protection from environmental energy disturbances. The
        diagrams are activated by the body's peripheral energy field,
        which is channeled through the linear diagrams, and enters into
        resonance with the functions of the organs they correspond to.
        The energy balancing effect and restoration of proper energy
        flow within the organs can be introduced by the diagrams either
        by proximity to the human body, or by superimposing on a
