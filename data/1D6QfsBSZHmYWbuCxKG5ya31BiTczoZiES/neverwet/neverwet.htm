          <br>
          <b>James Vincent &nbsp;</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          A spray on treatment that makes any object repel liquid has
          been launched into the US market. This is NeverWet, a
          superhydrobphobic coating that can be applied to nearly any
          surface.<br>
          <br>
          Consumers can now buy the two cans (capable of treating 10 to
          15 square feet) for $19.97 from Home Depot. Surfaces that the
          spray can be applied to include fabrics, wood, metal and
          plastics. The treatement consists of two coatings, each of
          which takes 30 minutes to dry.<br>
          <br>
          NeverWet have not yet given official figures on how long the
          superhydrophobia will last in various situations, but claim
          that treatments have “remained under seawater for over a year
          and reemerged completely dry.”<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, when the treatment is applied to glass it
          causes the surface to become frosted, though the company
          behind the product promise that a clear-drying version is in
          development.<br>
          <br>
          A demonstration video (below) shows NeverWet in action,
          including waterproofing an iPhone (something that instructions
          for NeverWet explicitly warns against), a toilet brush, a
          t-shirt and a pair of shoes.<br>
          <br>
          Superhydrophobic surfaces works by increasing the contact
          angle between water droplets and the coated surface through
          creating a low surface chemistry and a smooth surface –
          essentially this changes whether each individual droplet&nbsp;
          remains a ball when it rests on a surface, or whether it
          spreads out.<br>
          <br>
          Hydrophilic surfaces (surfaces that soak up water) have a
          contact angle of less than 90 degrees. Hydrophobic surfaces
          have a contact angle of above 90 degrees, but superhydrophobic
          surfaces have a contact angel of above 150 degrees.<br>
          <br>
          NeverWet coatings creating a contact angle of between 160 and
          175 degrees (by comparison, the non-stick coating on a Teflon
          pan is a 95 degrees contact angle). These are hard concepts to
          understand without talking about surface tension and why water
          molecules want to minimise their exposure to what is
          non-water. <br>

          At NeverWet, we have developed a super hydrophobic coating
          that completely repels water and heavy oils. Any object coated
          with our NeverWet™ coating literally cannot be touched by
          liquid. Any liquid placed on this coating is repelled and
          simply rolls off without touching the underlying surface. Not
          only is this amazing to see, but it solves a myriad of
          problems. <br>

          For one Lancaster County company, necessity was indeed the
          mother of invention.<br>
          <br>
          About three years ago, Ross Technology Corp. needed a better
          way to reduce corrosion on the steel products it makes here.<br>
          <br>
          When they couldn't find a suitable one, they worked on
          creating something on their own.<br>
          <br>
          And eventually they hit upon a slick product that's led to a
          whole new business.<br>
          <br>
          That product is NeverWet, a silicon-based spray-on coating
          that repels water and heavy oils.<br>
          <br>
          "When we started getting it to work, we realized it solved a
          lot of problems rather than just corrosion," said Andy Jones,
          who leads the new effort.<br>
          <br>
          Jones is the president of Ross Nanotechnology, the subsidiary
          of Ross Technology Corp. that was formed to develop NeverWet.<br>
          <br>
          The company now employs 12 scientists, chemists and engineers.<br>
          <br>
          They work out of a lab at the Ross Technology headquarters in
          the Conestoga Valley Industrial Park.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to fighting corrosion, NeverWet's nano-particle
          coating keeps things clean, dry and free of bacteria and ice.<br>
          <br>
          Jones said that once they found a coating that worked on
          metal, they created different formulations that adhere better
          to other surfaces, including clothing, plastics and cookware.<br>
          <br>
          The cookware formulation also was tweaked so it can better
          handle high temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          "Anywhere you don't want corrosion, or ice or things to get
          wet, this works well," Jones said.<br>
          <br>
          "When you start thinking about it, there are a lot of places
          where that's good."<br>
          <br>
          Jones quickly mentioned a number of additional possibilities.<br>
          <br>
          NeverWet could make ovens, toilet plungers and bed pans a
          cinch to clean, packaging resist water and white boards free
          of "ghost" images, he said.<br>
          <br>
          Another application is safeguarding electronics.<br>
          <br>
          "I sprayed my iPhone with NeverWet, submerged it in a foot of
          water for 30 minutes, took it out and it was good to go,"
          Jones said.<br>
          <br>
          Ross Nanotechnology isn't the only organization that likes
          what it sees in NeverWet.<br>
          <br>
          In June, NeverWet won the top prize at InventHelp's INPEX
          trade show in Pittsburgh. NeverWet also won a gold medal in
          the science category.<br>
          <br>
          The event showcases new products and innovations that are
          available for business and industry to manufacture, license or
          distribute.<br>
          <br>
          Jones said Ross Nanotechnology began licensing the NeverWet
          technology to other manufacturers about two years ago.<br>
          <br>
          It has sold four licenses to date and has numerous deals under
          discussion with potential licensees who'd use it on the
          products they manufacture.<br>
          <br>
          The decision is a time- and labor-intensive exercise.<br>
          <br>
          "Everybody has their own processes, so it takes a year or more
          of testing (before they decide whether to use NeverWet),"
          Jones said.<br>
          <br>
          "That's the painful part of this business."<br>
          <br>
          Ross Nanotechnology is focusing on a handful of niche markets,
          he said.<br>
          <br>
          Though declining to disclose Ross Nanotechnology's sales
          figures, Jones said the company is "small now but growing
          quickly."<br>
          <br>
          And, Jones said he expects to see some significant product
          launches in early 2012.<br>
          <br>
          These would include the first retail version of NeverWet for
          use by consumers.<br>
          <br>
          During a recent visit to the company's headquarters, Jones
          showed off NeverWet's capabilities in what seemed like a
          series of magic tricks.<br>
          <br>
          On hard surfaces such as glass and ceramic that were treated
          with NeverWet, water turned into nearly spherical balls that
          shot in all directions.<br>
          <br>
          A cotton shirt shed water. A canvas shoe repelled chocolate
          syrup and was left perfectly white.<br>
          <br>
          "Shoe people are all over us," eager to buy a NeverWet
          license. "If you pay $200 for a pair of shoes, you want them
          to stay clean," he said.<br>
          <br>
          Ross Nanotechnology has yet to license NeverWet to a shoe
          manufacturer, though, Jones said.<br>
          <br>
          What's the secret behind NeverWet?<br>
          <br>
          NeverWet — which has 13 patents pending — works much as
          Scotchgard does in protecting furniture, carpets and other
          surfaces. That is, it creates a very high contact angle for
          water on a surface, Jones explained.<br>
          <br>
          A drop of water that lies flat on a surface has a contact
          angle of zero percent, but if the droplet forms into a perfect
          circle, it has an angle of 180 degrees.<br>
          <br>
          Human skin provides a surface angle of 75 to 90 degrees, Jones
          said. Car wax provides a surface angle of about 95 degrees.
          Scotchgard has an angle as high as 116 degrees.<br>
          <br>
          In contrast, NeverWet has a contact angle as high as 165
          degrees, which means water forms an almost perfect sphere.<br>
          <br>
          Because of that shape, the water is repelled.<br>
          <br>
          Materials scientist Vinod Sikka, Ross Nanotechnology's
          director of research and development, played a key role in
          inventing NeverWet, Jones said.<br>
          <br>
          Sikka previously spent 34 years at Oak Ridge National
          Laboratory, where he became manager of research and technology
          development.<br>
          <br>
          But having a superior product alone isn't enough to guarantee
          commercial success, Jones points out.<br>
          <br>
          "It's challenging to break into the coatings market. People
          have been using the same stuff from the same suppliers for a
          long time," he said.<br>
          <br>
          Jones sees lots of potential for NeverWet, though.<br>
          <br>
          "It is very novel, and when you start thinking about it, you
          can think about how transformative the technology can be,"
          Jones said. "You can use it everywhere."<br>

          A superhydrophobic spray-on coating set to launch next year
          could dramatically change our perception of the phrase "water
          resistant."<br>
          <br>
          NeverWet is a patent-pending silicon-based covering that
          deflects nearly all liquids and heavy oils by creating a very
          high contact angle upon application. The angle is much higher
          than traditional substrates, such as car wax (90 degrees),
          Teflon (95 degrees), or Rain-X (110 degrees). Liquid literally
          glides off NeverWet's 160 degree to 175 degree angle in a way
          that almost seems like computer animation, as seen in the
          video below.<br>

          which is extremely difficult to get wet.<br>

          <br>
          At first glance, the mind-bending NeverWet comes across as a
          liquid repellent, but it is much more than that. Surfaces that
          are sprayed with NeverWet repel ice, corrosion, and even
          bacteria. The company behind the product, Ross
          Nanotechnologies, says on its Web site that the material does
          not fade in strength from blasts of high pressure. In fact, it
          even states that NeverWet-infused materials "have remained
          under seawater for over a year and reemerged completely dry."<br>
          <br>
          A dramatic video by the company also demonstrates something
          unbelievable: a waterproof iPhone. A video shows an iPhone
          covered in NeverWet, sitting in a bowl of water for 30
          minutes, remaining fully functional the entire time it is
          submerged. Other potential applications include a variety of
          objects and places, such as shoes, electrical equipment,
          clothing, hospitals, bathroom products, and much more.<br>
          <br>
          Lancaster Online has an informative interview with several of
          the people behind NeverWet, including co-inventor Vinod Sikka.
          He admits to the Pennsylvania newspaper, "It's challenging to
          break into the coatings market. People have been using the
          same stuff from the same suppliers for a long time. It is very
          novel, and when you start thinking about it, you can think
          about how transformative the technology can be," Jones said.
          "You can use it everywhere." <br>

          The present disclosure describes compositions comprising an
          acrylic polymer binder and nano-particles less than about
          100nm that provide a hydrophobic or superhydrophobic coating
          that may also display oleophobicity. The coating composition
          may advantageously be prepared using VOC exempt compounds that
          are compatible with a variety of surface materials including
          many electronic components. In addition, the coating

          Coating compositions for the preparation of superhydrophobic
          (SH) and/or oleophobic (OP) surfaces that employ low amounts
          of volatile organic compounds are described. Also described
          are the resulting coatings/coated surfaces and methods of
          their preparation. Such coatings/surfaces have a variety of
          uses, including their ability to prevent or resist water, dirt
          and/or ice from attaching to a surface.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The superhydrophobic (SH) and superoleophobic surfaces are
          defined as those where water or oil droplet contact angles
          exceed 150[deg.]. Such surfaces have a variety of uses,
          including their ability to prevent or resist water, dirt
          and/or ice from attaching to a surface. A variety of
          hydrophobic and oleophobic surface coating compositions have
          been described that employ high amounts of volatile organic
          compounds (VOCs) including those that participate in
          atmospheric photochemical reactions. Those contrast with the
          coating compositions described herein that utilize water
          and/or VOC- exempt organic solvents that have been found to
          undergo limited amounts of atmospheric photochemical reactions
          and lower amounts of photochemically active VOCs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This disclosure sets forth coating compositions that employ
          water-based binder systems that have a low VOC content and/or
          low non-exempt VOC content, thereby providing a variety of
          environmental benefits in their application. The coating
          compositions described herein remain substantially
          hydrophobic/oleophobic even when abraded, and have increased
          durability and/or life span when subjected to normal wear and
          tear compared to coatings where hydrophobic and/or oleophobic
          components are restricted to the coating's surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b>LOW VOC COATINGS</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Compositions for forming hydrophobic and/or oleophobic
          coatings described in this disclosure include one-step
          compositions that employ water-based polyurethanes (or
          combinations of water based polyurethanes) as a binder in
          combination with one or more types of second particles. The
          compositions set forth in this disclosure may optionally
          include one or more types of first particles in addition to
          third particles.<br>
          <br>
          The low VOC coating compositions described herein provide
          coatings that do not lose hydrophobicity and/or oleophobicity
          when their surface is abraded. As the coatings do not lose
          hydrophobicity and/or oleophobicity when abraded, the coatings
          permit thickness to be used as the basis to increase the
          abrasion resistance and durability.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Binders</b><br>
          <br>
          To reduce the amount of VOC's, particularly non-exempt VOC's,
          that are released from coating compositions used to prepare
          hydrophobic and/or oleophobic coatings, water-based (also
          denoted as waterborne) binders may be used to prepare coating
          compositions that result in SH and/or OP coatings, including
          water-based polyurethanes (e.g., water-based polyurethane
          dispersions (PUDs), emulsions, and/or suspension).<br>
          <br>
          In addition to low volatile organic compound content,
          water-based polyurethanes permit the formation of hydrophobic
          and/or oleophobic coatings that remain substantially
          hydrophobic and/or oleophobic even after substantial surface
          abrasion. Moreover, water-based polyurethanes offer mechanical
          flexibility, size/dimensional stability of the dried and cured
          coating, and they can resist embrittlement due to heat and/or
          light exposure. UV curable versions of water-based
          polyurethanes (e.g., PUDs) are also available that avoid the
          need to heat cure coatings, which is economically and
          environmentally desirable due to reduced energy expenditure
          associated with light cureable coating applications relative
          to those requiring or whose curing is enhanced by heating.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1.1 Water-Based Polyurethanes As Binders</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          A wide variety of water-based polyurethanes (polyurethane
          coating compositions comprising more than insubstantial
          amounts of water as a solvent and/or diluent) may be used to
          prepare hydrophobic and/or oleophobic coatings described
          herein. Polyurethanes are polymers consisting of a chain of
          organic units joined by urethane (carbamate) linkages.
          Polyurethane polymers are typically formed through
          polymerization of at least one type of monomer containing at
          least two isocyanate functional groups with at least one other
          monomer containing at least two hydroxyl (alcohol) groups. A
          catalyst may be employed to speed the polymerization reaction.
          Other components may be present in the polyurethane coating
          compositions to impart desirable properties including, but not
          limited to, surfactants and other additives that bring about
          the carbamate forming reaction(s) yielding a coating of the
          desired properties in a desired cure time.<br>
          <br>
          In some embodiments, the polyurethane employed in the durable
          coatings may be formed from a polyisocyanate and a mixture of
          -OH (hydroxyl) and NH (amine) terminated monomers. In such
          systems the polyisocyanate can be a trimer or homopolymer of
          hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI).<br>
          <br>
          <b>HDI Trimer Polyalcohol Polyurethane</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Some solvents compatible with such systems include water,
          n-butyl acetate, toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene,
          cyclohexanone, isopropyl acetate, N-methyl pyrrolidone, and
          methyl isobutyl ketone and mixtures thereof; although not all
          of these solvents are VOC-exempt.<br>
          <br>
          A variety of water-based (waterborne) polyurethane
          compositions may be employed for the preparation of
          hydrophobic, SH and/or oleophobic surfaces may be employed.
          Among the commercial water-based polyurethanes that may be
          employed in the preparation of SH and OP surfaces are those
          that comprise polycarbonate, polyester, polyethers and/or
          polyacrylic urethanes, and their aliphatic counterparts
          (aliphatic polyester urethane resins, aliphatic polycarbonate
          urethane resins, and/or aliphatic acrylic urethanes. The
          structures of some examples of polyacrylic urethanes,
          polyester urethanes, and polycarbonate urethanes are provided
          below...<br>

          distributed by their ma ufacturers. TO 40 g amounts of each
          mixture was added 4.4, 6.0, and 8.0 g (i.e., 11%, 15%, and
          20%) of CAB-O- SIL TS720. Also added to each mixture was 20-g
          (50%) water. All percentages are calculated and based on 100 g
          of 60:40 mixture. The compositions were each mixed using steel
          balls or a low impact mixer.<br>
          <br>
          Each mixture was sprayed (using an air gun) on 4x 4-in square
          steel plates at five different thicknesses. All of the plates
          were air-dried for 30 niin prior to drying in an oven at
          200[deg.]F for 30-40 min. Each plate was subjected to
          thickness measurement, surface roughness measurement (Ra and
          Rz values), and wear resistance using a Taber abrader (Taber
          abrasion). All Taber abrasion measurements were obtained using
          250-g load and CS10 wheels. Data are summarized in Table 5 and
          plotted in Figs. 6-8. Figures 6 and shows the plot of surface
          roughness, Ra and Rz values respectively. Figure 8 shows Taber

          Corvel Black - 2.8 grams and<br>
          H20 - 20.0 grams<br>
          was prepared by blending the components as follows:<br>
          BAYHYDROL(R) 124 (24.0 grams) and POLANE(R) 700T (16.0 grams)
          were blended together for 20 minutes. The addition of M5T (9.0
          grams, M5 silica treated with<br>
          (3, 3,4,4,5,5,6,6, 6-Nonafluorohexyl)trichlorosilane (SIN
          6597.6)) to the solution was followed by mixing in a ball mill
          for 30 minutes. Addition of Corvel Black (2.8 grams) and H20
          (20.0 grams) to the solution was followed by an additional 30
          minutes of mixing in a ball mill.<br>
          The coating was applied using a Central Pneumatic spray gun
          with the nozzle size of 0.020-0.025 inches. A coating
          thickness of 1.2-1.4 mils was applied to a 4 x 4 inch
          Al-plate. The plate was cured at room temperature for 30
          minutes followed by curing at 200F for 1-2 hours. After
          curing, the plates were tested for superhydrophobicity,
          oleophobicity, Taber abrasion resistance, and shower
          resistance to loss of superhydrophobicity. The results of the
          tests show the coating displays superhydrophobicity (contact
          angle = 167.33, after Taber abrasion testing = (155.23). The
          coatings also display oleophobic/superoleophobic behavior
          (contact angle = 153.67). The coating lost its
          superhydrophobicity after 500 Taber abrasion cycles with a
          250gram load. Superhydrophobicity is lost after 55-60 minutes
          in shower testing (described above); however,
          superhydrophobicity returns after drying.<br>
