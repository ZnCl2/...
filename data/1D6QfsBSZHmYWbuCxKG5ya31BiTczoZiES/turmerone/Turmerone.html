      ...Now, an exciting new study published in the journal Stem Cell
      Research &amp; Therapy provides additional support for the concept
      that curcumin alone is not enough to explain the healing power of
      turmeric as a whole plant. The study found that a little known,
      fat-soluble component within turmeric – Ar-tumerone – may make "a
      promising candidate to support regeneration in neurologic
      disease."<br>
      <br>
      Titled, "Aromatic-turmerone induces neural stem cell proliferation
      in vitro and in vivo," German researchers evaluated the effects of
      this turmeric-derived compound on neural stem cells (NSCs) – the
      subgroup of brain cells capable of continuous self-renewal
      required for brain repair.<br>
      <br>
      The study found that when brain cells were exposed to ar-tumerone,
      neural stem cells increased in number through enhanced
      proliferation. Moreover, these newly formed neural stem cells also
      increased the number of fully differentiated neuronal cells,
      indicating a healing effect was taking place. This effect was also
      observed in a live animal model, showing that rats injected with
      ar-tumerone into their brains experienced increases in neural stem
      cell proliferation and the creation of newly formed healthy brain
      cells...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Aromatic (ar-) turmerone is a major bioactive compound of the herb
      Curcuma longa. It has been suggested that ar-turmerone inhibits
      microglia activation, a property that may be useful in treating
      neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, the effects of
      ar-turmerone on neural stem cells (NSCs) remain to be
      investigated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      We exposed primary fetal rat NSCs to various concentrations of
      ar-turmerone. Thereafter, cell proliferation and differentiation
      potential were assessed. In vivo, naïve rats were treated with a
      single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of ar-turmerone.
      Proliferative activity of endogenous NSCs was assessed in vivo, by
      using noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and
      the tracer [18F]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([18F]FLT), as well as ex
      vivo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      In vitro, ar-turmerone increased dose-dependently the number of
      cultured NSCs, because of an increase in NSC proliferation
      (P &lt; 0.01). Proliferation data were supported by qPCR-data for
      Ki-67 mRNA. In vitro as well as in vivo, ar-turmerone promoted
      neuronal differentiation of NSCs. In vivo, after i.c.v. injection
      of ar-turmerone, proliferating NSCs were mobilized from the
      subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus of adult rats, as
      demonstrated by both [18F]FLT-PET and histology (P &lt; 0.05).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that ar-turmerone induces
      NSC proliferation. Ar-turmerone thus constitutes a promising
      candidate to support regeneration in neurologic disease…<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2. Ar-turmerone induces neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
      (A) NSCs were allowed to differentiate in the absence (control) or
      presence of 6.25 μg/ml ar-turmerone. Immunocytochemistry 10 days
      after growth-factor discontinuation revealed fewer
      undifferentiated (SOX2+) NSCs in the turmerone-treated group, but
      more young neurons. The generation of astrocytes and
      oligodendrocytes was not affected by ar-turmerone (mean ± SEM;
      **P &lt; 0.01, compared with control). (B) Representative images
      of differentiated cells include CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes
      (left), TuJ1-positive young neurons (middle), and GFAP-positive
      astrocytes (right); bar represents 50 μm. (C) After i.c.v.
      injection of 3 mg (1 mg/μl) ar-turmerone, significantly more
      DCX-positive neuroblasts were observed in the SVZ compared with
      placebo-injected control animals (mean ± SEM; **P &lt; 0.01). (D)
      Representative staining of DCX-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ
      (bar represents 50 μm)... <br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      In this study, we investigated the effects of ar-turmerone on NSCs
      in vitro and in vivo. Ar-turmerone increased the number of NSCs
      both in cell culture and in the adult rat brain in vivo. This
      increase resulted from enhanced NSC proliferation and led to
      promoted neurogenesis during differentiation. In vivo,
      ar-turmerone mobilized endogenous NSCs from both neurogenic
      niches, the SVZ and the hippocampus. We propose that ar-turmerone
      constitutes a promising future drug candidate to support
      regeneration in neurologic disorders.<br>

      neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to the anticonvulsant
      activity of turmeric oil and its volatile bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, β-turmerone (curlone)
      and α-atlantone, as an anticonvulsant agent for the treatment of

      mood disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, attention
      deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia), and
      neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder that affects
      approximately 50 million people worldwide (1). According to the
      World Health Organization (WHO), about 1% of the total burden of
      disease corresponds to various forms of epilepsy. Its
      pharmacologic treatment comprises a number of currently available
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (2). The main problem concerning AEDs
      is the high incidence of side effects ranging from
      gastrointestinal distress, hepatotoxicity, depression, cognitive
      impairment and even refractory seizures (2) (3) (4) (5) (6).
      Moreover, about one third of patients suffering from epilepsy
      remain resistant to available treatments (1) (2). Hence, there is
      a clear need to continue to identify novel AEDs that control
      seizures with minimal adverse effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Medicinal plants and the chemical compounds contained
      therein represent a potential source of novel AEDs. Numerous
      studies on the use of ethnomedicinal plants for the treatment of
      seizures have been reported (7). Small molecule compounds and
      essential oils extracted from plants have been shown to exhibit
      anticonvulsant properties (18) (19) (20). One compound,
      losigamone, derived from the kava kava plant and originally used
      by traditional healers in the South Pacific as an anxiolytic, is
      now in early clinical development as a novel antiepileptic drug
      (8) (9). Another plant, Curcuma longa L., is a medicinal perennial
      herb of the Zingiberaceae family native to South Asia. It has been
      traditionally used as a carminative, laxative, anthelmintic and as
      a treatment for liver disorders. The powder of its rhizomes,
      turmeric, has been used not only as a condiment and color additive
      in food but also in traditional medicine against epilepsy (10).
      Its major active chemical constituents are the curcuminoids (3-5%)
      and the volatile turmeric oil (2-7%). Turmeric oil is mainly
      composed of bisabolene sesquiterpenoids: ar-, α-, β-, turmerone,
      α-atlantone and curlone, whereas the curcuminoids include
      curcumin, monodemethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Nearly
      all investigations on the medicinal properties of turmeric have
      been focused on curcumin, whose anticonvulsant activities have
      been demonstrated in several rodent models such as the
      iron-induced epileptogenesis (11), maximal electroshock (12),
      kainic acid-induced (13) and pentylenetetrazole-kindling (14)
      models. However, while a few studies on the neuroprotective
      activity of turmeric oil have been performed (15) (16) (17), a
      specific link between anticonvulsant activity and non-curcuminoid
      compounds such as volatile turmeric oil or bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids has not been evaluated. Notably, previous studies
      on the volatile constituents of turmeric oil were limited due to
      the complex isolation steps involved.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Described herein is a practical method to isolate the main
      constituents of turmeric oil through RP-HPLC. The isolated
      compounds were individually evaluated in two vertebrate model
      systems: the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the mouse (Mus musculus).
      Over the past decade, the zebrafish has emerged as a valuable
      model for genetic studies and drug screening. The strength of this
      in vivo model relies on its high genetic, physiologic and
      pharmacologic homology to humans. Their high fecundity and small
      size allow for the performance of tests in a medium- to
      high-throughput fashion using minute (microgram-scale) quantities
      of compound. The zebrafish also holds promise as an in vivo model
      for identifying novel neuroactive compounds since the
      dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems develop early
      during embryogenesis and are already functional in larvae (21). In
      addition, their rapid development ex utero and optical
      transparency makes it possible to easily detect morphological and
      behavioral effects of test compounds on living embryos and larvae
      (22).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] More recently, zebrafish have also proven useful for the
      primary screening of potential novel anticonvulsants (23) (24)
      (25). An acute zebrafish seizure model based on the proconvulsant
      pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) has been described (23). The exposure of
      zebrafish larvae to PTZ evoked a sequence of behavioral changes,
      which were classified into three phases: a notable increase in
      swimming activity (stage I); rapid “whirlpool-like” circular
      swimming motion (stage II), and clonic movements with subsequent
      loss of posture and loss of movement for 1-3 seconds followed by
      tonic contractions (stage III) (23). In addition,
      electrophysiological recordings confirmed that zebrafish larval
      brains treated with PTZ displayed a series of ictal and interictal
      discharges. A follow-up study validated this zebrafish
      chemoconvulsant model by showing that 13 out of 14 clinically used
      AEDs were capable of suppressing PTZ-induced seizure behaviors in
      zebrafish (24).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the course of screening a series of medicinal plants for
      their potential anticonvulsant activities in the zebrafish PTZ
      chemoconvulsant model, we confirmed the reported anticonvulsant
      properties of curcumin. Surprisingly, however, further testing of
      turmeric oil and its chromatographic fractions revealed additional
      constituents capable of suppressing PTZ-induced seizure behaviors
      in larval zebrafish. Mass spectrometry and NMR analysis of these
      active purified fractions revealed them to belong to the
      bisabolene sesquiterpenoids ar-turmerone, α-, β-turmerone
      (curlone) and α-atlantone. The anticonvulsant activities
      identified using the zebrafish PTZ assay were then confirmed in
      the equivalent mouse PTZ-induced seizure model and the 6 Hz
      psychomotor seizure model of partial epilepsy. Additionally, an
      assessment on motor coordination and balance was performed jn mice
      using the elevated bridge after i.v. injection of ar-turmerone in
      order to determine any side effects leading to motor impairment.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There have been some publication providing turmeric
      extracts, for use in medicine, however, none of them provides the
      use thereof as an anticonvulsant agent in the treatment of
      disorders of the central nervous system. For example WO2007109210
      and WO2010045577 provide extracts of curcuma plants, and methods
      of treating neurodegenerative disorders such as disorders
      associated with amyloid plaque aggregation or fibril formation
      (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), however, neither patent application
      discloses or suggests a potential use of curcuma extracts as
      anticonvulsant agents. WO2011080090 provides formulations of
      turmeric oil having anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or
      anti-cancer activities, however, again it neither discloses nor
      suggests a potential use of curcuma extracts as anticonvulsant
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Even more, it is known that bisabolene-type
      sesquiterpenoids exhibit Acetylcholine esterase inhibitory
      activity (41), whereas it has also been shown that AChE blockers,
      in general induce seizures and may lead to status epilepticus,
      resulting in spontaneous seizures following a latent period (42).
      It was therefore surprising to find that bisabolene-type
      sesquiterpenoids are in fact capable of reducing the extent of
      epileptic seizures, rendering them suitable as anticonvulsant
      agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] A first aspect of the present invention relates to a
      bisabolene sesquiterpenoid for use as an anticonvulsant agent in
      disorders of the central nervous system. One or more bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids may be used either alone or in combination. The
      bisabolene sesquiterpenoids may be a sesquiterpenoid of turmeric
      oil. In some embodiments, the bisabolene sesquiterpenoids are
      isolated from turmeric oil. The Curcuma longa L plant may be a
      source for turmeric oil and/or bisabolene sesquiterpenoids. Other
      sources for bisabolene sesquiterpenoids include, but are not
      limited to, essential oils from plants (for example Peltphorum
      dasyrachis Kurz ex Bakar (Yellow Batai)), insects, natural
      products produced by living organisms (for example, honeycomb
      extract), fungi, bacteria, and/or microorganisms. Bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids may also be produced via chemical synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] “Bisabolenes” are a group of closely related natural
      chemical compounds which are classified as sesquiterpenes (a class
      of terpenes consisting of three isoprene units). Biochemical
      modifications such as oxidation or rearrangement produce the
      related sesquiterpenoids.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The term “turmeric” is also interchangeable with “curcuma”
      and includes plants, clones, variants and sports from the plant
      Zingiberaceae family. In particular, turmeric includes plants,
      clones, variants and sports from the plant genus Curcuma; more in
      particular Curcuma longa L. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment,
      the turmeric oil is from a Curcuma genus in particular Curcuma
      longa L. Turmeric, and in particular its rhizomes, contains about
      3-5% of curcuminoids, such as curcumin and about 2-7% of turmeric
      oil. A “rhizome” is a stem of a plant which is usually found
      underground, often sending out roots and shoots from its nodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] “Turmeric oil” can be obtained as detailed herein below in
      the examples, such as by hydro-distillation of dried rhizome
      powder of Curcuma. However, it may also be obtained via any other
      suitable way. Turmeric oil is mainly composed of bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids: ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, β-turmerone and
      α-atlantone, and thus in a particular embodiment, the present
      invention provides ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, β-turmerone and/or
      α-atlantone for use as an anticonvulsant agent in disorders of the
      central nervous system. In certain embodiments, ar-turmerone,
      α-turmerone, β-turmerone, and α-atlantone are administered singly.
      In some embodiments, ar-turmerone is administered in combination
      with α-turmerone, β-turmerone, and/or α-atlantone. Ar-turmerone
      may also be adminstered with one or more of turmerone,
      β-turmerone, and/or α-atlantone. In certain embodiments,
      α-turmerone is administered in combination with ar-turmerone,
      β-turmerone and/or α-atlantone. α-turmerone may also be
      administered in combination with one or more of ar-turmerone,
      β-turmerone and/or α-atlantone. In some embodiments, β-turmerone
      is administered in combination with ar-turmerone, α-turmerone,
      and/or α-atlantone. β-turmerone may be administered in combination
      with one or more of ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, and/or α-atlantone.
      In certain embodiments, α-atlantone may be administered in
      combination with ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, and/or β-turmerone.
      α-atlantone may be administered in combination with one or more of
      ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, and/or β-turmerone. When two or more
      compounds are administered, the administration may be simultaneous
      or serial.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Turmeric oil and/or bisabolene sesquiterpenoids are
      lipophilic and cross the blood-brain barrier and other cell
      membranes, a quality which may enhance bioavailability of the
      compounds in the nervous system. Thus, the use of tumeric oil
      and/or bisabolene sesquiterpenoids confers advantages over the use
      of other compounds such as curcumin. Curcumin is also a component
      of the Curcuma longa L plant, and a compound to which the
      anticonvulsant activity of Curcuma has been attributed (11) (12)
      (32). However, certain formulations of curcumin are readily
      converted to water soluble metabolites in the intestines and
      excreted, so that little of the compound reaches the blood or the
      nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The term “anticonvulsant agent” as used herein is meant to
      include any compound suitable for the treatment of epileptic
      seizures, bipolar disorders, mood disorders and/or neuropathic
      pain. Epileptic seizures may result from any abnormal, excessive,
      or hypersynchronous neuronal activity in the brain. In some
      embodiments, epileptic seizures which require treatment with
      anticonvulsants are caused by infection, stroke, trauma, fever,
      tumors, drug use, damage to the blood-brain barrier, and/or
      neurodegenerative disease. In certain embodiments, epileptic
      seizures are triggered by emotional state, by response to light
      and/or sound, sleep, sleep deprivation, hormones, metabolic
      disorders, and/or congenital defects. Epileptic seizures for which
      the anticonvulsants disclosed herein provide treatment may be
      classified as partial seizures, such as simple partial seizures
      and/or complex partial seizures, or they may be classified as
      generalized seizures, such as absence seizures, myoclonic
      seizures, clonic seizures, tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures,
      and/or atonic seizures, or a mixed seizure. The anticonvulsants
      described herein, such as turmeric oil, ar-turmerone, α-turmerone,
      β-turmerone and/or α-atlantone, may also provide treatment for
      therapy-resistant forms of seizure. Notably, the 6 Hz psychomotor
      seizure model of partial epilepsy has been used as a model
      therapy-resistant forms of seizures, including limbic seizures
      (40).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Patients suffering from epileptic seizures may be infants
      aged 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-18 months, 18-24 months. In
      certain embodiments, patients suffering from epileptic seizures
      are individuals aged 65-70, 75-80, 85-90, 95-100, 100-105, and
      older. Patients may also be children aged 2-12, adolescents aged
      13-19, or adults aged 20-64.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Anticonvulsants may be used for the treatment of epileptic
      seizures, including treatment of symptoms associated with
      epileptic seizures and/or epilepsy. Anticonvulsants may also be
      used to treat epileptic seizures that result from central nervous
      system disorders such as cerebrovascular diseases and/or
      neurodegenerative diseases. One goal of an anticonvulsant agent
      (i.e., an “anticonvulsant”) is to suppress the rapid and excessive
      firing of neurons that start a seizure. Another goal of an
      anticonvulsant is to prevent the spread of the seizure within the
      brain and offer protection against possible excitotoxic effects,
      that may result in brain damage. Anticonvulsants are also called
      antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated “AEDs”), and are sometimes
      referred to as antiseizure drugs. In epilepsy, an area of the
      brain and/or nervous system is typically hyper-irritable.
      Antiepileptic drugs function to help reduce this area of
      irritability and thus prevent epileptic seizures.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The term “central nervous system disorder” is meant to
      include any disease or disorder of the central nervous system
      (CNS) including epilepsy, tremor, pain, mood disorders (including
      depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity
      disorder, schizophrenia); infections of the CNS (e.g.
      encephalitis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. amyothrophic
      lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), autoimmune and
      inflammatory diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and genetic
      disorders (e.g. Huntington's diseases); in particular epilepsy. In
      a particular embodiment, the neurodegenerative disorders of the
      present invention do not include Alzheimer's Disease. In some
      embodiments, Alzheimer's Disease and/or other neurodegenerative
      diseases lead to epileptic seizures, which may be treated using
      anticonvulsants as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The present invention further provides a liquid composition
      comprising one or more bisabolene sesquiterpenoids according to
      this invention; for use as an anticonvulsant agent in disorders of
      the central nervous system. In a particular embodiment, said
      liquid composition is turmeric oil from a Curcuma genus in
      particular Curcuma longa L.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The liquid composition according to this invention in
      particular comprises an effective amount of bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids. As evident for a person skilled in the art, said
      effective amount may vary depending on the number and type of
      bisabolene sesquiterpenoids used. For example turmeric oil as a
      liquid composition may be used pure or further diluted to a
      concentration of about 1-50 μg/ml, more in particular about 2.5-20
      μg/ml, in particular about 10 μg/ml. Ar-turmerone, α-turmerone,
      β-turmerone and α-atlantone either or not in combination with each
      other may for example be present at a concentration of about 11-46
      μM, more in particular about 23-46 μM.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] These liquid compositions may be formulated and
      administered systemically or locally. Techniques for formulation
      and administration may be found in the latest edition of
      “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” (Mack Publishing Co. Easton
      Pa.). Suitable routes may, for example, include oral or
      transmucosal administration as well as parenteral delivery,
      including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary,
      intrathecal, intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or
      intranasal administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In a further embodiment, the compositions may be in the
      form of nutritional or dietary supplements, including tablets,
      capsules, gels, pastes, emulsions, solutions, caplets, and the
      like.<br>

      adapted from the original work of He and colleagues (27). RP-HPLC
      analysis was performed on a high performance liquid
      chromatographer (LaChrom Elite HPLC System, VWR Hitachi) equipped
      with diode array detection (DAD) system. RP-HPLC separation of
      turmeric oil constituents on a preparative scale was achieved
      using Econosphere 10 μm C18 (250 mm×10 mm) reversed phase column
      (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences, Belgium) attached to an
      Econosphere 10 μm C18 (33 mm×7 mm) guard column (Grace Davison
      Discovery Sciences, Belgium). The column operated at a flow rate
      of 5 ml/min at room temperature. The profile of the gradient
      elution was: double-distilled water (ddH2O) (A) and acetonitrile
      (B); 0-15 min, 40-60% B; 15-20 min, 60-100% B; 20-25 min, 100% B;
      25-30 min, 100-40% B. The analytes were monitored with DAD at 260
      nm. Eight fractions were individually collected (FIG. 4). Solvents
      from the collected fractions were removed by separation between
      diethyl ether and ddH2O.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The ether phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate
      and the solvent was removed by passing a slow stream of nitrogen
      over the sample at room temperature. The concentrated samples were
      stored at 4° C. until analyzed.<br>

      </b><b>Toxicological Evaluation in Zebrafish Model</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] The aim of this assay was to determine the range of
      appropriate concentrations to be tested in zebrafish for the
      anticonvulsant activity evaluation. Seven-dpf zebrafish were
      placed into a 24-well plate (tissue culture plate, flat bottom,
      FALCON®, USA), six larvae per well. They were incubated with
      different concentrations of a test compound dissolved in 1 ml of
      embryo medium (1% DMSO). The larvae were examined each hour during
      the period of 6 hours, and compared to control group to detect the
      following signs of toxicity: the absence of startle response to
      plate taps, changes in heart rate or circulation, presence of
      edema, paralysis and death. Thus, the maximum tolerated
      concentration (MTC) was defined as the highest concentration at
      which no signs of toxicity were observed in 6 out of 6 zebrafish
      larvae within 6 hours of exposure to a test compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In addition, the larvae were examined during a period of 24
      h in sample and compared to control group to detect toxicity.
      Thus, the maximum tolerated concentration (MTC) was also defined
      as the highest concentration at which no signs of toxicity were
      observed in 6 out of 6 zebrafish larvae within 24 h of exposure to
      sample.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Anticonvulsant Activity Evaluation in Zebrafish PTZ Model</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0058] Zebrafish larvae from 7-dpf were tracked using the
      ViewPoint VideoTrack System for Zebrafish™ (Version 2.3.1.0,
      ViewPoint, France). The system consists of an infrared light
      source, a high-resolution digital videocamera to capture larval
      movements within a defined time period (30 minutes in our
      experimental set-up) and the software to analyze larval locomotor
      activity (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The highest concentration tested corresponds to the
      previously determined MTC. Zebrafish larvae were placed in a
      96-well plate (tissue culture plate, flat bottom, FALCON®, USA);
      one larva per well. Each row of the plate (12 wells) comprised
      different treatment groups. Two adjacent rows contain the same
      compound but received two different treatments: a) first row,
      embryo medium (DMSO 1%), and b) second row, PTZ 20 mM. The first
      two rows of the plate (vehicle control group, where vehicle was
      embryo medium) contained a volume of 100 μl of embryo medium (1%
      DMSO) per well. The following three test groups (two rows each)
      contained 100 μl of different concentrations of test compound in
      embryo medium. The larvae thus treated were incubated at room
      temperature in dark and quiet conditions for 1 hour. Embryo medium
      (100 μl) was added to the first rows of each one of the four
      groups. Likewise, 100 μl of PTZ 40 mM were added to the second
      rows of each treatment group (final concentration of PTZ: 20 mM).
      Thus, the movement pattern of the exposed zebrafish larvae was
      video-tracked and assessed in presence of embryo medium (1% DMSO)
      and PTZ 20 mM. Videotracking of larval movements was started 5
      minutes after addition of embryo medium or PTZ to the wells and
      was recorded for 30 minutes. A total of 8 wells in each plate were
      left without larvae (medium only) as a negative control, so that
      each experimental parameter consisted of an average of 10 to 12
      larvae. The tracker software measured three periods of 10 minutes
      of larvae movement. Results were registered as the average value
      of the total time of larvae movement during 30 minutes. The
      figures shown are representative of a series of two similar
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The anticonvulsant properties of curcuminoids were assessed
      through video tracking analysis of seizure-like movements of
      zebrafish larvae. The higher tested concentrations correspond to
      MTC, thus in any case larvae did not display any sign of toxicity
      at these dose. MTC for curcuminoids corresponds to 10 μg/mL.
      Curcuminoids showed significant anticonvulsant activity
      (p&lt;0.05) at 2.5 μg/mL and at 5 and 10 μg/mL (p&lt;0.001) (FIG.
      2). This finding is in line with the anticonvulsant properties of
      curcumin revealed in rodent models (11) (12) (13) (14). On the
      other hand, further analysis uncovered the anticonvulsant activity
      for the turmeric oil. The larvae showed significant decrease
      (p&lt;0.001) of PTZ-induced seizures after exposure to turmeric
      oil (10 μg/ml) (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The anticonvulsant activity of curcuminoids and turmeric
      oil was compared to phenytoin and diazepam, two widely used drugs
      for the treatment of epilepsy. Higher tested concentrations
      correspond to MTC. Phenytoin showed significant activity at 75
      μg/ml (p&lt;0.05) and 252.26 μg/ml (p&lt;0.001). Diazepam
      decreased PTZ-induced movements in larvae at the concentrations of
      1.42 μg/ml and 14.23 μg/ml (p&lt;0.001) (FIG. 3). Curcumin and
      turmeric oil displayed interesting activity to delay seizure
      generation at significantly lower concentrations than phenytoin
      and at equivalent ones of diazepam.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] RP-HPLC analysis of turmeric oil revealed eight peaks (FIG.
      4). The peaks were individually collected to evaluate the
      anticonvulsant activity and find the active constituents.
      Fractions 2 and 7 were not tested in zebrafish model since the
      collected amounts were not enough for the assay performance.
      Significant decrease of the seizures triggered by PTZ was observed
      with fraction 4 (p&lt;0.05) at 10 μg/ml, fraction 5 (p&lt;0.001)
      at 5 μg/ml and fraction 6 at concentrations of 5 μg/ml
      (p&lt;0.001) and 10 μg/ml (p&lt;0.05) (FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7A).
      The bisabolene sesquiterpenoids exhibited anticonvulsant
      properties at lower concentrations compared to phenytoin. Fraction
      4 and 6 displayed positive response at similar concentrations than
      diazepam. Fraction 5 was effective at lower concentration than
      diazepam and phenytoin.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Fractions 4, 5 and 6 that showed positive activity in
      zebrafish PTZ model were further analyzed for chemical structure
      elucidation. Retention time, MW and UVmax of fraction 4 are
      consistent with the product proposed in FIG. 4. &lt;1&gt;H- and
      &lt;13&gt;C-NMR spectra of this fraction are in agreement with
      reported values for ar-turmerone (29), possibly a mixture of
      enantiomers. NMR analysis indicates that Fraction 5 is a 1:1
      mixture of two isomeric structures, possibly mixture of
      enantiomers. Compounds of this fraction were identified by 1D- and
      2D-NMR analysis as α-turmerone and β-turmerone (curlone) (30).
      Isomerisation to the aromatic analogue ar-turmerone was not
      observed by NMR after one week. Structure of Fraction 6 was
      identified as α-atlantone (probably the E-isomer) based on MW, 1D-
      and 2D-NMR spectra (29) (31) (FIG. 4; Table 1).<br>

      [0064] The analysis of the methanolic extract of turmeric (C.
      longa rhizome powder) revealed anticonvulsant activity in the
      zebrafish larval PTZ assay. In order to identify the active
      constituents present in the methanolic extract of turmeric, the
      anticonvulsant properties of curcuminoids and turmeric oil were
      also assessed through videotracking analysis. Curcuminoids showed
      anticonvulsant activity at 2.5 μg/ml (p&lt;0.05) and at 5 and 10
      μg/ml (p&lt;0.01) in our larval PTZ assay. Further analysis
      uncovered an additional anticonvulsant activity for turmeric oil.
      The larvae showed a decrease (p&lt;0.01) of PTZ-induced
      convulsions after exposure to turmeric oil (10 μg/ml) (FIG.
      2C-2E). Notably, exposure of zebrafish larvae to curcuminoids or
      turmeric oil alone (i.e. in the absence of proconvulsant) also
      resulted in a slight increase in locomotor activity compared to
      vehicle-treated controls. However, no obvious signs of toxicity
      (as measured by change in heart rate, loss of posture, lack or
      delay in response to tactile stimuli, or death were observed in
      these larvae.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The anticonvulsant properties of the bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids were also assessed through video tracking
      analysis of seizure-like movements of zebrafish larvae. The higher
      tested concentrations correspond to MTC, thus in any case larvae
      did not display any sign of toxicity at these dose. Significant
      decrease in the convulsions triggered by PTZ was observed for
      fractions ar-turmerone, α,β-turmerone and α-atlantone.
      Ar-turmerone showed anticonvulsant activity at 46 μM (p&lt;0.05),
      α-,β-turmerone at 23 μM (p&lt;0.01) and α-atlantone at
      concentrations of 23 μM (pb0.05) and 46 μM (p&lt;0.01) (FIG.
      7B-7D).<br>

      </b><b>Generation of PTZ-Induced Seizures in Mice</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0066] Mice were randomly divided into groups of five animals
      (vehicle (where vehicle was polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200):water
      1:1) and sample). The animals were pre-warmed under an infrared
      lamp for 10 minutes to dilate the tail veins. They were then
      placed in a restrainer and the lateral tail vein was catheterized
      with 1-cm long, 29-gauge needle. The needle was secured to the
      tail with surgical tape after confirming a correct placement. The
      needle was attached to a 0.7-m long polyethylene tubing connected
      to two 2.5-ml glass syringes containing: a) sample (control
      vehicle or test compounds) and b) PTZ (7.5 mg/ml ddH2O). These
      syringes were mounted on an infusion pump (ALADOIN-1000 11 VDC,
      0.75 Å, World Precision Instruments). Thus, 100 μL of control
      vehicle (PEG 200: ddH2O 1:1) or test compounds (turmeric oil and
      ar-turmerone) were IV infused at the rate of 50 μl/min for 2
      minutes. Ten minutes later, mice were released from the restrainer
      and placed in a transparent plastic cage for observation.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] PTZ was constantly infused at the rate of 150 μl/min.
      Seizure manifestation stages in mice were scored according to the
      time between the start of PTZ infusion and the following
      behavioral events: ear, tail and myoclonic twitch, forelimb
      clonus, falling, tonic hindlimb extension and death (28). Behavior
      was observed up to 5 minutes of PTZ infusion. In case of any
      surviving mice, they were sacrificed.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] PTZ doses were calculated according to the formula: PTZ
      dose [mg/kg]=(PTZ concentration [mg/ml]×infusion rate
      [ml/s]×infusion duration [s]×1000)/mouse weight [g]). All work
      solutions contained heparine (20 μl/ml).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Further evaluation of turmeric oil to control generation of
      PTZ-induced seizures in mice showed a delay on the onset of
      seizure parameters in mouse PTZ assay. Mice treated with turmeric
      oil (50 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in PTZ doses required
      to trigger all behavioral endpoints: tail twitch (p&lt;0.001), ear
      twitch, myoclonic twitch, forelimb clonus, falling, tonic hind
      limb extension and death (p&lt;0.05) compared to control group
      (FIG. 8A). Interestingly, ar-turmerone at a dose of 200 mg/kg also
      showed in mice a significant PTZ dose increase for generating ear,
      tail and myoclonic twitch, tonic hind limb extension and death
      (p&lt;0.05) as compared to control (FIG. 8B).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] When the vehicle PEG200:DMSO 1:1 was used, mice treated
      with turmeric oil (50 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in PTZ
      doses required to trigger all behavioral endpoints: forelimb
      clonus, falling and tonic hindlimb extension (p&lt;0.05) and ear,
      myoclonic, tail twitch, and death (p&lt;0.01), compared to control
      group (FIG. 9A).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Moreover, a dose of 100-mg/kg turmeric oil in the mouse PTZ
      assay exhibited significant activity in delaying seizure
      generation for all seizure parameters and death as compared to
      control (p&lt;0.01) (FIG. 9B). Regarding the active bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids, ar-turmerone and α,β-turmerone were assessed
      using the mouse PTZ seizure model (FIG. 10). Mice infused with a
      dose of 50 mg/kg of ar-turmerone exhibited significant resistance
      to the generation of seizures leading to an increase in the
      required dose of PTZ to trigger all assessed events: tonic
      hindlimb extension (p&lt;0.05) and ear, myoclonic and tail twitch,
      forelimb clonus, falling and death (p&lt;0.01). Likewise, the
      anticonvulsant activity of α,β-turmerone was evaluated, and
      positive results were also found with a dose of 100 mg/kg for all
      seizure parameters: forelimb clonus, falling, ear and tail twitch
      (p&lt;0.05) and myoclonic twitch, tonic hindlimb extension and
      death (p&lt;0.01). α-Atlantone was not tested in the mouse model
      since the collected amount was not sufficient to carry out the
      assay.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Sodium valproate was included as positive control in our
      PTZ tail infusion method for AED screening in mice (FIG. 11).
      Using this assay, sodium valproate (50 mg/kg) was capable of
      delaying tonic hindlimb extension (p&lt;0.01) and death
      (p&lt;0.05). Sodium valproate was also able to control seizures
      generation in zebrafish larvae where it was also used as positive
      control (FIG. 11).<br>

      [0073] All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
      Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Values were presented
      as means±standard deviation (SD). The locomotor activity of
      zebrafish larvae was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by
      Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Statistically significant
      differences (p&lt;0.05) between a treated group and the equivalent
      control groups (vehicle or PTZ) were considered indicative of
      decrease or increase in locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae.
      For mouse experiments, significant differences between estimated
      time intervals prior to above-mentioned seizure stages were
      calculated using the unpaired Student's t-test.<br>

      [0074] For assessing the anti-convulsant activity of ar-Tumerone,
      the 6 Hz psychomotor seizure model of partial epilepsy (Barton M.
      E. et al., 2001) was used, thereby applying the following
      stimulation parameters: 6 Hz, 0.2 ms rectangular pulse width, 3 s
      duration.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Every mouse (male NMRI+/−30 g) was administered the
      compound (ar-tumerone 50 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 100 μg/kg)
      or vehicle (PEG 200: DMSO 1:1) via i.p. injection. After 30
      minutes of incubation, seizures were induced via corneal
      stimulation using the Ugo-Basil device. Prior to the placement of
      corneal electrodes, a drop of 0.5% xylocaine was applied to the
      eyes of the animal. Animals were restrained manually and released
      immediately in a transparent plastic cage following the
      stimulation. Then, the animal was observed. The seizure was
      characterized by stun, forelimb clonus, twitching of vibrissae,
      straub-tail for at least 45 s. Protection was defined as the
      absence of a seizure. A minimum of six animals per dose was used.
      Six out of six mice showed protection with concentrations of 100
      μg/kg, and 1, 20, 50 mg/kg ar-turmerone (FIG. 13). Negative
      control (only vehicle) and positive control (valproic acid 300
      mg/kg) were included as well. As expected, 6 out of 6 mice treated
      with only vehicle were not protected and 6 out of 6 mice treated
      with valproic acid were protected.<br>

      </b><b>Motor Coordination and Balance on the Elevated Bridge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0076] In this example, the motor coordination and balance of mice
      using the elevated bridge was observed as described in (Brooks et
      al., 2012).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The elevated bridge measures the ability of a mouse (male
      C57B1/6+/−25 g) to traverse the beam without losing its balance
      (measured as footslips). Every mouse was trained until proficient
      at running the beam without pausing during the traverse. Two areas
      of the beam are designated the ‘start’ and ‘stop’ areas to allow
      the operator to start and stop the timing of the animal when
      running the beam. Following training, every mouse was administered
      the compound or vehicle via i.v. injection. After 10 minutes, the
      mouse was placed on the tip of the beam in the star facing towards
      the beam. The operator timed from the start line until the mouse
      reaches the stop line. The number of footslips (FIG. 12A), falls
      (FIG. 12B) and total time (FIG. 12C) on the beam (from ‘start’ to
      ‘stop’ areas) were counted. In this test, 5 out of 5 mice treated
      with ar-turmerone 50 mg/kg showed a behaviour comparable to the
      control group (treated with vehicle). Thus, from the obtained
      results it can be suggested that ar-turmerone does not cause motor
      or balance impairment as side effect of its anticonvulsant
      activity. Mice treated with diazepam were included due to the
      well-know side effect of this AED to cause motor and balance
      alterations in mice after i.v./i.p. administration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] The zebrafish PTZ-induced seizure model (24) was validated
      using first-line AEDs: phenytoin and diazepam. Additional
      validation of this screening system was achieved by identification
      of the known anticonvulsant properties of curcuminoids. Curcumin
      has often been cited as the main active substance responsible for
      the anticonvulsant properties of turmeric (11) (12) (32). Although
      its medicinal properties have been demonstrated, Phase I clinical
      trials have revealed important pharmacokinetic limitations for
      curcumin. When administrated p.o., the small amount of curcumin
      absorbed through the gut is mostly converted to water-soluble
      metabolites and excreted. Thus, the amount of curcumin reaching
      the circulation is very low. Therefore bioavailability issues have
      notably limited its therapeutical applications. Thus, several
      formulation studies have been performed to enhance curcumin
      bioavailability (33).<br>
      <br>
      [0079] On the other hand, neuroprotective studies in rodent models
      have shown that turmeric oil and its main bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids easily cross the blood-brain barrier likely due
      to their lipophilic nature which allows them to pass through cell
      membranes (18). Since turmeric oil and its constituents present
      better bioavailability and cross biomembranes with less difficulty
      when compared to curcumin (15) (16) (33), our finding that
      turmeric oil also displays anticonvulsant properties is indeed
      interesting. Moreover, turmeric safety is supported by the fact
      that it has been widely used as a food condiment predominantly in
      India for centuries and its use has been approved for human
      consumption. Furthermore, toxicity studies performed in human
      healthy patients (34) and in silico analysis (35) have predicted
      ar-turmerone as a safe potential candidate for further drug
      development.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Previous studies on the volatile constituents of turmeric
      oil were limited due to their complex isolation. Our work presents
      a practical method to isolate the main constituents of turmeric
      oil through RP-HPLC. The isolated compounds were individually
      evaluated in the zebrafish PTZ epilepsy model (data not shown for
      peaks 1, 3, 8). This model revealed significant activity for
      turmeric oil and the major bisabolene sesquiterpenoids: ar-;
      α,β-turmerone (curlone) and α-atlantone. Moreover, the
      anticonvulsant properties of turmeric oil (50 and 100 mg/kg),
      ar-turmerone (200 mg/kg), and α-,β-turmerone (100 mg/kg) were
      successfully corroborated in mice PTZ model and 6 Hz psychomotor
      seizure model of partial epilepsy. Regarding to the activity of
      turmeric oil vs ar-turmerone, it seems to be an additive activity
      since it is necessary higher dose of the isolated bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoid to observe anticonvusant properties in this model.
      Nevertheless, these findings reveal the major bisabolene
      sesquiterpenoids, especially ar-turmerone, as potential
      anticonvulsant drug candidates to be investigated further.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Curcumin
      [1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione]<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="238620112-EMI-C00001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      is the major yellow pigment of turmeric, a commonly used spice,
      derived from the rhizome of the herb Curcima longa Linn. In the
      Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, turmeric has traditionally
      been used as a treatment for inflammation, skin wounds, and
      tumors. Clinical activity of curcumin is yet to be confirmed;
      however, in preclinical animal models, curcumin has shown cancer
      chemo preventive, antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory
      properties&lt;1&gt;. Especially interesting is its ability to
      prevent the formation of carcinogen-induced intestinal
      premalignant lesions and malignancies in rat&lt;2, 3 &gt;and in
      the multiple neoplasia (Min/+) mouse&lt;4&gt;, a genetic model of
      the human disease familial adenomatous polyposis. Curcumin acts as
      a scavenger of oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide
      anion and singlet oxygen&lt;5,6,7 &gt;and interferes with lipid
      peroxidation&lt;8,9&gt;. Curcumin suppresses a number of key
      elements in cellular signal induction pathways pertinent to
      growth, differentiation and malignant transformations. Among
      signaling events inhibited by curcumin are protein
      kinases&lt;10&gt;, c-Jun/AP-1 activation&lt;11&gt;, prostaglandin
      biosynthesis&lt;12 &gt;and activity and expression of the enzyme
      cyclooxygenase-2&lt;13,14&gt;. This latter property is probably
      mediated by the ability of curcumin to block activation of the
      transcription factor NF-κB at the level of the NF-κB inducing
      kinase/IKKα/β signalling complex&lt;15&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Curcumin directly inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 and also
      inhibits the transcription of the gene responsible for its
      production. Cyclooxygenases (COX) catalyze the synthesis of
      prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. There are two isoforms
      of COX, designated COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed
      constitutively in most tissues and appears to be responsible for
      housekeeping functions&lt;16 &gt;while COX-2 is not detectable in
      most normal tissues but is induced by oncogenes, growth factors,
      carcinogens and tumor promoters&lt;17,18,19&gt;. Several different
      mechanisms account for the link between COX-2 activity and
      carcinogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Curcumin is not simply an alternative to non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), which also have
      anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties. This is
      so because COX is a bifunctional enzyme with cyclooxygenase and
      peroxidase activities. Aside from being important for PG
      synthesis, the peroxidase function contributes to the activation
      of procarcinogens. Therefore, the failure of NSAIDS to inhibit the
      peroxidase function of COX potentially limits their effectiveness
      as anticancer agents. Curcumin, in contrast, down-regulates levels
      of COX-2 and thereby decreases both the cyclooxygenase and
      peroxidase activities of the enzyme.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Curcumin is among the few agents to block both the COX and
      LOX (lipoxygenase) pathways of inflammation and carcinogenesis by
      directly modulating arachidonic acid metabolism. In a study to
      evaluate the effect of curcumin on the metabolism and action of
      arachidonic acid in mouse epidermis, it was found that topical
      application of curcumin inhibited arachidonic acid-induced ear
      inflammation in mice&lt;20&gt;. Curcumin (10 μM) inhibited the
      conversion of arachidonic acid to 5- and 8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
      acid by 60% and 51%, respectively (LOX pathway) and the metabolism
      to PGE2, PGF2α and PGD2 by 70%, 64% and 73%, respectively (COX
      pathway). In another study, dietary administration of 0.2%
      curcumin to rats inhibited azoxymethane-induced colon
      carcinogenesis and decreased colonic and tumor phospholipase A2,
      phospholipase Cγ1, and PGE2 levels&lt;21&gt;. In this study,
      dietary curcumin also decreased enzyme activity in the colonic
      mucosa and tumors for the formation of PGE2, PGF2α, POD2,
      6-keto-PGF2α and thromboxane B2 via the COX system and production
      of 5(S)-, 8(S)-, 12(S)-, and 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid
      via the LOX pathway was also inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Despite this impressive array of beneficial bioactivities,
      the bioavailability of curcumin in animals and man remains low. In
      rodents, curcumin demonstrates poor systemic bioavailability after
      p.o. dosing&lt;22 &gt;which may be related to its inadequate
      absorption and fast metabolism. Curcumin bioavailability may also
      be poor in humans as seen from the results of a recent pilot study
      of a standardized turmeric extract in colorectal cancer
      patients&lt;23&gt;. Indirect evidence suggests that curcumin is
      metabolized in the intestinal tract. Curcumin undergoes metabolic
      O-conjugation to curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate and
      bioreduction to tetrahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcumin and
      hexahydrocurcuminol in rats and mice in vivo&lt;24,25 &gt;in
      suspensions of human and rat hepatocytes&lt;26 &gt;and in human
      and rat intestine&lt;27&gt;. Metabolic conjugation and reduction
      of curcumin was more in human than in rat intestinal tissue. It
      has been suggested that the intestinal tract plays an important
      role in the metabolic disposition of curcumin. This is based
      predominantly on experiments in which [&lt;3&gt;H] labeled
      curcumin was incubated with inverted rat gut sacs&lt;28&gt;. This
      was later confirmed in intestinal fractions from humans and rats.
      Intestinal mucosa, as well as liver and kidney tissue from the
      rat, can glucurodinate and sulfate curcumin, as judged by the
      analysis of differential amounts of curcumin present before and
      after treatment of tissue extracts with conjugate-hydrolyzing
      enzymes&lt;29&gt;. Thus, gut metabolism contributes substantially
      to the overall metabolic yield generated from curcumin in vivo. In
      human intestinal fractions, conjugation with activated sulfuric or
      glucuronic acids was much more abundant, whereas conjugation in
      human hepatic tissues was less extensive, than in the rat
      tissues&lt;30&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Although p.o. administered curcumin has poor
      bioavailability and only low or non-measurable blood levels were
      observed&lt;31&gt;, this route of administration inhibits
      chemically induced skin and liver carcinogenesis&lt;32, 33&gt;.
      Oral administration of curcumin also inhibits the initiation of
      radiation-induced mammary and pituitary tumors&lt;34&gt;.
      Similarly, in a study to assess the curcumin levels in the
      colorectum, a daily dose of 3.6 g curcumin achieves
      pharmacologically effective levels in the colorectum with
      negligible distribution of curcumin outside the gut&lt;35&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Earlier Shobha et al&lt;36 &gt;had observed that
      administering piperine along with curcumin enhances the
      bioavailability of curcumin. However, the level of enhancement was
      only modest and no curcumin could be detected after 3 hours even
      when supplemented with piperine.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Although some questions remain unanswered regarding the
      pharmacokinetics of curcumin in humans, there is no denying the
      fact that considerable proportion of ingested curcumin is excreted
      through feces and at least about one-half of absorbed curcumin is
      metabolized. The quantity of curcumin that reaches tissues outside
      the gut is probably pharmacologically insignificant. Several
      studies have failed to demonstrate the positive in vitro results
      with curcumin in in vivo animal and human studies due to lack of
      absorption of curcumin after oral administration. To provide the
      clinical benefits, curcumin must be absorbed from its oral route
      of administration at a suitable rate, be distributed in adequate
      concentration in the blood and remain in the system for a
      sufficient period at an effective concentration level.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0025] The disclosure relates to a product to enhance the
      bioavailability of curcumin by mixing a suitable portion of the
      volatile oil obtained from turmeric with the curcuminoids isolated
      from turmeric.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As disclosed herein the term “curcuminoid” is a mixture of
      curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. In some
      embodiments, curcumin is the major component of the curcuminoid
      mixture. In some embodiments, demethoxycurcumin and
      bisdemethoxycurcumin are minor components of the curcuminoid
      mixture. In some embodiments, 95% of the crystals having
      curcuminoid mixture are composed of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin
      and bisdemethoxycurcumin.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The term “essential oil” or “essential oil of turmeric” is
      also referred to as “volatile oil” or “volatile oil of turmeric.”
      The essential oil of turmeric is a mixture of oils. Essential oil
      is obtained as a by-product during the extraction of curcumin or
      curcuminoids from turmeric. In some embodiments, Ar-turmerone,
      which is also referred to as turmerone, is the main constituent of
      essential oil. In some embodiments, Ar-turmerone constitutes about
      40-50% of the essential oil of turmeric. In some embodiments,
      Ar-turmerone comprises about 45% of the essential oil of turmeric.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As stated herein, the term “a” or “an” refers to one or
      more.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As stated herein, the terms “isolated” and “purified” are
      referred to interchangeably.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The volatile oil of turmeric was isolated by conventional
      methods of steam distillation to isolate essential oils and is
      well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Curcumin is isolated from the de-oiled turmeric by solvent
      extraction. Suitable solvents for this purpose include acetone,
      hexane, ethyl acetate, dichloroethane, chloroform, etc. The
      extraction is conveniently carried out at moderate temperatures
      (40-55° C.) and the solvent is partially removed to yield a
      concentrate containing 30-60% solids. This solution is cooled to
      obtain crystals of curcuminoid which are isolated by any suitable
      method such as filtration or centrifugation. Analysis of this
      product, which is composed of the isolated crystals of curcumoid
      mixture, showed that, in some embodiments, 95% of the product was
      composed of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The disclosure provides a composition having curcuminoid
      and an essential oil of turmeric. Curcumin and the volatile oils
      of curcumin are mixed and blended to get a uniform product. If

      [0039] In some embodiments, a composition of a curcuminoid and
      added essential oil of turmeric is orally administered to a human.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A method of extraction of curcuminoids includes treating
      dried and powdered rhizomes of turmeric with a solvent, followed
      by solvent stripping, and steam distilling to obtain an
      essential-oil free extract. The essential oil-free extract is
      cooled to about 4° C. to allow the curcuminoids to crystallize.
      The curcuminoids are then separated by filtration, centrifugation
      or any other method of solid-liquid separation well-known in the
      art. In some embodiments, 95% of the separated crystals are
      composed of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin.<br>

      [0060] It will be readily understood by the skilled artisan that
      numerous alterations may be made to the examples and instructions
      given herein. These and other objects and features of present
      invention will be made apparent from the following examples. The

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0061] Nine healthy human volunteers aged between 25 and 45 years
      of age were selected for the study. They were given capsules of
      curcuminoid mixture alone and capsules of enhanced curcumin
      capsules at the dosage of 50 mg curcuminoid/kg body weight.
      Enhanced curcumin is a composition having curcuminoid and added
      essential oil of turmeric. In the enhanced curcumin capsules the
      weight ratio of curcuminoid to essential oil of turmeric was 10:1.
      The subjects were advised to take curcuminoid capsules first.
      Blood samples were collected at zero hour and periodically at
      one-hour or half-hour intervals for 8 hours. After a washout
      period of one week, the same protocol was repeated with enhanced
      curcumin bioavailability capsules. The whole blood was extracted
      exhaustively with ethyl acetate to recover curcumin. The ethyl
      acetate extract was analyzed by HPLC on a RP-C18 column (25×4.5
      mm) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent and UV detection at 420
      nm. The eluant flow rate was 1 ml/min. Efficiency of the
      extraction procedure for recovering curcumin from blood samples
      was determined by measuring recovery of curcumin upon extraction
      of normal blood samples. Normal blood samples were collected by
      adding curcumin to normal blood (of persons not consuming curcumin
      or enhanced curcumin capsules). Curcumin was extracted from the
      normal blood samples by the above procedure. The efficiency of
      recovery of curcumin by the above extraction procedure was
      estimated to range between 80.12% and 86.49%.<br>

      Following administration of capsules having a 10:1 weight ratio of
      curcuminoid to essential oil of turmeric, the peak absorption of
      curcumin occurred at 3 hr. Furthermore, curcumin persisted in
      small amounts in the blood till 8 hr beyond which measurements
      were not made. At peak absorption the enhancement of
      bioavailability ranged, among the 9 persons, between 5 and 16-fold
      with a mean value of 10.62.<br>

      [0064] Human subjects were administered capsule (4×500 mg)
      prepared with curcuminoids and without added essential oil of
      turmeric (curcuminoids group in Table 2). Blood was drawn at
      different intervals (one hour) and tested for curcumin content.
      After two weeks the same groups were administered an enhanced
      curcumin bioavailability composition (4×500 mg). The varying
      ratios of curcuminoids and added essential oil of turmeric are as
      provided in Table 2. Blood from the enhanced curcumin group was
      drawn at different intervals and tested for curcumin content. As
      seen in Table 2, bioavailability of curcumin was greater when

      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 12:1 ratio etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Nine healthy human volunteers were given capsules
      containing 475 mg of curcuminoid mixture without added essential
      oil of turmeric (the capsule was made up to 500 mg by addition of
      rice powder) at a dosage of 50 mg curcuminoid/kg body weight.
      Blood was drawn from the subjects at baseline, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours post drug. The same subjects after a
      washout period of one week were given 500 mg capsule having 454.55
      mg curcuminoid mixture with 45.45 mg essential oil of turmeric,
      wherein the essential oil of turmeric had about 45% Ar-turmerone
      (the weight ratio of curcuminoid mixture to added essential oil of
      turmeric was 10:1) at a dosage of 50 mg curcuminoid/kg body weight
      of the subject. Blood was drawn from the subjects at baseline,
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours post drug. Table 4
      provides the amount of curcumin in nanograms per gram of blood for
      the subjects, which was averaged for each time point.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The above protocol was repeated with the following three
      formulations:<br>
      <br>
      (1) A capsule having 500 mg of essential oil of turmeric, wherein
      the essential oil of turmeric had 10-15% Ar-turmerone, was
      administered at a dosage of 50 mg of essential oil of turmeric per
      kg body weight of the human subject:<br>
      (2) A capsule having 500 mg of essential oil of turmeric, wherein
      the essential oil of turmeric had 45% Ar-turmerone, administered
      at a dosage of 50 mg of essential oil of turmeric per kg body
      weight of the human subject; and<br>
      (3) A capsule having 500 mg of raw turmeric powder was
      administered at a dosage of 50 mg of raw turmeric powder/kg body
      weight of the human subject.<br>
      (4) A capsule having 500 mg of 461.5 mg curcuminoid mixture with
      38.45 mg essential oil of turmeric, wherein the essential oil of
      turmeric had about 45% Ar-turmerone (the weight ratio of

      <br>
      [0069] Whole blood drawn from the subjects was extracted
      exhaustively with ethyl acetate to recover curcumin. The ethyl
      acetate extract was analyzed by HPLC on a RP-C18 column (25×4.5
      mm) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent and UV detection at 420
      nm. The eluent flow rate was 1 ml/min. As seen in Table 4 and FIG.
      2, curcumin bioavailability in human subjects following
      administration of raw turmeric was low. Curcumin bioavailability
      following administration of negative controls, namely, essential
      oil fractions having 10-15% or 45% Ar-turmerone was not detectable
      (referred to as Nd in Table 4). Whereas, curcumin was detectable
      in human subjects following administration of curcuminoid mixture
      without added essential oil of turmeric, the bioavailability of
      curcumin was enhanced by 6.7 fold upon administration of a
      composition having curcuminoid mixture and essential oil of
      turmeric with 45% Ar-t in 10:1 ratio and the bioavailability of
      curcumin was enhanced by 8.3 fold upon administration of a

      turmeric with 45% Ar-t in 12:1 ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] As seen in FIG. 2, the maximum concentration of curcumin in
      blood (Cmax of curcumin) was 13.81 ng/g upon administration of the
      negative control capsule having curcuminoid mixture without the
      added essential oil of turmeric, whereas, the Cmax of curcumin was
      92.59 ng/g upon administration of the positive control capsule
      having curcuminoid mixture and added essential oil of turmeric
      with 45% Ar-t in 10:1 ratio. The Cmax of curcumin was 114.59 ng/g
      upon administration of the positive control capsule having
      curcuminoid mixture and added essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-t in 12:1 ratio. Therefore, comparison of the Cmax values shows
      that bioavailability of curcumin upon oral administration of the
      claimed composition having curcuminoid mixture and added essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-t in 10:1 was 6.7 times greater than
      bioavailability of curcumin upon oral administration of
      curcuminoid mixture without the added essential oil of turmeric.
      Bioavailability of curcumin upon oral administration of the
      claimed composition having curcuminoid mixture and added essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-t in 12:1 ratio was 8.3 times greater
      than bioavailability of curcumin upon oral administration of
      curcuminoid mixture without the added essential oil of turmeric.<br>

      [0071] Bioavailability of curcumin from capsules having a weight
      ratio of curcuminoid mixture to essential oil of turmeric ranging
      from about 1:3 to 99:1<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Human volunteers aged between 25 and 45 years were
      randomized into separate groups having 3 subjects each (Groups A
      through W). For control experiment, at the initial time point,
      subjects in all the groups were four 500 mg capsules of C without
      added E having about 475 mg of curcuminoid mixture. Then blood was
      drawn from the subjects at different time periods (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours post drug) and the amount of curcumin in
      blood (in nanograms per gram of blood) was determined. The average
      values of curcumin in blood at each time period was plotted in
      separate graphs for each of the groups (A to W). For each of the
      groups, the area under the curve (AUC) of curcumin was calculated
      from the figure. In Table 5 and FIG. 3, AUC is provided as
      nanograms of curcumin per gram of blood.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] After a wash out period of 2 weeks, subjects in groups A
      through W were given four 500 mg capsules each, wherein set of 4
      capsules had varying ratios of curcuminoid mixture to added
      essential oil of turmeric (referred to as C with added E capsule
      in Table 5), and wherein the essential oil of turmeric in the
      capsules had 45% Ar-turmerone. The ratio of curcuminoid mixture to
      essential oil of turmeric in the capsules ranged from about 99:1
      to about 1:3. Some of the could be expressed as more than one type
      of ratio, for example, as 95:5 or 19:1; 90:4 or 22.5:1; 90:5 or
      18:1; 90:6 or 15:1; 90:7 or 12.9:1; 90:8 or 11.3:1; 90:9 or 10:1;

      30:60 or 1:2 and 25:75 or 1:3 and therefore the ratios are
      referred to accordingly in Table 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] As shown in Table 5, each of the groups was administered a
      capsule having a different weight ratio of curcuminoid mixture to
      essential oil of turmeric (referred to as C:E). Blood was drawn
      from the subjects and the AUC was calculated as described above.
      The curcumin content in the blood for each group was expressed as
      AUC, which was used to compare the bioavailability of curcumin
      from the different treatment groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Table 5 and FIG. 3 provide a comparison of the
      bioavailability of curcumin from the curcuminoid mixture without
      added essential oil of turmeric as the control group and the
      curcuminoid mixture with added essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] As seen in Table 5 and FIG. 3, curcumin bioavailability
      upon administration of capsules having curcuminoid mixture with
      added essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone resulted in
      an enhancement of bioavailability ranging from 1.8 to 7.3 fold
      over the curcumin bioavailability that was observed when negative
      control capsules having curcuminoid mixture without added
      essential oil of turmeric were administered. The results in Table
      5 further show that the enhancement of bioavailability was
      observed over the entire claimed range of the ratio about 1:3 to
      about 99:1 of curcuminoid mixture to essential oil of turmeric.<br>

      <br>
      [0078] Nine healthy human volunteers were given four 500 mg
      capsules having 20 mg curcuminoid mixture without added essential
      oil of turmeric (referred to as 20 mg C in Table 6). Blood was
      drawn from the subjects at baseline, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6
      and 8 hours post drug. Following one week washout period, the same
      nine subjects were given four 500 mg capsules having 200 mg of
      essential oil of turmeric having 10 to 15% Ar-turmerone. Blood was
      drawn from the subjects at baseline, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6
      and 8 hours post drug.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] With one week washout period between treatments, the
      subjects were tested for the following treatments, wherein four of
      500 mg capsules were administered to each subject. If any of the
      capsules had less than 500 mg of the test component such as
      curcuminoid mixture or essential oil or the combination of
      curcuminoid mixture and essential oil, then the capsules were made
      up to 500 mg by addition of a placebo, e.g., rice powder. In one
      treatment, each capsule had a 1:10 ratio of curcuminoid mixture to
      added essential oil of turmeric. Each capsule contained 20 mg
      curcuminoid and 200 mg essential oil of turmeric, wherein the
      essential oil of turmeric had 10 to 15% Ar-turmerone (referred to
      as Ar-t in Table 6).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In another treatment, each capsule had a 1:10 ratio of
      curcuminoid mixture to added essential oil of turmeric, wherein
      the essential oil had 45% Ar-turmerone. Each capsule contained 20
      mg curcuminoid and 200 mg essential oil of turmeric. The capsule
      is referred to as 20 mg C: 200 mg E=1:10 (E had 10-15% Ar-t) in
      Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In another treatment, the capsule had a 10:1 ratio of
      curcuminoid mixture to added essential oil of turmeric, wherein
      the essential oil had 45% Ar-turmerone. Each capsule contained 20
      mg curcuminoid and 2 mg essential oil of turmeric. The capsule is
      referred to as 20 mg C: 2 mg E=10:1 (E had 45% Ar-t) in Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In another treatment, each capsule had curcuminoid mixture
      without the added essential oil of turmeric. Each capsule
      contained 454.55 mg curcuminoids. The capsule is referred to as
      454.55 mg C without added E in Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In another treatment, each capsule had essential oil of
      turmeric having 45% Ar-turmerone. Each capsule contained 45.45 mg
      essential oil of turmeric. The capsule is referred to as 45.45 mg
      E (45% Ar-t) in Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In another treatment, each capsule had curcuminoid mixture
      along with added essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      at a 10:1 ratio. Each capsule contained 454.55 mg curcuminoids and
      45.45 mg of essential oil of turmeric. The essential oil of
      turmeric had 45% Ar-turmerone. The capsule is referred to as
      454.55 mg C: 45.45 mg E=10:1 (E had 45% Ar-t) in Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Whole blood from the subjects was extracted exhaustively
      with ethyl acetate to recover curcumin. The ethyl acetate extract
      was analyzed by HPLC on a RP-C18 column (25×4.5 mm) using
      tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent and UV detection at 420 nm. The
      eluent flow rate was 1 ml/min. Curcumin content in the blood was
      determined for each group at each time point and the average value
      of curcumin in blood (in nanogram per gram of blood) was
      calculated. The average value of curcumin at each time point for
      various the treatment protocols is provided in Table 6 and in FIG.
      4.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] As seen in Table 6, low bioavailability of curcumin of
      about 1.05 ng curcumin per gm of blood was observed from the
      negative control having 20 mg of curcuminoid mixture without added
      essential oil of turmeric. In the negative controls having
      essential oil of turmeric alone, with either 10-15% Ar-turmerone
      or 45% Ar-turmerone, the bioavailability of curcumin was not
      detectable (referred to as Nd in Table 6). Further,
      bioavailability of curcumin from the capsule prepared and having a
      1:10 ratio of curcuminoid mixture to essential oil of turmeric,
      wherein the essential oil had either a 10-15% Ar-turmerone content
      or 45% Ar-turmerone content, showed poor bioavailability of
      curcumin.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] An experimental capsule prepared at the ratio of 10:1 of
      curcuminoid mixture to essential oil of turmeric, wherein the
      essential oil had a 45% Ar-turmerone content, having 20 mg
      curcuminoid mixture and 2 mg essential oil of turmeric showed
      greater than 2-fold enhanced bioavailability over the negative
      control of 20 mg curcuminoid mixture without the added essential
      oil of turmeric. On the other hand the positive control having
      454.55 mg curcuminoid mixture and 45.55 mg essential oil of
      turmeric, wherein the essential oil of turmeric had a 45%
      Ar-turmerone content, i.e., a 10:1 ratio of curcuminoid mixture to
      essential oil of turmeric, showed a 6.97 fold enhancement of
      bioavailability of curcumin as compared to the bioavailability of
      curcumin from the negative control capsule having 454.55 mg
      curcuminoid mixture without the added essential oil of turmeric.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0088] The rhizomes of turmeric (300 Kg) were dried. The dried
      turmeric rhizomes were powdered to form powdered turmeric. The
      powdered turmeric was treated with ethyl acetate (900 L) to form a
      solution. The extraction was carried out at 78° C. temperature for
      1 hr. After initial extraction, the extraction process was
      repeated 4 more times and the resultant solution was filtered and
      the solvent was stripped from the filtered solution to form an
      extract. This extract was cooled to about 4° C. to obtain crystals
      of curcuminoid (12 Kg) and a liquid. The crystals of curcuminoid
      were isolated from the liquid by filtration. The crystals were
      powdered to form powdered curcuminoid mixture with 95%
      curcuminoids.<br>

      [0089] The rhizomes of turmeric (50 Kg) were dried and flaked into
      required size. The flakes of turmeric was filled in the soxhlet
      apparatus and extracted with ethylene dichloride (EDC). The
      extraction was carried out for 5 his at a temperature of about 83°
      C. After the completion of extraction, the solvent was filtered.
      The solvent was removed by distillation and mild vacuum was
      applied to get an oleoresin which contains essential oil of
      turmeric and curcuminoid. The oleoresin was steam distilled to get
      essential oil and a residue. The residue was dried under vacuum to
      form a powder (10 Kg) with 24% curcuminoid content.<br>

      indicated as ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70. ACR criteria measures
      improvement in tender or swollen joint counts and improvement in
      three of the following five parameters: patient global
      assessment-global assessment of disease activity on a 0-100 scale
      (0, best; 100, worst); physician assessment-global assessment of
      disease activity on a 0-100 scale (0, best; 100, worst); pain
      scale disability-visual analogue scale for pain (VAS; 0, no pain
      and 100, severe pain); functional questionnaire-HAQ (Health
      Assessment Questionnaire) includes four categories: dressing and
      grooming, arising, eating, and walking, on a 0-3 scale (0, best;
      3, worst); acute phase reactant (such as sedimentation rate).
      ACR20 is defined as a reduction in tender and swollen joint counts
      of 20%, ACR 50 of 50% and ACR 70 of 70%, from baseline. Monitoring
      of vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory parameters
      (hematology, blood chemistry, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      antistreptolysin-O (ASO), rheumatoid factor and blood sugar) were
      performed biweekly for safety evaluation. The occurrence of
      adverse events was the primary safety variable.<br>

      [0115] Treatment with formulation of curcuminoid with essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio showed
      decrease in disease activity score from 6.5 at baseline to 3.5 at
      the end of treatment. The results are summarized in Table 7. Mean
      VAS scores for pain in all the groups were comparable at baseline,
      and formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with
      45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio group showed significant reduction
      (65%) in VAS score from 79 mm at baseline to 27.5 mm at the end of
      treatment. Mean VAS scores for pain in the group with formulation
      of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 12:1 ratio group also showed significant reduction
      (69%) in VAS score from 78 mm at baseline to 24 mm at the end of
      treatment. The results are summarized in Table 8. All components
      of ACR response criteria viz., Total Painful Joints, Total Swollen
      Joints, Patient's GA, Physician's GA, Disability Index and HAQ
      showed a significant reduction from baseline to end of study in
      the formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with
      45% Ar-turmerone in 12:1 and 10:1 ratios. The results are
      summarized in Table 9 (FIG. 6). Treatment with formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 12:1 ratio group showed decreased C reactive protein from 12
      mg/L at baseline to 5.3 mg/L at the end of treatment and
      formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio showed decreased C reactive protein
      from 12 mg/L at baseline to 5.7 mg/L at the end of treatment. The
      results are summarized in Table 10. Treatment with formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 12:1 ratio group showed decrease in Rheumatoid Arthritis factor
      from 23 IU/L at baseline to 13 IU/L at the end of treatment.
      Formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio showed decrease in Rheumatoid Arthritis
      factor from 24 IU/L at baseline to 15 IU/L at the end of
      treatment. The results are summarized in Table 11. The study shows
      that formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric
      with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratios can provide
      significant improvement in treatment efficacy in active RA. All

      [0117] Each patient was given treatment for 12 weeks. The efficacy
      of the use of the study drugs over the treatment period was
      evaluated by symptom scoring and clinical examination. Symptom
      refers to the complaints expressed by the patient and scored
      depending on severity. Symptom scoring includes joint pain
      measurements and walking distance measurements. Joint pain in
      osteoarthritis is a deep pain localized to the joint and is
      measured by querying the patient and scoring it as
      No/mild/moderate/severe during each visit. Results of this
      analysis for the eight treatment groups are presented in Table 12
      (FIG. 7). Walking distance refers to the maximum distance a person
      is able to walk at a stretch without limiting pain. Walking
      distance measurements were recorded and are given Table 13 (FIG.
      8). Joint line tenderness was elicited by palpating along the
      joint line and was measured by querying the patient and recording
      the response as No/mild/moderate/severe and was recorded and
      results are presented in Table 14 (FIG. 9).<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Crepitus (crackling or grating feeling or sound in joints)
      is elicited by palpating the joint on movement and scoring it as
      No/Mild/Moderate/Severe. Range of movement of the knee is measured
      for flexion/extension movement and the normal range is from 0 to
      135 degrees (0 being neutral position and increasing flexion of
      the joint is normally up to 135 degrees). It is measured using a
      Goniometer and is measured by asking the patient to flex the joint
      to the maximum extent possible and the maximum value was recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The results showed that the % response of patients taking
      formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratios were significantly better
      than patients taking raw turmeric powder, essential oil of

      majority of the patients (52%) had only mild pain at the end of 3
      months of treatment in patients given formulation of curcuminoid
      with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 12:1
      ratio. Before the treatment 7% of patients had severe joint pain
      and after treatment none of the patients given formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 12:1 ratio had severe joint pain.<br>

      [0123] Before the treatment with formulation of curcuminoid with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 12:1 ratio 8%
      of patients could not walk even up to 100 meters. And after the
      treatment 75% of patients could walk over 1000 meters and 22%
      could walk 500-1000 meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Before the treatment with formulation of curcuminoid with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio 7%
      of patients could not walk even up to 100 meters. And after the
      treatment 72% of patients could walk over 1000 meters and the
      remaining 28% could walk 500-1000 meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The safety of the test drug was evaluated by measuring
      vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate,
      respiratory rate), haemogram measurement (Hb, TC, DC, ESR), liver
      function tests (SGOT, SGPT, SAP, bilirubin), renal function tests
      (blood urea, serum creatinine). None of these parameters were
      adversely modified by the study drugs. There were also no adverse
      events reported in the study.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In conclusion, formulation of curcuminoid with essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratios were
      significantly effective compared to raw turmeric powder, essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone, essential oil of turmeric
      with 10-15% Ar-turmerone, curcuminoid with essential oil of

      There was significant improvement in pain scores, walking
      distance, joint line tenderness, crepitus, range of movement of
      the knee and joint swelling measurements in osteoarthritic
      patients receiving formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil
      of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratios for 3
      months compared to patients receiving raw turmeric powder,
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone, essential oil of
      turmeric with 10-15% Ar-turmerone, curcuminoid with essential oil
      of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 1:10 ratio, curcuminoid with

      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratio capsules compared with raw
      turmeric powder, essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone,

      and curcuminoids 95% capsules was done in patients with
      progressive decline in memory or cognitive function and diagnosed
      with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients were
      randomized to 10 groups to receive 3.0 grams of each study drug
      capsules twice daily for 12 months.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] Parameters measured at baseline and end of study include
      plasma isoprostanes, Vit E, Aβ and clinical assessment with
      Mini-Mental State Examination Scores (MMSE). Isoprostanes are the
      products of non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid and so
      this, along with the antioxidant Vit E levels is indicative of the
      level of oxidative stress. Aβ are a 39-43 amino acid peptide
      fragment derived from the f-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and
      are the predominant component of the neuritic plaques, an
      invariant pathological hallmark of AD. Aggregated forms of Aβ are
      believed to be the real culprits of the disease. Mini-Mental State
      Examination Scores (MMSE) is a measure of cognitive function. The
      pharmacokinetics of curcumin from the ingested drugs and adverse
      events, if any, associated with the drug were also recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Serum Aβ levels was significantly higher in formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 10:1 and 12:1 ratio capsules compared to results following
      administration of raw turmeric powder, essential oil of turmeric
      with 45% Ar-turmerone, essential oil of turmeric with 10-15%
      Ar-turmerone, curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 1:10 ratio, curcuminoid with essential oil of
      turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 1:1 ratio, curcuminoid 24% with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio,
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 10-15%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio and curcuminoids 95% capsules,
      reflecting the increased ability of formulation of curcuminoid
      with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and
      12:1 ratio capsules to disaggregate Aβ deposits in the brain. The
      MMSE scores of patients given formulation of curcuminoid with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio
      capsules increased significantly from baseline value at 16/30 to
      23/30 at the end of the study. The MMSE scores of patients given
      formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 12:1 ratio capsules increased significantly from
      baseline value at 17/30 to 25/30 at the end of the study and in
      patients given raw turmeric powder, essential oil of turmeric with
      45% Ar-turmerone, essential oil of turmeric with 10-15%
      Ar-turmerone, curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 1:10 ratio, curcuminoid with essential oil of
      turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 1:1 ratio, curcuminoid 24% with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio,
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 10-15%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio and curcuminoids 95% capsules there was
      a marginal deterioration in the MMSE score (Table 15).
      Isoprostanes arc products of non-enzymatic oxidation of
      arachidonic acid and are indicative of oxidative stress. Plasma
      isoprostane levels were significantly lowered between baseline and
      at 12 months in patients taking formulation of curcuminoid with
      essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1
      ratios. Vitamin E levels increased in the formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 10:1 and 12:1 ratio groups from baseline to end of treatment,
      (Table 16). The curcumin level in patients taking formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 10:1 ratio (baseline at 12 to 653 at the end of treatment
      period) was 15 times higher than patients taking curcuminoids 95%
      capsules (baseline at 13 to 42 at the end of treatment) (Table
      17). The curcumin level in patients taking formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 12:1 ratio (baseline at 14 to 875 at the end of treatment
      period) was 20 times higher than patients taking curcuminoids 95%
      capsules (baseline at 13 to 42 at the end of treatment) (Table
      17). In patients taking raw turmeric powder, essential oil of
      turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone, essential oil of turmeric with
      10-15% Ar-turmerone, curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric
      with 45% Ar-turmerone in 1:10 ratio, curcuminoid with essential
      oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 1:1 ratio, curcuminoid
      24% with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1
      ratio, curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 10-15%
      Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio and curcuminoids 95% capsules there was
      no decrease noticed in the plasma isoprostane levels and Vitamin E
      levels remained more or less the same in all the groups except in
      patients taking formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of
      turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and 12:1 ratios.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] This study thus reveals that the formulation of curcuminoid
      with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 and
      12:1 ratio capsules confer greater clinical benefits as observed
      by significant increase in the MMSE score, increase in Vit E
      levels, high levels of serum Aβ levels, and lowered plasma
      isoprostane levels in patients consuming formulation of
      curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone
      in 10:1 and 12:1 ratio capsules compared with patients consuming

      (93%) higher in the formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil
      of turmeric with 45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio group than other
      groups (Table: 18). The change in HAM-D17 scores at the end of 8
      weeks from baseline at 20 to 7 at the end of treatment was higher
      for formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with
      45% Ar-turmerone in 12:1 ratio group (65%) than other groups
      (Table: 19). The change in HAM-D17 scores at the end of 8 weeks
      from baseline at 21 to 10 at the end of treatment was also higher
      for formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with
      45% Ar-turmerone in 10:1 ratio group (52%) than other groups
      (Table: 19). In Clinical Global Impression assessment scale, the
      formulation of curcuminoid with essential oil of turmeric with 45%
      Ar-turmerone in 12:1 ratio group showed a decrease in CGI-S score
      from baseline at 4 to 1 at the end of treatment. That is 75%
      improvement in CGI-S (Table: 20). In Clinical Global Impression
      assessment scale, the formulation of curcuminoid with essential

      and obesity, among others.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to an agent for preventing
      and/or ameliorating life style-related diseases which contains, as
      an active ingredient, an essential oil component derived from a
      plant material of the genus Curcuma origin, and a functional food
      containing the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Life style-related diseases resulting from changes for the
      worse in life style, such as excessive nutrition and lack of
      exercise, are now a great social problem. Among such life
      style-related diseases, there may be mentioned obesity, diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia and hypertension, among others. A plurality of such
      morbid states may develop in combination and such combination is
      also termed metabolic syndrome, obesity, syndrome X, deadly
      quartet, insulin resistance syndrome or visceral fat syndrome,
      among others. The onset of metabolic syndrome is said to be based
      on insulin resistance and, further, it is said that there is the
      accumulation of visceral fat as a further upstream cause.
      Therefore, it is considered that such life style-related diseases
      as mentioned above may be prevented and/or alleviated by
      preventing and/or ameliorating the accumulation of visceral fat or
      the insulin resistance.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a
      transcriptional regulatory factor serving to control the
      expression of a group of genes for maintaining the metabolism of
      sugars and lipids; it is a ligand-dependent transcriptional
      regulatory factor belonging to the nuclear receptor family. The
      PPAR includes three subtypes, namely PPAR[alpha], PPAR[gamma] and
      PPAR[delta]. Among them, PPAR[gamma] is expressed in adipose
      tissues and is a master regulator controlling the differentiation
      and maturation of adipocytes. Such thiazolidine derivatives as
      troglitazone, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone developed as
      antidiabetics and agents for alleviating insulin resistance
      (insulin sensitizers) are PPAR[gamma] ligands activating
      PPAR[gamma] and showing a hypoglycemic activity and an insulin
      resistance-alleviating activity. It has been confirmed that these
      agents clinically reduce the visceral fat level; they are known to
      be effective not only against diabetes but also against life
      style-related diseases, typically metabolic syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is a perennial herb of the
      family Zingiberaceae, genus Zingiber and is generally known as
      turmeric, one of curry spices; it is used not only for food but
      also a coloring agent for food, clothing, etc. It is also used
      medicinally in Chinese medicine and in such traditional medicine
      as Ayurveda in India or Jamu in Indonesia owing to its hemostatic,
      stomachic, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] It is known that the main components of turmeric are yellow
      coloring matters curcuminoids, namely curcumin and its derivatives
      demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. While various
      physiological effects are known as the effects of turmeric or
      turmeric extracts, as mentioned above, most of the effects
      coincide with the physiological effects of the curcuminoids, in
      particular curcumin and, therefore, it is believed that the
      curcuminoids are principal active ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It is also known that turmeric contains essential oil
      components as well and most of them are bisabolane type
      sesquiterpenoids, for example ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone and
      [beta]-turmerone. Known physiological activities of turmeric
      essential oil component include mosquitocidal activity (cf.
      Non-Patent Document 1), apoptosis-inducing activity (cf.
      Non-Patent Document 2), prostaglandin and nitrogen oxide
      production-inhibiting activity (cf. Non-Patent Document 3 and 4)
      and liver function-improving activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] On the other hand, among the plants of the family
      Zingiberaceae, genus Zingiber (Curcuma sp.), there are not only
      turmeric (autumn turmeric: Curcuma long L.) but also such
      varieties as wild turmeric (spring turmeric: Curcuma aromatica
      Salisb.), zedoary (purple turmeric: Curcuma zedoaria Rosc.) and
      xanthorrza (Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb.). These are herbs belonging
      to the same genus but differ in components contained therein.
      Thus, turmeric and xanthorrza are rich in the curcuminoids,
      typically curcumin, and all the species contain essential oil
      components but the compounds contained therein differ from species
      to species and are characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It has been disclosed that curcumenone (cf. Patent Document
      1) and (4S,5S)-(+)-germacrone-4,5-epoxide (cf. Patent Document 2)
      contained in wild turmeric (spring turmeric: Curcuma aromatica
      Salisb.) have glucose tolerance improving activity and are useful
      as antidiabetics. Further, it has been disclosed that
      [alpha]-curcumene, a bisabolane type sesquiterpenoid contained in
      xanthorrza (Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb.), has serum triglyceride
      lowering activity and is useful as a lipid metabolism improving
      agent (cf. Patent Document 3). However, it is not known as yet
      that turmeric (Curcuma longa L.)-derived essential oil components,
      in particular the bisabolane type sesquiterpenoids ar-turmerone,
      [alpha]-turmerone and [beta]-turmerone, have blood sugar lowering
      activity or blood sugar increase inhibiting activity, and visceral
      fat reducing activity.<br>

      [0036] Turmeric is a safe food material having a long history of
      being eaten as a food. Twenty or more compounds are known as
      essential oil components derived from a plant material of the
      genus Curcuma origin. The ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone,
      [beta]-turmerone, curlone, bisacumol, and
      [beta]-sesquiphellandrene, which are to be used in the present
      invention, are known as species of the bisabolane type
      sesquiterpenoids, which are essential oil components derived from
      turmeric (autumn turmeric: Curcuma long L.). The ar-turmerone,
      [alpha]-turmerone, [beta]-turmerone, curlone, bisacumol, and
      [beta]-sesquiphellandrene, which are to be used in the present
      invention, may be obtained from essential oil components derived
      from a plant material of the genus Curcuma origin, or chemically
      synthesized as long as they conform to food or food additive
      manufacturing standards, among others. Those obtained from an
      essential oil component derived from a plant material of the genus
      Curcuma origin are preferred. These 6 compounds may be used each
      as a single compound in the practice of the invention, or a
      mixture of two or more of them may also be used in the practice of
      the invention. As the compound mentioned above, ar-turmerone,
      [alpha]-turmerone and [beta]-turmerone are preferred, and
      ar-turmerone is more preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As the compound selected from among the bisabolane type
      sesquiterpenoids derived from Curcuma longa L., there may be
      mentioned, for example, ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone and
      [beta]-turmerone mentioned above, in addition curlone, bisacumol,
      and [beta]-sesquiphellandrene. As the compound selected from among
      the bisabolane type sesquiterpenoids derived from Curcuma longa
      L., ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone and [beta]-turmerone are
      preferred, and ar-turmerone is more preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The method for preparing the above-mentioned compounds to
      be used in the practice of the invention is not particularly
      restricted but any of those methods known in the art can be used.
      For example, an essential oil component can be obtained directly
      from a plant material of the genus Curcuma origin by such a method
      as solvent extraction using a hydrophobic solvent such as hexane,
      supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, or steam distillation. An
      essential oil component can also be obtained as a sesquiterpenoid
      fraction by subjecting a curcuma extract (extract, oleoresin)
      obtained by extraction with a solvent such as ethanol to column
      chromatography using silica gel or a resin for purification. The
      thus-obtained essential oil component derived from a plant
      material of the genus Curcuma origin generally contains about 50
      to 60% by weight of a sum total of the bisabolane type
      sesquiterpenoids ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone,
      [beta]-turmerone, curlone, bisacumol, [beta]-sesquiphellandrene.
      In addition, the method for obtaining such bisabolane type
      sesquiterpenoid compounds as ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone and
      [beta]-turmerone from the essential oil component derived from a
      plant material of the genus Curcuma origin is not particularly
      restricted but may comprise column chromatography using silica gel
      or a resin for purification, by which the compounds can be
      separated as a mixture or can be purified as respective single
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The content of the compound mentioned above in the agent
      for preventing and/or ameliorating life style-related diseases
      according to the invention may be properly selected depending on
      the intended application but is preferably about 1 to 100% by
      weight and more preferably about 10 to 90% by weight. The agent
      for preventing and/or ameliorating life style-related diseases
      according to the invention may contain other ingredients for the
      purpose of improving the nutrition, taste, odor, flavor, property,
      etc. thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] When the an agent for preventing and/or ameliorating life
      style-related diseases according to the invention is taken for the
      above-mentioned compound(s) as an active ingredient(s) to produce
      the effects thereof, the total amount of the compound(s) per day
      per adult is desirably such that preferably about 0.1 to 1,000
      mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 1 to 100 mg/kg body
      weight, be taken continuously.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The agent for preventing and/or ameliorating life
      style-related diseases of the invention can be utilized as or in
      functional foods such as health foods or functional health foods
      (specific health foods, functional nutritive foods). Such foods
      are not restricted in shape or form but the above agent can be
      utilized in supplement forms such as capsules and tablets; drink
      forms such as refreshing drinks and health drinks; or food forms
      such as processed foods and nutrient-adjusted foods. Such
      functional foods containing the agent for preventing and/or
      ameliorating life style-related diseases mentioned above also
      constitute an aspect of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      E<b>FFECT OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] In the following, the present invention is described
      further in details by means of examples. However, these examples
      are no limitative of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] A turmeric powder (Kaneka Sun Spice Co., Ltd.; 700 g) was
      immersed in 3.5 liters of n-hexane, allowed to stand in the dark
      at room temperature for 3 days and then filtered to give a primary
      extract. The residue after filtration was immersed in 3.5 liters
      of n-hexane, allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for
      1 day and then filtered to give a secondary extract. The primary
      extract and secondary extract were combined and concentrated under
      reduced pressure to give 50.4 g of a hexane extract of turmeric.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As a result of silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC),
      it was confirmed that the hexane extract of turmeric contained
      essential oil components but did not contain any curcuminoids. The
      TLC was carried out using Silica Gel 60F254 (Merck Ltd.) plates,
      with a 9:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol mixture as a developing
      solvent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0046] The blood sugar increase inhibiting effect of the hexane
      extract of turmeric as prepared in Example 1 was evaluated using
      KK-A&lt;[gamma]&gt; mice known as type II diabetes model animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] KK-A A&lt;[gamma]&gt; mice (females, 6 weeks of age) were
      divided into two groups (5 animals per group), which were used as
      a control group and a hexane extract-dosed group. The control
      group was given a purified powder feed (Oriental Yeast Co.), and
      the hexane extract-dosed group was given the purified powder feed
      supplemented with 0.5% by weight of the hexane extract of turmeric
      as prepared in Example 1. The purified powder feed had the
      following composition: 20% by weight of casein, 49.948% by weight
      of corn starch, 10% by weight of sucrose, 10% by weight of soybean
      oil, 5% by weight of cellulose powder, 3.5% by weight of AIN-93
      mineral mix, 1% by weight of AIN-93 vitamin mix, 0.25% by weight
      of choline bitartrate, 0.002% by weight of tert-butylhydroquinone
      and 0.3% by weight of L-cystine.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Small blood samples were collected from the mice via the
      caudal vein at the start of feeding and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks
      later. Each blood sample was measured for blood sugar using a
      Glutest Ace portable blood sugar meter (SANWA KAGAKU KENKYUSHO
      CO., LTD.). The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>

      After 4 weeks&nbsp; 393 ± 18&nbsp; 299 ± 46 (P &lt; 0.1)<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In the control group, the blood sugar levels after 2 weeks
      and 4 weeks were higher as compared with the time of start of
      feeding, whereby it was confirmed that the animals became
      hyperglycemic. On the other hand, the sugar levels in the hexane
      extract-dosed group after 2 weeks and 4 weeks were clearly lower
      than those in the control group; thus, a blood sugar increase
      inhibiting effect was observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] A turmeric oleoresin (Maruzen Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.; 30
      g) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by
      elution with 10% (by volume) ethyl acetate/n-hexane. The eluate
      was concentrated to dryness to give 13.5 g of a sesquiterpenoid
      fraction of turmeric.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] As a result of high-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC), it was confirmed that the sesquiterpenoid fraction of
      turmeric contained such bisabolane type sesquiterpenoids as
      ar-turmerone, [alpha]-turmerone and [beta]-turmerone but did not
      contain any curcuminoids. The HPLC was carried out at 30[deg.] C.
      using a TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (4.6*75 mm) (Tosoh Corporation) and
      an acetonitrile (A)-distilled water (B) system as the mobile phase
      under gradient conditions such that the concentration of A was
      increased from 45% to 70% at a constant rate from minute 0 to
      minute 15 and then maintained at 70% from minute 15 to minute 30.
      The flow rate was 0.7 ml/minute, the injection size was 20 [mu]l,
      and the detection wavelength was 254 nm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] The blood sugar increase inhibiting effect and visceral fat
      reducing effect of the sesquiterpenoid fraction of turmeric as
      prepared in Example 3 was evaluated using KK-A&lt;[gamma]&gt; mice
      known as type II diabetes model animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] KK-A&lt;[gamma]&gt; mice (females, 6 weeks of age) were
      divided into two groups (6 animals per group), which were used as
      a control group and a sesquiterpenoid fraction-dosed group. The
      control group was given a high-fat powder feed (Oriental Yeast
      Co.), and the sesquiterpenoid fraction-dosed group was given the
      high-fat powder feed supplemented with 0.24% by weight of the
      sesquiterpenoid fraction as prepared in Example 3. The high-fat
      powder feed had the following composition: 25% by weight of
      casein, 14.869% by weight of cornstarch, 20% by weight of sucrose,
      2% by weight of soybean oil, 14% by weight of lard, 14% by weight
      of tallow, 5% by weight of cellulose powder, 3.5% by weight of
      AIN-93 mineral mix, 1% by weight of AIN-93 vitamin mix, 0.25% by
      weight of choline bitartrate, 0.006% by weight of
      tert-butylhydroquinone and 0.375% by weight of L-cystine.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Small blood samples were collected from the mice via the
      caudal vein at the start of feeding and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks
      later. Each blood sample was measured for blood sugar using a
      Glutest Ace portable blood sugar meter (SANWAKAGAKUKENKYUSHO CO.,
      LTD.). The results are shown in Table 2. After 5 weeks of feeding,
      the perirenal fat and the mesenteric fat within the abdominal
      cavity were excised from each mouse by anatomy and weighed. The
      results are shown in Table 3.<br>

      [0055] In the control group, the blood sugar levels after 2 weeks
      and 4 weeks were higher as compared with the time of start of
      feeding, whereby it was confirmed that the animals became
      hyperglycemic. On the other hand, the sugar levels in the
      sesquiterpenoid fraction-dosed group after 2 weeks and 4 weeks
      were clearly lower than those in the control group; thus, a blood
      sugar increase inhibiting effect was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The weights of the perirenal fat and the mesenteric fat in
      the sesquiterpenoid fraction-dosed group were clearly lower than
      in the control group; thus, a visceral fat reducing effect was
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] A 3-g portion of the sesquiterpenoid fraction of turmeric
      prepared in Example 3 was subjected to ODS column chromatography,
      followed by elution with 65% (by volume) acetonitrile, whereby 0.7
      g of ar-turmerone was isolated and purified. That the isolated and
      purified compound was ar-turmerone was confirmed by structural
      analysis by &lt;1&gt; H-NMR and &lt;13&gt; C-NMR.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0058] The hexane extract of turmeric as prepared in Example 1,
      the sesquiterpenoid fraction of turmeric as prepared in Example 3
      and the ar-turmerone prepared in Example 5 were measured for
      PPAR[gamma] ligand activity levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] CV-1 cells (male African green monkey kidney-derived
      cultured cells) were seeded onto a 96-well culture plate
      (6*10&lt;3 &gt; cells/well) and cultured under conditions of
      37[deg.] C. and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The medium used was DMEM
      (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; GIBCO) supplemented with 10%
      FBS (fetal bovine serum), 10 ml/L of a solution of penicillin and
      streptomycin (5,000 IU/ml and 5,000 [mu]g/ml, respectively; GIBCO)
      and 37 mg/L of ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
      Ltd.). Cells were washed with OPTI-MEM (GIBCO), a serum-free
      medium for transfection, and then transfected with two plasmids,
      namely pM-PPAR[gamma] and 4xUASg-luc, using Lipofectamine Plus
      (Invitrogen Corporation), a gene transfer reagent. pM-PPAR[gamma]
      is a chimera protein expression plasmid resulting from joining of
      the yeast-derived transcription factor GAL4 gene (amino acid
      sequence 1-147) and the PPAR[gamma] ligand binding site gene
      (amino acid sequence 204-505), and 4xUASg-luc is a reporter
      plasmid with 4 repetitions of a GAL4 responsive element (UASg) as
      inserted upstream of the luciferase gene. At about 24 hours after
      transfection, the medium was replaced with a medium containing the
      sample (hexane extract of Example 1, sesquiterpenoid fraction of
      Example 3 or ar-turmerone of Example 5) (4 wells), followed by 24
      hours of cultivation. Each sample was dissolved in dimethyl
      sulfoxide (DMSO) and the solution, or DMSO used in a no treatment
      control group, was added to the medium to each concentration given
      in Table 4. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
      (PBS+) containing Ca and Mg, then luclite (PerkinElmer), a
      luciferase chemiluminescence reagent, was added, and the
      luciferase-due chemiluminescence intensity was measured using a
      TopCount microplate scintillation/luminescence counter
      (PerkinElmer).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] For each sample, the mean of luminescence intensities (4
      wells) was determined, the ratio thereof to the value for the no
      treatment control was calculated and the relative activity was
      reported as the PPAR[gamma] ligand activity of the sample. The
      results obtained by carrying out the experiment in triplicate are
      shown in Table 4.<br>

          <b>A COMPOSITION TO ENHANCE THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CURCUMIN
            &nbsp;</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a composition of curcumin with the
      essential oil of turmeric, with Ar-turmerol as the main
      constituent, to enhance the bioavailability of curcumin and to
      augment the biological activity of curcumin. Such enhanced
      bioavailability has been demonstrated in human volunteers.<br>
      <br>
      Curcumin [1 ,7-bis (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1
      ,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione is a major yellow pigment of turmeric, a
      commonly used spice, derived from the rhizome of the herb Curcuma
      longa Linn. In the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia,
      turmeric has traditionally been used as a treatment for
      inflammation, skin wounds, and tumors. Clinical activity of
      curcumin is yet to be confirmed; however, in preclinical animal
      models, curcumin has shown cancer chemopreventive, antineoplastic
      and antiinflammatory properties (for a review, see, Kelloff, G.I.,
      et al, J. Cell Biochem., 1996, 265:54-71). Especially interesting
      is its ability to prevent the formation of carcinogen-induced
      intestinal premalignant lesions and malignancies in rats (Rao, CV.
      et al, Cancer Res., 1995, 55:259-66; Kawamori, T. et al, Cancer
      Res., 1999, 59:597-601 ), and in the multiple neoplasia (Min/+)
      mouse (Mahmood, N.N. et al, Carcinogenesis, 2000, 31 :921-27), a
      genetic model of the human disease familial adenomatous polyposis.
      Curcumin acts as a scavenger of oxygen species such as hydroxyl
      radical, superoxide anion and singlet oxygen (Subramanian, M. et
      al, Mutat Res., 1994, 311 :249-55; Tonnesen, H. H. et al, int. J.
      Pharm., 1992, 87:79-87; Reddy, A.C.P. et al, MoI. Cell Biochem.,
      1994, 137:1-8) and interferes with lipid peroxidation (Donatus,
      I.A., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1990, 39:1869-75; Sharma, S. C. et al,
      Biochem. Pharmacol., 1972, 21 :1210-14). Curcumin suppresses a
      number of key elements in cellular signal induction pathways
      pertinent to growth, differentiation and malignant
      transformations. Among signalling events inhibited by curcumin are
      protein kinases (Liu, J.V. et al, Carcinogenesis, 1993,
      14:857-61), c- Jun/AP-1 activation (Huang, T.S. et al, Proc. Natl.
      Acad. Sci., 1991 , 88:5292-96), prostaglandin biosynthesis (Huang,
      M-T. et al, In L.W. Battenberg (ed.) Cancer Chemoprevention, CRC
      Press, Boca Raton, 1992, pp375-91) and activity and expression of
      the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (Huang, M. T., et al, Cancer Res.,
      1991 , 51 :813-19; Zhang, F. et al, Carcinogenesis, 1999,
      20:445-51). This latter property is probably mediated by the
      ability of curcumin to block activation of the transcription
      factor NF-KB at the level of the NF-[kappa]B inducing
      kinase/IKK[alpha]/[beta] signalling complex (Plummer, S. et al,
      Oncogene, 1999, 18:6013-20).<br>
      <br>
      Curcumin directly inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 and also inhibits
      the transcription of the gene responsible for its production.
      Cyclooxygenases (COX) catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins
      (PGs) from arachidonic acid. There are two isoforms of COX,
      designated COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in
      most tissues and appears to be responsible for housekeeping
      functions (Funk, CD. et al, FASEB J., 1991 , 5:2304-12) while
      COX-2 is not detectable in most normal tissues but is induced by
      oncogenes, growth factors, carcinogens and tumor promoters
      (Subbaramiah, K. et al, 1996, Cancer Res., 1996, 56:4424-29;
      DuBois, R.N. et al, J. Clin, invest, 1994, 93:493- 98; Kelley,
      D.J. et al, Carcinogenesis, 1997, 18:795-99). Several different
      mechanisms account for the link between COX-2 activity and
      carcinogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Curcumin is not simply an alternative to non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), which also have
      anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties. This is
      so because COX is a bifunctional enzyme with cyclooxygenase and
      peroxidase activities. Aside from being important for PG
      synthesis, the peroxidase function contributes to the activation
      of procarcinogens. Therefore, the failure of NSAIDS to inhibit the
      peroxidase function of COX potentially limits their effectiveness
      as anticancer agents. Curcumin, in contrast, down-regulates levels
      of COX-2 and thereby decreases both the cyclooxygenase and
      peroxidase activities of the enzyme.<br>
      <br>
      Curcumin is among the few agents to block both the COX and LOX
      (lipoxygenase) pathways of inflammation and carcinogenesis by
      directly modulating arachidonic acid metabolism. In a study to
      evaluate the effect of curcumin on the metabolism and action of
      arachidonic acid in mouse epidermis, it was found that topical
      application of curcumin inhibited arachidonic acid-induced ear
      inflammation in mice.(Huang, M.T., et al Cancer Res., 1988,
      48:5941-46; 1991 , 51 :813-19). Curcumin (10 [mu]M) inhibited the
      conversion of arachidonic acid to 5- and 8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
      acid by 60% and 51 %, respectively (LOX pathway) and the
      metabolism to PGE2, PGF20 and PGD2 by 70%, 64% and 73%,
      respectively (COX pathway). In another study, dietary
      administration of 0.2% curcumin to rats inhibited
      azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis and decreased colonic
      and tumor phospholipase A2, phospholipase CyI, and PGE2 levels
      (Rao, CV. etal, Cancer Res., 1995, 55:259-66). In this study,
      dietary curcumin also decreased enzyme activity in the colonic
      mucosa and tumors for the formation of PGE2, PGF2[alpha], PGD2,
      6-keto- PGF2n and thromboxane B2 via the COX system and production
      of 5(S)-, 8(S)-, 12(S)-, and 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid
      via the LOX pathway was also inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      Despite its impressive array of beneficial bioactivities, the
      bioavailability of curcumin in animals and man remains low. In
      rodents, curcumin demonstrates poor systemic bioavailability after
      p.o. dosing (Ireson, CR. et al, Cancer Res., 2001 , 41 :1058- 64)
      which may be related to its inadequate absorption and fast
      metabolism. Curcumin bioavailability may also be poor in humans as
      seen from the results of a recent pilot study of a standardized
      turmeric extract in colorectal cancer patients (Sharma, R.A. et
      al, CHn. Cancer Res., 2001 , 7:1834-1900). Indirect evidence
      suggests that curcumin is metabolized in the intestinal tract.
      Curcumin undergoes metabolic O-conjugation to curcumin glucuronide
      and curcumin sulfate and bioreduction to tetrahydrocurcumin,
      hexahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcuminol in rats and mice in vivo
      (Pan, M. H. et al, Drug Metabol. Dispos., 1999, 27:486-94; Asai,
      A., et al, Life ScL, 2000, 67:2785-93), in suspensions of human
      and rat hepatocytes (Ireson et al, loc. cit) and in human and rat
      intestine (Ireson , CR. et al, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev.,
      2002, 11 :105-11). Metabolic conjugation and reduction of curcumin
      was more in human than in rat intestinal tissue. It has been
      suggested that the intestinal tract plays an important role in the
      metabolic disposition of curcumin. This is based predominantly on
      experiments in which [&lt;3&gt;H] labeled cucrcumin was incubated
      with inverted rat gut sacs (Ravindranath, V. and Chandrasekhara,
      N., Toxicology, 1981 , 20::251-57). This was later confirmed in
      intestinal fractions from humans and rats. Intestinal mucosa, as
      well as liver and kidney tissue from the rat, can glucurodinate
      and sulfate curcumin, as judged by the analysis of differential
      amounts of curcumin present before and after treatment of tissue
      extracts with conjugate-hydrolyzing enzymes (Asai et al, loc cit).
      Thus, gut metabolism contributes substantially to the overall
      metabolic yield generated from curcumin in vivo. In human
      intestinal fractions, conjugation with activated sulfuric or
      glucuronic acids was much more abundant, whereas conjugation in
      human hepatic tissues was less extensive, than in the rat tissues
      (Ireson, C. R., et al, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 2002, 11
      :105-11).<br>
      <br>
      Although p.o. administered curcumin has poor bioavailability and
      only low or non- measurable blood levels were observed (Perkins,
      S. et al, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 2002, 11 :535-40),
      this route of administration inhibits chemically induced skin and
      liver carcinogenesis (Limtrakul, P., et al, Cancer Lett, 1997,
      116:197-203; Chiang, S.E. et al, Carcinogenesis, 2000, 21
      :331-35). Oral administration of curcumin also inhibits the
      initiation of radiation-induced mammary and pituitary tumors
      (Inano, H. et al, Carcinogenesis, 2000, 21 :1835-41 ; Int. J.
      Radiat.Oncol. Biol. Phys., 2002, 52:212-23; ibid, 2002,
      53:735-43). Similarly, in a study to assess the curcumin levels in
      the colorectum, a daily dose of 3.6 g curcumin achieves
      pharmacologically effective levels in the colorectum with
      negligible distribution of curcumin outside the gut (Garcea, G. et
      al, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 2005, 14:120-25). Earlier
      Shobha et al (Planta Med., 1998, 64:353-56) had observed that
      administering piperine along with curcumin enhances the
      bioavailability of curcumin. However, the level of enhancement was
      only modest and no curcumin could be detected after 3 hours even
      when supplemented with piperine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Thus, in order to derive full benefits from the administration of
      curcumin in human subjects, ways and means to enhance its
      bioavailability needs to be explored. The present invention is an
      effort in this direction. It was found that when the essential oil
      of turmeric was added to curcumin, the bioavailability of curcumin
      is significantly enhanced. Accordingly, a composition of curcumin
      admixed with a suitable proportion of turmerone (the main
      component of the turmeric essential oil) is provided. This
      composition was administered to 9 human volunteers and blood
      samples were collected at zero hour and then at hourly or
      half-hourly intervals upto 8 hours. Maximum absorption was
      observed at 3 hours after ingestion and consumption of the said
      composition resulted in curcumin levels that were 5-16 fold higher
      compared to curcumin alone. Earlier Shobha et al (Planta Med.,
      1998, 64:353-56) had observed that administering piperine along
      with curcumin enhances the bioavailability of curcumin. However,
      the level of enhancement was only modest and no curcumin could be
      detected after 3 hours even when supplemented with piperine. With
      turmerone as the adjuvant, as in the present invention, peak
      absorption occurred at 3 hours and persisted at low levels at
      least until 8 hours, beyond which no measurements were made. The
      invention relates to a product to enhance the bioavailability of
      curcumin by mixing a suitable portion of the volatile oil obtained
      from turmeric with the curcuminoids isolated from turmeric. For
      this purpose, the volatile oil of turmeric was isolated by
      conventional methods of steam distillation to isolate essential
      oils and is well known in the art.. Curcumin is isolated from the
      de-oiled turmeric by solvent extraction. Suitable solvents for
      this purpose include acetone, hexane, ethyl acetate,
      dicholoroethane, chloroform, etc. The extraction is conveniently
      carried out at moderate temperatures (40-55&lt;0&gt;C) and the
      solvent is partially removed to yield a concentrate containing
      30-60% solids. This solution is cooled to obtain crystals of
      curcumin which are isolated by any suitable method such as
      filtration or centrifugation. This product was analyzed to contain
      95% curcumin. Curcumin and the volatile oils of curcumin are mixed
      and blended to get a uniform product. The ratio of curcumin to oil
      can be varied between 3:1 to 99:1 , preferably in the ratio 85:15.
      A more preferred ratio is 95:5. Gelatin capsules containing 500 mg
      of the blend were prepared. Curcumin capsules without the
      essential oil were similarly prepared.<br>
      <br>
      Nine healthy human volunteers aged between 25 and 45 years of age
      were selected for the study. They were given curcumin and the
      inventive composition in capsules at the dosage of 50 mg/kg body
      weight. They were advised to take curcumin first. Blood samples
      were collected at zero hour and periodically at one-hour or
      half-hour intervals for 8 hours. After a washout period of one
      week, the same protocol was followed with the inventive
      composition. The whole blood was extracted exhaustively with ethyl
      acetate. Recoveries ranged from 80.12 to 86.49. The ethyl acetate
      extract was analyzed by HPLC on a RP-C18 column (25 x 4.5 mm)
      using methanol as solvent and UV detection at 420 nm. The eluant
      flow rate was 1 ml/min. A typical result is given in the following
      Table.<br>
      <br>

      8.0 1.11 5.09<br>
      <br>
      The results are also graphically represented in Fig. 1. The peak
      absorption of curcumin occurred at 3 h and in the case of the
      Inventive composition, curcumin persisted in small amounts in the
      blood till 8 h beyond which measurements were not made. This is
      significant. At peak absorption the enhancement of bioavailability
      ranged among the 9 persons between 5 and 16-fold with a mean value
      of 10.62.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive composition has the additional benefit that the
      essential oil components are themselves bioactive (for example,
      see Yue, A et al, Int. J. MoI. Med., 2002, 9:481-84; Jayaprakasha,
      G.K. et al, Z.Naturforsch., 2002, 57:828-35) and thus is expected
      to synergistically enhance the bioactivity of curcumin.<br>
