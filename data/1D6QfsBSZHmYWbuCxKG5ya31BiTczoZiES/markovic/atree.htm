          In 1899, Nikola Tesla discovered the principle that now serves
          as the basis for the receiver unit that was first tested by
          peter Markovich in August of 1977. At this point, let us
          briefly review what was discovered by Dr. Tesla in July of
          1899. If we look at US Patent # 725,605 entitled "System of
          Signaling", we will find diagrams that described the Tesla
          system. This system was based on what Dr. Tesla called a wave
          phenomenon that was not electromagnetic in nature. This wave
          was able to produce useable electrical energy that was taken
          from the Earth's atmosphere. This wave as described by Tesla
          and partially proven by Markovich had a number of unique
          characteristics. First, the wave train was stationary with a
          length of about 185,000 miles and a width of about 200 miles.
          Secondly, it had a frequency of 925 cycles per second.
          Finally, the wave's speed was equal to or greater than the
          speed of light.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To understand the instrument
          and how it is able to generate electrical power, we must
          divide the unit into three components. These parts are the
          windings or coils (a primary and secondary units), their
          shape, and the height and diameter of the capacitor electrode
          (electron pool). Included in the design of the receiver is the
          type and composition of the materials used in its
          construction. To understand the theory behind the device, one
          must remember that the Earth and its Atmosphere are
          electromagnetically charged. Further, an instrument that is
          properly "grounded into this system can be used to receive and
          transmit useable energy -- a point discovered and noted by
          Tesla on July 17, 1899 at his Colorado Springs Laboratory.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Markovich device
          incorporates the basic principle discovered at Colorado
          Springs by Dr.Tesla -- namely, that the Earth is a giant
          condenser The Earth's surface can be seen as one plate and the
          ionosphere as the other plate through which an electric-like
          charge is constantly flowing. At present, the Markovich unit
          can be rated at 2.5 volts and 0.5 (or 0.025) amps. This rating
          yields approximately 1.25 (or 0.06) watts of power. If the
          presently loose connections were properly cleaned and
          soldered, the unit could produce an increased efficiency of
          about 18% or 1.48 (or 0.07) watts. Moreover, if the system
          were properly "grounded" by connecting it to another unit of
          oppositely wound coils, the efficiency could be increased from
          30 to 60% or 1.63 (or 0.08) to 2.19 (or 0.10) watts. This
          rating can also be vastly increased by altering the
          composition of the materials used to make the device. Here
          Markovich has confirmed the importance of using materials
          (metals) of high electrical conductivity such as copper,
          silver, gold, etc. the ideal material is a metal alloy of
          copper and silver. This material was employed by Tesla in the
          transmitter built at Wardenclyffe (Shoreham, Long Island (NY)
          in the early 1900s.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus the immediate goals of
          the research program on the rediscovered Tesla power system is
          basically five-fold in nature. First, the wave phenomenon has
          to be correctly measured and its exact nature discovered.
          Second, the exact relationship between the energy utilized by
          the machine and the better known certain types of materials
          that act as more efficient conductors of this energy must be
          fully ascertained. Fourth, the effect of the use of this
          system on the various organisms that inhabit this planet must
          be discovered. Finally, the possible interface to the
          so-called "psychic energy" and any possible relationships must
          be fully researched.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By adequately learning the
          nature of the energy that is produced by the Tesla-Markovich
          energy unit, a general theory of the nature of
          electromagnetism and energies closely related to them may be
          possible. In so doing, one may be able to advance the "state
          of the art" of Man's technology. Moreover, in the long run,
          the new discoveries may not only solve the energy crisis, but
          also the "technology crisis" that presently distorts the
          potential of contemporary civilization.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I, Peter T. Markovich,
          citizen of Canada, propose to explain the basis for what shall
          hereafter be known as the "Apparatus to Rectify Ether Energy"
          (ATREE)</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Preface ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Humanity has long been aware
          of a unique form of energy that appears to be related to the
          electromagnetic technologies of modern civilization. These
          energies have been referred to in all ancient civilizations
          under a number of different names such as chi, prana, mana,
          etc. In modern times, science has adopted new names for it.
          These terms, whterher "odic force", "orgone energy" or
          "bioplasmic effect" are no more than new terms for these
          ancient energies. In fact, research by modern physics
          indicates that this energy is related in part to the classic
          concept of the "ether" -- an energy that would be composed of
          all known and unknown forms of energy (those energies that
          occupy the electromagnetic spectrum and allied types). Indeed,
          it now seems that the new physics as created in the early part
          of this century has not completely disproven the existence of
          an "ether" that would "flow" throughout the universe, but has
          just established the need to determine whether the "ether"
          fits into a new general theory on the relationships between
          energy and matter. In this regard, the discovery of an
          instrument that could convert the "ether" into a more familiar
          energy form (e.g., electricity) would be a boon to the
          formulation of any new theory on the relationships of
          presently known energies to the "ether".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the spring of 1977, Peter
          Markovich was able to convert this energy into direct current
          (DC) electricity by the use of a specially constructed
          apparatus. Here, an important point must be made, that the
          instrument in question is not a perpetual motion machine, but
          simply a machine that is able by the use of a unique induction
          process to convert an energy of extremely high frequency
          (teracycles) to one of practically no cycles (DC electricity).
          Following a series of modifications, the apparatus was able by
          the fall of 1977 to have raised its voltage from 2.5 volts DC
          to 36 volts DC and its amperage to 0.7 amps from an initial
          0.025 amps. Further developments in the machine's technology
          had allowed Markovich to progress to instruments in the early
          part of 1978 that produced wattages in the vicinity of 0.5
          kilowatts of DC electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparatus
            To Rectify Ether Energy ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Apparatus To Rectify
          Ether Energy (ATREE) is a machine that is able to transform
          the energy of the ether into direct current (DC) electricity.
          In order to accomplish this feat, the instrument takes into
          account the nature of ether. As many scientists now know, the
          ether consists of a "compressible fluid" that has a density of
          10<sup>127</sup> to 10<sup>94</sup> wattseconds per cubic
          centimeter. This high energy density permits a cubic
          centimeter of ether to be able to provide for the energy needs
          of a small city. In addition, many scientists have also
          speculated that the ether may be conducted as a tensor field
          (motion by compression of the wave) and therefore is a
          stationary wave. These stationary waves would be able to
          penetrate and pass through almost all the heavenly bodies
          known to inhabit the universe. As is the case with radio
          waves, a particular antenna design would be necessary to
          efficiently collect and rectify this energy. Since its
          wavelength is 10<sup>-32</sup> centimeters and motion of the
          wave train is quite similar to that of stationary waves, a
          specially designed hollow ball construction of a highly
          conductive metal seems most appropriate for this task. In
          addition, the induction unit could take advantage of the
          modified "L" (electric) and "H" (magnetic) fields produced by
          the ether energy to induct a useful electric current.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To convert this energy into
          electricity, it is essential that a component be provided that
          can collect and begin the rectification of the ether energy
          found near the surface of the planet. This part must be able
          to receive, store and conduct the ether energy to the
          component of the ATREE that actually rectified the ether into
          DC electricity. Due to its almost corkscrew motion as well as
          its high frequency and near electrical properties, ether
          energy can be collected by a hollow ball whose diameter is
          approximately one-sixth that of the height of the
          rectification component. Moreover, the ball should be composed
          of a very thin (26 gauge or less) metal of high electrical
          conductivity, such as gold, silver or copper. In our case, a
          hollow ball composed of copper was employed. In operation, the
          ether will first collect around the outside of the ball and
          then easily penetrate the outer surface of the ball and
          collect in the form of a moving swirl on the inside surface of
          the ball. To get this pulsating energy to the unit that
          actually does the rectification, it is necessary to take
          advantage of the near electrical properties of the ether. At
          this time, a specially built copper core must be employed. The
          core of the converter is a copper rod that has the upper 5 %
          of its length inserted inside the copper collection ball. The
          top part of this element is needle shaped to permit the
          swirling ether energy to jump the gap to the tip of the copper
          core, much in the manner of an electrical spark completing a
          return to ground through a pointed electrode. This core is
          tightly wound with 26-gauge copper wire from a point directly
          beneath the ball down to the opposite end of the copper rod.
          Also, an outer coil built from insulated #14 household wire is
          used in the converter. This second coil is attached on one end
          to the outside of the collection ball and on its opposite end
          to the working electrical circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conversion of energy
          resembles in many ways the electromagnetic induction principle
          discovered in the 19th century. As noted previously, ether
          possesses two quasi-electromagnetic vectors. The first of
          these is the quasi-electric one that seems to carry a charge
          and to flow like electricity through wires. The second vector
          is a quasi-magnetism that differs only in the fact that the
          lines of flux are bent in an inward direction instead of the
          more well-known outward bend of magnetic flux. To induce
          electricity, the converter employs an unusual phenomenon
          related to these vectors. In the case of ether, the swirling
          energy flows into the rod and also into the tightly wound
          inner coil; however, the difference in rate and distance
          traveled allows the rod's energy to reach the bottom of this
          component way before that which goes by way of the inner coil.
          In doing so, the vectors cross and induce an electrical
          potential in the wires of the inner coil. To amplify this
          voltage, the outer coil must be wound counter to the winding
          of the inner coil. Here, the return circuit through this coil
          acts in the same manner as the secondary induction coil in a
          transformer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To summarize the process
          mentioned above, let us quickly review the entire conversion
          process. First, the ether jumps to the tip of the converter's
          core and is conducted toward the opposite end of the rod that
          is connected to the electrical circuit. Simultaneously, the
          ether flows through the tightly wound inner coil to the
          opposite end of the rod. The difference in rate and distance
          allows the coil and the copper rod to induce an electrical
          potential that is greater at the bottom of the rod than at its
          top. Finally, the outer coil wound counter to the inner one
          acts as an amplifier of the electrical potential and current
          since its fields (the electrical circuit return to the ball)
          have the property to amplify the quasi-electricity produced by
          the induction process in the copper rod and the inner coil. In
          this fashion, the ATREE is able to convert ether energy into
          useable DC electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To conclude, we have seen
          how a specially constructed instrument as first conceived and
          developed by Peter Markovich in the spring of 1977 has been
          able to conduct and convert ether into DC electricity. As
          future developments continue, it holds the promise of giving
          humanity a possible alternative to fossil and nuclear
          generation of electrical energy.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On February 8, 1978, a test
          of the Markovich Electric Power Source (MEPS) was conducted at
          the home of its inventor, Peter Markovich. Also in attendance
          for this demonstration was Don Murphy, Art Steele, and Sheldon
          Nidle. A series of tests were run in order to determine the
          current rating and closed and open circuit voltages of the
          MEPS. The first test was to hook the voltmeter in series with
          the device and then to add a number of resistors to determine
          the closed circuit voltage of the instrument. Following these
          tests, the MEPS was to be tested by having it light a 60-watt
          bulb. Current was to be determined by having the voltmeter
          connected in parallel to the MEPS and an ammeter connected in
          series to the electrical circuit of the MEPS. The results are
          as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Open Circuit&nbsp; 180 Volts
          DC&nbsp; 3.0 Amps</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">60 Watt Bulb&nbsp; 150

          VDC&nbsp; -----</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The results of the tests
          were quite impressive. The motor was run at a very high speed
          while the bulb was able to shine very brightly; however, the
          actual lumens given off was not measured. In addition to the
          DC current, an AC component was also measured. This phenomenon
          may be due to the nature of the meter employed as well as to
          the pulsing nature of the DC electricity that comes from the
          instrument. The low current that was measured when the 10
          megaohm resistor was shorting the MEPS was to be expected
          since such a high resistance did not lower the amount of
          voltage measured in the instrument. These tests indicate the
          fact that the unit is extremely more potent a power source
          than a battery since the instrument returned to its maximum
          measurements instantly after being disconnected and being
          drained for 5 to 10 minute periods.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Sirs:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As requested during our
          meeting, I am enclosing a general outline of ongoing research
          at Markovich Technology Institute in regards to the Markovich
          Tesla Electrical Power Source, referred to as MTEPS. One of
          our basic research units was demonstrated at the US Dept. of
          energy on April 25, 1978.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have developed my
          "Magnifying transmitter" based upon the initial research and
          the basic principle discovered at Colorado Springs, CO by Dr.
          Nikola tesla. As you are aware, Dr. Tesla received over 2,000
          US Patents, developed the basic poly-phase electrical systems
          used by Westinghouse and Edison, and produced many other basic
          electrical devices still sued today. That particular research
          is based upon my improvements on US patent # 725,605 entitled
          "System of Signalling" by Nikola tesla.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I was first able to prove
          the Tesla Theory to my satisfaction while aiding in the
          development of the tracking equipment for the early Sputnik
          satellites launched by the USSR during 1956. Since this
          period, I have been able to satisfactorily prove a number of
          Tesla Theories including an electromagnetic scope and a basic
          theory to separate hydrogen and oxygen from seawater into
          conventional fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Tesla Colorado
          Experiments and Tesla Theory as well as my own research seem
          to indicate the possible utilization of cosmic energy rather
          than fossil fuels, nuclear, etc., in the production of either
          AC or DC electrical power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MTEPS is a system based upon
          a stationary wave phenomenon described by Nikola Tesla that is
          not electromagnetic in nature. This wave as described by Tesla
          and partially proven by me has many unique characteristics.
          First, the wave train is stationary with a length of
          approximately 125,000 miles and a width of approximately 200
          miles. Secondly, it has a frequency of 925 cycles per second.
          Finally, the wave's speed is equal to or greater than the
          speed of light at 185,000 miles per second.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Testing and new developments
          have been in progress for over one year with the following
          results:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Sept. 28, 1977</i> ~
          Faraday Cage Experiment determined power rating and electrical
          potential at voltage of 2.5 V exactly; amperage at level of
          0.5 A; wattage under ideal conditions at 1.25 W. resulting
          power source was attached to a series of loads which included
          a small incandescent light bulb used for flashlights and a 10
          ohm resistor. Light remained bright and steady indicating
          device applicable for common electrical usage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Nov. 15-16, 1977</i> ~
          Continuation of research with modifications on MTEPS. Results
          included: Voltage increase from 2.5 V to 25 V; Amperage
          increased from 0.5 A to 0.6 A with a total increase of
          approximately 10x in potential and 20x in power. Note: It
          appears that some form of new energy is being induced to
          produce a useable DC electrical current.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Nov. 20, 1977</i> ~
          Experiment by Marcel Vogel, Senior Scientist for IBM Research
          Center, San Jose, CA. Results included: Open circuit voltage
          of 36 volts; open circuit current of 0.8 amps. When a load of
          1,000 ohms was added in a closed circuit, the potential
          dropped to 20 volts and the closed circuit current remained at
          0.8 Amps. When the load was disconnected, the voltage rapidly
          returned to 36 volts in less than one minute (20 seconds). The
          oscilloscope verified the steady DC voltage emitted from the
          MTEPS Unit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Feb. 8, 1978</i> ~
          Continuation of witnessed experiment. Open circuit resulted in
          180 V; current at 3.0 Amps, which lighted a 60 watt bulb. Both
          an AC and DC current component was measured.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These tests indicate that
          the MTEPS Unit is extremely potent as a power source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>May &amp; July, 1978</i>
          ~ The current working model of the MTEPS Research is producing
          360 volts; current at 14 amps; producing AC and DC electrical
          power capable of running a 5 hp motor to light 6 household
          light bulbs. This was successfully demonstrated at the US
          Dept. of Energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Based upon these successful
          experiments in a very short period, I expect that with proper
          funding, Markovich Technology Institute could produce a vastly
          improved, high performance MTEPS Unit demonstrating an
          entirely new energy technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The energy ramifications are
          quite evident. The applications of the MTEPS are unlimited.
          However, initial consideration should be given to the original
          Tesla concept of a new type of communications system that
          would be virtually an unjammable communications method and
          very effective beyond out solar system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additional areas for
          exploration include:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Deep space magnetic
          propulsion vehicles;</font> <br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since our last series of
          tests a series of modifications of the Tesla-Markovich Power
          Source have been completed. Among these changes were the
          following:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Alteration of the
          capacitor ball by substitution of a larger copper unit and the
          addition of a needle-shaped mast core that was entwined with
          30-gauge copper wire (bare). Also, a series of copper wire
          prongs attached to the top of the unit with these prongs put
          through the top of the unit and attached to the inside of the
          ball.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Alteration of the mast
          unit by substitution of a much larger unit (OD of 3/4") and
          the intertwining of the new copper core with 30-gauge wire. In
          addition, the use of #14 insulated electrical wire wound to
          the ID of the new brass mast with a winding of #14 bare
          electrical wire interwound with the insulated #14 wire.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Addition of a solid
          connection between the secondary and the primary coils by the
          use of aluminum tape.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Addition of two new
          coils. One that goes from the mast to the primary tube and one
          that goes from the mast core to the secondary-primary
          connection.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When testing was finally
          begun, a number of unusual phenomena were discovered. Among
          these were the following:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Voltage was increased in
          the unit from 2.5 V to 25 V while amperage was increased
          from0.5 A to 0.6 A --- a total increase of approximately 10x
          in potential and 20x in power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) The circuit was found to
          produce current when a number of different connection were
          attempted --- e.g., mast to ground, ball to secondary, etc.
          The device only failed to produce current when some
          connections involving the primary were attempted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) It appears that some
          form of new energy is being induced to produce a useable DC
          electrical current.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the present time, we are
          in the process of adding more windings to the capacitor unit
          and the mast. Hopefully, this action will boost the electrical
          potential to 36 volts.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After the capacitor ball was
          altered by covering it with aluminum tape and the insertion of
          several prongs at various angles to the needle-shaped core of
          the mast inside the ball, the unit (M-1a) was taken to the
          home of Marcel Vogel in San Jose, CA. Here, it was set up with
          two high impedance voltmeters and an oscilloscope to measure
          any possible effects. In addition, a series of experiments
          which involved the use of Mr. Vogel's psychic ability to
          increase and decrease the voltage of the MTEPS were attempted.
          The results of the experiments were as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) The readings of the
          units were increased as initially predicted: an open voltage
          of 36 volts and an open circuit current of 0.8 amps.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) When a load of 1,000
          ohms was added in a closed circuit the potential dropped to 20
          volts and the closed circuit current remained at 0.8 amps.
          When the load was disconnected the voltage rapidly returned to
          36 volts in less than one minute (20 seconds).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Marcel Vogel appeared to
          be able to increase and decrease voltage by about 3 volts. Mr.
          Vogel reported that the use of a clear quartz crystal left a
          feeling of coolness in his feet while the use of an amethyst
          crystal produced a feeling of warmth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) The use of an
          oscilloscope again verified the steady DC voltage emitted by
          the unit. However, any attempt at looking for electrostatic
          fields has to be discounted since the research did not take
          place in a Faraday cage and the testing equipment was tied to
          extension cords feeding off standard AC house current.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These tests again proved the
          ability of the unit to perform as a battery and/or timed
          capacitor in the DC circuits employed. It also pointed out
          even more clearly the fact that the unit may be drawing
          off&nbsp; "life" or "cosmic" energies and acting as a
          transducer to turn them into useable DC electrical energy. Our
          next experiments will involve the use of a large Tesla air
          induction coil interphased with the MTEPS in order to test the
          wireless power transmission theories of Dr. Tesla as well as
          the upgrading of the unit to larger wattages so that the unit
          can be tested as a main and/or auxiliary power source. In so
          doing, we feel that it will be possible to eventually use the
          device as an AC power source.</font> </p>

      <p>The device in question is one of a number of energy transducers
        that converts extremely high frequency energy to a form
        comparable to alternating or direct current electricity. The
        process involves in all cases, the utilizing of the instrument
        as a specially designed resonating cavity. This cavity can be
        composed of either a number of crystals, a series of coils, or a
        combination of the above. To understand how the unit operates,
        it is first necessary to briefly describe the nature of this
        energy source. </p>
      <p>Research and experimentation have established that this energy
        is one that pervades the known universe and is constantly
        flowing through the Earth itself. It has been found to be quite
        dense, with enough power to light an American city of around
        50,000 persons for a year. Because of its origins and immense
        power potential, this energy has been called "vacuum," "cosmic,"
        "radiant," or "zero-point" energy. Dr. Nikola Tesla, the
        discoverer of the electric age, may have used this energy to
        create his most fantastic invention-the "Magnifying
        Transmitter." </p>
      <p>At the beginning of this century, Tesla was able to send
        electrical energy through the earth without the use of wires. In
        a test transmission, he sent electricity to a receiver located
        twenty six miles away where a bank of 200 fifty watt light bulbs
        lit for as long as the transmitter operated. This demonstration
        convinced Tesla that he had learned the principles of operating
        the Earth as a gigantic resonating cavity. This resonating
        cavity had the ability to conduct not only electricity, but also
        radio waves and any other type of electromagnetic wave. However,
        the key part was the ability of the transmitter to magnify
        electromagnetic waves. Also, the device had the ability to
        transmit this energy at a frequency comparable to the Schuman
        cycle (6 to 13 hertz). This fact indicated that Tesla had
        stumbled onto a new form of energy directly convertible into
        electricity. Evidence of this discovery can be seen in two
        actions taken by Tesla after the success of the Colorado Springs
        Experiments. In July 1902, he wrote a letter to Robert Underwood
        Johnson in which there was mentioned a discovery of a new
        unknown energy that could be used to create "fuel-less motors."
        At the same time, Tesla was demonstrating these devices to other
        friends and refusing to apply for U.S. patents. </p>
      <p>Recently researchers have discovered a number of interesting
        facts about Tesla's energy. First the energy traveled through
        the universe as a spiraling stationary wave or corkscrew. Second
        the energy can be conducted by electrical instruments (wires,
        etc.) composed of metals that are also excellent conductors of
        electricity (gold, silver, copper, etc). Strangely, those
        conductors that have no known natural magnetic property such as
        aluminum can not be used to collect these energies, but only to
        disperse them. Finally the energy in its corkscrew fashion
        carried itself around the outside of a wire and not through it
        as was the case with conventional electricity. Hence, it will be
        necessary to construct motors that are wound slightly
        differently in order to make the best use of this energy source.
        However it will be possible to inter-phase this energy into the
        modern electrical world and gradually "phase in" the new system.
      </p>
      <p>It is one thing to acknowledge the presence of this strange
        form of energy, but quite another to construct a successful
        transducer device. To do so a potential inventor must realize
        that one should design a device that will have a number of
        interesting properties. First the instrument must be constructed
        of materials that can collect the energy, i.e., conductive
        metals such as copper, silver, etc. Second, the unit must be
        able to gradually step down the energy. This process can be
        accomplished by a series of tightly wound coils or else a
        specially faceted quartz crystal that is connected in series to
        a number of tightly wound coils. It is the purpose of the first
        set of spiral coils or of the crystal to act as the source of
        control for the "electrical energy" in the circuit. The crystal
        or spiral coil receives this "energy" from a "collector" and
        converter coils that are attached to it. For the system to
        operate efficiently, the collector and converter coils must be
        of a similar shape as the coils that directly surround the
        crystal or else a harmonic ratio of the crystal and its coils.
        By putting the energy through enough turns of wire and
        constructing a properly faceted crystal, one is able to drop the
        energy to a frequency that can be inter-phased with electrical
        circuitry. Such a device will only encounter two potential
        problems. First, there is the great amount of radiant energy
        that can be given off by an improperly tuned coil. This problem
        can be overcome by the use of a proper amount of windings and
        the substitution of materials that are more conductive than
        those used in previous models. Finally, one must overcome the
        problem of lower amperages in crystal units. This problem can be
        solved by the use of a system of specially constructed grounds
        and the use of smaller crystals in the circuitry between the
        crystal control system and the collection and conversion system.
        In this way, improper balances in the device can be overcome in
        the development of this new system. </p>
      <p>As we have seen, there exists a number of ways to successfully
        convert space energy into electrical energy. This largely
        unknown energy can be used to perform all the important tasks
        that can be presently accomplished by electricity. That is, the
        energy can be utilized as a communications system, power system,
        or transportation system. </p>
      <p><b>Space Energy Power System</b> </p>
      <p>To convert this energy into electricity, it is essential that a
        component be provided that can both collect and begin the
        conversion of the energy found near the surface of the planet.
        This part must be able to receive, store, and conduct the energy
        to the unit that actually rectifies this energy into dc
        electricity. Due to its corkscrew motion, high frequency and
        other near electrical properties, it has been found that this
        energy can best be collected by a hollow ball whose outside
        diameter is one sixth of the height of the rectifying unit.
        Furthermore, this ball should be constructed of a fairly thin
        conductive metal (#11 gauge sheet metal or less) In our case we
        chose a ball made of copper (Figure 2) In operation, the energy
        will first collect around the outside of the ball. This energy
        will then enter the inside of the ball and collect on the inner
        surface in a fashion similar to an electrostatic charge. Hence,
        the ball has received the energy and due to its conductivity and
        shape stored the energy as a "charge" on its inner plate. To get
        this energy to the rectifier, it is essential to devise a means
        to send the collected swirl of energy to the induction rod. This
        act is accomplished by employing an electrical property of
        "space energy." The top 5% of the copper rod is formed into a
        needle shaped tip that permits the energy's "charge" to flow
        down it like a standard electrostatic charge would by "jumping
        the gap" to an electrode (tip) in order to complete the fastest
        possible return to ground. Wound around the "induction rod" is
        #26 AWG seven stranded hook up wire, the wire is loosely wound
        over the first six inches of the rod and then tightly wound
        around the rest of the rod. Finally, the use of #14 AWG
        household wire is employed in a coil wound in the direction
        opposite of the coil on the "induction" rod. This coil is
        affixed on the top to the ball and on the bottom to the working
        electrical circuit. This entire unit is encase in 1¼ -inch
        copper tubing. </p>
      <p>Conversion of "space energy" resembles in many ways the
        electromagnetic induction principle first discovered by Henry
        and Faraday in the last century. As noted previously, this
        energy has near electromagnetic properties. These properties
        include the presence of two quasi-vectors, a quasi-electrical
        (L) field and a quasi-magnetic (H) field. This second or
        quasi-magnetic field differs from the traditional concept of
        magnetism by having its flux (lines of force) bend inward
        instead of magnetism's outward direction. To induce electricity,
        it is necessary that two dissimilar energy flows be set up. The
        first is through the copper rod and the second through the coil
        wound around the rod. Apparently, this difference in distance
        and speed (wire resistance) off flow creates the conditions
        similar to the moving of an iron core through a magnetic field,
        that is, an electrical current is induced. This phenomenon is
        due to the quasi-magnetism present in both the copper rod and
        coil (Iron nails will stick to the outer copper tube). Thus, a
        corollary of the Faraday Law of Electromagnetic induction is
        clearly found in the induction unit. Further proof of this
        inductive effect comes from the fact that the counter-coil seems
        to act much in the manner of the secondary coil of a transformer
        (amplifies voltage). </p>
      <p>Once the energy leaves the induction unit, it enters the
        "control unit." This unit is composed of a central piezoelectric
        quartz crystal that is mounted on a tuning (moveable) base
        attached to the bottom of a hexagonal hardwood resonating
        chamber. This instrument acts as the split or frequency tuning
        capacitor. That is, the "control unit" accomplishes the final
        tuning of the energy so that the maximum amount of energy can be
        converted into electricity. This circuit begins at the top of
        the box and passes to a flat spiral coil placed beneath the top
        of the box. This coil is glued to the copper sheathing that
        comprises the actual resonating chamber. This "roof coil" starts
        the process by directing the energy to the crystals upper facets
        into the working circuit. Next, the energy travels to the inner
        counter-wound vertical coil called "the crystal coils" through
        the use of a "slip ring." Here, it is exposed to the energy of
        the sides or long facets of the crystal. Finally, the energy
        travels through the main coils, a counter-wound vertical coil
        glued to the bottom sheathed resonance chamber. By this time,
        the resonance induced by tuning (turning) the crystal has
        increased the efficiency of the conversion process. This
        phenomenon is due to two factors. First, the crystal has the
        ability to control the amount of voltage in the circuit. This
        effect is found in standard electrical theory in the use of
        split capacitors to tune circuits and in this way increase the
        "Q" efficiency of an induction coil (commonly employed in
        microwave and radio circuits). Secondly, the unit has the
        property to increase or decrease the amount of resistance in a
        given circuit. This was demonstrated by the boxes ability to
        burn out a 70Vdc, 2 amp step-down transformer. By the use of
        these properties the control unit is able to transform the
        energy from the conduction unit into a more stable electrical
        form. </p>
      <p>To sum up let us quickly review the entire conversion process.
        First, the energy jumps to the tip of the inductor rod and is
        conducted to the opposite end of the rod. Simultaneously, this
        energy flows through the tightly wound induction coil. The
        difference in rate and distance allows the rod and coil to
        induce an electrical current. Finally, the energy is sent to the
        control unit to stabilize the converted energy. The main working
        circuit for the system consists of a primary tube (core and coil
        assembly labeled C and D in diagram 2) and the secondary spiral
        tube (core and coil assembly labeled E in diagram 2) In this
        fashion the device is able to covert "space energy" into a
        useable form of DC electricity. </p>

      <p>That is interesting, i will have to experiment with the
        location of the sphere connector. </p>
      <p>I have some interesting results, can anyone confirm these 2
        things for me?? </p>
      <p>1) the current appears fo be proportional to the size of the
        sphere </p>
      <p>2) voltage appears to be proportional to the number of turns in
        the primary divided by the number of turns on the secondary
        windings. - i.e. - increase the total number of turns on both
        coils and thus should increase the voltage. </p>
      <p>im running out of ferrite rods, my longest one thus far is 14
        inches. If anyone could play with a larger set-up that would be
        helpful. </p>
      <p>hyp .::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if my calculations hold true, a 1kw
        unit should be approx 2-ft diameter hollow sphere (copper or
        aluminum) <br>
        and approx 300 turns on the primary / 150 on the secondary. </p>
      <p>currently my biggest problem is an inconsstency in the curent
        when a load is attached,&nbsp; the current drops exponentially
        from 130ma down to 0 after a 10-15 seconds (with a 14-inch rod
        [60/30 turns] + 9-inch sphere) </p>
      <p>This leads me to believe the sphere is acting as a sort of
        "capacitor", charging over time from the induced voltage
        diference. I need to experiment with completely discharging the
        sphere, then measure the "charge time" along a
        current-based-scale. <br>
        Im guessing there is relationship to the charging-time of the
        sphere, to its discharge <br>
        time&nbsp; (i.e. -current out) . </p>
      <p>Solution :::--&nbsp; Construct two devices, discharge one
        intentionally, at the halfway mark of the discharge time, to
        offset them, then collect them as a low-voltage A/C signal,
        through a square-wave rectifier to produce a (steady) DC output.
      </p>
      <p>any thoughts? or anyone that can test these things and
        confirm/deny what im seeing here? thanks. </p>

      <p>my 2 largest voltages thus far have come from the 9-inch
        spheres (these are the argest i have) </p>
      <p>copper sphere (9in) yields a consistent 0.13v DC potential
        between the lead from the secondary lead ot the bottom of the
        rod.&nbsp; (-0.13v if measured in the other direction) </p>
      <p>the aluminum sphere (9in) yields a varying voltage potential
        between 0.04 - 0.9v DC, im not sure what causes the variance -
        my two best guesses are temperature and/or the mixture of
        different metals in the aluminum alloy. <br>
        [i could not obtain a hollow sphere made of pure aluminum - they
        are hard to come by, and i was also told that it would quickly
        form an oxide layer on the outer (and inner) surface, which
        would act like an insulator, destroying the effect we are trying
        to achieve.] </p>
      <p>My next attempt is going to be constructed with a hollow Brass
        sphere, im shooting for 12-14 inch if i can find one. if it has
        to be custom made, i'll get the biggest one my pockest can
        afford. </p>
      <p>at best, what i have is approx 2/100th's of a Watt, which
        decreases over the discharge time of the sphere (capacitor). </p>
      <p>i have not yet been able to achieve a non-stop DC output of any
        measurable current, the current is only present when i let it
        "charge" for a few seconds. </p>
      <p>also i have found an increase in ferformance when you
        completely seal(air tight) the hole in the bottom of the sphere,
        around the rod shaft. - this seal also doubles as an insulator
        for the inner coil lead, between it and the sphere, allowing a
        much closer solder point at the top of the rod. - although my
        next one will be attached actually up INSIDE the sphere just
        under the "point", my mind keeps telling me to do this for some
        reason, so im gonna go with it.. </p>
      <p>Brass should perform slightly better than the copper, it lies
        between copper and silver on the list of metals <br>
        silver, gold, or even platinum/titanium are probably the best
        metals to build this device out of, but i am not rich enough to
        build a golden toy Smiley </p>
      <p>honestly i think the "ground-battery" gives a much better power
        output for the cost of parts, but this does have the advantage
        of mobility, so im going to toy with it for a little while
        longer. - if anyone has suggestions to try, or results of their
        own i would appreciate as much input as i can get at this point.
      </p>
      <p>p.s. i mentioned in an earlier post about using a ferrite rod -
        disregard this - continue using non-ferromagnetic rods, it does
        not have the advantage that i thought it would have, and may in
        fact decrease performance, or at least make it inconsistent. </p>
      <p>--- </p>
      <p>the more i toy with this, the more i tihnk "comming from the
        aether" is not what is happening here at all. </p>
      <p>If i had to describe this effect, it would be along the lines
        of a peltier effect, along a temperature constant. There is a
        voltage potential, but (almost) no current flow. <br>
        if the circuit is isolated (open) the cummulative charge density
        can build up. </p>
      <p>which "auto"-charges some types of capacitors over time. </p>
      <p>This capacitor, just happens to be a sphere. </p>
      <p>i have not been able to detect any ionic disturbances with my
        static-detectors, and they are extremely sensitive at a close
        range, so i am confident there are no ion accumulations
        involved. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>If you want to see this effect in greater quantities, get a
        pelter thermoelectric "CPU cooler", and attach it to a capacitor
        at ambient temperaure on both terminals. <br>
        (you can increase the voltage obtained by placing it in a
        magnetic field.) </p>
      <p>i think the coils could essentially be replaced with a strip of
        dissimilar metal attached from the sphere to the bottom of the
        rod. <br>
        voltage would be obtained between the sphere and the top of the
        rod. this effect is achieved by the coils, not by induction, but
        by increasing the conductive path on one side of the circuit,
        which is (synthetically) the same as using a different metal. <br>
        many designs, in fact used different metal coils </p>
      <p>when there is a thermal difference between the two ends, the
        situation is extremely compounded with differing energy levels,
        but at a thermal equilibrium, there is simply a voltage
        potential, with current so low your meter probably will read
        0.000, but will charge a cap over time. </p>
      <p>--- </p>
      <p>hi saintsnick, </p>
      <p>it says 5% of the rod inside the sphere, not 1/5, it's a big
        difference. </p>
      <p>spiral, out. </p>
      <p>--- </p>
      <p>The rod and sphere must be electrically isolated from one
        another. </p>
      <p>we are talking about a hollow sphere here, not a ball with a
        hole drilled in it. It must be very thin and smooth inside and
        out. </p>
      <p>The type of metal may vary, but they fall within the class of
        non-magnetic metals (copper,silver,gold,platinum) </p>
      <p>iron or steel will not work, because it induces an opposing
        magnetic field within the material that cancels out the electric
        potential. </p>
      <p>Be SURE that your wiring is NOT paramagnetic. you can test this
        by placing a magnet to the wire. If it is attracted, find a
        different wire. (if you're using copper wiring you dont have to
        worry about this) <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>The wires used in the 2 coils should be proportionally sized
        (meaning that the larger wire is divisible by the diameter of
        the smaller , or by a common denominator of the two) </p>
      <p>Also the number of turns should be proportional to the opposite
        degree&nbsp; (2x size = 1/2x the # of turns) </p>
      <p>the (inner) coil should be bare copper wire. an insulated
        copper wire actually has an inductance, which will prevent ANY
        current from flowing through it. rather we provide a circular
        (shorted) path for some of the energy to flow through (on the
        surface of....).&nbsp; The secondary coil is insulated to
        created the induction effect to drive the load. </p>
      <p>Hope this helps. </p>
      <p>[as for the mile long Tesla thing, it's size has no bearing on
        the effect&nbsp; Its massive size was designed for one reason
        and one reason only, </p>
      <p>--To Achieve Incredible Ammounts of Energy from One Device - so
        he could play with it consistently without interupting the
        commercial power-grid his machines were hooked to. I dont
        believe he ever got a chance to actually make this large version
        of the device before his laboratory was confiscated.] </p>
      <p>--- </p>
      <p>Hi All; </p>
      <p>I was playing around with the <br>
        ATREE I had built earlier in this post and to my surprise there
        might be something to this design after all.&nbsp; Earlier I had
        tried many different things to try and get voltage from the
        device but my meter showed nothing.. Well It turns out my meter
        was faulty!&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tried checking the voltage with a
        new more sensitive meter I was getting a small but constant
        voltage of 80 to 100 m volts.&nbsp; I tried putting different
        capacitors across the two output leads and was able to vary the
        voltage substantially.&nbsp; With two 50 volt 22000 uF dc
        capacitors in parallel I am able to maintain .15 volts .&nbsp; I
        has gotten as high as .7volts.&nbsp; When I attached a 2500 volt
        ac microwave capacitor to the ATREE I was able to actually get a
        spark after about 10 minutes of charging.&nbsp; The output is
        definitely DC..I tried putting a resistor across th leads after
        the capacitor and it drained the voltage to 0.&nbsp; It will
        slowly build the charge after a while and return to a steady
        state.&nbsp; I don't have a low voltage LED to try on it but
        when I get one I will try it. </p>
      <p>I'm not sure how to harvest this voltage but it is definitely
        acting like a collector.&nbsp; I know my device is crude but
        maybe a properly built one will get better results. </p>
      <p>I am currently building a RENE- RATER and will post some
        pictures soon for anyone that is interested. </p>
      <p>--- </p>
      <p>NO, I did not change a thing.&nbsp; The primary is wound with
        #26 magnet wire just like the original diagram in this posting
        shows.&nbsp; The only things that I changed was my meter and the
        way I attached capacitors to it. </p>
