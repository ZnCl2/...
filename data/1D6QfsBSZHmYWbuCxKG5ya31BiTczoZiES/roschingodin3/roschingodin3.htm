OF



            THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0003] This invention relates generally to the field of direct
          current electrical motors and generators that operate without
          the need for commutation and/or rectification, and more
          particularly to multi-rotor homopolar machines which derive
          their emf (electromotive force) from co-rotational magnets and
          metallic disk embodiment.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0004] Back in 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that a
          cylindrical magnet suspended by a string and touching a
          mercury bath at the bottom could generate electricity while
          spinning along its axis if a second electrical contact was
          made at the periphery of the midpoint of the magnet. His
          experiment was a one-piece homopolar machine since the magnet
          and conductor were joined together. Such Faraday generators
          have also been called acyclic, unipolar or homopolar
          generators because no commutation or alternating of the
          magnetic poles is necessary for this machine in order to
          generate electricity.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The type of electrical output is most often direct
          current (DC) unless specific means are designed to provide an
          interruption of radial conduction and thus simulate
          alternating current (AC). Historically, DC was championed by
          Thomas Edison during the early part of the 20th century while
          at the same time AC was championed by Nikola Tesla and George
          Westinghouse. In the future, DC will be coming back into style
          with the emergence of ambient temperature superconductive
          cables. Therefore, highly efficient homopolar generators will
          be in demand to meet the future market demand for DC
          electricity.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Homopolar generators usually have a single disk or drum
          rotating in a stationary magnetic field with sliding contacts.
          The sliding contacts often present high resistance however.
          The construction and operation of homopolar machines for
          electric propulsion of marine vessels or railguns for example
          is already well known. Such machines include motors and
          generators wherein electrical current flows through a
          conductor situated in a magnetic field during rotation of the
          machine rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] In the case of a homopolar motor, the current will
          develop a J*B force perpendicular to the direction of its flow
          through the conductor and that of the magnetic field. In the
          case of a homopolar generator, a voltage dependent on the
          rotational speed, magnetic field, and radius, is induced in a
          conductor moving within the magnetic field. When current is
          drawn from the homopolar generator, it also develops a J*B
          force for the same reason as with the motor but is referred to
          as back torque or armature reaction. General reference
          information including basic principles used to reduce back
          torque can be found in The Homopolar Handbook by Thomas Valone
          (ISBN 0-9641070-1-5).<br>
          <br>
          [0008] The prior art rarely includes a one-piece homopolar
          machines that rotate the magnet with the disk. Even more
          unknown is the concept of rolling contacts. Eliminating
          sliding contacts is shown in the "Planetary Homopolar
          Generator," IBM Technical Disklosure Bulletin, Vol. 17, No. 6,
          p. 1786-87, November, 1974, H. D. Varadarajan.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Using a conducting belt or rolling contacts to gather
          current from a magnetic field flux cutting rotor, there is an
          annular magnetic field through which the rotor executes a
          planetary motion.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The large stresses resulting from the centrifugal force
          of the massive, unbalanced planetary rotor is a distinct
          disadvantage, prohibiting high speed operation. Thus, only a
          low rate of rotation is possible with the IBM design.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The "Direct Current Homopolar Machine" U.S. Pat. No.
          5,587,618 to Hathaway demonstrates an analogous concept of
          relative motion between conductive orbiting shaft and a
          stationary disk-shaped magnetized armature.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] However, the design is a bit cumbersome to be
          practical. Science Applications International Corporation
          claims a conductive belt, dual disk "Homopolar
          Motor-Generator" in U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,232 to Reed that
          apparently reinvents the "Dynamo Electric Machine" of U.S.
          Pat. No. 406,968 patented by none other than Nikola Tesla in
          1889 that also has two unipolar magnetized rotors connected by
          a conductive belt. The belted dual unipolar machines solve one
          of the problems that plague the field by offering two sliding
          contacts at the low speed surface on the axle. However, the
          present invention requires only one sliding contact on the
          axle. These conductive belt machines also demonstrate, in
          principle, the concept of a multi-rotor, planetary design, by
          the process of coordinate transformation, since relative
          motion is the key to the operation of a homopolar generator.
          The concept of rolling contact is demonstrated with the Dalen
          "Dynamo Electric Machine" U.S. Pat. No. 645,943, where two
          disks are turning in opposite directions while in contact with
          each other at their periphery. However, the axle of each disk
          must remain fixed in place whereas each axle is in orbiting
          motion in the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Homopolar machines can reversibly function as motors as
          well, such as flywheels, and used as energy storage devices.
          First used in transportation applications in the 1950's,
          flywheel powered buses were designed to have the flywheel
          accelerated at every stop. Composite rotors currently have
          been developed which can spin at very high revolutions
          (100,000 revolutions per second); and the speed is limited by
          the tensile strength of the rim of the rotor. By using a
          multi-rotor design, the centrifugal forces of a large disk can
          be greatly reduced and still maintain high-energy storage or
          production. By using magnetic bearings, the friction on the
          axis of the rotor can be reduced sufficiently so that such
          rotors can maintain most of the energy for several days.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The IBM Varadarajan planetary rotor is unbalanced and
          has a low rate of magnetic flux cutting due to its annular
          magnetic field design. The Hathaway direct current machine has
          a lot of unbalanced conductive material orbiting the central
          magnetized disk which limits the rotational speed.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The conductive belt designs can be subject to oxidation
          and slippage, even requiring a toothed timing belt on each
          axle as well. With most disk models of homopolar generators,
          as opposed to drum designs, sliding contacts are the single
          most important contribution of resistance inhibiting the power
          output of the machine. Internal resistance is the only limit
          to the output capability of a homopolar generator and it is
          important to reduce all sources of internal resistance to
          obtain maximum power output for a given input torque. Rather
          than use high resistance carbon brushes, medium resistance
          silver-graphite brushes or dangerous conductive liquids such
          as mercury, low temperature solder, or sodium-potassium, there
          is a need to eliminate frictional sliding contact at the high
          speed periphery of the magnetized rotor completely.
          Furthermore, rather than maintaining two sliding contacts
          which contribute friction and resistance, even in the rolling
          and belted designs, there is a need to cut the number in half
          to only one high current sliding contact. The present
          invention satisfies both of these needs.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0016] The present invention derives direct current
          electricity by co-rotating a plurality of magnets and a
          metallic disk. It comprises an improved homopolar machine with
          dynamically balancing, axially parallel, cylindrical,
          electrically conductive magnets arranged circumferentially
          around the vertical axis of central stator ring. Such a design
          can be referred to as distributed generation since each magnet
          rotor generates only a fraction of the current that is
          transmitted through the machine. Thus, the conductive bearings
          contacting the center of each end of the magnet rotors may
          carry only one tenth or less of the total current.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] The multi-rotor orbiting homopolar also does not
          include sliding contacts at each magnetized rotor rim but
          instead utilizes a suitable rolling means attached separately
          to magnets and also to the stator ring for intimately
          contacting and engaging non-slip rolling between magnets and
          stator as they orbit around the stator. The magnetized rotors
          maintain rotational synchronism and equal relative position to
          each other with a bearing means rotatably securing the top and
          bottom end of each magnet to a corresponding electrically
          conductive circular endplate.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] The electrical energy is extracted, or input if used as
          a motor, through contacts on the conductive stator and at the
          machine's electrically conductive axle located in the center
          of the machine while rigidly attached to the top circular
          endplate that rotates with all of the individually magnetized
          rotors. The only single, high current, moving contact that is
          required is an electrically conductive thrust bearing that
          supports the central axle. An insulating thrust bearing
          meanwhile separates the axle from the center of bottom
          circular endplate. The stator, which is of course stationary,
          accomplishes the second contact means through a standard
          electrical connection with no need for any relative motion
          sliding contact. The stator may be optionally magnetized in
          the opposite direction to the magnetized rotors in order to
          increase the coercive force or magnetic flux density.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] The drawings constitute a part of this specification
          and include exemplary embodiments to the invention, which may
          be embodied in various forms. It is to be understood that in
          some instances various aspects of the invention may be shown
          exaggerated or enlarged to facilitate an understanding of the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Problem</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0020] The problem this invention solves is that it generates
          high power direct current electricity without the need for
          commutation and rectification, otherwise the internal
          resistance losses are high.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] The problems with prior art devices, processes and
          systems can be categorized as follows.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] 1. Require commutation or rectification to generate
          direct current electricity.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] 2. Rely on more than one current brush which often have
          high speed contact.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] 3. Do not distribute magnetic field power generation by
          multi-rotor orbiting magnets in homopolar machines or systems.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] 4. Internal resistance losses are usually high.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] 5. Neither efficient nor cost effective.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] 6. Neither simple nor practical for most applications.<br>

          [0028] A preliminary limited prior art search was not
          commissioned but the inventor is intimately familiar with the
          prior art. Following are typical examples of the prior art

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0041] Unfortunately none of the prior art devices singly or
          even in combination provide for all of the objectives as
          established by the inventor for this system as enumerated

          12. Another objective of this invention is that it can be made
          from modular standard materials and components that are also
          easily maintainable.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] Other objectives advantages and features of this
          invention reside in its simplicity, elegance of design, ease
          of manufacture, service and use and even aesthetics as will
          become apparent from the following brief <br>

            bold;">
          <br>
          [0060] As shown in the drawings wherein like numerals
          represent like parts throughout the several views, there is
          generally disclosed in FIG. 1 is a state of the prior art.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are
          provided herein. It is to be understood, however, that the
          present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore,
          specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as
          limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a
          representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to
          employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately
          detailed system, structure or manner.<br>
          <br>
          [0062] Turning first to FIG. 2 there is shown a perspective
          cutaway view of a portion of one embodiment of the present
          invention showing one of a multitude of rotors that are
          axially magnetized (B). This multitude mounted in parallel
          comprise the multi-rotor homopolar machine in close contact
          with a ring shaped stator that may be optionally magnetized in
          the direction opposite to the magnetic fields of the rotors.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] Each rotor 20 has its own axle 21 which is
          circumferentially mounted vertically, arranged and dynamically
          balanced around a central vertical axis, on an electrically
          conductive but low permeability axle rod 21 made of copper,
          brass or bronze, that may penetrate the center of the entire
          magnetized rotor and rotatably attach to top and bottom
          bearing 33 on circular endplates 31, 32 shown in FIG. 3. In
          operation, the rotors orbit around the circular stator ring,
          which may or may not also be magnetized.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] The invention is more completely shown in the
          elevational view of FIG. 3 with several rotors 20 rotatably
          attached to the top circular endplate 31 and bottom circular
          endplate 32 by electrically conductive bearings 33. The top
          endplate 31 is rigidly attached to the central axle 34
          supporting the orbiting multi-rotor homopolar generator
          assembly. The hollow circular design of the stationary ring
          stator 23 is also visible in FIG. 3, which can be optionally
          magnetized to increase performance output.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The bottom circular endplate 32 has a large hole in the
          center, more completely seen in FIG. 4, that allows inner
          attachment to insulating bearing 44 which optimally can be a
          non-contacting, low friction magnetic bearing since the weight
          of the rotor assembly is carried by the electrically
          conductive thrust bearing 41. The bottom endplate 32 is thus
          isolated electrically from the stationary Inner cylinder 43
          that is the inner core of the stator. Inner circular assembly
          plates 49 of equal size and shape, that preferably are
          electrically conductive, rigidly attach the inner cylinder 43
          to the stator ring 23. In accordance with the present
          invention, FIG. 4 shows the side cross sectional view edge on
          with a cutaway so that the central axle 34 and hollow inner
          cylinder design 43 is visible.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] The insulating bearings 42 separate the central axle 34
          from the inner cylinder 43. Both bearings 42 and 44
          electrically maintain the separation of polarity of the
          electromotive force (emf) voltage of each rotor. The positive
          or negative polarity of the conductors depends of course on
          the rotation direction of the rotor magnets. One conductor 45
          is electrically emerging from the stator assembly and
          ultimately emanates from the outer edge of each rotor 20 with
          the homopolar effect conducting the generated electricity
          through the rolling means 47 and 48. The opposite polarity
          conductor 46 is electrically emanating from the center axle 21
          of each rotor 20 is connected to the electrically conductive
          thrust bearing 41.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] In accordance with an important function of the present
          invention, there is shown in FIG. 4 one embodiment of an
          intimately contacting and engaging nonslip rolling means 47
          and 48. As is well-known in the industry where good traction
          with a high coefficient of friction (1.6 or better) but
          sufficiently low electrical resistance is desired between two
          surfaces, an adherent coating of copper can be used on both
          facing surfaces of the stator 23 and rotor 20. For the copper
          coating, electro-deposition can be used or flame spraying of
          copper on the rotor and stator outer surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] Another embodiment of rolling means 47 and 48 utilizes
          a geared electromechanical rotary joint developed by NASA
          Goddard Space Center (NASA Tech Briefs, December, 1994) which
          offers the advantage of a springy, low noise planetary gear
          contacting a stator ring gear. It was designed by NASA to
          overcome the disadvantages of sliding contacts and to ensure
          high traction desired for rolling electrical contacts.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] The springy gears are made from beryllium copper which
          is a self-cleaning material with, in one embodiment, an
          average diameter of 6.35 mm with any reasonable number of
          teeth. Another concept to creating a rolling contact utilizes
          a magnetic sprocket design with small rare earth (samarium
          cobalt for example) magnets embedded perpendicularly in the
          surfaces of the stator ring and rotor magnets. The magnetic
          sprocket thus utilizes equally spaced magnets mounted normal
          to the axes of the stator and rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] To demonstrate an important feature of the invention,
          there is shown in FIG. 5 a plan view from the top of the
          balanced distribution of the rotors 20 around the stator
          assembly 43 with the outer stator ring 23 that are equally
          spaced and preferably dynamically balanced so the centrifugal
          forces are equal and opposite.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Theory of Operation</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0072] The main principle of operation is based on the fact
          that rotating cylindrical magnets creates a homopolar emf
          generation from Faraday's Law and the Lorentz Force.
          Physically, a rotating, non-inertial reference frame
          configuration can only be analyzed correctly with Einstein's
          general theory of relativity, utilizing a Thirring metric.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] Particularly, where rotating cylindrical magnets and
          disk are synchronized and made co-rotational, such a
          co-rotational configuration makes the generator one piece like
          the earth's magnetic field itself. As the inventors explored
          this correspondence more closely, it was learned that the
          earth's molten, electrically conductive iron core also
          includes not one but several vortices in a coaxial circular
          arrangement. The inventors stumbled upon this concept while
          investigating the field rotation paradox and found that an
          orbiting, multi-rotor homopolar generator assembly would be
          analogous to the earth's electrically conductive,
          multi-vortex, magnetic, molten iron core.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] The field rotation paradox can be easily resolved by an
          amateur DIY (Do It Yourself ) scientist by comparing the
          interception of a linear magnetic field vs. a rotating
          magnetic field. In the former configuration the meter gives
          the same reading whether the magnet is moved with respect to a
          pickup coil of wire or vice versa but in the latter
          configuration the meter reading is seen only when the disk is
          moved with respect to rotary magnetic field of cylindrical
          magnet but not when the magnet is moved with respect to the
          disk. The former is consistent with special relativity while
          the latter is relying on general relativity. Both are loosely
          termed "relativistic."<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assembly and Use</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0076] The manufacturing, assembly and use of this invention
          is very simple even intuitive. The system of this invention
          can be readily assembled from the teaching provided in this
          disclosure by state of the art techniques and materials by a
          person of average skill in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] The applicant has described the essence of this
          invention. While this invention has been described with
          reference to an illustrative embodiment, this description is
          not intended to be construed in a limiting sense. Various
          modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments
          as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent
          to a person of average skill in the art upon reference to this
          description.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variations</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0079] Due to the simplicity and elegance of the design of
          this invention designing around it is very difficult if not
          impossible. Nonetheless many changes may be made to this
          design without deviating from the spirit of this invention.
          Examples of such contemplated variations include the
          following:<br>
          <br>
          1. The shape and size, colors etc of the device or the
          packaging thereof may be modified.<br>
          <br>
          2. Additional complimentary and complementary functions and
          features may be added.<br>
          <br>
          3. The system of this invention may be adapted for other
          related uses.<br>
          <br>
          4. Instead of cylindrical magnets, other types of magnets and
          mode of mounting on the disk may be employed to create the
          orbiting, rotational magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          5. The invention may be scaled up and down by several orders
          of magnitude<br>
          <br>
          7. An experimental science toy version may be developed for
          education and entertainment of little young scientists of the
          future.<br>
          <br>
          8. Homopolar generator may be employed in reverse as a motor
          to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.<br>
          <br>
          9. A homopolar servo motor version may be crafted based on
          this co-rotational magnet and disk concept.<br>
          <br>
          10. Permanent cylindrical magnets may be replaced by
          equivalent configuration of electromagnets.<br>
          <br>
          11. A portion of the emf generated may be fed back to
          cylindrical electromagnets to explore the possibility of a
          self-excited generator without violating any laws of nature.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Other changes such as aesthetics and substitution of
          newer materials as they become available, which substantially
          perform the same function in substantially the same manner
          with substantially the same result without deviating from the
          spirit of the invention may be made.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>. The
        Morningstar Energy Box is a derivative of a Searl device
        modified in a similar fashion used by the Russian Scientists
        Godin and Roschin. These devices use laminated rollers and a
        main ring made of different materials used to enhance electrical
        and magnetic properties. Where the Searl device uses rollers to
        move around a main ring, the Russian device kinematically
        constrains these rollers within a mechanical cage. The
        operational theory for the Energy Box uses rotating
        electromagnetic fields to create gravitational effects and is
        different from those theories outlined by either Searl or the
        Russians. A prototype device is currently under test and
        unfortunately self-accelerated motion has yet to be obtained.
        The Russians have made several serious claims that their device
        produced self-acceleration to generate electricity, created a
        relatively large weight loss, generated discrete walls of
        magnetism far from the device and that a temperature drop exists
        when the device loses weight. To date, no one has validated
        these outrageous claims. However, we have found similar
        phenomenon regarding temperature loss and the discrete magnetic
        walls to occur during tests of the Energy Box and have
        correlated the temperature drop that the Godin &amp; Roschin
        device produces as being a consequence of the Unruh effect.
        Where they claimed to lose as much as 35% of the weight of a 375
        kg armature, the Energy Box only loses as much as 2% of its 490
        pounds at this stage of the test cycle. Additional tests and
        modifications are underway to hopefully increase the weight
        loss.<br>

        in the IRI website, describing their experiments.<br>
