      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      An aqueous extract of the blue-green filamentous algae Arthrospira
      platensis (previously called Spirulina platensis) inhibited HIV-1
      replication in human T-cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC), and Langerhans cells (LC). Extract concentrations
      ranging between 0.3 and 1.2 microg/ml reduced viral production by
      approximately 50% (50% effective concentration [EC50]) in PBMCs.
      The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of extract for PBMC growth
      ranged between 0.8 and 3.1 mg/ml. Depending on the cell type used,
      therapeutic indices ranged between 200 and 6000. The extract
      inactivated HIV-1 infectivity directly when preincubated with
      virus before addition to human T-cell lines. Fractionation of the
      extract revealed antiviral activity in the polysaccharide fraction
      and also in a fraction depleted of polysaccharides and tannins. We
      conclude that aqueous A platensis extracts contain antiretroviral
      activity that may be of potential clinical interest.<br>

      ...Another group of medical scientists has published new studies
      regarding a purified water extract unique to Spirulina named
      Calcium-Spirulan. It inhibits replication of HIV-1, herpes
      simples, human cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, mumps virus and
      measles virus in-vitro, yet is very safe for human cells. It
      protects human and monkey cells from viral infection in cell
      culture. According to peer reviewed scientific journal reports
      this extract, "...holds great promise for treatment of ...HIV-1,
      HSV-1, and HCM infections, which is particularly advantageous for
      AIDS patients who are prone to these life-threatening infections."<br>
      <br>
      Calcium-Spirulan is a polymerized sugar molecule unique to
      Spirulina, containing both sulfur and calcium. Hamsters treated
      with this water soluble extract had better recovery rates when
      infected with an otherwise lethal herpes virus. How does it work?
      When attacking a cell, a virus first attaches itself to the cell
      membrane. However, because of spirulina extract, the virus cannot
      penetrate the cell membrane to infect the cell. The virus is
      stuck, unable to replicate. It is eventually eliminated by the
      body's natural defenses. Spirulina extracts may become useful
      therapeutics that could help AIDS patients lead longer, more
      normal lives.<br>

      The Study of Spirulina<br>
      <br>
      Effects on the AIDS Virus, Cancer and the Immune System<br>
      <br>
      Spirulina is gaining more attention from medical scientists as a
      nutraceutical and source of potential pharmaceuticals. There are
      several new peer reviewed scientific studies about Spirulina's
      ability to inhibit viral replication, strengthen both the cellular
      and humoral arms of the immune system and cause regression and
      inhibition of cancers. While these studies are preliminary and
      more research is needed, the results so far are exciting.<br>
      <br>
      In April 1996, scientists from the Laboratory of Viral
      Pathogenesis, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical
      School and Earthrise Farms, Calipatria, California, announced
      on-going research, saying "Water extract of Spirulina platensis
      inhibits HIV-1 replication in human derived T-cell lines and in
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A concentration of 5-10
      mg/ml was found to reduce viral production." HIV-1 is the AIDS
      virus. Small amounts of Spirulina extract reduced viral
      replication while higher concentrations totally stopped its
      reproduction. Importantly, with the therapeutic index of 100,
      Spirulina extract was non-toxic to human cells at concentrations
      stopping viral replication.<br>

      The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a result of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection which subsequently leads to
      significant suppression of immune functions. AIDS is a significant
      threat to the health of mankind, and the search for effective
      therapies to treat AIDS is of paramount importance. Several
      chemical anti-HIV agents have been developed. However, besides the
      high cost, there are adverse effects and limitations associated
      with using chemotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection Thus,
      herbal medicines have frequently been used as an alternative
      medical therapy by HIV positive individuals and AIDS patients. The
      aim of this review is to summarize research findings for herbal
      medicines, which are endowed with the ability to inhibit HIV. In
      this article, we will emphasize a Chinese herbal medicine. <b>

      </b><br>
      The selective extraction of baicalin is important to its quality
      control especially when the matrices are complicated. In this
      work, a novel molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared for the
      selective extraction of baicalin in herbs. The molecularly
      imprinted polymer was synthesized by the copolymerization of
      4-vinyl pyridine and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate in the
      presence of baicalin by a precipitation polymerization method.
      After the optimization of parameters for molecularly imprinted
      polymer preparation, including the functional monomer, porogen,
      sampling solvent, and washing solvent, good selectivity was
      obtained, with an imprinting factor of about 4, which is much
      better than that achieved by the bulk-polymerization method. The
      performances of the prepared molecularly imprinted polymers were
      systematically investigated, including adsorption kinetics,
      isotherm experiment, and Scatchard analysis. On the basis of the
      good adsorptive capability of the prepared molecularly imprinted
      polymer, it was also applied for the pretreatment of baicalin in
      Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. The result showed that most of the
      matrices were removed and baicalin was selectively enriched.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Context: Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Labiatae) is one of the
      most commonly used medicinal herbs, especially in traditional
      Chinese medicine. However, compared to many pharmacological
      studies of this botanical, much less attention has been paid to
      the quality control of the herb’s pretreatment prior to extract
      preparation, an issue that may affect therapeutic outcomes.<br>
      <br>
      Objective: The current study was designed to evaluate whether
      different pretreatment conditions change the contents of the four
      major flavonoids in the herb, i.e., two glycosides (baicalin and
      wogonoside) and two aglycones (baicalein and wogonin).<br>
      <br>
      Materials and methods: A high-performance liquid chromatography
      assay was used to quantify the contents of these four flavonoids.
      The composition changes of four flavonoids by different
      pretreatment conditions, including solvent, treatment time,
      temperature, pH value and herb/solvent ratio were evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      Results: After selection of the first order time-curve kinetics,
      our data showed that at 50 °C, 1:5 herb/water (in w/v) ratio and
      pH 6.67 yielded an optimal conversion rate from flavonoid
      glycosides to their aglycones. In this optimized condition, the
      contents of baicalin and wogonoside were decreased to 1/70 and
      1/13, while baicalein and wogonin were increased 3.5- and
      3.1-fold, respectively, compared to untreated herb.<br>
      <br>
      Discussion and conclusion: The markedly variable conversion rates
      by different pretreatment conditions complicated the quality
      control of this herb, mainly due to the high amount of endogenous
      enzymes of S. baicalensis. Optimal pretreatment conditions
      observed in this study could be used obtain the highest level of
      desired constituents to achieve better pharmacological effects.<br>

      There are words you don't use in medicine today, such as "cure."
      But a remarkable case study in an HIV positive patient treated
      with black seed extract resulted in a sustained remission,
      indicating a safe, accessible and affordable alternative to highly
      toxic antiretroviral HIV drugs may already exist.<br>
      <br>
      Nigella Sativa, also known as 'black seed,' has been studied for a
      wide rage of health benefits, but not until recently was it
      discovered to hold promise as a curative agent against potentially
      lethal viral infections, including Hepatitis C[i] and now HIV.<br>
      <br>
      A remarkable case study published in August of this year in the
      African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative
      Medicine described an HIV patient who after undergoing treatment
      with a black seed extract experienced a complete recovery, with no
      detectable HIV virus or antibodies against HIV in their blood
      serum, both during and long after the therapy ended.[ii]<br>
      <br>
      This was a remarkable and unexpected observation, described by the
      researchers as follows:<br>
      <br>
      "Nigella sativa had been documented to possess many therapeutic
      functions in medicine but the least expected is sero-reversion in
      HIV infection which is very rare despite extensive therapy with
      highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). "…<br>
      <br>
      At the outset of the study, the patient presented with classical
      symptoms of symptomatic HIV infection, "with [a] history of
      chronic fever, diarrhoea, weight loss and multiple papular
      pruritic lesions of 3 months duration." Examination identified
      moderate weight loss, with laboratory confirmed tests showing
      'sero-positivity' to HIV infection with a "pre-treatment viral
      (HIV-RNA) load and CD4 count of 27,000 copies/ml and CD4 count of
      250 cells/ mm(3) respectively."...<br>
      <br>
      The patient was administered a black seed concoction of 10 mls
      twice daily for 6 months, resulting in a rapid improvement in
      symptoms, and significant reductions in viral load:<br>
      <br>
      "Fever, diarrhoea and multiple pruritic lesions disappeared on
      5th, 7th and 20th day respectively on Nigella sativa therapy. The
      CD4 count decreased to 160 cells/ mm3 despite significant
      reduction in viral load (≤1000 copies/ml) on 30th day on N.
      sativa."<br>
      <br>
      By the 187th day on black seed therapy, testing indicating the
      blood was entirely cleared of signs of infection, a so-called
      'sero-negative status'. The post-therapy CD4 counts increased from
      baseline to a normalized 650cells/ mm(3) with an undetectable
      viral (HIV-RNA) load.<br>
      <br>
      "This case report reflects the fact that there are possible
      therapeutic agents in Nigella sativa that may effectively control
      HIV infection."...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract:</b><br>
      <br>
      Nigella sativa had been documented to possess many therapeutic
      functions in medicine but the least expected is sero-reversion in
      HIV infection which is very rare despite extensive therapy with
      highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This case
      presentation is to highlight the complete recovery and
      sero-reversion of adult HIV patient after treatment with Nigella
      sativa concoction for the period of six months. The patient
      presented to the herbal therapist with history of chronic fever,
      diarrhoea, weight loss and multiple papular pruritic lesions of 3
      months duration. Examination revealed moderate weight loss, and
      the laboratory tests of ELISA (Genscreen) and western blot (new
      blot 1&amp;2) confirmed sero-positivity to HIV infection with
      pre-treatment viral (HIV-RNA) load and CD4 count of 27,000
      copies/ml and CD4 count of 250 cells/ mm(3) respectively. The
      patient was commenced on Nigella sativa concoction 10mls twice
      daily for 6 months.. He was contacted daily to monitor
      side-effects and drug efficacy. Fever, diarrhoea and multiple
      pruritic lesions disappeared on 5th, 7th and 20th day respectively
      on Nigella sativa therapy. The CD4 count decreased to 160 cells/
      mm3 despite significant reduction in viral load (≤1000 copies/ml)
      on 30th day on N. sativa. Repeated EIA and Western blot tests on
      187th day on Nigella sativa therapy was sero-negative. The post
      therapy CD4 count was 650cells/ mm(3) with undetectable viral
      (HIV-RNA) load. Several repeats of the HIV tests remained
      sero-negative, aviraemia and normal CD4 count since 24 months
      without herbal therapy. This case report reflects the fact that
      there are possible therapeutic agents in Nigella sativa that may
      effectively control HIV infection.<br>

      To assess the effects of TCHM on patients with HIV infection and
      AIDS, we reviewed eleven randomized placebo-controlled trials
      involving 998 patients. Due to the limited number of RCTs for
      included trials and the small sample size of each study, we are
      not able to draw firm conclusions concerning TCHM therapy in
      treating patients with HIV infection and AIDS. However, some
      high-quality clinical studies do exist. Studies of diarrhea and
      oral candidiasis, which are challenging symptoms of AIDS, were
      demonstrated to have positive effects. Study of peripheral
      leukocytes, which are a side effect of antiretroviral drugs,
      suggested that an integrated treatment approach may be of benefit.
      The overall methodological quality of the trials was adequate;
      however, randomization methods should be clearly described and
      fully reported in these trials according to the Consolidated
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)…<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.1. IGM-1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A randomized trial tested a Chinese herbal formulation (IGM-1)
      composed of 31 Chinese herbs (Table 1) in 30 HIV-infected adults
      with symptoms and decreased CD4+ cell count (200–499/mm3) for
      treatment of HIV-related symptoms for duration of 12 weeks [13].
      The study found a significant better effect in improvement of
      health-related QoL in terms of life satisfaction and symptoms than
      placebo. The number of symptoms was reduced in patients receiving
      herbs, but not in those receiving placebo. There were no
      statistically significant differences in overall health
      perception, symptom severity, CD4 counts, anxiety, or depression
      between groups. No adverse events were reported among
      participants. However, the above results need to be accounted for
      with care due to the small sample in the trial.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.2. “35-Herb”</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Interestingly, three years after the above trial was published,
      the same investigator who prescribed IGM-1 prescribed another
      Chinese herbal formulation that was tested in a trial in
      Switzerland [17]. The formulation was composed of 35 Chinese herbs
      containing most of the herbs listed in IGM-1 (Table 1). A trial
      tested the Chinese herbal formulation in 68 HIV-infected adults
      with decreased CD4+ cell count (less than 500/mm3) for a treatment
      period of six months [17]. The participants were randomized to
      receive “35-herb” ( ) or placebo ( ). Over 70% of the patients had
      received previous antiretroviral therapy, the two groups were
      comparable regarding sociodemographic characteristics, previous
      antiretroviral use, viral load, CD4+ cell counts, and other
      clinical laboratory tests at entry. A total of 53 (78%) patients
      completed treatment for 6 months, including 24 in the herb group
      and 29 in the placebo group. Analyses were based on complete data
      and on intention-to-treat principle in the trial report. After six
      months, there was no significant difference in CD4+ cell counts,
      viral load, new AIDS-defining events, number of reported symptoms,
      psychosocial measurements or QoL between two groups.<br>
      <br>
      The total number of reported adverse events was 46 in the herb
      group and 20 in the placebo group, and included diarrhea,
      increased number of daily bowel movements, abdominal pain,
      constipation, flatulence, and nausea. Hematological or serum
      chemistry laboratory values showed no evidence of toxicity from
      the study herbs. Two patients in the herb group died during the
      study period and causes of death were believed to be due to severe
      immunodeficiency and pre-enrolment history of severe opportunistic
      complications, but not related to the study drugs.<br>
      <b><br>
        3.3.3. Compound SH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Compound SH containing five herbs (Table 1) were combined with
      zidovudine and zalcitabine in the treatment of 60 HIV-infected
      Thai patients in a randomized trial [14]. The herbal formula was
      made from more than 1000 chinese herbs from 120 plant families by
      Kunming Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Science. The
      trial found that adding SH herbs to the two nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors has a greater antiviral activity than
      antiretrovirals only. However, the data analyses were based on
      participants, who had completed the trial, 22 subjects who lost
      followup or withdrawal due to adverse events were excluded, and
      the above benefits need to be accounted for with care.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.4. Qiankunning</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Qiankunning (Table 1) is a Chinese herb preparation extracted from
      14 herbs. A randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial was
      conducted in 2003 in China [15], 36 adults with HIV infection or
      AIDS were randomized to receive Qiankunning ( ) or placebo ( ).
      Patients were comparable regarding age, body weight, average
      duration of drug abuse, and pre trial HIV RNA levels. No intention
      to treat analyses were applied, the data analyses were based on
      participants who had completed the trial. Significant decrease in
      HIV RNA levels was found in herb group than placebo after the end
      of treatment for 7 months. In this trial, the use of herbs was
      related to stomach discomfort and diarrhea. No adverse effects
      were reported from the placebo group. There were no serious
      adverse events observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.5. Zhongyan-4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Chinese herbal medicine zhongyan-4 (ZY-4) (Table 1) is prepared by
      the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing, China.
      A randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial enrolled 72
      patients with HIV infection or AIDS (36 with herbs and 36 with
      placebo) [16]. CD4+ cell counts in the ZY-4 group were increased
      by cells/mm3, while in the placebo group the CD4+ cell counts were
      decreased by cells/mm3 after treatment for 6 months ( ). A total
      of 15 out of 30 patients (6 dropped out) in the ZY-4 group had
      their CD4 count increased compared with 8 out of 33 patients (3
      dropped out) in the placebo group ( ). The study concludes that
      ZY-4 is effective in enhancing immunity function based on CD4+
      cell counts. However, this study showed no significant difference
      in body weight or viral load after treatment between ZY-4 and
      placebo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.6. Aining Granule</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Chinese herbal medicine Aining Granule (AG) (Table 1) was
      tested in 100 patients compared with placebo in a double blind
      trial. Participants were randomized into two groups [18], AG group
      ( ) received AG+HAART (d4T+ddI+NVP) and Placebo group ( ) received
      placebo + HAART (d4T+ddI+NVP). CD4+ cell counts in the AG group
      were decreased by  cells/mm3, while in the placebo group the CD4+
      cell counts were decreased by  cells/mm3 after treatment for 11
      months ( ). Significant improvement of symptoms such as fatigue,
      anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, skin rash was found in AG group. The
      results showed that patients receiving Chinese herb AG had a lower
      risk for the decrease of CD4+ cell counts. However, this study
      showed no significant difference between two groups in viral load
      after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.7. Xiaomi Granule</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A randomized two arms positive-drug controlled open label trial
      was conducted in 2009 in china, in which 80 AIDS participants with
      oral candidiasis were included in the Xiaomi Granule (Table 1)
      plus Nystatin group ( ) and Nystatin group ( ) [19]. After
      treatment for 2 weeks, significant improvement of symptoms of oral
      candidiasis was found in herb group. No adverse event was found.
      Xiaomi Granule is a Chinese herb preparation developed from a
      prescription in classic Chinese medicine ancient book “jin kui yao
      lve”. There is no description of CD4+ cell counts and viral load
      in the paper available.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.8. Jingyuankang Capsule</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a double-blind, double-analogue trial, 116 participants with
      HIV infection and peripheral leucopenia were randomized to receive
      Jingyuankang Capsule (JC) (Table 1) plus AZT, ddI, NVP, and
      analogue Leucogen Tablets ( ) or Leucogen Tablets plus AZT, ddI,
      NVP and analogue JC ( ) for 6 months [20]. The application of JC
      showed significant increase of peripheral leukocytes in herb
      group. CD4+ cell count outcome was not reported. There were no
      significant differences between the groups regarding adverse
      effect in the trial report.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3.9. Xielikang Capsule</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A randomized, double-blind, double dummy and controlled clinical
      trial was conducted between 2009 and 2011 in china, in which 158
      AIDS-related chronic diarrhea patients were randomized into
      Xielikang Capsule (XC) (Table 1) plus loperamide analogue group (
      ) and loperamide capsule plus XC analogue group ( ) [21]. The
      primary efficacy parameters were stool weight, abnormal stool
      frequency and score of diarrhea questionnaire. All the patients
      have no recognized enteritis or intestinal canal identified from
      enteroscope or diarrhea resulted by protease inhibitors (PI)
      drugs. According to an analysis of the treatment effect over 7 and
      14 days based on daily measurements, Patients who were treated
      with XC experienced a statistically significant reduction in stool
      weight ( in 7 days and in 14 days) and in diarrhea questionnaire
      score ( in 14 days). There were no significant differences between
      groups with respect to stool frequency. No serious adverse events
      were reported. There was no major difference between XC and
      placebo in the occurrence of adverse events or in laboratory
      abnormalities.<br>

      </b>Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of Zhongyan-4
      ((Chinese characters), ZY-4, a Chinese herbal preparation worked
      out according to the therapeutic principle of supplementing qi,
      nourishing Yin, clearing heat and detoxication) in treating
      HIV/AIDS patients in the early or middle stage. Methods: Adopted
      was randomized double-blinded and placebo-parallel-controlled
      method, with 72 HIV/AIDS patients randomly divided into the ZY-4
      group (36 patients) treated with ZY-4 and the control group (36
      patients) treated with placebo. The treatment course was six
      months. The index of CD 4 +, CD 8 + counts, body weight, clinical
      symptom scoring were estimated at 4 time points (0, 1, 3 and 6
      month in the course), and also the viral load before and after
      treatment. The whole course of observation was completed in 63
      patients, 30 in the ZY-4 group and 33 in the control group.
      Results: CD 4 + count in the ZY-4 group got elevated by 7.70 ±
      150.96/mm 3 on average, while that in the control group lowered by
      27.33 ± 85.28/mm 3. Fifteen out of the 30 patients in the ZY-4
      group had their CD 4 + count increased, which was evidently much
      higher than that in the control group (8/33, P&lt;0.05),
      suggesting that the efficacy of ZY-4 is superior to that of
      placebo in elevating CD 4 + count. Moreover, ZY-4 showed actions
      in elevating CD 45RA + and CD 8 + count, reducing HIV virus load,
      improving clinical symptom/sign and increasing body weight of
      patients. No obvious adverse reaction was found in the clinical
      trial. Conclusion: ZY-4 has an immunity-protective and/or
      rebuilding function in HIV/AIDS patients in the early and middle
      stage, and also shows effects in lowering viral load, increasing
      body weight and improving symptoms and signs to a certain degree.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Context: Alternative medicine or complementary remedies that have
      not been scientifically tested are nonetheless widely used to
      treat chronic illnesses, particularly if curative options are
      limited. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of Chinese
      medicinal herbs in reducing symptoms and improving the quality of
      life of HIV-infected persons. Design: Prospective,
      placebo-controlled double-blind study. Setting: University-based
      HIV outpatient clinic. Patients: 68 HIV-infected adults with CD4
      cell counts &lt;0.5 x 109/L. Intervention: Participants were
      randomized to receive four daily doses of seven pills containing a
      standardized preparation of 35 Chinese herbs or placebo for 6
      months. Main Outcome Measures: Symptoms, HIV disease progression,
      HIV-1 RNA plasma vital loads, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, and scores
      on standard questionnaires for quality of life, depression,
      anxiety, and coping. Results: Intervention and placebo groups were
      equivalent at baseline regarding, respectively, previous
      antiretroviral therapy (74% versus 79%), median CD4 cell counts
      (0.20 x 109/L versus 0.25 x 109/L), and median HIV-1 plasma viral
      loads (35,612 copies/ml versus 52,027 copies/ml). At enrollment,
      none of the study subjects was seriously ill or depressed, and
      average coping and quality of life scores were in the normal
      range. In all, 53 (78%) participants completed the study. Patients
      taking Chinese herbs reported significantly more gastrointestinal
      disturbances (79% versus 38%; p = .003) than those receiving
      placebo. No therapy-related toxicities were observed. At
      completion of the study, no significant differences between the
      intervention and placebo groups were found regarding plasma viral
      loads, CD4 cell counts, symptoms, and psychometric parameters.
      HIV-1 RNA level was unchanged at study end. Among participants who
      were not on concomitant antiretroviral therapy, median CD4 cell
      counts declined by 0.05 x 109/L in both the intervention and
      placebo groups. Conclusions: This standardized formulation of
      Chinese herbs for HIV-infected individuals did not improve quality
      of life, clinical manifestations, plasma virus loads, or CD4 cell
      counts. The data suggest that this formulation of Chinese herbs is
      not effective when administered in a Western medicine setting.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Herbal compositions derived from Kenyan plants are provided for
      the treatment of HIV and other infectious diseases. The herbal
      compositions can include the extracts of up to 14 plants,
      including the root of <b>Dovyalis abyssinica and Clutia robust</b>a.





      Also provided are methods for extracting alkaloids and other
      compounds from the plants. Also provided are methods of treating a
      subject having an infectious disease, particularly HIV.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to combinations of extracts from
      plants that can be used in the treatment of infection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This application claims the benefit of provisional application
      Ser. No. 60/710,237, filed Aug. 22, 2005, incorporated herein by
      reference in its entirety. The following discussion of the
      background of the invention is merely provided to aid the reader
      in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or
      constitute prior art to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Tens of millions of people world-wide are living with acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or are infected with the
      causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In some
      countries in sub-Saharan Africa, up to one in four adults has
      contracted the disease. Despite the costs and efforts spent
      attempting to identify new methods of treatment, a cure for the
      disease has remained elusive.<br>
      <br>
      Ancient societies have traditionally turned to plants for their
      health needs. Documented use of herbs to treat illnesses dates
      back to as early as 2,000 B.C. Recently, individuals have resorted
      to nature as remedies and medicines for the treatment of modern
      illnesses have been derived from plants, such as for example,
      treatment of HIV and other infectious diseases.<br>
      <br>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,865 discloses an experimental
      treatment with 56 herbs, and reports that 10 of the 56 herbs
      exhibit anti-HIV activity in in vitro experiments. The 10 herbs
      include: <b>Coptis chineusis, Ligusticum wallichii, Ilicium
        eanclolatum, Isatis tinctoria, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Erycibe
        obtusifolia, Acanthopanax graciliatylus, Bostaurus domesticus,
        Inula helenium and Lonicera japonica. Both Bostaurus domesticus
        and Lonicera japonica</b> are further described to be able to
      combine with Scutellaria baicaleusis to exhibit anti-HIV activity.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,257 discloses Chinese herbal medicines that
      exhibit in vitro antiviral activity against murine leukemia virus
      and HIV and for treatment of animals and humans infected with HIV.
      In one of the preferred embodiments, the Chinese herbal medicines
      contain <b>hedyotis, Scutellarial barbatae herba, Lonicera flos,
        Prunellae spica and Solani harba.</b><br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,556 discloses various herbal compositions for
      treating viral infections which have shown in vitro antiviral
      activities against HIV. A first herbal composition contains <b>Aeginetiae





        herba, Blechni rhizoma, Lespedezae herba, Polygoni cuspidati
        rhizoma, Forsythiae fructus, and Ligustri fructus. A second
        herbal composition contains Cirsii rhizoma and radix, Breeae
        radix, Baphicacanthis rhizoma and radix, Phellodendri cortex,
        and Bletillae tuber. A third herbal composition disclosed in the
        patent includes Aeginetiae Herba, Lonicerae, Flos, Prunellae
        spica and Lespedezal herba.</b><br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,094 discloses an herbal pharmaceutical
      composition for treating HIV/AIDS. The pharmaceutical composition
      contains 14 ingredients, including: <b>diffuse hedyotis, bistort
        rhizome, giant knotweed rhizome, Asiatic moonseed rhizome,
        baical skullcap root, Bovine biliary powder, milkvetch root,
        barbary wolfberry fruit, sanqi, figwort root, Chinese
        magnoliavine fruit, turmeric root-tuber, hawthorn fruit and
        Chinese angelica.</b> Procedures are provided for the
      preparation of an “HIVCIDE condensate”, which can be formulated as
      an injectible solution or as capsules. Results indicate that
      subjects injected with HIVCIDE solution showed no symptoms of
      acute or chronic toxicity. Further, the HIVCIDE injection solution
      was effective in inhibiting pathological changes in cells caused
      by HIV-1 in vitro. In a third experiment, the HIVCIDE injection
      solution was effective in reducing symptoms of HIV-infected
      subjects in a treatment regime together with administration of
      HIVCIDE capsules. HIV-positive subjects did not show adverse
      reactions to HIVCIDE injection solution. It was further reported
      three out of four subjects showed improvement in fatigue after
      treatment with HIVCIDE, and that HIV viral load studies indicated
      that all subjects demonstrated reduced HIV viral loads.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,078 discloses a medical herbal composition for
      treating liver diseases and HIV. The composition contains 15
      ingredients, which includes <b>diffuse hedyotis, bistort rhizome
        giant knotweed rhizome, Asiatic moonseed rhizome, baical
        skullcap root, bovine biliary powder, milkvetch root, barbary
        wolfberry fruit, sanqi, red gingseng, figwort root, Chinese
        magnoliavine fruit, turmeric root-tuber, hawthorn fruit and
        Chinese angelica. Among the 15 ingredients, diffuse hedyotis,
        bistort rhizome, giant knotweed rhizome, and Chinese
        magnoliavine fruit</b> are cited as being necessary to
      contribute to the efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,725, an <b>extract from the seeds of
        Aeginetia indica</b> was prepared which exhibited excellent
      carcinostatic effects and possesses interleukin-2 and
      interferon-gamma-inducing properties. The extract is believed to
      be a macromolecular polysaccharide, which may or may not contain
      Lipid A binding with protein depending on whether the extraction
      is conducted using butanol or phenol. The extracted substance is
      soluble in water, insoluble in n-butanol, and has a molecular
      weight ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 Daltons.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,733 to Hozumi, et al., discloses a variety of
      plant extracts for use as anti-herpes viral, anti-polioviral,
      anti-varicella-zoster virus, anti-measles virus,
      anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV), and anti-DNA and anti-RNA virus
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,865 discloses the anti-HIV activity in vitro
      of a variety of herbs known in China to exhibit anti-viral
      activity. Water extractions of the mixtures, treatment with
      ethanol for precipitation and charcoal adsorption are disclosed
      for the preparation for the anti-HIV-active composition.<br>
      <br>
      Two<b> lignans, phyllamycin B and retrojusticiden B</b>, have been
      reported to have an inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse
      transcriptase activity. The lignans are isolated from <b>Phyllanthus





        myrtifolius Moon,</b> a plant widely grown in Southern China.
      See, for example, Chang, et al., Antiviral Research, 27 (4),
      367-374 (1995).<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of <b>aqueous extracts of Lonicera japonica flower
        buds, Forsythia suspensa fruits, and Scutellaria baicalensis
        rootbark</b> have been shown to have antibacterial and antiviral
      properties. Subjects with severe respiratory disease treated with
      the mixture responded as well as a control group on standard
      antibiotic therapy. See Houghton, et al., Phytother. Res., 7(5),
      384-386 (1993).<br>
      <br>
      A water extract of Prunella vulgaris was reported to have
      anti-HIVB activity when administered in combination with
      zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (dd1). Only a slight additive
      effect was observed for the administration of an extract of <b>Prunella





        vulgaris and zalcitabine (ddC)</b>. See John, et al., Abstr.
      Gen. Meet. Am. Sc. Microbiol., 94, 481 (1994).<br>
      <br>
      Yamasaki et al. have reported the in vitro evaluation of 204 crude
      drugs commonly used in Japan for anti-HIV-1 activity and studies
      indicate that hot water extracts of <b>Lithospermum erythrorhizon
        (root) and Prunella vulgaris (spike)</b> showed strong in vitro
      anti HIV-1 activity with an IC100 of 16 μg/mL. See Yamasaki, et
      al., Yakugaku Zasshi, 113(11), 818-824 (1993).<br>
      <br>
      Yao et al. have reported that water extracts of dried <b>Prunella
        vulgaris </b>(whole plant) were active in vitro for inhibiting
      HIV-1 replication, and showed relatively low cytotoxicity to MT-4
      cells. The extract also demonstrated activity in the inhibition of
      reverse transcriptase. The active factor was purified and
      identified as anionic with a molecular weight of approximately
      10,000 Daltons. This active component may be the same as the
      prunellin, as described by Tabba, et al., (1989). The purified
      extract inhibited HIV-1 replication in the lymphoid cell line
      MT-4, in the monocytoid cell line U937, and in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) at effective concentrations of 6.3 and
      12.5 μg/mL, respectively. Pretreatment of uninfected cells with
      the extract prior to viral exposure did not prevent HIV-1
      infection upon subsequent exposure to the virus. Preincubation
      with the purified extract decreased HIV-1 infectiousness. The
      purified extract also blocked cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1,
      prevented syncytium formation, and interfered with the ability of
      both HIV-1 and purified gp 120 to bind to CD4. PCR (polymerase
      chain reaction) analysis confirmed the absence of HIV-1 proviral
      DNA in cells exposed to virus in the presence of the extract,
      suggesting that the purified extract antagonized HIV-1 infection
      of susceptible cells by preventing viral attachment to the CD4
      receptor. See Yao, et al., Virology, 187(1), 56-62 (1992).<br>
      <br>
      Tabba, et al. isolated and partially characterized prunellin, a
      compound exhibiting anti-HIV properties, from <b>aqueous extracts
        of Prunella vulgaris, a Chinese herb. Prunellin</b> was
      identified as a carbohydrate (a partially sulfated polysaccharide)
      with an minimum inhibition concentration of 2.2 μg/mL against
      HIV-1 in vitro. It was identified as having a molecular weight of
      about 10,000 Dalton. See Tabba, et al., Antiviral Research, 11,
      263-273 (1989).<br>
      <br>
      Antiviral agents have been isolated from <b>Syzygium aromatica,
        Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree leaves), Scutellaria
        baicalensis, and Scutellaria rivularis. Eugeniin, (a tannin
        isolated from Syzygium aromatica), and methyl gallate, (isolated
        from Sapium sebiferum)</b>, exhibited anti-herpes simplex virus
      (HSV-2) activity in vitro. Plant flavonoids, such as
      5,7,4-truhydroxyflavone, extracted from the whole herb Scutellaria
      rivularis, were reported to have anti-influenza virus activity.
      See Hozumi, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,733; Takechi, et al.,
      Planta Medica, 42, 69-74 (1981); Kane, et al., Bioscience Report,
      8, 85-94 (1988); and Nagai, et al., Chem. Pharm Bull. 38(5),
      1329-1332 (1990).<br>
      <br>
      Ethiopian medicinal plants known for treatment of a variety of
      ailments were screened for activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2, as
      reported by Asres, et al. <b>Extracts from Bersama abyssinica
        root bark, Combretum paniculatum leaves, Dodonaea angustfolia
        leaves, and Ximenia Americana stem bark</b> each displayed
      anti-viral activity at concentrations that were non-toxic to MT-4
      cells. Anti-viral activity of the extracts is noted to be more
      effective against HIV-1 than HIV-2. See Asres, et al., Phytother.
      Res., 15, 62-69 (2001).<br>
      <br>
      Selected plants used in traditional Rwandan medicine for treatment
      of infections and/or rheumatoid diseases were investigated for
      antiviral activity in vitro against HIV-1. See Cos, et al.,
      Phytomedicine 9, 62-68 (2002). Of 38 plant extracts tested,
      extracts from the leaves of <b>Aspilia pluriseta and Rumex
        bequaertii</b> had the highest antiviral activities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based upon the discovery of the unique
      antiviral properties of a herbal remedy composition prepared from
      a variety of plants native to Kenya. The herbal composition of the
      present invention can include plant material from between two and
      14 different plants preferably including roots of abyssinica
      (representative seed of said line having been deposited under ATCC
      Accession No. PTA-6769) and Clutia robusta (representative seed of
      said line having been deposited under ATCC Accession No.
      PTA-6970). For treatment of infectious disease, the herbal
      composition of plant material may be extracted to produce a liquid
      herbal composition or further purified to obtain alkaloid
      compounds from the plant material. The liquid herbal composition
      prepared from aqueous extracts from the plants has demonstrated
      effectiveness in treating HIV-positive subjects, as subjects
      treated with the liquid herbal composition have experienced
      improvements in CD4+ cell counts, and in some cases, complete
      reversal of HIV positive status.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect, the invention provides a herbal composition for
      treating infectious diseases, such as for example, HIV. The
      composition containing plant material includes the roots of
      abyssinica and the roots of Clutia robusta. In other embodiments
      of the invention, the herbal pharmaceutical composition may also
      include plant material, as indicated, from one or more of the
      following: <b>stem bark of Prunus africanastem bark of Croton
        macrostachyus, stem bark of Acacia nilotica (representative seed
        of said line having been deposited under ATCC Accession No.
        PTA-7378), roots of Rhamnus prinoides, roots of Adenia
        gummifera, roots of Asparagus africanus, stem bark of
        Anthocleista grandiflora, whole plant of Plantago palmata
        (representative seed of said line having been deposited under
        ATCC Accession No. PTA-7377), roots of Clematis hirsuta, stem
        bark of Ekebergia capensis, stem bark of Bersama abyssinica, and
        roots of Periploca linearifolia.</b><br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the invention provides a method for preparing a
      liquid extract of the solid herbal composition of the invention.
      The extraction of plant material can be done with hot water. In
      one embodiment, hot aqueous extraction is done under basic
      conditions, followed by hot aqueous extraction under acidic
      conditions. In further embodiments, desired alkaloid compounds
      purified from the liquid extracts are provided or produced from
      direct chemical synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      The invention further provides aqueous extracts of the herbal
      compositions of the invention. Also provided are alkaloid
      compounds purified from aqueous extracts and the chemical
      synthesis of the herbal compositions of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention a method for treating

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the discovery that combinations
      of extracts from plants native to Kenya can be used in the
      treatment of infection, such as for example, HIV and AIDS. Herbal
      compositions prepared from combinations of the extracts of the
      following: <b>the roots of abyssinica and Clutia robusta, Rhamnus
        prinoides, Adenia gummifera, Asparagus africanus, Clematis
        hirsuta, and Periploca linearifolia, the stem bark of Ekebergia
        capensis, Bersama abyssinica, Prunus africana, Croton
        macrostachyus, Acacia nilotica, and Anthocleista grandiflora,
        and the whole plant of Plantago palmata</b> have been shown to
      be particularly effective in improving the health of infected
      subjects. Specifically, herbal compositions of the present
      invention are particularly well suited for the treatment of
      infectious diseases including HIV.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions of the invention can be prepared from plant material
      collected from the Mau Forest Complex in Western Kenya. Herbal
      compositions prepared from aqueous extractions and purified
      extracts of plants from this region of Kenya exhibit increased
      potency in the treatment of infectious diseases. The Mau Forest
      Complex is located at 0° 30′ South, 35° 20′ East and in the Rift
      Valley Province, and spans four Kenyan administrative districts:
      Narok, Nakuru, Bomet and Kericho. Mean annual rainfall varies from
      1000 to 1500 mm with peaks in April and August. The rainfall
      pattern at the western flanks is governed by the moist monsoon
      winds from the Indian Ocean and dry winds from the Great Rift
      Valley. The western flanks of the Mau Forest Complex are
      influenced by the Lake Victoria macroclimatic region and are
      generally wetter with annual rainfall greater than 2000 mm and
      more evenly distributed. Mean annual temperatures for the Mau
      Forest Complex range from 12-16° C. The soil of the Mau Forest
      Complex is rich volcanic loam having a pH between 3.8-5.8.<br>
      <br>
      The vegetational pattern follows an altitudinal gradient with
      local topographical ecolines. The closed canopy moist mountain
      forest at lower altitudes becomes increasingly intermixed with
      bamboo from 2200 m onwards. Between 2300 and 2500 m, pure bamboo
      (Arundinaria alpina) swards are found. Above 2500 m this gives way
      to mixed bamboo/tree stands, both associated with grass clearings
      that usually represent a sub-climax resulting from burning and
      cutting of bamboo. A marginal type of mountain sclerophyll forest,
      wherein the plants generally have hard leaves to prevent wilting
      during dry conditions, occupies the highest altitudes of the Mau
      complex.<br>
      <br>
      Plants in the Western flank of the Mau Forest Complex have shown
      the highest potency for the herbal compositions. Plants growing in
      the Western flank, (which is generally a high rainfall, high
      altitude region), have fewer environmental stresses. It is
      therefore possible that plants of the Western flank have more
      biosynthetic pathways, which may in turn lead to the production of
      a greater number of diverse compounds, which may in turn explain
      the greater potency of plants from the Western flank (as compared
      to other regions of the Mau Forest Complex). Alternatively, the
      greater potency plant extracts from the Western flank plants may
      be a result of a greater variety and number of alkaloids and other
      compounds in the plant extracts, such that the combined effect is
      greater than the sum of their individual effects.<br>
      <br>
      The East Mau Forest Complex has a drier vegetation of Cedar and
      Podo. Wherever these species have been extracted, colonizing
      species such as<b> Neuboutonia marcrocalyx and Macaranga capensis</b>
      can be found.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention may be prepared using plants
      collected from three altitude ranges of the Mau Forest Complex:
      2000 m (annual rainfall of 1000 mm), 2300 m (1500 mm), 2500 m
      (western Mau flank, annual rainfall greater than 2000 mm) above
      sea level. The Western flanks of the Mau Forest contain plants
      that are particularly preferred for preparing the herbal
      compositions of the invention. The plants grown in the drier.
      Eastern flank of the Mau Forest Complex also may be used.<br>
      <br>
      Plant material for preparing compositions of the invention may
      also be obtained from plants grown in a greenhouse environment.
      The germination of the seeds of particular plants may be altitude
      or soil dependent. Seeds for greenhouse planting may require
      collection from the natural dispersal agents as they exist in the
      wild. Additionally, simulation of rainfall, sunlight (an average
      of 12 hours per day in the Mau Forest Complex), and soil
      conditions of the Mau Forest Complex (i.e., rich volcanic loam
      having a pH between 3.8-5.8) may be required to obtain plants of
      similar potency.<br>
      <br>
      The seeds of abyssinica (representative seed of said line having
      been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-6969) are contained in
      a fleshy fruit. There are about 4 seeds enclosed by the flesh. A
      ripe fleshy fruit can be soaked in water for about 4 days, to make
      it possible to squeeze with minimum force to release the small
      seeds, each being approximately the size of a tomato seed or
      slightly larger. The seeds are then washed, dried and stored,
      awaiting germination under Mau Forest-like environmental
      conditions. In the wild, the fruit flesh is soaked by rain water,
      which results in the release of the seeds. The seeds grow
      naturally under the environmental conditions of the Mau Forest
      Complex as described above.<br>
      <br>
      The <b>Clutia robusta</b> (representative seed of said line
      having been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-6970) seeds are
      much smaller and encased in berries having a nut-like outer
      covering which encases approximately 3 to 4 seeds the size of a
      grain of sand. When mature seeds are exposed direct sunlight, they
      disperse rapidly in a process called explosive dispersal. This is
      not a problem in the wild, but if one is interested in collecting
      the seeds, care and intelligence are required, or else all the
      seeds will fly away under the scattering effect of the hot sun.<br>
      <br>
      To recover the <b>clutia robusta seeds</b>, the berries should be
      placed in a metallic container, and covered with a material that
      allows sunlight to enter, such as a transparent polyethylene film
      surrounding a container of appropriate wire mesh. Exposure to
      light will cause the shells to break open, releasing the seeds
      which can then be separated from the chaff.<br>
      <br>
      The optimal time for planting the clutia and dovyallis seeds in
      their natural environment is during the long rains, typically
      around the month of April. However, in the wild, the plants will
      generally grow throughout the year, except during the dry season,
      as the plants require a considerable amount of water and light to
      grow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Croton macrostachyus </b>produces pale pea-sized capsules, on
      drooping spikes to 30 cm long, splitting open on the tree to
      release 3 shiny grey seeds, covered at one end by a soft, creamy
      aril, or envelope.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prunus africana</b> produces spherical fruit, about 10 mm in
      diameter and is pinkish brown in color.<br>
      <br>
      The <b>Acacia nilotica</b> (representative seed of said line
      having been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-7378) plant
      produces straight or curved pods measuring approximately 17×2 cm.
      When young, the pods are green and fleshy but get darker with age,
      and are usually velvety. Pods have a fruity odor and open on the
      ground to release seeds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ekebergia capensis</b> produces rounded, thin skinned berries,
      up to 2.5 cm in diameter, on long stalks in heavy bunches, which
      are yellow to red in color when mature.<br>
      <br>
      The berry-like fruits of <b>Rhamnus prinoides</b> are
      approximately the size of a pea (about 5 mm in diameter), roundish
      and clearly divided into three compartments. They are fleshy and
      green, turning red and then purple as they ripen.<br>
      <br>
      The fruit of the <b>Asparagus africanus</b> is a round berry,
      approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, green aging to orange, found
      most of the year. It is spread mainly by birds carrying the seeds.<br>
      <br>
      The <b>Anthocleista grandiflora</b> produces fruits that are oval
      in shape, measuring approximately 3 cm×2 cm, glossy, smooth and
      brown when mature. Multi-seeded, large fruits are found throughout
      the year.<br>
      <br>
      The <b>Bersama abyssinica</b> produces a smooth, spherical
      capsule, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, golden
      velvety at first, losing most of the hair and becoming brown by
      maturity; splitting into four valves to reveal attractive bright
      red seeds, about 10 mm long, enveloped for about their half length
      by a yellow, cup-shaped aril.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adenia gummifera</b> produces a fruit which is a stalked
      3-valved capsule, leathery or fleshy, often red; seeds compressed
      with bony testa in a fleshy aril.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plantago palmata</b> (representative seed of said line having
      been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-7377) produces a
      capsule-like fruit with two seeds per capsule.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Periploca linearifolia </b>(representative seed of said line
      having been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-7375) produces
      black seeds measuring approximately 10 mm long and 2 mm wide with
      white wool measuring around 3 cm attached to the tips of the
      seeds. The seeds are enclosed in pods measuring about 12 cm long.
      Upon maturity, the pods break open upon exposure to sunlight. This
      releases the seeds, which are borne aloft by the wool as they are
      dispersed by wind. Alternatively, these plants may be cultivated
      from stem cuttings, which when laid on or planted in the ground,
      grow roots and propagate new plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clematis hirsuta</b> (representative seed of said line having
      been deposited under ATCC Accession No. PTA-7383) produces
      yellowish seeds measuring approximately 3mm in length and 1 mm in
      breadth. The seeds are surrounded by yellowish-white wool which
      measures about 5 mm long. The wool carries the seeds upon the
      wind, which is the dispersal agent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HIV Testing</b><br>
      <br>
      As noted previously, for purposes of this application, a person is
      considered HIV-negative if the subject tested negative on a
      two-part HIV screening tests, consisting of an initial screening
      test and a confirmatory test.<br>
      <br>
      An infected individual usually goes for testing for one or more of
      the following reasons: 1) the individual feels ill, 2) the
      individual's sexual partner is ill and has tested positive, 3) the
      individual's sexual partner died of AIDS; or 4) the individual
      suspects his/her sexual partner is sexually promiscuous.<br>
      <br>
      The initial screening test is ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
      Assay), an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine the presence of
      HIV antibodies. The ELISA test uses artificial HIV proteins that
      capture antibodies to the virus and is more than 99 percent
      accurate. If antibodies to HIV are present (positive result), the
      test is typically repeated. However, other antibodies can cause a
      false-positive result.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, HIV-1 antibodies are detectable approximately 25 days
      after acute infection, with nearly all infected subjects testing
      HIV positive 12 weeks after infection. The process of developing
      antibodies to a virus is termed seroconversion, and individuals
      who become antibody-positive are often called seroconverters.<br>
      <br>
      Two types of HIV have been identified: HIV-1 and HIV-2, of which,
      HIV-1 is more common. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are similar in the modes of
      transmission (sexual contact, sharing needles, etc.) and infected
      individuals are generally subject to the same opportunistic
      infections. However, HIV-2 appears to weaken the immune system
      more slowly than HIV-1.<br>
      <br>
      In Kenya, individuals are generally tested for antibodies to both
      HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is generally more common in the Western
      world and HIV-2 is more common in Africa. In Kenya however, most
      HIV-positive individuals have the HIV-1 infection. It is believed
      that 90% of the HIV-positive cases in Kenya are HIV-1, with the
      remaining 10% of HIV-positive cases being the HIV-2. While rare,
      subjects occasionally are HIV antibody-positive to both types of
      HIV (i.e. HIV-1 and HIV-2).<br>
      <br>
      The second part of the HIV screening test is called the
      confirmatory test. In the U.S., the most often used confirmatory
      test is the Western blot, wherein an electrical field is used to
      separate the various components by their molecular weight prior to
      evaluating antibody binding. This allows identification of
      antibodies to specific viral antigens, which show up as
      identifiable “bands” on a strip of test paper. The Western blot
      test is more difficult to perform and accurately interpret than
      the ELISA test, but it is less likely to give a false-positive
      result because it can distinguish HIV antibodies from other
      antibodies that may react to the ELISA. Other confirmatory tests
      may be used, including the indirect fluorescent antibody assay
      (IFA) and the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA).<br>
      <br>
      One major drawback of antibody tests is the “window” period (i.e.
      the time it takes the body to produce antibodies after infection
      has begun). The screening tests do not correlate to the presence
      or absence of symptoms. The standard HIV tests do not detect the
      virus itself, but instead detect the antibodies that the body
      produces in response to the virus. During the period before the
      antibodies are produced, a person may be infected with HIV and can
      infect others, and still test negative on the HIV antibody test.
      It is therefore important to tell subjects who test negative to
      avoid engaging in high-risk behavior and to return for retesting
      at a later date.<br>
      <br>
      The p24 antigen test can be used in diagnosing HIV early in the
      course of infection. It is primarily used to screen the blood
      supply but in some places it is used for testing for HIV. The p24
      antigen is a protein that is part of the HIV. Early in the
      infection, it is produced in excess and can be detected in the
      blood serum by a commercial test. The p24 test can detect HIV
      infection before the HIV antibody test can and it is recommended
      2-3 weeks after a risk exposure.<br>
      <br>
      Individuals that test positive for HIV are regularly administered
      two tests to monitor HIV levels in the blood and to determine how
      the virus is affecting the immune system. These tests are: (1) a
      viral load measurement, and (2) CD4+ cell counts.<br>
      <br>
      Viral load measurement (also called the HIV plasma RNA test)
      determines how many HIV viral particles are present in a given
      amount of a person's blood. Test results help determine the best
      treatment for the HIV infection as the viral load test shows how
      fast the virus is multiplying in the body. Because HIV reproduces
      by making copies of itself, the results are given as copies per
      milliliter (mL). Viral load testing can also reveal the presence
      HIV infection before antibodies can be detected and can also
      accurately determine whether a baby born to an infected mother has
      HIV.<br>
      <br>
      CD4+ cell counts (T-lymphocyte measurements) provide an estimate
      of the immunologic status of an individual and help determine the
      immediate risk of opportunistic infection. The CD4+ count measures
      the number of a certain type of white blood cell that is most
      affected by HIV, and are measured every 3 to 4 months in
      individuals infected with HIV. On average, an individual infected
      with HIV loses approximately, 30-60 CD4+ cells per year, although
      in some subjects, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts may remain stable for
      years followed by rapid decline.<br>
      <br>
      CD4(T4) or CD4+ cells are a type of T cell involved in protecting
      against infections, such as for example, viral, fungal, and
      protozoal infections. Destruction of these cells is the major
      cause of immunodeficiency observed in AIDS, and decreasing CD4+
      lymphocyte counts appear to be the best indicator for the
      potential development of opportunistic infections. In judging the
      severity of HIV/AIDS cases, the CD4+ lymphocyte count is more
      indicative of the severity of the disease than gross symptomalogy,
      although it is also true that certain symptoms may be associated
      with particular CD4+ lymphocyte levels. See, for example, FIG. 1.
      Average normal adult CD4+ cell counts typically ranges from 500 to
      1,500/2,000 cells per cubic milliliter of blood.<br>
      <br>
      As CD4+ cell counts decrease below the normal adult levels during
      primary HIV infection, CD8+ or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes also
      increase. However, most studies indicate that an increase in CD8
      count is not a prognostic indicator of disease progression. Some
      clinicians in the U.S. use the CD4/CD8 ratio as an indicator of
      disease progression, however, this ratio varies not only with the
      severity of the disease, but with the ethnicity of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      There are several systems for classifying and staging HIV
      infection. The most commonly-used system is the CDC (Centers for
      Disease Control) Scheme. The CDC scheme has three classifications
      based upon CD4 counts. The definitions of the three CD4+
      T-lymphocyte categories I as follow: Category 1: &gt;500
      cells/mm&lt;3 &gt;(or CD4%&gt;28%); Category 2: 200-499
      cells/mm&lt;3 &gt;(or CD4% 14% -28%); and Category 3: &lt;200
      cells/mm&lt;3 &gt;(or CD4%&lt;14%).<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the CDC classification scheme, there are also 3
      possible categories of clinical conditions, which are designated
      by the letters A, B and C. Therefore, a given individual can have
      the following CDC classification and clinical categorization
      designation: 1-A, or 1-B, or I-C, 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 3-A, 3-B or 3-C.<br>
      <br>
      An individual in category A is identified as an adolescent or
      adult (&gt;13 years) with documented HIV infection having one or
      more of the following conditions (and lacking any of the
      conditions associated with categories B and C): asymptomatic HIV
      infection; persistent generalized lymphadenopathy; and acute
      (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of
      acute HIV infection.<br>
      <br>
      An individual in category B is identified as an adolescent or
      adult (&gt;13 years) with documented HIV infection having one or
      more of the following conditions (and lacking any of the
      conditions associated with category C) and that meet at least one
      of the following criteria: (a) the conditions are attributed to
      HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated
      immunity; or (b) the conditions are considered by physicians to
      have a clinical course or to require management that is
      complicated by HIV infection. Examples of conditions in clinical
      category B include but are not limited to: bacillary angiomatosis;
      candidiasis (oropharyngeal, i.e. thrush); candidiasis
      (vulvovaginal, persistent, frequent, or poorly responsive to
      therapy); cervical dysplasia (moderate or severe/cervical
      carcinoma in situ); constitutional symptoms, such as fever (body
      temperature of 38.5° C. or greater) or diarrhea lasting longer
      than 1 month; hairy leukoplakia (oral); herpes zoster (shingles),
      involving at least two distinct episodes or more than one
      dermatome; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; listeriosis;
      pelvic inflammatory disease (particularly if complicated by
      tubo-ovarian abscess); and (11) peripheral neuropathy. For
      classification purposes, Category B conditions take precedence
      over Category A conditions. For example, an individual previously
      treated for oral or persistent vaginal candidiasis (but not
      exhibiting a Category C disease or condition) who is now
      asymptomatic, should be classified in Category B.<br>
      <br>
      An individual in category C is identified as an adolescent or
      adult (&gt;13 years) with documented HIV infection having one or
      more of the following conditions Category C conditions include the
      following: candidiasis of bronchi, trachea, or lungs; candidiasis
      (esophageal); invasive cervical cancer; coccidioidomycosis
      (disseminated or extrapulmonary); cryptococcosis (extrapulmonary);
      cryptosporidiosis (chronic intestinal, greater than 1 month's
      duration); cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or

      One method of treatment for HIV-positive individuals is the highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. HAART is a
      therapeutic treatment regime consisting of the combination of
      anti-HIV drugs, that is prescribed to HIV-positive individuals
      even before they develop symptoms of AIDS. The therapy usually
      includes one nucleoside analog, one protease inhibitor and either
      a second nucleoside analog or a non-nucleoside reverse
      transcription inhibitor (NNRTI). Frequently, the HAART regime is
      toxic to the individual, resulting in adverse side effects. For
      example, HAART can be toxic to blood because it almost always
      includes one or two nucleoside analogs, like AZT that are
      notorious for their toxicity to red and white blood cells and
      blood cell production. Various forms of anemia are very common and
      sometimes are irreversible. However, it is extremely rare for a
      subject on the HAART regimen reverse his/her HIV status in Kenya.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of drugs administered for the HAART treatment regime
      include: azidovudine (AZT), didanosine (dideoxyinosine, ddI),
      zalcitabine (dideoxycytosine, ddC), lamivudine (epivir, 3TC),
      nevirapine (Viramune), abacavir (Ziagen), stavudine (Zerit, d4T),
      tenofovir (Viread), efavirenz (Sustiva), amprenavir (Agenerase),
      lopinavir (Kaletra), nefinavir (Viracept), saquinavir (Invirase),
      ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and delavirdine
      (Rescriptor).<br>

      <b>Method for Extracting Alkaloid Compounds and Preparing Herbal
        Composition</b><br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention are prepared using roots of
      abyssinica and Clutia robusta, and optionally one or more of the
      following: <b>the stem bark of Prunus africana, stem bark of
        Croton macrostachyus, stem bark of Acacia nilotica, roots of
        Rhamnus prinoides, roots of Adenia gummifera, roots of Asparagus
        africanus, stem bark of Anthocleista grandiflora, whole plant of
        Plantago palmata, roots of Clematis hirsuta, stem bark of
        Ekebergia capensis, stem bark of Bersama abyssinica, and roots
        of Periploca linearifolia</b>. Preferably, the ingredients
      collected are fresh, although dried samples may also be used. The
      ingredients are combined and chopped into small pieces and dried.
      Preferably, the dried ingredients are ground into a fine powder
      after drying. Alternatively, each ingredient may be processed
      individually and combined at a later stage. Preferably, if
      combined for the extraction process, the ingredients are combined
      in equal weight ratios. Optionally, Dovyalis abyssinica, Clutia
      robusta, Prunus africana, Croton macrostachyus, Acacia nilotica,
      Rhamnus prinoides, Adenia gummifera, Asparagus africanus,
      Anthocleista grandiflora, Plantago palmata, Clematis hirsuta,
      Ekebergia capensis, Bersama abyssinica and Periploca linearifolia
      can be present in a weight ratio of 2:2:2:2:2:2:1:2:2:1:2:2:2:2.<br>
      <br>
      The herbal plant material mixture may be extracted with a
      non-polar solvent to remove fats from the chopped herbal
      ingredients. Preferably, approximately 20% by volume non-polar
      solvent is added to the herbal ingredient mixture. Non-polar
      solvents are generally organic solvents having a dielectric
      constant less than 20. Non-polar solvents that may be used
      include, but are not limited to: alkanes, 1,4-dioxane, carbon
      tetrachloride, chloroform, methylene chloride, benzene, ethers,
      ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, butanol,
      chlorobenzene, cycloalkanes, xylene, and the like. Preferred
      non-polar solvents are xylene and ether.<br>
      <br>
      The non-polar solvent is decanted and discarded. The defatted
      herbal solids, are then allowed to dry. Sufficient base is added
      to the defatted herbal material to achieve a pH of approximately
      8. The concentration of the base added can be adjusted to provide
      sufficient liquid volume to cover the defatted herbal solid
      mixture. Any suitable base may be used, with preferred bases
      including NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, NH4OH, and the like. The
      base extract is then heated for 2-4 hours. Preferably, the
      ingredients are slowly simmered under reflux conditions, although
      the same effect can be achieved by simmering the mixture in a
      covered pot.<br>
      <br>
      Acid is added to the base extract to achieve a pH of approximately
      3. Preferably the acid is HCl, although other acids, including but
      not limited to, HBr, HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4, or any other acid
      suitable for achieving a pH of approximately 3 may be used as
      well. The concentration of the acid can be adjusted as necessary
      to provide sufficient volume to the mixture. The acidified
      solution is then boiled for approximately 2-4 hours under the same
      conditions employed for the heating of the basic solution. After
      heating, the mixture is cooled, and the aqueous layer is separated
      from the mixture, such as for example, by decanting the liquid
      from the remaining solids. Acid is then added to the remaining
      residue sufficient to achieve a pH of approximately 3, and the
      mixture is then reheated for approximately 2-4 hours under the
      same conditions previously employed. The aqueous layer is
      separated from the ingredients and the two acidified layers are
      combined. If necessary, additional acid extractions may be
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      The acidic filtrate is extracted several times with a non-polar
      solvent until little or no emulsion forms. Preferable non-polar
      solvents are ether and xylene. Base is added to the aqueous layer
      to precipitate the alkaloid compounds. Preferably, base is added
      to achieve a pH of approximately 9. The precipitate is separated
      from the aqueous solution, neutralized and dried.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate is preferably collected in either crystalline or
      powder form, and may administered to an subject as a beverage,
      capsule, tablet, powder, candy, gel, nutritional product or
      pharmaceutical product.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate can be further purified as desired to isolate
      individual alkaloid compounds by any known chromatographic means.<br>
      <br>
      It is understood that at any point during the process of
      extracting the alkaloid compounds from the herbal ingredients that
      the aqueous solution can be concentrated and stored for later use
      without the need for precipitation of the compounds from solution.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the alkaloid compounds for use in the present
      invention can be synthesized by known methods once the chemical
      structure has been determined. Isolated compounds can be analyzed
      by chemical analysis, mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy,
      X-ray diffraction, NMR (including &lt;1&gt;H NMR, &lt;13&gt;C NMR,
      COSY, NOSEY, and the like), and other known analytical techniques
      to obtain the chemical structures. For example, chemical
      structures for four extracts obtained from abyssinica have been
      previously determined. (See, for example,
      http://www.dfuni.dk/uploads/media/Naturstofgruppen_BonnieRasmussen.pdf).<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be described in greater detail by reference
      to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Determination of Bioactivity of Plant Extracts<br>
      <br>
      The efficacy of the individual plant extracts were tested against
      Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Plant extracts were
      obtained as described above. Solutions containing 100 ppm (parts
      per million) of each plant extract were prepared for use in the
      anti-bacterial assay.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of bacterial culture of Escherichia coli and
      Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
      <br>
      Standard cultures of E. coli (representing gram-negative strains
      of bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (representing gram-positive
      bacteria) were obtained from Moi University Teaching and Referral
      Hospital. Assays were conducted at the Moi University Department
      of Botany.<br>
      <br>
      Bioassay procedure (Diffusion Method)<br>
      <br>
      Nutrient agar was used as growth medium for both bacteria samples.
      The agar was sterilized in an autoclave at 120° C., cooled and
      poured into sterile Petri dishes and allowed to set. Sterile
      conditions were achieved and maintained by exposing the area to a
      UV lamp during sample preparation and the assay the procedure.<br>
      <br>
      The cooled agar medium was streaked on the surface with each
      bacteria culture. Wells were dug in the middle of the medium,
      using a cork borer, where the prepared plant extract was
      deposited. A control experiment was also performed, using plain
      sterile water in place of the plant extracts.<br>
      <br>
      Cultures were incubated for 12 hours, after which zones of
      inhibition of bacterial growth were determined and measured.
      Bacteria-growth inhibition was expressed in diameters (mm), and
      was determined by measuring the distance from edge of the well to
      area where the bacteria begin to show growth. Generally, the
      larger inhibition diameter indicates greater potency of the
      particular extract against the bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Of the 23 plants were screened in this assay, 14 of the plants had
      bacteria growth inhibition diameters greater than 8 mm, which was
      previously determined to be the minimum activity required for
      adoption of the extract for the herbal remedy. The anti-bacterial
      activities of the plants were compared with standard antibiotics.
      Of the 14 plants having inhibition diameters greater than 8 mm,
      abyssinica and Clutia robusta demonstrated the greatest
      anti-bacterial activity. Results for plant extracts exhibiting
      inhibition diameters greater than 8 mm are provided in the Table
      1.<br>

      Administration of the Herbal Composition<br>
      <br>
      The plant extract precipitates are preferably purified and
      collected in either crystalline or powder form. The precipitates
      can administered to a subject as a beverage, capsule, tablet,
      powder, candy, gel, nutritional product or pharmaceutical product.
      Preferably, between 0.1 and 25 grams of alkaloids are administered
      per day to an infected subject. The herbal composition is
      preferably administered as a beverage wherein approximately 1 tbsp
      of powdered extract is dissolved in approximately 250 mL of hot
      water, and drunk. Dosing is either twice daily at 12 hour
      intervals, or three times daily at eight hour intervals (depending
      on the level of infection of the test subject), and is preferably
      administered with a meal.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects in the current trials were screened at the Walter Reed
      Hospital of the U.S. Army in Kericho, Kenya, the Moi University
      Hospital in Eldoret, and at various Voluntary Counseling and
      Testing (VCT) Centers scattered throughout the country.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects' CD4 and CD8 counts were measured using a FACSCount™
      system following procedures provided in the FACSCount White Paper
      (July 1994). HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies were detected using a
      bioMérieux Vironostika® HIV Uni-Form II Ag/Ab ELISA system.<br>
      <br>
      All subjects administered the herbal composition were HIV-positive
      adults. Prior to administration of the herbal composition, an
      initial CD4 count for each subject was determined, followed by an
      assessment of the level of opportunistic infections. Those with
      fewer opportunistic infections were administered the herbal
      composition twice daily after meals, at twelve hour intervals.
      Those with more opportunistic infections were administered the
      herbal composition three times daily, at 8 hours intervals. Each
      subject was given one week's dosage during each visit to the
      clinic. This was done to make it possible to monitor compliance,
      and to avoid the possibility of subjects sharing the drug with
      others.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1<br>
      <br>
      Initial studies for the treatment of HIV positive subjects with
      herbal remedy were conducted by treating four HIV positive
      subjects with two different herbal remedies. Two subjects were
      administered a herbal composition which included the extract of
      abyssinica, while the other two subjects were administered a
      herbal remedy which included the extract of Clutia robusta. The
      subjects were each treated for a period of three months. The CD4
      counts of both sets of subjects (i.e., those administered either
      abyssinica or Clutia robusta) increased by approximately 10 per
      month of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      In another study, three subjects were administered a herbal
      composition prepared with a 1:1 ratio by weight mixture of Doyalis
      abyssinica and Clutia robusta for a period of approximately three
      months. The CD4 counts of the subjects treated with the mixture
      increased by approximately 30 per month.<br>
      <br>
      Example 3<br>
      <br>
      In yet another experiment, 20 subjects were administered a herbal
      composition containing extracts of abyssinica, Clutia robusta,
      Prunus africana, Croton macrostachyus, Acacia nilotica, Ekebergia
      capensis, Clematis hirsuta and Adenia gummifera. The 8 plant
      extracts were selected from 23 total plant extracts which had been
      previously assayed against E. coli and S. aureus. As shown in
      Table 2, CD4 counts increased of subjects by up to 100 per month,
      but none of the subjects tested HIV negative within the
      three-month period.<br>

      Example 4<br>
      <br>
      In another experiment, 26 HIV-positive subjects were treated with
      a herbal composition consisting of the 14 herbal ingredients
      identified in Table 1. Subjects were administered a composition
      prepared by dissolving approximately 1 tbsp. (or 15 ml) of the
      powdered ingredients (a mixture prepared the 14 plants listed in
      Table 1) in approximately 8 ozs. (250 ml) of hot water. The
      supernatant liquid was then ingested by the subject.<br>
      <br>
      The subjects were divided into two groups: the first group having
      10 subjects (subject ID Nos. 1-10) and the second group having 16
      subjects (Subject ID Nos 11-26). In the first group, each the 14
      plants was present in the composition in equal weight ratios. In
      the second group, the concentrations of abyssinica and Clutia
      robusta were approximately half of the other 12 ingredients as
      disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Table 3, CD4 counts for each subject were measured on
      a monthly basis. The CD4 counts of the test subjects treated with
      the 14 ingredient herbal composition increased by up to 100 per
      month. Six subjects tested HIV-negative after four months of
      treatment. Two subjects tested HIV-negative after two months of
      treatment.<br>

      By comparison with the results achieved with the present
      invention, in a study conducted on subjects on HAART in Moi
      University Teaching and Academic Model for Prevention and
      Treatment of HIV (AMPATH), the CD4 count increases were gradual,
      generally taking several years to reach above 500. The subjects
      were treated with conventional antiretroviral (ARV) therapy,
      consisting of twice daily dosing of Stavudine, Lamivudine and
      Nevirapine (d4T-3TC-NVP). Other ARV regimes include treatment with
      combinations consisting of ZDV-3TC-NVP, d4T-3TC-EFV and
      ZDV-3TC-EFV (wherein ZDV is Zidovudine and EFV is Efavirenz).
      Treatment guidelines are provided in the publication “Integrated
      Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness,” published in January
      2004 by the World Health Organization. ARV therapy subjects rarely
      reverse their seroconversion status, and among those listed in
      Table 4, none did so.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Modem medical science is constantly searching for new and more
      powerful agents to prevent, treat or retard bacterial and viral
      infections and cure the diseases they cause. Bacterial and viral
      infections of humans and domestic animals cost billions of dollars
      annually. Vast sums of money are spent each year by pharmaceutical
      companies to identify, characterize, and produce new antibiotics
      and antivirals to combat the emerging drug resistant strains which
      have become a serious problem. Reliable prophylactic treatments
      for disease prevention are also of major interest. Yet, despite
      the costs and efforts to identify treatments for viral infections,
      such as hepatitis and AIDS, effective therapies remain elusive.<br>
      <br>
      Hepatitis is a disease of the human liver. It is manifested with
      inflammation of the liver and is usually caused by viral
      infections and sometimes from toxic agents. Hepatitis may progress
      to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and eventually death. Several
      viruses such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G are known to cause
      various types of viral hepatitis. Among them, HBV and HCV are the
      most serious. HBV is a DNA virus with a virion size of 42 nm. HCV
      is a RNA virus with a virion size of 30-60 nm. See D. S. Chen, J.
      Formos. Med. Assoc., 95(1), 6-12 (1996).<br>
      <br>
      Hepatitis B is a major health problem worldwide, especially in
      Asia and Africa. Approximately 300 million people are chronically
      infected with HBV worldwide. More than one million carriers of HBV
      are found in the United States and HBV infection is currently the
      main cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. HBV carriers not only
      become long-term reservoirs of the virus but also may develop
      chronic liver disease and have a greatly increased risk of
      developing liver cirrhosis and cancer. The progression from
      chronic hepatitis B to cirrhosis is frequently insidious and
      occurs without a noticeable change in symptoms. Once the symptoms
      of cirrhosis or cancer are manifested, therapies are of little
      value.<br>
      <br>
      Current prevention of HBV infection is a hepatitis B vaccination
      which is safe and effective. However, vaccination is not effective
      in treating those already infected (i.e., carriers and patients).
      Many drugs have been used in treating chronic hepatitis B and none
      have been proven to be effective, except interferon. Treatment
      with interferon has limited success and has frequently associated
      adverse side effects such as fatigue, fever, chills, headache,
      myalgias, arthralgias, mild alopecia, psychiatric effects and
      associated disorders, autoimmune phenomena and associated
      disorders and thyroid dysfunction. Treatment with interferon for
      sixteen (16) weeks has been shown to be effective with a sustained
      loss of viral replication in approximately 40% of hepatitis B
      patients. The great majority of responders had normal serum
      aminotransferase levels and relapse rates appear to be low. See R.
      P. Perrillo, Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 38(4), 577-593
      (1993). However, a higher long-term relapse rate (24%) was
      reported in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B who
      underwent interferon therapy. See A. S. F. Lok, H. T. Chung, V. W.
      S. Liu, &amp; O. C. K. Ma, Gastroenterology, 105(6), 1833-1838
      (1993).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared in
      10-15% of patients treated with interferon. The loss of HBsAg
      coincided with the disappearance of HBV. Improvement in liver
      histology was sustained years later in HBsAg-negative patients.
      The lack of disease progression could thus conceivably result in
      the prevention of liver cancer when treatment is provided in the
      pre-cirrhotic stage of infection. See R. P. Perrillo, Digestive
      Diseases and Sciences, 38(4), 577-593 (1993).<br>
      <br>
      Hepatitis C has been previously described as a non-A non-B
      hepatitis, which is caused by HCV. There are approximately 100
      million HCV carriers worldwide. An estimated 3.5 million people
      have chronic hepatitis C in the United States. HCV infection will
      lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer with less clinical
      manifestation. Most hepatitis C patients do not have particular
      symptoms and can thus be easily overlooked until it is too late
      for therapy. This poses a potentially more serious problem than
      hepatitis B. HCV carriers also become long-term reservoirs of the
      virus and eventually develop chronic liver disease and have a
      greatly increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and cancer.
      See D. S. Chen, Science, 262, 369-370 (1993).<br>
      <br>
      No effective immunization is currently available, and hepatitis C
      can only be controlled by other preventive measures such as
      improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions and interrupting
      the route of transmission. At present, the only acceptable
      treatment for chronic hepatitis C is interferon which requires at
      least six (6) months of treatment. Treatment with interferon has
      limited long term efficacy with a response rate about 25%. Initial
      treatment has a response rate of about 50% however, half of those
      which respond relapse after cessation of interferon treatment.
      Therefore, only about 25% of patients had a sustained response.
      See D. S. Chen, J. Formos. Med. Assoc., 95(1), 6-12 (1996) and N.
      Terrault &amp; T. Wright, New Engl. J. Med., 332(22), 1509-1511
      (1995).<br>
      <br>
      Because the interferon therapy has limited efficacy and frequent
      adverse effects, a more effective regimen is needed. New
      antivirals and immune modulators are presently undergoing clinical
      trials.<br>
      <br>
      AIDS is a deadly disease of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      in humans caused by HIV. It has been plaguing the world since the
      first description of the disease in 1981 and the discovery of its
      causative agent, HIV, in 1983. About 13 million people were
      infected with HIV worldwide in 1993 and the number has increased
      to about 21 million in 1996. See B. Jasny, Science, 260(5112),
      1219 (1993) and P. Piot, Science, 272(5270), 1855 (1996).<br>
      <br>
      Several drugs have been approved for treatment of this devastating
      disease, including azidovudine (AZT), didanosine (dideoxyinosine,
      ddI), d4T, zalcitabine (dideoxycytosine, ddC), nevirapine,
      lamivudine (epivir, 3TC), saquinavir (Invirase), ritonavir
      (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and delavirdine (Rescriptor). See
      M. I. Johnston &amp; D. F. Hoth, Science, 260(5112), 1286-1293
      (1993) and D. D. Richman, Science, 272(5270), 1886-1888 (1996).<br>
      <br>
      All drugs currently approved for AIDS treatment utilize inhibition
      of viral proliferation and are viral reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors or viral protease inhibitors. More protease inhibitors,
      such as nelfinavir and improved saquinavir, are in development. An
      AIDS vaccine (Salk's vaccine) has been tested and several proteins
      which are chemokines from CD8 have been discovered to act as HIV
      suppressors.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above synthetic nucleoside analogs, proteins,
      and antibodies, several plants and substances derived from plants
      have been found to have in vitro anti-HIV activity, such as
      Lonicera japonica and Prunella vulgaris, and glycyrrhizin from
      Glycyrrhiza radix. See R. S. Chang &amp; H. W. Yeung, Antiviral
      Research, 9, 163-175 (1988) and M. Ito, et al., Antiviral
      Research, 7, 127-137 (1987).<br>
      <br>
      Despite all of the available pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
      HIV, there is still no cure for the deadly disease. HIV viruses
      continue to mutate and become resistant to existing drugs such as
      the reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.
      Recently, a therapy of using two (2) or three (3) anti-HIV drugs
      in combination has been found effective in significantly lowering
      the HIV loads in AIDS patients. The results have been promising,
      however the virus continues to develop resistance to the drugs and
      the long-term outcome (survival and cure rates) is still unknown.
      Thus, the medical communities throughout the world continue to
      search for drugs that can prevent HIV infections, treat HIV
      carriers to prevent them from progressing to full-blown deadly
      AIDS, and treat the AIDS patient.<br>

      The use of herbal drugs and folk medicines have been known for
      thousands of years in China. These herbal approaches to the
      treatment of numerous illnesses, from arthritis to viral
      infections, have been viewed by western modern medicine as
      ineffective and dangerous. Records of the use of herbs date from
      ancient China, Egypt and Biblical times. Early physicians used
      hundreds of herbs to treat a variety of ailments. The practice is
      still widespread, especially in Asia and Europe. During the 19th
      century, many home remedies containing herbs were patented and
      sold. Modern drugs have replaced those remedies, but many modern
      drugs contain ingredients derived from herbs.<br>
      <br>
      In 1776, the English botanist and physician William Withering
      learned that an herbal tea made by an old farm woman was effective
      in treating dropsy, or excess water in the tissues, which is
      caused by the inability of the heart to pump strongly enough. He
      found that one ingredient of the tea, which was made with leaves
      of the foxglove plant, strengthened the heart's pumping ability.
      The drug made from the foxglove plant is now known as digitalis.<br>
      <br>
      Folk medicine is a relatively modern term to the West and has come
      to mean the care and treatment of the sick through a variety of
      herbal medicines. In recent years, folk medicines have become of
      increasing interest to many people in the western scientific
      medical community.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIOR ART</b><br>
      <br>
      A Chinese herbal medicine known as <b>AEGINETIAE HERBA (a.k.a.
        GOLDEN LOCK KEY or LOTUS HERBA</b>); has traditionally been used
      to treat illnesses such as swollen and sore throat, urinary tract
      infection, osteomyelitis, boils, tonsillitis, goiter, pharyngitis,
      thyroiditis, enteritis, liver disease, cancer, rheumatism,
      hematemesis, neurasthenia, eye redness, piles, menstruation
      irregularity, dropsy, jaundice, hernia, snake bite, and child
      developmental retardation. AEGINETIAE HERBA is prepared from the
      dried whole plant of Aeginetia indica which belongs to the family
      Orobanchaceae Dichondra micrantha, Striga lutea and Dichondra
      repens are also used to prepare this herbal medicine. Treatment
      dosage using the dried plant is typically from 4 to 150 g per day.
      It should be noted that the plant tastes bitter and is toxic.<br>
      <br>
      Okubo et al. disclose that a phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
      extract (pH 7.2 at ambient to 4 DEG C.) from the seeds of
      Aeginetia indica exhibits excellent carcinostatic effect and
      possesses interleukin-2 and interferon-.gamma. inducing
      properties. The PBS was a 0.1M phosphate buffered physiological
      saline at pH 7.2, not containing calcium or magnesium ions. The
      extracted substance is taught to be a macromolecular
      polysaccharide which may or may not contain lipid A binding with
      protein depending on whether the extraction is conducted using
      butanol or phenol. The extracted substance was soluble in water
      and insoluble in n-butanol. Its molecular weight was within the
      range of 100,000 to 200,000 Dalton. See S. Okubo, M. Sato, &amp;
      K. Himeno, U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,725, issued on Nov. 22, 1994.<br>
      <br>
      A Chinese herbal medicine known as <b>BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET
        RADIX</b> has traditionally been used to treat illnesses such as
      fever, abscesses, erysipelas, swollen sore throat, hematemesis,
      epistaxis, typhus, typhoid, mumps, puerperal fever, flu, measles,
      beriberi, headache, jaundice, plague, leucorrhea, and syphilis.
      BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET RADIX is prepared from the dried rhizoma
      and root of Baphicacanthes cusia, Strobilanthes cusia, Isatis
      tinctoria, Isatis indigotica, or Polygonum tinctorium. It has been
      reported that this herbal medicine has exhibited inhibition of flu
      virus in vitro. Aqueous extracts from boiling the root of Isatis
      tinctoria have also exhibited antibacterial effect.<br>
      <br>
      The dried leaf of Baphicacanthes cusia, Isatis tinctoria, Isatis
      indigotica, or Polygonum tinctorium have been used to prepare
      another herbal medicine known as BAPHICACANTHIS FOLIUM.
      BAPHICACANTHIS FOLIUM has traditionally been used to treat
      illnesses such as typhus, typhoid, measles, fever, erysipelas,
      sore throat, tonsillitis, dysentery, acute laryngitis, stomatitis,
      gum bleeding, and various infectious diseases with fever. It has
      also exhibited antibacterial effects and antipyretic effects. The
      leaf of Isatis tinctoria has been used as an antipyretic in the
      past.<br>
      <br>
      The leaf of Baphicacanthes cusia, Isatis tinctoria, Isatis
      indigotica, or Polygonum tinctorium with additional processing has
      also been used to prepare a third related herbal medicine known as
      <b>INDIGO PULVERATA LEVIS. INDIGO PULVERATA LEVIS</b> has
      traditionally been used to treat illnesses such as epistaxis,
      rashes, sores, mumps, chronic skin boils, dermatitis, anemia,
      fever, swollen sores, stomatitis, acute laryngitis, tonsillitis,
      gingivitis, parasitic oral mucosa inflammation, snake or dog
      bites, malignant sores, and erysipelas. Ethanol extracts of INDIGO
      PULVERATA LEVIS have exhibited bacterial inhibition properties.<br>
      <br>
      Baphicacanthes cusia and Strobilanthes cusia belong to the family
      of Acanthaceae. Isatis tinctoria and Isatis indigotica belong to
      the family of Cruciferae. Polygonum tinctorium belongs to the
      family of Polygonaceae. BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET RADIX tastes
      bitter while BAPHICACANTHIS FOLIUM tastes bitter and salty, and is
      nontoxic. INDIGO PULVERATA LEVIS tastes salty and is also
      nontoxic. Treatment doses are typically 10 to 19 g per day for
      BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET RADIX, 8 to 30 g per day for
      BAPHICACANTHIS FOLIUM, and 0.4-1.1 g per day for INDIGO PULVERATA
      LEVIS.<br>
      <br>
      Ho et al. disclose the use of an extract from a mixture of herbs
      for the in vitro inhibition of HIV infection in human T lymphocyte
      cells and mononuclear phagocytic lineage cells. The activity was
      based on the test results of a water extract from a mixture of
      three herbs: <b>Isatis tinctoria (or Isatis indigotica), Lonicera
        japonica, and Polygonum bistorta</b>. See D. D. Ho &amp; X. S.
      Li, U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,865, issued on Jan. 12, 1993.<br>
      <br>
      The compound known as tryptanthrin has been identified as the
      principal antifungal agent in the leaf of Strobilanthes cusia and
      as the main antidermatophytic substance in the leaf of <b>Polygonum





        tinctorium and Isatis tinctoria</b>. See H. Y. Hsu, Y. P. Chen,

      <br>
      A Chinese herbal medicine known as <b>BLECHNI RHIZOMA or
        DRYOPTERIS CRASSIRHIZOMAE RHIZOMA</b> has traditionally been
      used to treat conditions such as cuts, swelling, fever, measles,
      hematemesis, menorrhagia, dysentery, stool with traces of blood,
      abdominal pain caused by parasites, wound bleeding, uterus
      bleeding, puerperal abdominal pain, and erysipelas. BLECHNI
      RHIZOMA is prepared from the dried root and stem of Blechnum
      orientate which belongs to the family of Polypodiaceae or
      Blechnaceae. DRYOPTERIS CRASSIRHIZOMAE RHIZOMA is prepared from
      the dried root and stem of Dryopteris crassirhizoma which belongs
      to the family of Aspidiaceae. Osmunda japonica(Osmundaceae
      family), Woodwardia orientalis and Woodwardia unigemmata
      (Blechnaceae family), Athyrium acrostichoides (Aspidiaceae or
      Athyriaceae family), Sphaeropteris lepifera (Cyatheaceae family),
      Cyrtomium falcatum, and Cyrtomium fortunei (Aspidiaceae family)
      have also been used for preparation of the herbal medicines. These
      herbal medicines taste bitter and astringent, and are slightly
      toxic. Treatment dosage is typically 4-11 g per day.<br>
      <br>
      The sprout of Blechnum orientate has been used to treat swelling
      while the sprouts of <b>Sphaeropteris lepifera</b> (also known as
      (hereinafter "a.k.a.", Alsophila pustulosa) have been used to
      treat carbuncles. Blechnum orientate has also shown a strong
      inhibition effect against the influenza virus. Filmarone, filicin,
      aspidin, albaspidin, and filicic acid which are found in
      Dryopteris crassirhizoma have been characterized as having an
      anthelmintic effect. See H. Y. Hsu, Y. P. Chen, S. G. Hsu, J. S.

      crude drugs of common use in Japan for anti-HIV-1 activity and
      reported that the hot water extract of Prunella vulgaris (spike)
      showed a strong in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity with an IC100 of 16
      .mu.g/mL. See K. Yamasaki, T. Otake, H. Mori, M. Morimoto, N.
      Ueba, Y. Kurokawa, K. Shiota, &amp; T. Yuge, Yakugaku Zasshi,

      <br>
      Yao et al. report that the water extract of the dried entire plant
      of Prunella vulgaris was active in vitro in inhibiting HIV-1
      replication with relatively low cytotoxicity towards the MT-4
      cells. The extract was also active in reverse transcriptase
      inhibition. The active factor was purified and identified as
      anionic with a molecular weight of approximately 10,000 Dalton.
      This active component may be the same as the prunellin, as
      described below by Tabba et al. The purified extract inhibited
      HIV-1 replication in the lymphoid cell line MT-4, in the
      monocytoid cell line U937, and in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) at effective concentrations of 6, 30, and 12.5
      .mu.g/mL, respectively. Pretreatment of uninfected cells with the
      extract prior to viral exposure did not prevent HIV-1 infection.
      Preincubation of HIV-1 with the purified extract dramatically
      decreased infectiousness. The purified extract was also able to
      block cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1, prevented syncytium
      formation, and interfered with the ability of both HIV-1 and
      purified gp120 to bind to CD4. PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
      analysis confirmed the absence of HIV-1 proviral DNA in cells
      exposed to virus in the presence of the extract. The results
      suggested that the purified extract antagonized HIV-1 infection of
      susceptible cells by preventing viral attachment to the CD4
      receptor. See X. J. Yao, M. A. Wainberg, &amp; M. A. Pamiak,
      Virology, 187(1), 56-62 (1992).<br>
      <br>
      Tabba et al. isolated and partially characterized an anti-HIV
      component, prunellin, from aqueous extracts of <b>Prunella
        vulgaris</b>. Prunellin is a carbohydrate with an MIC (minimum
      inhibition concentration) of 2.2 .mu.g/mL against HIV-1 in vitro.
      It was identified as a partially sulfated polysaccharide with a
      molecular weight of about 10,000 Dalton. See H. D. Tabba, R. S.

      Zheng evaluated four hundred seventy two (472) traditional
      medicinal herbs for antiviral effect on type 1 herpes simplex
      virus (HSV1). Prunella vulgaris was one of the ten herbs found to
      be highly effective in vitro. Clinically, 78 cases of herpetic
      keratitis due to HSV1 were treated with Prunella vulgaris and
      Pyrrosia lingua eye drops. Among them, 38 cases were effectively
      cured, 37 cases showed an improvement, and 3 cases showed no
      benefit. See M. Zheng, J. Tradit. Chin. Med., 8(3), 203-206
      (1988).<br>
      <br>
      Triterpene 1 and Triterpene 2 which have been isolated from
      Prunella vulgaris have shown antiviral activity against HSV1.
      Triterpene 1 was identified as betulinic acid and triterpene 2 was
      identified as 2.alpha.,3.alpha.-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid.
      The EC50 was estimated to be 30 .mu.g/mL for triterpene 1 and 8
      .mu.g/mL for triterpene 2 by plaque reduction assay. See S. Y.

      primitive tribes of western Ghats in India. A decoction prepared
      from <b>Solanum nigrum plants, Glycosmis Mauritania seeds and/or
        Santalum album wood chips</b> was believed to have expectorant
      activity and has been used for coughs and to treat hemoptysis. See
      P. Pushpangadan and C. K. Atal, J. Ethnopharmacol., 11(1), 59-77
      (1984).<br>
      <br>
      The compound solasonine (found in the <b>whole herb, fruit, leaf,
        and fresh immature berries of Solanum nigrum</b>) has an
      anti-inflammatory effect similar to cortisone. Solasonine and
      solanine (also found in Solanum nigrum) possesses the ability of
      raising or lowering the blood sugar level in rats depending on the
      situation of the animals. Solasonine was also reported to have a
      stimulating effect on the heart, while solanine had a suppressive
      effect. When administered at small doses, solasonine enhances the
      stimulative process of the central nerve system in animals (i.e.,
      rat and rabbit). On the other hand, it enhances the suppressive
      process when administered at large doses. Solasonine can also
      lower the blood coagulability. See (1) H. Y. Hsu, Y. P. Chen, S.

      Additionally, Yamasaki et al. report that the hot water extract of
      <b>Lithospermum erythrorhizon (root)</b> showed a strong in vitro
      anti-HIV-1 activity with an IC100 of 16 .mu.g/mL. Yao et al.
      reported that the water extracts of the dried root of Arctium
      lappa and the dried aerial parts of Andrographis paniculata were
      anti-HIV-1 active in vitro and cytotoxic towards the MT-4 cells.
      Both extracts were also active in reverse transcriptase
      inhibition. See K. Yamasaki, T. Otake, H. Mori, M. Morimoto, N.
      Ueba, Y. Kurokawa, K. Shiota, &amp; T. Yuge, Yakugaku Zasshi,

      <br>
      <b>Glycyrrhizin </b>is reported to have an inhibitory effect on
      the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic activity of HIV. See M.
      Ito, et al, Antiviral Research, 7, 127-137 (1987). Glycyrrhizin is
      a saponin found in the herbal medicine <b>GLYCYRRHIZAE RADIX</b>.
      GLYCYRRHIZAE RADIX is prepared from the dried root of Glycyrrhiza
      uralensis, Glycyrrhiza glandulifera, Glycyrrhiza echinata, or
      Glycyrrhiza glabra all of which belong to the family Leguminosae.<br>
      <br>
      Chang and Yeung screened the boiling water extracts of twenty
      seven (27) medicinal herbs for anti-HIV activity. They found
      eleven (11) of the extracts were active in inhibiting HIV in the
      H9 cells. <b>Lonicera japonica, Prunella vulgaris, Woodwardia
        unigemmata, and Senecio scandens</b> were among those active
      ones with moderate activities. <b>Forsythia suspensa, Isatis
        tinctoria, and Polygonum cuspidatum </b>were among those tested
      which did not display activity in the anti-HIV assay. The anti-HIV
      active extract of Viola yedoensis was further tested and found to
      be fairly specific. The extract did not inactivate HIV
      extracellularly and did not inhibit the growth of herpes simplex,
      polio, or vesicular stomatitis viruses in human fibroblast
      culture. See R. S. Chang &amp; H. W. Yeung, Antiviral Research, 9,
      163-175 (1988).<br>
      <br>
      Antiviral agents have been isolated from <b>Syzygium aromaticum,
        Sapium sebiferum, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Scutellaria
        rivularis. Eugeniin </b>(a tannin) isolated from Syzygium
      aromaticum and methyl gallate isolated from Sapium sebiferum
      exhibited anti-herpes simplex virus activity in vitro. Plant
      flavonoids, such as 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone from the
      root of Scutellaria baicalensis and apigenin
      (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone) from the whole herb Scutellaria
      rivularis, were also reported to have anti-influenza virus
      activity. See (1) T. Hozumi, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,733

      Hozumi et al. disclose ninety one (91) herbal medicines which
      demonstrated antiviral activity. More specifically, fifty two (52)
      of them had antiherpesviral activity, sixty four (64) had
      antipolioviral activity, thirty seven (37) had anti-measles virus
      activity, twenty seven (27) had anti-varicella-zoster virus
      activity, twenty three (23) had anti-CMV activity, and twenty
      eight (28) had anti-DNA virus and anti-RNA virus activity. See T.
      Hozumi, T. Matsumoto, H. Ooyama, T. Namba, K. Shiraki, M. Hattori,
      M. Kurokawa, &amp; S. Kadota, U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,733, issued on
      May 2, 1995.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-DNA virus and anti-RNA virus activity of the twenty eight
      (28) herbal medicines disclosed in the '733 patent solely based
      upon their antiherpesviral, antipolioviral, anti-measles virus,
      and/or anti-varicella-zoster virus and anti-CMV activities.
      However, the extrapolation to cover both anti-DNA virus and
      anti-RNA virus activities is unfounded from the work conducted.<br>
      <br>
      The data of the present invention presented below evidenced little
      or no anti-HIV activity of the two herbal medicines at 2.5 and 0.5
      mg/mL derived from the <b>rhizome of Cyrtomium fortunei and the
        bark of Phellodendron amurense</b>. In contrast, the three (3)
      herbal medicines using the spike of Prunella vulgaris, the fruit
      of Forsythia suspensa, and the root and rhizome of Polygonum
      cuspidatum, will be shown to have a strong to moderate anti-HIV
      activity at 2.5 mg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      Herbal medicines<b> LONICERAE FLOS, BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET
        RADIX, and FORSYTHIAE FRUCTUS</b> have been used separately
      and/or in combination as antipyretic and detoxification agents
      along with other herbal medicines for treating acute hepatitis.
      The herbal medicines <b>BLECHNI RHIZOMA and POLYGONI CUSPIDATI
        RHIZOMA</b> have been used along with other herbal medicines in
      a formula for treating B hepatitis. The herbal medicines<b>
        SCUTELLARIAE BARBATAE HERBA and LIGUSTRI FRUCTUS</b> have
      occasionally been added to improve activity. Herbal medicine
      LIGUSTRI FRUCTUS was occasionally used along with other herbal
      medicines mainly as a tonic and HEDYOTIS was occasionally used
      along with other herbal medicines as a detoxification agent. The
      herbal medicine PRUNELLAE SPICA has also been used along with
      other herbal medicines to relief liver stress.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that in the practice of Chinese traditional medicine,
      herbal medicines were used to treat the symptoms of the patients,
      not the disease entity itself, and were therefore fairly
      nonspecific to a particular disease. Herbal medicines were used
      depending on the symptoms of the individual patient. The
      composition of herbal medicines would vary case by case and may
      even change for each individual patient during the course of the
      treatment according to each treatment result. It is therefore very
      difficult to have a universal herbal composition suitable for
      treating a specific disease within a population.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to the discovery of antiviral
      herb compositions, extracts thereof and the active chemical
      constituents. The antiviral herb compositions of this invention
      are derived from individual herbs, herb mixtures and commercially
      available Chinese herbal medicines. These novel herb compositions
      and their extracts and/or active principles have demonstrated
      activities against viral diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis
      C, HBV and HCV carriers, HIV infection and AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As used herein and in the claims, the following nomenclatures will
      be used to identify the four (4) herb mixtures known as HHT888-4,
      HHT888-5, HHT888-45 and HHT888-54. HHT888-4 is a mixture of five
      single-herb Chinese herbal medicines at a preferred ratio of
      No.4(1): No.4(2): No.4(3): No.4(4): No.4(5) of about 3:3:3:3:4
      (w/w). The weight ratio may vary up to 50% per component. By
      "variance of the weight ratio by 50%" means that each value of
      each component of the ratio may be increased or decreased by 50%.
      Thus, as an example, 1:1 can range from 1.5:0.5 to 0.5:1.5 (or 3:1
      to 1:3).<br>
      <br>
      HHT888-5 is a mixture of eleven (11) single-herb Chinese herbal
      medicines, No.5(1) to No.5(11) preferably at about equal
      proportions by weight. The weight ratio may vary up to 50% per
      component.<br>
      <br>
      HHT888-45 is a mixture of four (4) to six (6) single-herb Chinese
      herbal medicines at a ratio of No.4(3): No.4(4): No.5(4): No.5(5):
      No.5(8): No.4(2) at a preferred ratio of about 1:1:1:1:0-1:0-1
      (w/w). The weight ratio may vary up to 50% for each component.<br>
      <br>
      HHT888-54 is a mixture No.5(5) and at least one single herb
      medicine selected from No. 4(2), No. 4(3), No. 4(4), No. 4(5), No.
      5(1), No. 5(2), No. 5(4), No. 5(7), No. 5(8) and No. 5(11) wherein
      the weight ratio of No. 5(5) to each of the other single herb
      medicines is 1:1. Thus, HHT888-54 consists of No. 5(5) plus No.
      4(3), No. 4(4) and No. 5(8); the most preferred weight ratio is
      1:1:1:1.<br>
      <br>
      More generally, the weight ratio of No. 5(5) to the sum of the
      other single herb medicines is from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>

      The present invention in its broadest aspect relates to the use of
      the described herbal medicines and various mixtures thereof to
      prevent and treat viral infections. More specifically, the viral
      infections are those caused by HBV, HCV and HIV. The antiviral
      mixtures according to the invention have been described above as
      HHT888-4, HHT888-5, HHT888-45 and HHT888-54. In addition, the
      single herb agents designated No. 4(2), No. 4(5), No. 5(5), No.
      5(7), No. 5(8) and No. 5(11) have been shown to have antiviral
      activity. These single herb agents have not been shown by the
      prior art to have antiviral activity.<br>
      <br>
      A more specific aspect of the present invention resides in the
      discovery that HHT888-5 is efficacious in reducing hepatitis B
      viruses in HBV carriers. An additional aspect of the invention
      resides in the discovery that HHT888-45 is efficacious in treating
      hepatitis C patients and returning their liver function to normal.<br>
      <br>
      The herb mixtures HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 and their aqueous extracts
      have both been shown by the inventors herein to also have
      antiretroviral activities against MuLV and HIV in vitro. In
      addition, eleven (11) of the fifteen (15) single-herb components
      of HHT888-4 and HHT888-5, i.e., No.4(2), No.4(3), No.4(4),
      No.4(5), No.5(1), No.5(2), No.5(4), No.5(5), No.5(7), No.5(8), and
      No.5(11) have shown anti-HIV activities by effectively suppressing
      viral proliferation in HIV infected human peripheral blood
      lymphocytes (PBLs).<br>
      <br>
      There is further disclosed as a composition of matters, the herb
      mixtures HHT888-4, HHT888-5, HHT888-45 and HHT888-54. As described
      above, HHT888-54 is No.5(5) or its extract or active principle and
      at least one single-herb herbal medicine or its extract or active
      principle selected from the group consisting of No.4(2), No.4(3),
      No.4(4), No.4(5), No.5(1), No.5(2), No.5(4), No.5(7), No.5(8), and
      No.5(11). These compositions of matter have not been described
      before and are unobvious.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The dosage of the compositions of the invention can range from 0.4
      to 120 g per day for the mammal in need of therapy. One skilled in
      the art will appreciate that depending upon the weight of the
      individual and the progression of the viral infection, that higher
      doses of the compositions will be required. As the compositions
      according to the invention have demonstrated virtually no side
      effects, high doses may be initiated with reduction of dosage upon
      manifestation (i.e., reduction of viral load) of therapeutic
      effect. One skilled in the art can tailor each dosage rate for a
      given individual without undue experimentation. More specifically,
      the dosages for a given composition can range from 0.4 to 25 g per
      day. Preferably, the compositions are administered at least three
      (3) times per day however, bolus administration will be effective.
      More specifically, oral dosages of 5.5 g three (3) times a day
      (total 16.5 g per day) of the herb mixture HHT888-5 have been
      found to be effective to reduce HBV load in carriers. Oral dosages
      of 2.7-5.7 g three times a day (total 8-17 g per day) of the herb
      mixture HHT888-45 have been found to be effective to return normal
      liver function to hepatitis C patients. Dosages as high as 121 g
      per day for HHT888-5 and 63 g per day for HHT888-45 have not
      evidenced serious side effects. It will be appreciated that the
      dosages recited herein are for the herbal medicine (extract
      deposited on ground plant) in dry form. Further, extracts of the
      inventive compositions will increase the concentration of the
      actives and therefore reductions in the dosage levels will be
      realized. Dosages as low as 10% of those recited herein for the
      inventive compositions are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred dosage for No. 5(5) to treat HCV infection is from
      0.4 to 17 g per day.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention are preferably administered
      enterally, however, intravenous (i.v.) and/or intramuscular (i.m.)
      administration is also contemplated herein. Those skilled in the
      art will understand how i.v. and i.m. formulations can be prepared
      and how the effective dosages can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In the method according to this invention a mammal may be a human
      or animal. The human may be an adult, child or infant. Thus, for
      infants, an infant formula containing the hereinafter described
      plant extracts or active principles will be effective in treating
      the infants infected with HBV, HCV, or HIV. For children and
      adults, a medical food or nutritional product, such as milks and
      yogurts, containing the plant extracts or active principles
      described herein will also be effective in treating humans
      infected with HBV, HCV, or HIV.<br>
      <br>
      The herbs used as starting materials for this invention may be
      obtained from commercial sources as single-herb herbal medicines
      which may be mixed, or extracted and concentrated, and placed in
      compositions for the administration to a human. The plant
      extracts, once isolated from the plant material, may be
      concentrated and then placed in compositions for the
      administration to a human. The active principles, once isolated
      from the plant material or herbal medicine, may be concentrated
      and then placed in compositions for the administration to a human.
      The compositions of this invention may take a variety of forms
      such as capsules, tablets, powder, candies, gels, beverages, teas,
      nutritional products, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Also disclosed is a medicinal product produced by the process
      comprising the steps of: (a) contacting comminuted plant material
      selected from the group consisting of No.5(1) to No.5(11), No.4(2)
      to No.4(5), and mixtures thereof, with water to form an aqueous
      dispersion; (b) heating the aqueous dispersion to about 100 DEG C.
      and holding at that temperature for about 0.5 to about 3 hours;
      (c) separating the insoluble plant material from the aqueous
      phase; and (d) concentrating the solute contained in the aqueous
      phase. The concentrated solute may be obtained through freeze
      drying, spray drying, evaporation and ultrafiltration.<br>
      <br>
      As described in more detail in the following examples, the herbal
      compositions of the invention contain components that are active
      against viruses in vitro and in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      Most impressively, the clinical effects of HHT888-5 on hepatitis B
      virus carriers are shown in Table 1 while the clinical effects of
      HHT888-45 on type C hepatitis patients are shown in Table 6.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the herb mixtures, individual
      single-herb herbal medicines, their water extracts and/or active
      principles are incorporated into oral dosage forms such as
      capsules, tablets, teas, powders, candies, candy bars, beverages,
      nutritional products, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      This application sets forth the data available on the present
      discoveries and fully describes the compositions of matter, their
      preparation, and clinical applications. These and other aspects of
      the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as
      a result of the following examples which are intended as
      illustrative of the invention and not limitative.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      To acquaint persons skilled in the art with the principles of the
      invention, the following Examples are submitted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Herb Mixtures</b><br>
      <br>
      In the preparation of the herbal compositions according to the
      invention, Chinese herbal medicines in single herb format were
      obtained from commercial sources in powder form. The individual
      single-herb herbal medicines were mixed in the appropriate
      proportions to prepare each herb mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The herb mixture HHT888-4 was prepared by mixing five (5)
      single-herb herbal medicines No.4(1), No.4(2), No.4(3), No.4(4),
      and No.4(5) at a ratio of 3:3:3:3:4 by weight. The herb mixture
      HHT888-5 was prepared by mixing equal weights of eleven (11)
      single-herb herbal medicines No.5(1), No.5(2), No.5(3), No.5(4),
      No.5(5), No.5(6), No.5(7), No.5(8), No.5(9), No.5(10), and
      No.5(11).<br>
      <br>
      The herb mixture HHT888-45 was prepared by mixing four (4) to six
      (6) single-herb herbal medicines No.4(3), No.4(4), No.5(4),
      No.5(5), No.5(8), and No.4(2) at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:0-1:0-1 by
      weight. The single-herb herbal medicine No.5(8) or No.4(2), or
      both, were not used in some cases in HHT888-45 for initial
      administrations. One of the two single-herb herbal medicines or
      both were added later when needed to enhance the therapy. The
      weight ratio of the single-herb herbal medicine No.4(2) in the
      herb mixture HHT888-45 also varied case-by-case between 0.5 and 1
      when used.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that a mixture of decoctions prepared individually
      from the source plants of the single-herb herbal medicines or a
      decoction prepared from the pre-mixed source plants of the
      single-herb components of each herb mixture is well within the
      specification of the herb mixture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Single-herb Herbal Medicines</b><br>
      <br>
      The single-herb herbal medicine used to prepare the herb mixtures
      has been described in the Prior Art section of this application.
      The plant source from which each single-herb herbal medicine is
      obtained was also listed in the Prior Art section. More than one
      species or genus of medicinal plant may be used to prepare the
      same herbal medicine as indicated in the plant source list of that
      herbal medicine. For example, the herbal medicine No.5(8) or
      FORSYTHIAE FRUCTUS may be prepared from either one of the three
      (3) species of Forsythia genus plants, i.e., Forsythia suspensa,
      Forsythia viridissima, Forsythia koreana or mixtures thereof. The
      herbal medicine No.5(6) or BAPHICACANTHIS RHIZOMA ET RADIX may be
      prepared from one of the five (5) plants of different genus and
      species, i.e., Baphicacanthes cusia, Strobilanthes cusia, Isatis
      tinctoria, Isatis indigotica, Polygonum tinctorium or mixtures
      thereof The herbal medicines were prepared from their respective
      plant sources as follows.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable part or parts or the whole herb of a medicinal plant
      was obtained, washed with cold water, dried and comminuted. The
      plant materials were then extracted with boiling water on a basis
      of 1 part by weight of plant material to approximately 5 to 10
      parts by weight of water. The amount of water used should at least
      cover the plant material in the extraction vessel. Samples were
      boiled for 0.5 to one hour, but not in excess of 3 hours, in order
      to allow effective extraction of the desired components. Shorter
      or longer heating would not substantially affect the extraction,
      except the yield and cost. The aqueous solution was separated from
      the plant material by filtration.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous solution may be freeze dried or spray dried, or
      reduced in volume by heating with or without an applied vacuum.
      The concentrate may then be spray dried or freeze dried or
      absorbed by powdered material of the same plant material or starch
      and thus the single-herb herbal medicine is prepared in powdered
      form.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that a decoction prepared from a source plant of the
      single-herb herbal medicine is well within the specification. A
      decoction is the aqueous solution of the plant material prepared
      by boiling the plant material in water as described above for
      about 0.5 to one hour. The decoction may be directly consumed
      after it is prepared and cooled to warm or ambient temperatures or
      preserved with proper sterilization for later consumption.
      Sterilization may be accomplished by microfiltration or heat.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Treatment of Hepatitis B Virus Carriers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Twenty-nine (29) HBV carriers with normal levels of serum liver
      enzymes, glutamine oxalacetate transferase (SGOT) and glutamine
      pyruvate transferase (SGPT), were treated with HHT888-5. Several
      HBV carriers who had elevated SGOT and SGPT levels were first
      treated with other remedies which returned their serum liver
      enzymes to normal levels (8-40 unit/mL for SGOT and 5-35 unit/mL
      for SGPT) but failed to reduce the HBV load. Treatment with
      HHT888-5 then began. HHT888-5 was prepared as described in Example
      1 by mixing eleven (11) single-herb herbal medicines which were
      obtained from a commercial source and were manufactured following
      good manufacture practice (GMP) guidelines. Consent of the
      patients was obtained before their treatment began.<br>
      <br>
      Patients were instructed to take the HHT888-5 three (3) times a
      day. Each dose was 5.5 g. Each 5.5 g packet of the herb mixture
      was mixed with warm water and consumed orally. Serum hepatitis B
      surface antigen (HBsAg) titers of each patient were determined at
      intervals as shown in Table 1 to monitor the progress of the
      treatment. Serum HBsAg titer was determined using a
      reverse-passive hemagglutination test as described herein: (1)
      Instruction of "Taifu" Serodia-HBs Test Reagent for HBsAg
      Detection, Taifu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Taoyuan, Taiwan,
      R.O.C.; (2) D. S. Chen &amp; J. L. Sung, J. Formosan Med. Assoc.,
      77, 263-270 (1978); and (3) T. Juji &amp; T. Yokochi, Japan. J.
      Exp. Med., 39, 615-620 (1969).<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 shows the treatment results of the twenty-nine (29) HBV
      carriers. Individual patients showed progressive improvement in
      their disease state over the course of treatment, as indicated by
      their HBsAg titer reductions and well being. Fourteen (14)
      carriers (48%) whose HBsAg titers ranged from 20 to 81,920 were
      significantly lowered (four (4) to 256-fold reductions, or from
      positive to negative) after 35 to 964 days of treatment. Four (4)
      carriers (14%) reduced their HBsAg titers from 20, 40, and 2,560
      to negative (i.e., below 20 ng/mL detection level) after 56-153
      days of treatment. Fourteen (14) carriers (48%) had no significant
      change (two-fold titer decrease or increase or no change) in HBsAg
      titers. That means these carriers had static HBsAg titers during
      the course of the treatment (63-284 days). One carrier (3%) had a
      slightly four-fold titer increase.<br>
      <br>
      The above HHT888-5 treatment results compare very favorably with
      the current interferon therapy. The response rates for interferon
      therapy and HHT888-5 treatment to lower the HBsAg titers in
      patients infected with HBV were comparable, approximately 40% vs.
      48%. The serum HBsAg clearance rates were also comparable for
      both, 10-15% for interferon therapy and approximately 14% for
      HHT888-5 treatment. Furthermore, the interferon therapy is
      administered intramuscularly or intravenously and with frequent
      adverse effects. The HHT888-5 treatment is administered orally
      (like drinking a tea) and no apparent side effects were observed
      in all patients treated. Oral administration is a much more
      convenient and better way than intramuscular or intravenous
      administration. HHT888-5 can thus be safely and conveniently
      consumed even on a long-term basis to reduce or control HBV
      proliferation in HBV carriers and hepatitis B patients.<br>

      When the HBV viral load in an HBV carrier can be reduced or
      maintained at a sufficiently low level, the carrier is less likely
      to progress to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and
      death. Thus, HHT888-5 may be used to prevent and treat hepatitis
      B, or even prevent liver cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      Since HHT888-5 was administered in the above treatments by mixing
      the powder in water first and then consumed orally, the water
      extract of HHT888-5 or a decoction from the herbal mixture
      comprising the single-herb components or plants of HHT888-5 is
      expected to be also effective and safe. Isolation of the active
      components of HHT888-5 and its administration to humans would also
      be efficacious in the treatment of HBV.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that HHT888-5 may be administered "as is" or in other
      solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, tea bags, candies,
      etc. The powdered herb mixture is typically mixed with warm or
      cold water and consumed orally. Its extracts may be administered
      as capsules, tablets, teas, candies, beverages, nutritional
      products, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Dosages range from 1 to 5 treatments per day at about 1 to 120 g
      per dosage depending upon the form and concentration of the herbal
      medicine. The effective minimum dose of a composition as a dried
      water extract of HHT888-5 is 1 g per day. The effective minimum
      dose of a composition comprising a more purified active component
      or components would be lower. The water extract of the tested
      HHT888-5 constituted 19% of the herb mixture by weight. Dosages of
      the herb mixture HHT888-5 as high as 120 g per day have been
      accomplished without serious side effects.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Antiretroviral Testing of Herb Mixtures and their Water
        Extracts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two herb mixtures, HHT888-4 and HHT888-5, were tested for their
      antiretroviral activities and found to be active against EMuLV and
      HIV in the in vitro assay. Two in-vitro assays, anti-Ecotropic
      Murine Leukemia Virus (anti-EMuLV) and anti-HIV, were used to test
      the antiretroviral activities of the inventive compositions.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-EMuLV assay uses a large, enveloped, RNA-containing
      retrovirus, EMuLV, which belongs to the same virus family as HIV
      and has many characteristics that are similar to HIV.<br>
      <br>
      1. Anti-Ecotropic Murine Leukemia Virus Assay<br>
      <br>
      The assay contained two parts, cytotoxicity test and virus
      suppression test. See QBI Protocol 39014 Final Report and QBI
      Protocol 39016 Final Report, Quality Biotech, Camden, N.J., USA,
      1992. Each sample was initially tested for its cytotoxicity to the
      SC-1 indicator cells which were used for titration of infectious
      EMuLV in a XC plague assay. See QBI protocol C30015, Quality
      Biotech, Camden, N.J., USA. Each sample was dispersed in a virus
      resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mM KCL, 0.1 mM EDTA)
      without the virus. The solution was then subjected to the XC
      plague assay under the same conditions as those for the
      determination of EMuLV titer. A sample was considered cytotoxic if
      the indicator cells for the assay were less than 50% confluent. A
      noncytotoxic sample concentration was chosen for the virus
      suppression test.<br>
      <br>
      In the virus suppression test, each sample was incubated with
      EMuLV (strain AKV623, titer 2.2-4.2.times.10@5 PFU/mL) in a virus
      resuspension buffer at 23-25 mg/mL (e.g., 100 mg/4.0 mL) for 12-32
      minutes. The treated virus suspension was pH adjusted, if
      necessary, to within 6.8-7.2 and then tested for its titer in the
      XC plague assay.<br>
      <br>
      An aliquot (1.5 mL) was diluted in the cell culture medium to the
      endpoint (10@0, 10@-1, 10@-2, 10@-3, 10@-4, 10@-5, 10@-6, 10@-7,
      and 10@-8 dilutions, or as appropriate). Each dilution was
      vortexed to resuspend any particulates if present and assayed in
      duplicate for infectious viral particles by the XC plaque assay. A
      positive control (virus suspension without treatment) and a
      negative control (cell culture medium, no virus) were also
      analyzed concurrently to validate the assay.<br>
      <br>
      Anti-EMuLV activity of the sample was expressed in log10 reduction
      of the EMuLV titer when compared to the positive control. A sample
      with log10 to titer reduction greater than 0.5 is considered to be
      active.<br>
      <br>
      HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 were initially tested "as is" and exhibited
      good antiviral activities (1.0 to 1.4 log10 reduction in viral
      titer) at 25 mg/mL and 12 minutes of incubation with the virus at
      room temperature. They were then tested again with a longer
      incubation time (32 minutes) with the virus at the same
      concentration. Each sample was also tested for its soluble and
      insoluble fractions in the above virus resuspension buffer to see
      if any active component was water soluble. The soluble portion was
      separated from the insoluble one by centrifuge at room temperature
      and 10,000x g for 10 minutes. The soluble fraction was divided
      into two aliquots, one 0.45-.mu.m filtered and one unfiltered, and
      tested to see if residual particulates have any effect on the
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 summarizes the anti-EMuLV activity test results. The
      results confirmed that both HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 and their
      soluble and insoluble fractions have anti-EMuLV activities. The
      samples caused 1.0 to 2.6 log10 reduction in viral titer when they
      were incubated with the virus at 23-25 mg/mL for 32 minutes.
      Microfiltration did not significantly affect the activity of
      either soluble fraction.<br>
      <br>
      2. Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Assay<br>
      <br>
      This assay also contained two parts, a toxicity test and a HIV
      suppression test. The sample was mixed in a cell culture medium,
      e.g., 50 mg in 1.00 mL. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged
      to separate the soluble from the insoluble. The supernate was
      filtered through a 0.45-.mu.m filter and then diluted with cell
      culture medium to appropriate concentrations for the assay. The
      cell culture medium used in the assay was RPMI 1640 (pH 7.3.±.0.3)
      supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamin, 50 U/mL
      penicillin and 50 .mu.g/mL streptomycin.<br>
      <br>
      The sample was tested for its cytotoxicity and/or cytostatic
      activity towards the target cells, human peripheral blood
      lymphocytes (PBLs). A lymphocyte proliferation assay was used for
      the toxicity test, where a 100 .mu.L sample was incubated with 100
      .mu.L of a cell suspension of uninfected PBLs (3.times.10@5 cells)
      under the same conditions as the HIV suppression test. Lymphocyte
      proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay<br>

      virus, since the samples were not sterile filtered before assay.<br>
      ****Incubation time 32 minutes, at 25 mg/mL test level for the "as
      is" unfractionated samples. For soluble, soluble &amp; sterile
      filtered, and insoluble fractions, the test level was equivalent

      <br>
      (MTT-Test). See T. Mosmann, J. Immunological Methods, 65, 55-63
      (1983). A sample concentration which results in .gtoreq.70% of the
      control in Iymphocyte proliferation is considered to be acceptable
      for the HIV suppression test.<br>
      <br>
      In the HIV suppression test, HIV-1 infected PBLs were cultivated
      in the presence of the sample for four (4) days as in the toxicity
      test. See H. Ruebsamen-Waigmann, et al., J. Med. Virology, 19,
      335-344 (1986). The secreted viral core protein p24 and/or viral
      RNA were determined as indicators for virus proliferation status
      on day 3 and day 4 by an HIV-1 p24 capture ELISA technique and an
      HIV-RNA dot blot hybridization technique, respectively. The
      concentration of p24 synthesized by the HIV infected cells was
      determined by Sandwich ELISA. A standard preparation of
      recombinant p24 (MicroGeneSys, USA) was used for calibration of
      the ELISA. See Ch. Mueller, et al., Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem., 330,
      352-353 (1988).<br>
      <br>
      HIV-RNA synthesized in the infected cells was determined by a
      nucleic acid hybridization technique. Cellular RNA was prepared
      from the infected cells and analyzed by a dot blot hybridization
      technique. The hybridization solution contained the P@32 -labeled
      DNA probe which comprised a 5.5 kilobase DNA fragment of the HIV
      isolate D31. See H. v. Briesen, et al., J. Med. Virology, 23,
      51-66 (1987). This fragment covering the gag/pol region of the
      virus is labeled with P@32 alpha-d CTP by oligonucleotide
      labeling. Plus-strand RNA transcripts derived from the gag/pol
      region of the viral isolate D31 were used as the external standard
      for the hybridization. These "run-off" transcripts were generated
      by means of the T7 polymerase reaction from negatively polarized
      HIV-DNA under T7-promotor control. The concentration of RNA
      transcripts was determined spectrophotometrically. The hybridized
      probe was detected by autoradiography and the processed
      autoradiograms were evaluated densitometrically.<br>
      <br>
      A positive control, a negative control, and an AZT control were
      conducted concurrently to assure the validity of the HIV
      suppression test. All tests were performed in triplicates, and
      96-well round bottom microtiter plates were used for all assays. A
      positive control was HIV-1 infected lymphocytes cultivated in the
      presence of the cell culture medium without the sample. A negative
      control was lymphocytes infected with a heat-inactivated virus
      inoculum incapable of replication. These "mockinfected"
      lymphocytes were cultivated and assayed in the same way as the
      infected cells. The amount of viral protein being present in the
      cultures solely due to the remaining inoculum was thus determined
      as the background level. The amount of viral protein p24 in the
      test sample and in the positive control due to viral replication
      was then determined by the respective p24 levels less the
      background level.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of viral protein being present in the cultures
      containing the sample due to viral proliferation was compared with
      that in the positive control, i.e., the culture without the
      sample. The % suppression of HIV proliferation was determined by
      the difference in p24 levels between the positive control and the
      sample, divided by the p24 level of the positive control, and
      timed 100%.<br>
      <br>
      The AZT control was conducted via HIV-1 infected lymphocytes that
      were cultivated in the presence of azidothymidine (AZT) at
      concentrations of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. This
      provided an estimate of the sensitivity of the lymphocytes towards
      AZT, a known inhibitor of HIV-1 replication. The suppression of
      HIV-1 proliferation caused by AZT in a concentration of 10 ng/mL
      should be greater than 50% as compared to the untreated positive
      control.<br>

      <br>
      Table 3 summarizes the cytotoxicity and the HIV suppression test
      results of HHT888-4 and HHT888-5, as well as the AZT controls.
      Both herb mixtures were active in suppressing HIV proliferation in
      infected human lymphocytes at 2.5-5.0 mg/mL, but not at 50
      .mu.g/mL (50-100 times diluted). The AZT controls from all sets of
      anti-HIV assays herein and thereinafter exhibited the expected
      activities and thus assured the validity of the tests.<br>
      <br>
      At 2.5-5.0 mg/mL of HHT888-4 and HHT888-5, HIV proliferation in
      infected human lymphocytes were essentially completely suppressed:
      97-100% suppression based on viral protein p24 and 99-100%
      suppression based on viral RNA determined on both day 3 and day 4
      after treatment. The anti-HIV activity at 50 .mu.g/mL was
      negligible, 0-12% suppression for both herb mixtures. The
      activities could not be attributed to insoluble particulates since
      they were filtered out by a 0.45-.mu.m filter before the assay.
      The activities were not due to cytotoxicity. Repeat tests on three
      lots of HHT888-4 showed 100% suppression at 2.5 mg/mL on both day
      3 and day 4 with acceptable cytotoxicity (71-100% of control
      proliferation). Repeat tests on three lots of HHT888-5 at 2.5
      mg/mL showed 93-98% suppression on day 3 and 89-99% suppression on
      day 4 with acceptable cytotoxicity (85-91% of control
      proliferation). Results of the repeat experiments are shown in
      Table 4.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that Lot 3 of HHT888-4 or HHT888-5 was prepared by
      mixing the respective single-herb components at equal proportion
      by weight. Lot 3 of HHT888-5 was composed of nine (9) single-herb
      components, excluding No.5(10) and No.5(11).<br>
      <br>
      Water extracts of HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 from one to two lots were
      further tested to see whether the active components were
      extractable by water. Water extracts of HHT888-4 and 5 were
      prepared by extracting 5 g of the powder with 25 mL of MilliQ
      purified water twice. Each water suspension was vortexed for 1
      minute, stood for 5 minutes, and vortexed again for 1 minute to
      facilitate the extraction. The extract was separated from the
      insoluble by centrifuge at 1,000-2,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The
      supernate was transferred into a clean preweighed 50-mL centrifuge
      tube, freeze dried, weighed, and tested for anti-HIV activity.<br>
      <br>
      The percent weight of material extracted was 17.3% for the first
      25 mL extract and 10.8% for the second 25 mL extract of HHT888-4
      (Lot 2). That was 14.2% for the first 25 mL extract and 4.6% for
      the second 25 mL extract of HHT888-5 (Lot 2). The first (E1), the
      second (E2) and the combined (E) extracts of HHT888-4 (Lot 2) were
      tested for anti-HIV activity. All the other extracts were tested
      with the first and the second extracts combined. The results are
      summarized also in Table 4.<br>

      suppression of the viral proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      The water extract of HHT888-4 showed very good activity: 93-100%
      suppression at 0.5-1.0 mg/mL. The first (E1) and the second water
      extract (E2) of Lot 2 exhibited comparable activities: 100%
      suppression on day 3 and 87-96% suppression on day 4 at 1.0 mg/mL.
      The IC50 of the water extract of HHT888-4 was between 0.1-0.5
      mg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      The water extract of HHT888-5 (lot 2) exhibited a substantially
      lower activity: 71% suppression on day 3 which dropped to 26%
      suppression on day 4 at 1.0 mg/mL. The main active component
      apparently stayed behind in the insoluble fraction and was not as
      easily extracted by water as that of HHT888-4 under the
      aforementioned conditions. It is noted that the water extract of
      HHT888-5 (Lot 2) constituted 19% by weight of the herb mixture.
      The test concentration of the water extract of HHT888-5 (or
      HHT888-5-E) at 1.0 mg/mL is equivalent to 5.3 mg/mL of HHT888-5
      itself. HHT888-5 was tested very active at both 2.5 mg/mL (93-98%
      suppression on day 3 and 89-99% on day 4) and 5.0 mg/mL (100%
      suppression on day 3 and 97% on day 4).<br>
      <br>
      The above results clearly demonstrated that both HHT888-4 and
      HHT888-5 and their water extracts have in vitro antiretroviral
      activities, more specifically anti-EMuLV and anti-HIV activities.
      HHT888-5 has also been shown to be efficacious in treating
      hepatitis B virus carriers, while HHT888-4 has not been tested in
      vivo.<br>

      <br>
      All five (5) single-herb components of HHT888-4 exhibited anti-HIV
      activities with various degrees: 73-100% suppression on day 3 and
      50-100% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. No. 4(3) and No. 4(4)
      exhibited the best activity: 100% suppression at 2.5 mg/mL on both
      day 3 and day 4. No. 4(2) and No. 4(5) were the next: 92-98%
      suppression on day 3 and 92-94% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL.
      No.4(1) exhibited a moderate activity: 73% suppression on day 3
      and 50% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. No.4(5) exhibited a
      slight cytotoxicity (41-79% of control proliferation) which was
      likely to contribute to the observed activity with an ID50 between
      0.5 and 2.5 mg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      Three (3) of the eleven (11) single-herb components of HHT888-5:
      No.5(4), No.5(5), and No.5(8) exhibited very good activities,
      93-100% suppression of HIV proliferation on both day 3 and day 4
      at 2.5 mg/mL. No.5(11) was the next: 92% suppression on day 3 and
      74% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. Again, No.5(1), which was
      the same as No.4(1), had a moderate activity: 73% suppression on
      day 3 and 50% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. No.5(2) and
      No.5(7) exhibited only marginal activities: 18-50% suppression on
      day 3 and 29-38% suppression on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. No.5(10)
      exhibited a very slight activity: 65% suppression on day 3 which
      dropped to 0% on day 4 at 2.5 mg/mL. The remaining three (3)
      single-herb components, No.5(3), No.5(6), and No.5(9) exhibited no
      activity at 0.5-2.5 mg/mL. No.5(9) was not tested at 2.5 mg/mL
      level because of its cytotoxicity: already 24-78% of control
      proliferation at 0.5 mg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      Although No.5(4) and No.5(8) appeared to be slightly more active
      than No.5(5) (100% vs. 93% suppression at 2.5 mg/mL), their
      activities might be partially due to cytotoxicity (32-64% of
      control proliferation at 2.5 mg/mL). This was supported by the
      loss of activity (0% suppression) when tested at lower levels,
      0.5-1.0 mg/mL, where the cytotoxicity was lower and more
      acceptable to the assay.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><br>
      <br>
      Anti-HIV Testing of Medicinal Plant<br>
      <br>
      The source plant of the single-herb herbal medicine No.5(5),
      Aeginetia indica, was obtained from a local herbal store in Taiwan
      and tested for its anti-HIV activity. This was to see whether the
      activity can be reproduced in the herbal medicine prepared
      directly from its source plant, instead of being obtained from the
      commercial source.<br>
      <br>
      The whole plant was washed with cold water, dried, comminuted, and
      extracted with boiling water as described above in Example 2. The
      aqueous solution was separated from the plant material by
      filtration. The aqueous solution was then reduced in volume by
      heating. The concentrate was spray dried and absorbed onto
      powdered material of the same plant material and thus was prepared
      the herbal medicine in powder form, designated hereinafter as raw
      No.5(5).<br>
      <br>
      The powdered herbal medicine prepared from Aeginetia indica, or
      raw No.5(5), was extracted with water at ambient temperature. Two
      (2) 5.00 g samples were each extracted twice with about 40 mL of
      water each time in a separate 50-mL plastic centrifuge tube by
      vortexing for one (1) minute, standing for ten (10) minutes, and
      vortexing again for one (1) minute. The tubes were centrifuged at
      1500 rpm for twenty (20) minutes to separate the extracts from the
      insoluble residues. The extracts were filtered through a Whatman
      No.4 filter paper, freeze dried or nitrogen dried, and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      The above extraction of the raw No.5(5) with water (pH.about.5.1)
      was repeated and the pH of the first extract was measured to be
      5.7. The first and the second extracts were respectively separated
      from the residue, air dried, and weighed. The percent weight of
      the extractable was determined to be 18.7.±.2.8% (n=2).<br>
      <br>
      The first water extract of the raw No.5(5) was tested for anti-HIV
      activity and found to be as active, 91% suppression on day 3 and
      97% suppression on day 4 at 1.0 mg/mL. Cytotoxicity test showed
      that the extract was not cytotoxic at this level, 99% of control
      proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      The above examples clearly demonstrate that both the herb mixtures
      HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 are very active against HIV proliferation.
      Complete (100%) or nearly complete (89-99%) suppressions of HIV
      proliferation were achieved at 2.5 mg/mL. The water extract of
      HHT888-4 is also very active. Complete (100%) suppression of HIV
      proliferation was achieved at 0.5 mg/mL. The water extract of
      HHT888-5 is not as active as its original mixture. It only
      suppressed 26-71% of HIV proliferation at 1.0 mg/mL. Both HHT888-4
      and HHT888-5 are not cytotoxic at 2.5 mg/mL. The water extracts of
      both HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 are also not cytotoxic at 1.0 mg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      HHT888-5 has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in
      treating HBV infections in humans. That means, the active
      principle or principles of HHT888-5 must be bioavailable in humans
      through oral administration to cause the decrease of hepatitis B
      virus in those patients treated, as indicated by the decrease of
      their hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) exhibited in
      Example 3. In addition, Hozumi et al. provide examples in U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,411,733 to support the belief that substances
      exhibiting antiviral activity in vitro also possess antiviral
      activity in vivo as described in the Prior Art section. It is
      therefore logical to believe that HHT888-4 or HHT888-5 and their
      water extracts or active principles should also be effective for
      treating HIV infections in humans.<br>
      <br>
      To test the belief, six (6) of the most anti-HIV active
      single-herb components of HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 were selected to
      treat hepatitis C patients caused by hepatitis C virus infections.
      The logic is that both HCV and HIV are retroviruses. Viral
      hepatitis C tends to become a chronic disease and is therefore
      more suitable for the test of the treatment. If the treatment
      works for patients infected with HCV, it will also work for
      patients infected with HIV. Example 7 clearly demonstrates the
      validity of this belief.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Treatment of Hepatitis C Patients</b><br>
      <br>
      Six (6) of the most anti-HIV active single-herb components of
      HHT888-4 and HHT888-5 were selected and mixed to treat hepatitis C
      patients caused by hepatitis C virus infections. The six (6)
      single-herb herbal medicines selected were No.4(2), No.4(3),
      No.4(4), No.5(4), No.5(5), and No.5(8). No.4(5) was not included
      although it exhibited a very good activity because it was learned
      that the herb might have a certain unconfirmed toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      The six (6) single-herb herbal medicines were obtained from a
      commercial source and were manufactured following good manufacture
      practice (GMP) guidelines. They were mixed according to the
      desired ratio in various combinations and thus the herb mixture
      HHT888-45 was prepared as further described in Example 1.
      Patients' consents were obtained before the initiation of
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Patients were instructed to take the herb mixture three (3) times
      a day, 2.7-5.7 g each time. Unit dosages of the herb mixture
      HHT888-45 were prepared in individual packets. Each unit dose
      packet (2.7-5.7 g) of the herb mixture was mixed with warm water
      and taken orally. All patients were treated with HHT888-45
      containing No.4(3), No.4(4), No.5(4), and No.5(5). No.5(8) or
      No.4(2) or both were added in HHT888-45 for the treatment of some
      patients at the very beginning or during the course of the
      treatment to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. During
      the course of the treatment, the daily dose of No.4(3), No.4(4),
      No.5(4), and No.5(5) varied from two (2) to three (3) g each. The
      daily dose of No.5(8) also varied from two (2) to three (3) g when
      used. The daily dose of No.4(2) varied from 1.5 to two g when
      used. The dose was varied according to the progress of the
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      Seven (7) viral hepatitis C patients were treated. Their serum
      liver enzymes, SGOT and SGPT, were determined from time to time by
      a local clinical laboratory during the course of the treatment to
      monitor the progress of the disease. The SGOT and SGPT were
      determined using an enzyme assay. See (1) Instruction of Kyokuto
      TA-E Transaminase Assay Reagents, Permit No. (62AM)0885, Kyokuto
      Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, 1994; (2)
      Instruction of Yatrozyme TA-Lq Transaminase-assay Reagent Solution
      (Enzyme Assay), Commodity No. 817245 (RM163-K), Yatron Co., Ltd.,
      Diayatron Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; and (3) U. Lippi &amp; G Guidi,
      Clin. Chim. Acta., 28, 431-437 (1970).<br>
      <br>
      The levels of serum GOT and GPT closely correlate with the degree
      of cellular injury in the liver. These tests are widely used in
      the diagnosis of liver diseases and as an indicator of the liver
      function. The normal range for SGOT is 8-40 units/mL and that for
      SGPT is 5-35 units/mL. Elevated SGOT and SGPT levels usually
      indicate compromised liver functions.<br>
      <br>
      The results of HHT888-45 treatment are shown in Table 6. All seven
      (7) patients treated had their serum liver enzymes returned from
      elevated levels (SGOT from 48 to 166 unit/mL and SGPT from 41 to
      291 unit/mL) to essentially normal range (SGOT from 8 to 40
      unit/mL and SGPT from 5 to 35 unit/mL) after 17 to 178 days of
      treatment. Thus, the liver functions of the patients were returned
      to normal after consumption of the invention composition.<br>
      <br>
      The results clearly demonstrate that the herb mixture HHT888-45 is
      effective in treating hepatitis C patients. To accomplish that,
      the causative hepatitis C virus needs to be eradicated or reduced
      to a tolerable level. Since HHT888-45 components have demonstrated
      very strong anti-HIV in vitro activity and several of the
      components have demonstrated efficacy in reducing HBV in carriers,
      the herb mixture will therefore be effective in treating patients
      infected with HIV and HBV.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an aspect of this invention that the antiviral
      herbal medicines including the herb mixtures according to this
      invention and their single-herb components at various proportions
      and effective doses are effective in treating hepatitis C,
      hepatitis B, and other retroviral diseases, such as AIDS.<br>

      Since the precise chemical composition and pharmacological
      mechanism of the compositions of this invention have not yet been
      eludicated, it is possible that the antiviral activity may be due
      to a single herbal component, a combination of components or the
      biological metabolite or derivative thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Industrial Applicability</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The instant invention is directed in part, to the discovery that
      specific medicinal plants or herbal medicines or their mixtures
      possess surprising antiviral activities without causing damage to
      the host cells. Further, the invention is directed to methods of
      treating humans and mammals infected with viruses such as HBV,
      HCV, or HIV. The data presented in this application clearly
      demonstrate that the identified compositions possess antiviral
      activity without toxicity to the host cells.<br>
      <br>
      It can be concluded from the foregoing experiments that the herb
      mixture designated HHT888-4 is effective in treating HBV carriers
      and thus can be used to treat humans infected with HBV. The
      reduction of viral load in HBV patients will thus result in the
      prevention of HBV disease in the human and will also be effective
      in the treatment of humans exhibiting HBV disease. The clinical
      experiments have also shown that the herb mixture HHT888-45 is
      effective in treating hepatitis C patients, and thus is expected
      to be effective in treating hepatitis B patients when administered
      alone or in combination with HHT888-5 or its antiviral single-herb
      components.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, HHT888-5, HHT888-45, HHT888-54 and the individual
      anti-HIV active single-herb components have demonstrated efficacy
      in suppressing HIV proliferation in human cells. Furthermore,
      HHT888-5, HHT888-45 and HHT888-54 have shown efficacy in treating
      patients infected with HBV and HCV. HHT888-5, HHT888-45, HHT888-4
      and HHT888-54 are also effective in treating humans infected with
      HIV, including HIV carriers and AIDS patients.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a continuation-in-part (CIP) of the
      parent patent application, U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      09/906,791, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,078, which is herein
      incorporated by reference. In the parent application, novel
      pharmaceutical compositions, which are particularly effective in
      treating patients with human immunodeficeincy virus (HIV), were
      described.<br>
      <br>
      HIV infection causes acquired immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS) in
      humans which presents special problems to the medical community.
      AIDS is a pandemic immunosuppressive disease which results in
      life-threatening opportunistic infections and malignancies. The
      retrovirus, HIV, has been isolated and identified as the etiologic
      agent of this disease. HIV has been detected in whole blood,
      plasma, lymphatic fluid, serum, semen, vagina fluid, breast milk,
      tears, saliva, and central nervous system tissue of infected
      patients. HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact with an
      infected person, by sharing needles or syringes (primarily for
      drug injection) with an infected person, or, less commonly,
      through transfusions of infected blood or blood clotting factors.
      Babies born to HIV-infected women may become infected before or
      during birth or through breast-feeding after birth. As of this
      time, complete cure for HIV infection/AIDS has been diligently
      pursued by scientists around the world, yet there has been no
      report of absolute success.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutical compositions made from natural herbs have been
      known and used for thousands of years to cure or ameliorate
      various diseases and injuries. Some of these herbal compositions
      have been disclosed for having medicinal properties for curing or
      ameliorating symptoms associated with HIV infection. For example,
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,865 discloses screening of fifty-six (56)
      individual herbs and have found that ten (10) out of 56 herbs
      exhibits anti-HIV activity in ex vivo experiments. The ten (10)
      individual herbs include Coptis chineusis, Ligusticum wallichii,
      Illicium lanceolatum, Isatis tinctoria, Salvia miltiorrhiza,
      Erycibe obtusifolia, Acanthopanax graciliatylus, Bostaurus
      domesticus, Inula helenium, and Lonicera japonica. Both Bostaurus
      domesticus and Lonicera japonica are further described to be able
      to combine with Scutellaria baicaleusis to exhibit anti-HIV
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,257 discloses Chinese herbal medicines that
      exhibit in vitro antiviral activities against murine leukemia
      virus and HIV and for treatment of animals and humans infected
      with HIV. In one of the preferred embodiments, the Chinese herbal
      medicines contain hedyotis, scutellariae barbatae herba, lonicerae
      flos, prunellae spica, and solani herba.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,556 discloses various herbal compositions for
      treating viral infection. One of the herbal compositions contains
      Aeginetiae Herba, Blechni Rhizoma, Lespedezae Herba, Polygoni
      Cuspidati Rhizoma, Forsythiae Fructus, and Ligustri Fructus.
      Another herbal composition contains Cirsii Rhizoma et Radix,
      Breeae Radix, Baphicacanthis Rhizoma et Radix, Phellodendri
      Cortex, and Bletillae Tuber. A third herbal composition disclosed
      in the patent has Aeginetiae Herba, Lonicerae Flos, Prunellae
      Spica, and Lespedezae Herba.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a novel pharmaceutical composition
      for treatment of HIV, both in vitro and in vivo, including
      treatment of AIDS patients, which are distinctively different from
      prior art disclosures. This novel pharmaceutical composition
      differs from the pharmaceutical compositions described in the
      parent application for not containing red ginseng (Radix ginseng
      rubra). The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is
      a natural Chinese medicine with little or no side effects and has
      no toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which
      is particularly effective in treating HIV-positive or AIDS
      patients. The pharmaceutical composition (in the name of
      "HIVCIDE") is in the form of an injection solution (for
      intravenous injection) or capsules. It contains aqueous extract of
      the following herbal ingredients: (1) an entire plant of Herba
      Hedyotidis diffusae (diffuse hedyotis); (2) a rhizome of Rhizoma
      Bistortae (bistort rhizome); (3) a rhizome of Rhizoma Polygoni
      Cuspidati (giant knotweed rhizome); (4) a ripe fruit of Fructus
      Schisandrae (Chinese magnoliavine fruit); (5) a rhizome of Rhizoma
      Menispermi (Asiatic moonseed rhizome); (6) a root of Radix
      Scutellariae (baical skullcap root); (7) bovine biliary powder;
      (8) a root tuber of Radix Curcumae (tumeric root-tuber); (9) a
      ripe fruit of Fructus Crataegi (hawthorn fruit); (10) a root of
      Radix Notoginseng (sanqi); (11) a ripe fruit of Fructus Lycii
      (barbary wolfberry fruit); (12) a root of Radix Scrophulariae
      (figwort root); (13) a root of Radix Angelicae sinensis (Chinese
      angelica); and (14) a root of Radix Astragali (milkvetch root).
      Examples of the aqueous solution for extracting the pharmaceutical
      ingredients from the herbs include, but are not limited to, water,
      ethanol, or a mixture thereof. The preferred aqueous solution is
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The herbal ingredients of HIVCIDE differ from that in the parent
      application by not containing the root of Radix ginseng rubra (red
      ginseng). Also, the weight ratio of the pharmaceutical composition
      of the present invention is different from that of the
      pharmaceutical composition of the parent application by containing
      more quantity of diffuse hedyotis. The weight ratio of the 14
      ingredients listed above is about 4:3:1:2:1:1:0.1:1:2:1:3:2:1:2.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous extract of the herbal ingredients is further filtered
      and condensed. The condensed aqueous extract is called "herbal
      condensate" or "HIVCIDE condensate."The volume of the herbal
      filtrate is about 1.4 fold of the herbal condensate.<br>
      <br>
      The gram weight of the HIVCIDE for the purpose of determining the
      dosage amounts for patient treatment as described hereinafter is
      based on the weight of the "HIVCIDE condensate," not the weight of
      the original herbal ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also includes a method for preparing HIVCIDE
      which includes the steps of: (1) grinding and mixing diffuse
      hedyotis, bistort rhizome, giant knotweed rhizome, Chinese
      magnoliavine fruit, Asiatic moonseed rhizome, baical skullcap
      root, bovine biliary powder, tumeric root-tuber, hawthorn fruit,
      sanqi, barbary wolfberry fruit, figwort root, Chinese angelica,
      and milkvetch root to form a herbal mixture; (2) boiling the
      herbal mixture in water to form a water extract; (3) filtering the
      water extract to collect an herbal filtrate; and (4) concentrating
      the herbal filtrate to form an herbal condensate (also known as
      "HIVCIDE condensate"). The HIVCIDE condensate is then either
      dissolved in a suitable solution to form the intravenous injection
      solution or sprayed dried to form herbal powders. The herbal
      powders are further mixed with a binder, such as starch, and
      encapsulated.<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE injection solution contains about 0.1-1 g of the
      HIVCIDE condensate per ml of the injection solution. When
      administering to patients, the HIVCIDE is perferably diluted to
      about 1:5 to 1:10 by volume of 5% glucose solution.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further contains a method for treating
      patients with HIV infection which includes intravenous
      administration of an effective amount of HIVCIDE to patients with
      HIV infection. The preferred dosage is about 1 to 10 g of HIVCIDE
      condensate, most preferably, about 2-6 g of HIVCIDE condensate,
      per day.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the present invention provides a method for treating
      patients with HIV infection which comprises: intravenous
      administering the HIVCIDE injection solution and orally
      administering the HIVCIDE capsules to patients. The preferred
      dosage of the HIVCIDE injection solution is about 1 to 10 g, most
      favorably, 2-6 g, of the HIVCIDE condensate per day, preferrably
      in one injection.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred dosage for HIVCIDE capsules is about 0.1 to 2 g of
      HIVCIDE condensate per serving and for about 2-4 times a day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows the HIV numbers in the five HIV positive patients as
      described in EXAMPLE 5, infra. These five HIV-positive patients
      were treated with daily intravenous injection of HIVCIDE injection
      solution (Example 1, infra) for 3 months. Patient #1 (, solid line
      with solid arrow) had received AZT and DDI treatment for 3 months.
      Ten (10) days after the discontinuance of the AZT and DDI
      treatment, patient #1 started the HIVCIDE daily injection. Patient
      #5 (-&gt;, solid line with open arrow) received the HIVCIDE
      treatment concurrently with [alpha]-interferon. Results for
      Patents #2, #3 and #4 are indicated as (dash line with solid
      arrow), -- (solid line with solid circle) and - - - - (dash line
      with solid circle), respectively.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Traditional Chinese medicine has been in existence for more than
      two thousand years. It has a proven record of success for curing
      many kinds of diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine utilizes a
      variety of herbs and natural substances. Each herb/natural
      substance has its unique characteristics. By combining and
      balancing the unique characteristics of herbs, a doctor can
      prescribe a formulation with enhanced medicinal activities and
      with less or no toxicity by synergizing the medicinal effects
      among various herbs, while in the meantime, cancelling out or
      neutralizing the toxic effects of the herbs. This, in Chinese
      herbal medicine, is regarded as to regulate between
      negative/hypoactive characteristics ("yin") and
      positive/hyperactive characteristics ("yang"),<br>
      <br>
      Under the definitions set forth in the traditional Chinese
      medicine, "yin" is defined as drugs which cure cold syndrome
      (which itself has hot or warm property), and "yang" is defined as
      drugs which cure heat syndrome (which itself has cold or cool
      property).<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical combination of the present invention comprises
      fourteen (14) ingredients, which are particularly effective in
      treating patients with HIV. Out of the 14 ingredients, four (4)
      ingredients are the core ingredients which contribute to the
      primary efficacy and healing effect of the composition. They are:
      (1) diffuse hedyotis/spreading hedyotis (Pharmaceutical name:
      Herba Hedyotidis diffusae; Botanical name: Hedyotis diffusa
      Willd.); (2) bistort rhizome (Pharmaceutical name: Rhizoma
      Bistortae; Botanical name: Polygonum bistorta L.); (3) giant
      knotweed rhizome (Pharmaceutical name: Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidati;
      Botanical name: Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc.), and (4)
      Chinese magnoliavine fruit (Pharmaceutical name: Fructus
      Schisandrae Chinensis; Botanical name: Schisandra chinensis
      (Turcz.) Baill., S. sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils.). The core
      ingredients are functioned in clearing heat and toxic substances
      while improving immune system and circulation, curing symptoms of
      jaundice, and having beneficial effect on internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      There are six (6) additional ingredients that are used to improve
      and balance the pharmaceutical effects activities produced by the
      above named core ingredients. These six ingredients also have
      toning effect and can improve blood circulation in the liver.
      These six ingredients are: (1) Asiatic moonseed rhizome
      (Pharmaceutical name: Rhizoma Menispermi; Botanical name:
      Menisermum dauricum DC); (2) baical skullcap root (Pharmaceutical
      name: Radix Scutellariae; Botanical name: Scutellaria baicalensis
      Georgi); (3) bovine biliary powder (Zoological name: Vesica Fellea
      Bovus); (4) tumeric root-tuber (Pharmaceutical name: Radix
      Curcumae; Botanical name: Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Lee et Cl Ling);
      (5) Hawthorn Fruit (Pharmaceutical name: Fructus Crataegi;
      Botanical name: Crataegus pinnatifida Bge.); and (6) sanqui
      (Pharmaceutical name: Radix Notoginseng; Botanical name: Panax
      notoginseng (Burk.)).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, there are additional five (4) ingredients which are used
      to primarily provide nutrients and energy sources for patients so
      as to expedite the recovery process. These ingredients include:
      (1) barbary wolfberry fruit (Pharmaceutical name: Fructus Lycii;
      Botanical name: Lycium barbarum L.); (2) figwort root
      (Pharmaceutical name: Radix Scrophulariae; Botanical name:
      Scrophularia ningpoensis); (3) Chinese angelica (Pharmaceutical
      name: Radix Angelicae sinensis; Botanical name: Angelica sinensis
      (Oliv.) Diels); and (4) milkvetch root (Pharmaceutical name: Radix
      Astragali; Botanical name: Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge.).
      Among these ingredients, milkvetch root (Radix Astragali) also has
      the capacity of improving immunological functions of the body to
      fense off diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention differs
      from the composition described in the parent application by not
      containing red ginseng (Radix Ginseng Rubra). It was found that
      the presence of red ginseng appeared to cause relapse of the
      disease after termination of the use of the pharmaceutical
      composition. Also, the pharmaceutical composition of the present
      invention is particularly suitable for intravenous injection and
      less effective for oral administration, which is also slightly
      different from the pharmaceutical composition of the parent
      application, where both capsules (in the form of HIVCIDE powder)
      and intravenous injection are effective.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical names, botanical or zoological names, family
      names, common descriptions, and major ingredients of the herbs
      used in the present invention are shown in Table 1.<br>

      according to the common procedures. The herbs are cut and put in a
      container with water to boil and simmer twice. The first time of
      simmering takes two hours, the solution is collected, and water is
      added for the second time of simmering for about 1.5 hour. The
      solutions from the simmering steps are collected and then filtered
      by a sieve/filter. The filtrate is then condensed from about 1.4
      fold by volume to about 1.0 fold by volume. The resulting
      condensate is pasty-like. Optionally, the herbs can be simmered,
      filtered and condensed again. The second condensate is then mixed
      with the first condensate to form the "HIVCIDE condensate," which
      becomes the basic content of the HIVCIDE injection solution. When
      used, the HIVCIDE injection solution is further diluted 1:5 to
      1:10 by volume with a suitable solution. The gram weight of the
      HIVCIDE injection solution described herein is referred to the
      weight of the "HIVCIDE condensate."<br>
      <br>

      The individual herb was cut into small pieces and thoroughly mixed
      together. The mixed herbs were placed in bags with sufficient
      space to spread out. The bags were placed in an extractor with 350
      L (±10%) of water and soaked for about 60±10 min. The herbs were
      first extracted at 95±5[deg.] C. under steam pressure of 2
      kg/cm&lt;2 &gt;and lid pressure of 0.2-0.4 kg/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 45
      min. The water extract was collected into a concentrator and
      concentrated at 40±5[deg.] C. under vacuum of -60 to -76 cmHg for
      40 min to form the first concentrate.<br>
      <br>
      The herbs in the bags were recovered from the extractor, placed
      into another 350 L (±10%) of water and extracted again at
      95±5[deg.] C. under steam pressure of 2 kg/cm&lt;2 &gt;and lid
      pressure of 0.2-0.4 kgf/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 45 min. The extract from
      the second extraction was collected into a concentrator and
      concentrated at 40±5[deg.] C. under vacuum of -60 to -76 cmHg for
      40 min to form the second concentrate.<br>
      <br>
      The first and second concentrates were combined and poured into a
      stainless container. The total weight of the combined concentrates
      was about 6.1 kg±10%. The combined 1&lt;st &gt;and 2&lt;nd
      &gt;concentrates were called the "HIVCIDE condensate."<br>
      <br>
      For the HIVCIDE injection solution, about 0.1 to 1 g, preferably
      0.4 g of the "HIVCIDE condensate" was dissolved in about 1 ml of
      the injection buffer. About 5 ml of the injection solution was
      poured into an ampoule.<br>
      <br>
      For the HIVCIDE powders (which were packaged into HIVCIDE
      capsule), about 3.9 kg of starch (adjustable based on the water
      content of the starch) were added to the HIVCIDE condensate and
      spray dried in a fluidized bed setting at in-temperature of
      60[deg.] C. and out-temperature of 50[deg.] C. for approximately
      120±20 min until LOD (limit of detection)&lt;5%.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant powders were passed through a 100-mesh sieve and
      then a 80-mesh sieve. The final yield of the HIVCIDE powders were
      about 9.5≈10.5 kg. The HIVCIDE powders were further packaged into
      capsules. Any conventional capsules, including, but not limited
      to, natural gelatin, pectin, casein, collagen, protein, modified
      starch, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, were suitable for
      encapsulation.<br>
      <br>
      There were two dosage forms of HIVCIDE capsules: A 500 mg of the
      HIVCIDE capsule, which contained about 305 mg of the "HIVCIDE
      condensate" and about 195 mg of starch; and a 220 mg of the
      HIVCIDE capsule, which contained about 134 mg of the "HIVCIDE
      condensate" and about 86 mg of starch.<br>
      <br>
      (3) In-Process Quality Controls<br>
      <br>
      After the extracts were concentrated, a 10-15 g sample was
      collected and the concentrations of the solid content and the
      water content were determined by methods described in US
      Pharmacopoeia, China Pharmacopoeia, and/or Japanese Pharmacopoeia.<br>
      EXAMPLE 2<br>
      Acute Toxicity Study of HIVCIDE in Animals<br>
      <br>
      Purpose:<br>
      <br>
      The following experiment was conducted at the Toxicology
      Laboratory of the Institute of Labor, Health, and Occupational
      Disease of Heilungkiang Province in China to examine acute
      toxicity of the HIVCIDE during intravenous injection in animals.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      Experimental animals were Japanese big-ear white rabbits obtained
      from the Animal Center of Haerbin Medical University in Haerbin,
      Heilungkiang Province, China. These rabbits were characterized by
      the obvious blood vessels on ears which facilitates the operation
      of injection during the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Ten (10) rabbits were obtained including six (6) males and four
      (4) females, each weighing between 1900 g to 3000 g.<br>
      <br>
      The rabbits were randomly divided into two (2) groups, five
      rabbits in each group including two (2) females and three (3)
      males. The HIVCIDE injection solution was intravenously injected
      into the two groups of rabbits through the veins on their ears at
      dosages of 10 g and 15 g of HIVCIDE condensate per kg of rabbit
      body weight, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE concentration was about 1 g/ml, so that the higher
      dosage group was about 15 ml/kg, which was roughly equal to a
      sixty (60) kg-weighted adult treated with 900 ml of the HIVCIDE
      injection solution.<br>
      <br>
      The rabbits were observed for behaviour continuously for a period
      of two (2) weeks after intravenous injections. Observation was
      conducted hourly at day 1; during the following days, observation
      was conducted four to six (4-6) times per day.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the observation period, rabbits were sacrificed and
      dissected to examine the eyes, liver, lung, and spleen to
      determine adverse effects.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      No abnormal behavior was found in the rabbits during the entire
      observation period. All animals exhibited normal body weight
      gains. No organ abnormality was observed. After sacrifice and
      dissection of the animals, inspection of the eyes, liver, lung,
      and spleen showed no extraordinary syndromes. The results indicate
      that, when comparing with the general acute toxicity index, the
      HIVCIDE injection solution showed no symptoms of acute or chronic
      toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      The intravenous administration of HIVCIDE injection solution up to
      15 g/kg was well-tolerated, which was approximately equal to
      injection of 900 ml of HIVCIDE into a 60-kg of human. The HIVCIDE
      demonstrated no acute toxicity in rabbits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Effects of the HIVCIDE on HIV in Cell Cultures</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Purpose:<br>
      <br>
      The following experiment was to determine the effectiveness of the
      HIVCIDE injection solution gainst HIV in cell cultures.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      MT4 cells were cultured in HIV-1 suspension liquid of 100 TCID50
      in a 96-orifice culture plate. MT4 is a human T-cell lymphotropic
      virus type 1-transformed cell line. The culture condition was set
      at a temperature of 37[deg.] C. and under 5% CO2. The duration of
      the culture was seven (7) days.<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE injection solution of the present invention was added
      to the cultural wells at various concentrations. The morphology of
      the MT4 cells was observed under microscope by conventional
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      No pathological changes of MT4 cells were observed in the cultural
      wells where the HIVCIDE injection solution was added to in
      adequate concentrations. The inhibition of the pathological
      changes of MT4 cells indicated that the HIVCIDE injection solution
      had inhibitory effect on pathological changes of the cultured
      cells caused by HIV.<br>
      <br>
      The effective concentration of the HIVCIDE injection solution for
      inhibition of the pathological changes of MT4 cells was more than
      12.5 mg/ml. To achieve a 50% of inhibition, the concentration of
      the HIVCIDE herbal composition was 25 mg/ml.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE injection solution was effective in inhibiting
      pathological changes in cells caused by HIV-1 in vitro.<br>
      EXAMPLE 4<br>
      A Case Study on an HIV-Patient Treated with HIVCIDE<br>
      <br>
      Purpose:<br>
      <br>
      The following clinical trial was conducted in the Infectious
      Disease Hospital in Shanghai, China to test the effectiveness of
      the herbal composition of the present invention in treating an
      HIV-infected patient.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      A fifty-year Chinese male patient diagnosed with HIV infection
      complicated by herpes zoster was treated with anti-virus regimens
      by the combination of western medicine and the herbal composition
      of the present invention during hospital stay.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      The patient was confirmed of HIV-infection by Rapid Agglutinin
      Assay. At the time of the initial diagnosis, the patient showed no
      symptoms. Ten months after the initial diagnosis, the patient
      quickly developed an herpetiform rash over the front of the left
      side of the check extending over the nick, the shoulder, and the
      upper left arm. The patient was then admitted into the Hospital
      shortly thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      At the hospital, the result of the physical examination was normal
      except the skin rash. The pathology tests confirmed normal renal
      function. The functional tests of the liver showed a slightly
      increased level of serum [gamma] glutamyl transpeptidase and
      acetyl glucuronidase. Hepatitis viral tests showed negative for
      Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus (HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA).
      However, Hepatitis G viral test showed positive for HGV-RNA. The
      immunological studies showed that the [beta]-2 microglobulin level
      was 2.4-2.5 mg/ml.<br>
      <br>
      During the hospital stay, haemoglobin and erythrocytes levels of
      the patient were slightly decreased, while the levels of the
      leukocyte and platelet were normal. Peripheral blood lymphocytes
      counts showed that T4 cells were decreased to 2.76*10/L (32.9%)
      and the ratio of T4/T8 cell was 1.16. Thus, the diagnosis is that
      the patient was with HIV infection complicated by herpes zoster.<br>
      <br>
      During hospital stay, the patient had diarrhea and dry cough for a
      few days and was cured. The patient showed HIV antibody positive
      by ELISA, and his T4 cells further decreased to 25.4% and the
      ratio of T4/T8 cells was inverted to 0.94.<br>
      <br>
      The patient's T4 cells and the ratio of T4/T8 gradually increased
      after intravenously injected with the HIVCIDE injection solution.
      In about three months of HIVCIDE treatment, his T4 cells were
      returned to 40.7%, and the ratio of T4/T8 was improved to 1.45.
      The skin rash gradually disappeared and completely recovered by
      the end of November.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE injection solution was effective in reducing symptoms
      of the HIV-infected patient in a treatment regime together with
      western medicine.<br>

      effectiveness of HIVCIDE in HIV patients.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      Five (5) HIV-postive patients were intravenously injected with

      <br>
      The patients were treated according to the following regimen:<br>
      <br>
      The HIVCIDE injection solution was prepared according to EXAMPLE
      1, supra. Prior to the injection, five (5) ml of HIVCIDE injection
      solution was diluted in 250 ml of 5% glucose solution. The diluted
      solution was injected intravenously once per day for three (3)
      consecutive days. If no adverse reactions were observed, the
      dosage was increased to 15 ml of HIVCIDE in 250 ml of 5% glucose
      solution, and the patients were injected intravenously once per
      day reactions for two (2)-three (3) months.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, patient #1 was treated with AZT and DDI therapy for
      3 months. The AZT and DDI therapy was discontinued ten (10) days
      prior to the HIVCIDE treatment. Patients #2, #3, and #4 were given
      HIVCIDE daily injection alone. Patient # 5 was given combined
      treatment of [alpha]-interferon and HIVCIDE.<br>
      <br>
      About 3 ml of blood sample were taken from the patients each time
      before, during, and after the treatment and further tested for HIV
      numbers. CD4 counts were determined in Patients #1, #2 and #4
      before and after the respective treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      No adverse reactions to the HIVCIDE injection solution were
      observed. Three out of the four AIDS patients had different
      degrees of fatigue before the treatment of HIVCIDE. There was
      marked improvement in the fatigue after the treatment with HIVCIDE
      in the three AIDS patients.<br>
      <br>
      The change in HIV viral load (copies/ml) in plasma before and
      after HIVCIDE treatment is shown in Table 5 and FIG. 1.<br>

      &nbsp; *The lower HIV numbers observed in Patient #1 before
      treatment might be contributed to the 3-month treatment of AZT and
      DDI prior to the start of HIVCIDE treatment.<br>
      &nbsp; **Patient #5 received concurrent treatment of HIVCIDE and
      [alpha]-interferon.<br>
      &nbsp; ***The plasma HIV viral load of Patient #4 was detected 6
      weeks after the HIVCIDE treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Table 5 and FIG. 1, four of the five HIV-positive
      patients (i.e., patients #1, #3, #4, and #5) showed decrease in
      HIV viral load in two months. Two out of these four patients
      (i.e., patients #1 and #4) showed a rebound in viral load after
      the end of the third-month HIVCIDE treatment. The other two
      patients, (i.e., patients #3 and #5), showed significant clinical
      symptom relief, and did not provide plasma sample for analysis at
      the end of the third-month treatment. Patient #2, whose plasma
      sample was not taken at the end of the second month treatment,
      showed a 40-time reduction in HIV viral load at the end of the
      third-month HIVCIDE treatment. Patient #2 also demonstrated
      significant clinical symptom relief at the end of the third-month
      HIVCIDE treatment. However, because patient #5 received concurrent
      treatment with [alpha]-interferon, the results of this patient
      were difficult to assess.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the HIV viral load study indicate that all of the
      patients demonstrated reduction in HIV viral load after HIVCIDE
      treatment. However, great fluctuation in the replication of HIV
      was observed in two of the five patients. For example, patient
      #4's HIV viral load decreased significantly after 6 weeks of
      treatment but rebounded after the end of the three-month HIVCIDE
      treatment. Patient #1 also experienced a rebound (although to a
      much lesser degree than that of patient #4) at the end of the
      third-month treatment.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to HIV viral load, CD4 count (count/mm&lt;3&gt;) was
      measured in three patients (i.e., patients #1, #2, and #3) at the
      end of the three-month HIVCIDE treatment. For example, the CD4
      count of patient #2 rose from 285 to 510/mm&lt;3 &gt;after 3
      months of HIVCIDE treatment and continued to rise to 630/mm&lt;3
      &gt;2 months after the discontinuance of the HIVCIDE treatment.
      The CD4 count of Patient 4 was 190/mm&lt;3 &gt;prior to HIVCIDE
      treatment, 40/mm&lt;3 &gt;after 3-month of HIVCIDE treatment, and
      360/mm&lt;3 &gt;2 months after the discontinuance of the HIVCIDE
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      The results indicated that HIVCIDE injection solution was
      effective in treating HIV/AIDS patients.<br>

      The patients were concurrently treated with HIVCIDE injection
      solution and HIVCIDE capsules. For HIVCIDE injection solution,
      about 5 ml of HIVCIDE injection solution (containing approximately
      0.4 g of HIVCIDE condensate per ml) were diluted in 250 ml of 5%
      glucose. Each patient was given an intravenous injection of the
      HIVCIDE injection solution once daily for 3 months. For HIVCIDE
      capsules, each patient was given 6 HIVCIDE capsules (220 mg of
      HIVCIDE capsules) per time (before meal), three times per day for
      3 months.<br>
      <br>
      Blood samples were taken from the patients before, during, and
      after the HIVCIDE treatment for tests of CD4 cells count.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      All patients experienced pain in the stomach and right rib area
      during the first two weeks of the treatment period. Patient #5
      also vomited every morning for a week in the third month of the
      treatment period.<br>
      <br>
      The CD4 cells count of the patients is shown in Table 7:<br>

      <br>
      During the treatment period, all patients demonstrated positive
      response to the HIVCIDE treatment except the minor adverse
      reactions as mentioned above. The physical condition of all of the
      patients had clearly improved after one month of the HIVCIDE
      treatment. In particular, patients felt stronger, were happier and
      showed improved appetite. Anaphylaxis, melancholy, stomach pain
      and discomfort disappeared. For some of the patients who had
      constipation, the symptom was greatly improved. For some of the
      patients who had experienced insomnia, the sleepless problem was
      also greatly improved. Also, patients #4 and #5 had gained about 5
      kg at the end of the three-month HIVCIDE treatment. And patients #
      2 and #4 stopped taking narcotic analgesics for pain relief. The
      biochemical indicators, including HBV and HCV, in some of the
      patients were also clearly improved. The M antibody in Citomegalo
      virus, genorrhea antibody and HBC antibody also disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as shown in the last column of Table 7, 2 months after the
      completion of the 3-month treatment period, all of the patients
      CD4 cell counts were continued to increase, which indicated that
      no relapse had occurred after the termination of the HIVCIDE.<br>
      <br>
      Patients #1 and #2 had received a second 3-month course of HIVCIDE
      treatment after the completion of the first 3-month HIVCIDE
      program. No adverse effect was observed at the end of the second
      course of HIVCIDE treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      The combined use of HIVCIDE injection solution and HIVCIDE
      capsules was effective in reducing symptoms in HIV-positive
      patients.<br>

        </b><b>CHINESE HERBAL EXTRACTS IN THE TREATMENT OF HIV RELATED
          DISEASE IN VITRO</b><b><br>

      <br>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HO DAVID D [US]; LI XILING, et
      al&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The invention features herbal extracts from ten (10) Chinese
      Herbal Medicines demonstrating significant in vitro and ex vivo
      anti-HIV activity and their use for the diagnosis and treatment of
      HIV and HIV-related disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention is in the fields of medicine and pharmacology. In
      particular, the invention features ten (10) commercially available
      Chinese Herbal Extracts (CHEs) exhibiting in vitro and/or ex vivo
      activity against the etiologic agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency
      Syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS related complex (ARC).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a pandemic
      immunosuppressive disease which results in life threatening
      opportunistic infections and malignancies. A retrovirus,
      designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1(HTLV-III LAV)), has
      been isolated and identified as the etiologic agent of this
      disease. This virus has been shown to be harbored by T helper
      lymphocytes and monocyte-macrophages, and it is detectable in
      whole blood, plasma, lymphatic fluid, serum, semen, saliva and
      central nervous system tissue. Ho et al., New England Journal of
      Medicine, 321:1621-1625 (1989). Although cells of the
      monocyte-macrophage lineage serve as important reservoirs of HIV
      infection, most of the cell-associated virus in the blood is
      contained within CD4+ T cells. Characteristically, then, AIDS is
      associated with a progressive depletion of T cells, especially the
      helper-inducer subset bearing the OKT4 surface marker.<br>
      <br>
      Several agents have been reported to inhibit the growth of the
      human immunodeficiency virus in vitro. Among the agents exhibiting
      in vitro anti-HIV activity, some are now in clinical use,
      including ribavirin, zidovudine (AZT), the 2',
      3'-dideoxynucleosides (DDI and DDC); ganciclovir alpha-interferon,
      interleukin-2, ampligen and isoprinosine. Anand et al., Lancet
      i,97-98 (1986); Balzarini et al., Int. J. Cancer 37:451-457
      (1986); Ho et al., Lancet, i,602-604 (1985); McCormick et al.,
      Lancet ii,1367-1369 (1984); Mitchell et al., Lancet i,890-892
      (1987); Mitsuya et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:1911-1915
      and 82:7096-7100 (1985, 1986); Mitsuya et al., Science 226:172-174
      (1984); Pert et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9254-9258
      (1986); Pizzi et al., Human Biol. 22:151-190 (1950); Rozenbaum et
      al., Lancet i,450-451 (1985); Sandstrom et al., Lancet i,1480-1482
      (1986); Veno and Kino, Lancet i,1379 (1987); Yamamoto et al.,
      Interferon Res. 6:143-152 (1986), and Antiviral Research 7:127-137
      (1987). However, no therapy to date is known to cure AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of the compounds tested for use against HIV.
      including those referenced above, appear to be either too toxic
      for prolonged use or incapable of completely eliminating HIV
      infection from the human host. Blanche et al., Lancet i,863
      (1986); De Clercq et al., J. Med. Chem. 29:1561-1569 (1986);
      Yarchoan et al., Lancet i,575-580 (1986); Wetterberg et al.,
      Lancet i,159 (1987). In view of the severity of the AIDS situation
      and the toxicity and limited clinical efficacy of the compounds
      tested thus far, the scientists of the present invention have
      begun investigating the anti-HIV activity of extracts from Chinese
      medicinal herbs. Chang and Yeung, Antiviral Research 9:163-176
      (1988); Chang et al., Antiviral Research 11:263-73 (1989). This
      interest in Chinese herbs was prompted by Chinese folklore,
      wherein a number of these herbs have been reputed to have
      anti-infective activity and to be well tolerated by humans. A
      subset of these herbs now also appear to exhibit anti-HIV
      activity, and are disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      However, Chinese folk medicine is based largely on anecdotal
      observations spanning the past several thousands of years. Hence,
      the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs used by folk medicine
      practitioners has, for the most part, not been substantiated by
      scientific methods. Despite this lack of scientific proof, it is
      quite possible that some herbal remedies may have specific
      therapeutic action, as was proven to be the case with the
      anti-malarial. qinghaosu, and perhaps even anti-HIV activity.
      Klayman, Science, 228:1049-1055 (1985). Consequently, with regard
      to the possible anti-HIV activity among Chinese herbal extracts,
      an urgent need exists for: 1) the identification of effective
      anti-HIV herbal extracts, 2) the substantive documentation, by
      modern scientific methods, of the effectiveness of these herbal
      extracts against HIV, and 3) the identification of effective
      anti-HIV Chinese herbal extracts that are less toxic than the
      currently available anti-HIV agents. The present invention
      satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.<br>
      <br>
      The papers cited throughout this application are incorporated
      herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A total of fifty-six (56) herbal extracts. some of which are known
      to have anti-infective properties and to be non-toxic in clinical
      use in China, were screened for their anti-HIV activity using in
      vitro techniques. Of these fifty-six (56) herbal extracts, ten
      (10) were shown to have potent anti-HIV activity in in vitro
      experiments, and two (2) of these ten (10) also exhibited anti-HIV
      activity in ex vivo experiments.<br>
      <br>
      These ten (10) include the extracts from: Sample #1--Coptis
      chineusis, which can be located in Western, Southern and Central
      China; Sample #8--Ligusticum wallichii, which can be found in
      Northern and Southwestern China, and Salvia miltiorrhiza, which
      can be located in most areas of China; Sample #21--Illicium
      lanceolatum, which can be located in Eastern and Southern China;

      *A compound comprising more than one (1) herb.<br>
      <br>
      In the context of the present specification, CHE is used to refer
      to any species of any of the herbs delineated above which, upon
      extraction, yields a fraction comprising a pharmacologically
      active agent, whether a component, a combination of components, a
      biological metabolite, a derivative thereof or a combination of
      the above, that exhibits in vitro and/or ex vivo anti-HIV
      activity. Since the precise chemical composition and pharmacologic
      mechanism of the CHEs has not yet been elucidated, it is possible
      that the anti-HIV activity may be due to a single CHE component, a
      combination of CHE components, or the biologic metabolite or
      derivative thereof.<br>
      <br>
      By the terms "HIV," and "AIDS-related virus" is meant the commonly
      designated HIV series (human immunodeficiency virus) formerly
      called HTLV, LAV and ARV, and species thereof, as described in the
      incorporated references.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the terms "HIV-related disease" and "AIDS-related
      disease" shall refer to any illness or syndrome, caused directly
      or indirectly by HIV or AIDS-related virus, including but not
      limited to infections whose source is fungal, viral and/or
      bacterial.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to employ the
      CHEs as therapeutic agents in hosts infected with HIV. In vitro
      studies, ex vivo studies, including the therapeutic indices (TI)
      calculated for each CHE, suggest that these CHEs will be useful in
      pharmacological preparations as in vivo anti-HIV agents. The
      pharmacological preparations may contain the pharmacological
      active ingredient alone or in admixture with an appropriate
      excipient or carrier, and administered to the HIV infected host by
      enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral, such as
      intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous route.
      The pharmacological agent may also be administered in combination
      with a supplemental antiviral agent, an immune modulator, any
      other chemotherapeutic agent, an antibody or a combination
      thereof. In addition, the pharmacological preparations according
      to the invention may be, for example, in dosage unit form, such as
      tablets, capsules. suppositories or ampoules.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the invention to use a CHE component or
      combination of CHE components, a biologic metabolite, a derivative
      thereof or a combination of the above, in a pharmacological
      preparation for the treatment of HIV-related illness in infected
      hosts.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the invention to use the CHE, its active
      component or combination of components, a biological metabolite, a
      derivative thereof, or a combination of the above, alone or
      conjugated to a label, in a diagnostic test for the diagnosis of
      HIV related illness. Such a test could be an immunofluorescent
      test, based upon a CHE's capacity to bind either the HIV infected
      T cells or the anti-idiotypic antibody derived from the CHE.<br>
      <br>
      It is still a further object of the invention to use a CHE, a CHE
      component, a combination of CHE components, a biological
      metabolite, a derivative thereof, or a combination of the above to
      produce a vaccine. Once the CHE's "active site" has been
      determined, current immunologic techniques could be relied upon to
      produce such a vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects will become readily apparent to those
      skilled in the art from the following description and appended
      claims.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following detailed description and procedures are provided to
      illustrate the principles of the invention. They are not, however,
      intended to limit the invention, which extends to the full scope
      of the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      A. Preparation of Extracts<br>
      <br>
      The fifty six (56) subject herbs were obtained from China in
      extract form, packaged in ampoules for parenteral use. However,
      the extracts of the present invention can be prepared from the
      subject herbs by utilizing the procedures set forth below, or any
      organic extraction procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Cut into small pieces, one kilogram of dried herb. Soak the cut
      herb pieces in eight liters (8 L) of water at room temperature for
      six to eight hours, and then boil under reflux for one (1) hour.
      Decant the extract, filter it through a 0.45 .mu.m membrane
      filter, and concentrate to one liter (1 L).<br>
      <br>
      To the concentrated extract, add three liters (3 L) of 100%
      ethanol, and maintain the mixture at room temperature for
      forty-eight (48) hours. Decant, filter and concentrate the extract
      to one liter (1 L) as above. Repeat this ethanol precipitation two
      (2) more times.<br>
      <br>
      Add 0.3% charcoal into the concentrated extract and boil the
      charcoal-extract mixture for five (5) minutes. Filter the extract
      again.<br>
      <br>
      To the filtered extract, add 10% sodium hydroxide until pH7. The
      final extract concentration obtained using these procedures should
      be 1 g herb/ml.<br>
      <br>
      B. Determination Of The Subtoxic Concentrations Of Herbal Extracts<br>
      <br>
      Before assessing the anti-HIV activity of the fifty-six (56) CHEs,
      toxicity studies were performed to ensure that the observed
      activity could not be attributed to the indiscriminate destruction
      of the host lymphocytes by the CHE. For these studies, the
      standard laboratory methods for T cell toxicity testing were
      followed. Chang et al., Antiviral Research 9:163-176 (1988);
      Merchant et al., Handbook of Cell and Organ Culture, Burgess
      Publishing Co., Minneapolis, Minn. (1960).<br>
      <br>
      Briefly, the CHE extract to be tested was diluted two-fold
      serially in medium. To 0.2 ml of the diluted extract, 0.8 ml of a
      freshly prepared H9 cell suspension was added. (The H9 cells had
      been obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
      (A.T.C.C.).) This was done in duplicate; and a medium control was
      included in every assay. This medium control consisted of 0.8 ml
      of the same H9 cell suspension added to 0.2 ml of medium; and the
      control was done in quadruplicate. After 4 days of incubation, the
      number of viable cells in each culture was counted with a
      hemacytometer by dye exclusion. When the viable count of
      extract-treated culture was 2 S.D. below the mean of the medium
      control, the extract-treated culture was considered to show
      evidence of cytotoxicity. The highest concentration of an extract
      which showed no evidence of cytotoxicity was taken as the subtoxic
      concentration, or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD's for the
      ten (10) CHEs exhibiting anti-HIV activity are disclosed in Table
      II which follows:<br>
      <br>
      TABLE II<br>

      #44 40<br>
      #49 20<br>
      <br>
      C. Neutralization Assay<br>
      <br>
      Having determined their MTDs, the fifty-six (56) CHEs were then
      screened for their inhibitory activity against HIV-IIIB in H9
      cells. (The HIV-IIIB had been obtained from Drs. Popovic and
      Gallo.) Employing a standard neutralization assay, which assay is
      described in the literature, HIV expression was detected by p24
      production in the culture supernatant. Ho et al., Science
      239:1021-1023 (1988); and Ho et al., J. Virol. 61:2024 (1987).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective doses) for
      the HIV-IIIB isolate was placed in contact with 1.times.10@6 human
      T lymphocytes, one hour after the CHE under investigation was
      added at varying doses. This culture was then followed for seven
      days and observed for signs of viral expression, as measured by
      the production of HIV core protein p24. A particular CHE was not
      deemed to have anti-HIV activity unless 90% of viral replication
      was blocked, as compared to control cultures.<br>
      <br>
      An ID50 and ID90 (amount of CHE necessary to inhibit 50% and 90%
      of viral replication, respectively) was also calculated for each
      of the ten CHEs that exhibited anti-HIV activity. In addition, by
      dividing the MTD by the ID50, a therapeutic index was obtained.
      Generally, the therapeutic index (T.I.) is a measure of both drug
      efficacy and safety, and a high therapeutic index is desirable.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 demonstrates the anti-HIV activity of each of the ten (10)
      CHEs against the lab isolate IIIB. In brief, the ID50 for the ten
      (10) subject CHEs ranged from 0.15 .mu.l to 1.80 .mu.l, while the
      ID90 ranged from 0.38 .mu.l to 2.70 .mu.l. The T.I. for these same
      ten (10) ranged from 22 to 173. These values are all presented in
      Table III below.<br>

      #49 20 0.24 0.53 83.33<br>
      <br>
      Using a similar method, the CHEs were then tested against seven
      (7) clinical isolates (J, AP, L, B, P, C, F) and two (2)
      additional HIV laboratory isolates, (AC and HIV2), in normal
      stimulated PBMNs. (The clinical isolates, and the AC laboratory
      isolate, had been obtained from AIDS patients treated at
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles, Calif. The HIV-2
      (LAV-2ROD) had been obtained from Luc Montagnier, at the Institute
      Pasteur, in France.) The ten (10) CHEs were found to exhibit
      anti-HIV activity against most of the clinical isolates; but with
      varying efficacy. Similarly, in FIG. 2, all ten (10) CHEs
      exhibited activity against the AC laboratory isolates, whereas
      only two (2) of the ten (10) CHEs (#41 and #49), in FIG. 3, showed
      appreciable inhibitory activity against the HIV2 isolate. The
      results of this method are discussed more particularly as follows:<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 4, CHE #1 exhibited greater than 90%
      inhibition for six (6) of the seven (7) primary HIV-1 isolates,
      with an ID90 ranging from 0.20 .mu.l to 3.5 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, CHE #8 was found to have equal or greater than 90%
      inhibition for the seven (7) primary isolates, with an ID90
      ranging between 0.35 .mu.l to 5.00 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 6, CHE #21 exhibited greater than 90%
      inhibition for all but one (1) of the seven (7) primary isolates,
      with an ID90 ranging from 1.74 .mu.l to 7.6 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 7, CHE #30 exhibited greater than 90% activity against
      five (5) ofthe seven (7) primary isolates, with an ID90 of 0.52
      .mu.l to 8.30 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates the neutralization activity for CHE #32. As the
      graph illustrates, CHE #32 exhibited ID90 activity against five
      (5) of the seven (7) primary isolates, with an ID90 ranging from
      0.52 .mu.l to 7.00 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 9, CHE #35 inhibited six (6) of the seven (7) primary
      isolates, with an ID90 ranging from 0.60 .mu.l to 8.2 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 10, only three (3) of the six (6) primary
      isolates were inhibited more than 90% by CHE #39, with an ID90
      ranging from 2.2 .mu.l to 10 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 11, all but one (1) primary isolate were inhibited greater
      than 90% by CHE #41, with an ID90 between 1.10 .mu.l to 5.00
      .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      CHE #44 exhibited greater than 90% inhibition against three (3) of
      the six (6) primary isolates in FIG. 12, with an ID90 ranging from
      1.00 .mu.l to 5.10 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 13, CHE #49 inhibited all seven (7) primary isolates by
      greater than 90%, with an ID90 of 0.62 .mu.l to 2.05 .mu.l.<br>
      <br>
      D. Syncytial Inhibition<br>
      <br>
      Formation of syncytia, with progression to cell death, is a
      characteristic feature of in vitro cell cultures infected with
      HIV. Syncytia formation depends upon the interaction of
      HIV-expressing cells with neighboring cells bearing the CD4
      differentiation antigen. Syncytial inhibition studies were
      therefore performed to determine whether a particular CHE had its
      primary effect upon the HIV envelope glycoproteins, or upon the
      uninfected target cells. Following a standard method, described in
      the literature, the two cell cultures Molt IIIB and HPBALL were
      employed as the sources of infected and uninfected cell specimens,
      respectively. See Lifson et al., Science 232:1123-7 (1986);
      Sodroski et al., Nature 322:470-4 (1986); and Lifson et al.,
      Nature 323:725-8 (1986).<br>
      <br>
      Varying amounts (0.3 .mu.l, 1.0 .mu.l, 3.0 .mu.l) of each of the
      ten (10) CHEs were preincubated separately with either the
      infected Molt IIIB or the uninfected HPBALL cells for a standard
      time period. The cells were then washed several times and the two
      cell types were mixed in culture. The percent syncytial inhibition
      of both methods was then evaluated for all CHEs by light
      microscopy eighteen (18) hours after mixing. Table IV lists the
      preliminary results of syncytial inhibition activity exhibited by
      each CHE studied.<br>

      *The results tabulated above were obtained from one (1) series of
      experiments. These experiments have not yet been repeated to
      verify the reproducability of the above results.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly, as tabulated above in Section A of Table IV, four (4) of
      the ten (10) CHEs (#1, #8, #32 and #35) exhibited greater than 90%
      inhibition of syncytia formation when the CHE was preincubated
      with the uninfected cells. However, only one (1) (#44) exhibited
      greater than 90% inhibition of syncytia formation when the CHE was
      preincubated with the infected cells.<br>
      <br>
      An additional experiment was thereafter performed to determine
      whether this anti-HIV activity produced by the CHEs occurred
      inside the cells. In this experiment, the cells were infected one
      (1) hour before adding the CHEs, using the reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor, AZT, as a control. In FIG. 14, 10 .mu.l of CHE #32
      exhibited 100% inhibition of HIV replication in the preinfected
      cells with both doses of HTLV-IIIB (50 TCID50 and 100 TCID50).
      This result appears to indicate that the observed in vitro
      anti-HIV activity may actually occur within the cell, although the
      precise mechanism for this activity is still being investigated.<br>
      <br>
      E. End-Point-Dilution Cultures<br>
      <br>
      The end-point-dilution culture method, as described in the
      literature, was used to determine whether the CHEs exhibited an
      anti-HIV effect in chronically infected H9/IIIB cells. Ho et al.,
      NEJM 321:1621-1625 (1989). As indicated in FIG. 15, 1 .mu.l of CHE
      #21 produced no viral titer change, although 10 .mu.l of CHE #21
      produced a 10 fold decrease in viral titer. Moreover, 1 .mu.l of
      CHE #32 produced a 2 fold decrease in viral titer, while 10 .mu.l
      produced a 10 fold decrease; and 1 .mu.l of CHE #49 decreased the
      viral titer 2 fold, while 10 .mu.l resulted in a 100 fold
      decrease.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, these results further strengthen the results obtained in
      the pre-infection studies in FIG. 14, (the cells were infected one
      hour before adding the CHEs), where it appeared that the anti-HIV
      activity of the CHEs may actually occur within the cell interior.
      However, as indicated above, the precise mechanism for the CHE
      activities is still under investigation.<br>
      <br>
      F. Reverse Transcriptase Assay<br>
      <br>
      The HIV III-B RT enzyme was isolated and mixed with varying
      amounts of each CHE, using a known reverse transcriptase (RT)
      biochemical assay. Ho et al., Science 226:451-453 (1984); Popovic
      et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 77:7415 (1980).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, virus particles were precipitated from cell-free
      supernatant as follows: 0.3 ml of 4M sodium chloride and 3.6 ml of
      30% (weight volume) polyethylene glycol (Carbowax 6000) were added
      to 8 ml of harvested culture fluids and the suspension was placed
      on ice overnight. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rev/min
      at 30 minutes. The precipitate was resuspended in 300 .mu.l of 50%
      (by volume) glycerol (25 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM dithiothreital,
      150 mM potassium chloride and 0.025% Triton X-100). Virus
      particles were disrupted by addition of 100 .mu.l of 0.9% Triton
      X-100/1.5M potassium chloride solution.<br>
      <br>
      The cell-free virus concentrate from a culture of H9/HIV III-B was
      layered on a 20 to 60% (by weight) sucrose gradient in 10 mM
      tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1M sodium chloride and 1 mM EDTA
      and centrifuged overnight at 35,000 rev/min. Fractions of 0.7 ml
      were collected from the bottom of the gradient and 10 .mu.l
      portions, in a final volume of 100 .mu.l containing 40 mM tris-HCl
      (pH 7.8), 4 mM dithiothreital, 45 mM potassium chloride and 50
      .mu.g of template--primer poly (A).dT12-18 and poly (C).dG12-18
      per ml (with 10 mM Mg@2+) or 50 .mu.l of poly (dA).dT12-18 per ml
      (with 0.25 mM Mn@2+) were assayed for RT at 37 DEG C. for 1 hour.
      The mixture also contained 15 .mu.M of the appropriate labeled
      deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, [@3 H]dTTP (16 Ci/mmole; 1
      Ci-3.7.times.10@10 becquerels) or [@3 H]dGTP (12 Ci/mmole). The
      amount of each CHE necessary to inhibit 50% and 90% of the HIV
      III-B RT activity is reported in Table V below and FIG. 16. As
      illustrated, the results indicate that seven (7) of the ten (10)
      CHEs exhibited greater than 90% RT inhibition.<br>

      G. Ex Vivo Experiments Utilizing CHEs #32 And #49, The Best Mode
      CHEs<br>
      <br>
      Having determined their in vitro anti-HIV activity, ex vivo
      experiments were conducted in order to provide an experimental
      model that resembles as closely as possible, in vivo conditions
      for the CHEs. Ho et al., PNAS, 87:6574-6578 (1990). For these
      experiments, CHEs #32 and #49 were utilized, as they were
      considered the leading candidates among the ten (10) CHEs for
      anti-HIV activity. These two (2) particular (CHEs) were selected
      based upon the experimental data to date. However, this selection
      of CHEs #32 and #49 as the best mode CHEs is not meant to
      foreclose other possibilities, as future experiments may identify
      other more effective anti-HIV agents among the ten (10) CHEs.<br>
      <br>
      Plasma and PBMNs were obtained from three (3) patients and denoted
      as follows: A, for a patient with AIDS; R for a patient with ARC;
      and H for a healthy patient. An end-point-dilution culture method
      as described above, was used for serial quantitation of HIV-1 in
      the PMBNs and plasma of the three (3) patients, and serum p24 core
      antigen levels were measured as a marker of viral burden. In FIG.
      17, the HIV titers in PBMNs are illustrated on the top graph; and
      the HIV titers in plasma are illustrated on the bottom graph.<br>
      <br>
      HIV-1 was recovered from the PBMNs of all three (3) patients, with
      titers ranging from 10 to 1,000 TCID/10@6 cells, and a mean titer
      of 370 TCID/10@6 cells. When 1 .mu.l of CHE #32 was added,
      however, HIV-1 was detected in titers ranging from 10 to 100
      TCID/10@6 cells, a 10 fold decrease in viral titers. When 10 .mu.l
      of CHE #32 was added, viral titers in all patients were decreased
      to 1 TCID/10@6 cells. Meanwhile, the total HIV-1 titers in plasma
      before the addition of CHE ranged from less than 1 to 10 TCID/ml,
      and a mean value of 3.3 TCID/ml. However, the addition of 1 .mu.l
      or 10 .mu.l of CHE #32 decreased viral titers to less than 1 to 1
      TCID/ml.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 18, in PBMNs treated with 0.1 .mu.l of CHE
      #49, HIV titers decreased from a mean titer of 370 TCID/10@6 to 10
      TCID/10@6 cells. The addition of 1 .mu.l of CHE #49 further
      reduced the viral titer to 0.67 TCID/10@6 cells. In plasma,
      however, 0.1 .mu.l of CHE #49 produced no change in HIV titer,
      although 1 .mu.l reduced the HIV titer 10 fold.<br>
      <br>
      These experiments and the resulting data demonstrate that CHEs may
      be a rich source for potential in vivo anti-HIV therapy in an
      infected host. As illustrated, ten (10) of the fifty-six (56) CHEs
      tested were found to exhibit dose dependent anti-HIV activity in
      vitro. Five (5) of these CHEs (#1, #8, #32, #35 and #44) also
      demonstrated substantial syncytial inhibition activity, while
      seven (7) CHEs (#8, #30, #32, #39, #41, #44 and #49) exhibited
      inhibitory activity against reverse transcriptase. Finally, CHEs
      #32 and #49 even exhibited ex vivo dose dependent anti-HIV
      activity in patient plasma and PBMNs.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Liver diseases have great impact on human health. Hepatitis is a
      kind of liver diseases, which is caused by liver inflammation due
      to infection of a variety of pathogens, which include, but are not
      limited to, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Hepatitis can
      be categorized as acute, chronic, or fulminant.<br>
      <br>
      Viral hepatitis is an enterically transmitted liver disease due to
      viral infection. The major transmission means for viral hepatitis
      is through ingestion. Viral hepatitis can also be transmitted
      through blood transfusion or similar means of
      hepatitis-virus-carrying blood or blood product such as blood
      plasma. Viral hepatitis is widespread around the world. For
      example, there are approximately thirty million (30,000,000) viral
      hepatitis patients in China including an estimated number of nine
      million (9,000,000) new patients each year, and about one hundred
      million (100,000,000) hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. It is
      estimated that 10% of the pregnant women in China are HBV
      carriers. About one hundred thousand (100,000) people in China die
      of liver cancer originated as liver diseases each year.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the major etiologic agent, viral hepatitis is
      categorized into Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis
      D, and Hepatitis E. Hepatitis A is caused by hepatitis A virus
      (HAV); Hepatitis A can affect anyone and occur in isolated cases
      as well as widespread epidemics. Hepatitis B is a serious disease
      caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV attacks the liver and can
      cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver
      cancer, liver failure, and death. Hepatitis C is caused by
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D
      virus (HDV) which is a defective single-stranded RNA virus that
      requires the helper function of HBV to replicate and to synthesize
      envelope protein composed of HBsAg to encapsulate HDV's genome.
      Hepatitis E is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is an
      etiologic agent of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis.
      HEV is a spherical, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of
      approximately 32 to 34 nm in diameter. HEV has been provisionally
      classified in the Caliciviridae family; however, the organization
      of the HEV genome is substantially different from that of other
      Caliciviruses, and HEV may eventually be classified in a separate
      family.<br>
      <br>
      The most common types of viral hepatitis are Hepatitis A,
      Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis E, which have similar
      major symptoms including decreased appetite, nausea, unease upper
      abdomen, lack of strength, etc. Acute jaundice is also one of the
      common symptoms. Chronic hepatitis is very difficult to cure.
      Severe hepatitis often comes on quickly and results in high
      mortality.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional Chinese herbal compositions have been developed and
      shown success for preventing and treating various liver diseases.
      The types of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating
      hepatitis include medications having single or multiple herbal
      components and medications made of active ingredients extracted
      from the herbs.<br>
      <br>
      For example, Qianglining injection solution is made of
      glycyrrhizic acid extracted from licorice (Glycyrrhiza).
      Glycyrrhizic acid reacts with ammonia to form a water-soluble
      ammonium salt of glycyrrhizic acid, which then can compound with
      amino acids. The injection solution is useful for treating chronic
      viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatoma. The total
      effective rate of qianglining injection solution is about 87.5%,
      in which 64.1% is significant, according to clinical studies
      conducted on hepatitis patients provided by Shanghai Huashan
      Hospital, Shanghai, China.<br>
      <br>
      Yanhuanglian injection solution is derived from ground herb
      Yanhuanglian grown in Guangxi Province in China. The solution is
      useful for treating various types of hepatitis, liver cirrhosis,
      and liver cancer, with a reported clinical efficacy rate of
      81.47%. The solution has an effective rate of 93.88% in cases
      involving acute jaundice patients, 87.50% in non-jaundice type
      hepatitis patients, 87.09% in chronic active type hepatitis
      patients, 69.23% in prolonged type hepatitis patients, and 80.95%
      in chronic cirrhosis patients. However, only 17.91% of the
      patients show changes of HBV surface antigen from positive to
      negative.<br>
      <br>
      Shandougen (Radix Sophorae Tonkinensis) injection solution is
      useful for both acute and chronic viral hepatitis, and especially
      effective for chronic active hepatitis. As studied by Guangxi
      Medical College in Guangxi province, China, the total effective
      rate is 91.79% for chronic active hepatitis patients, and the
      substantial effective rate is 54.23%. Also, 64.93% of the
      patients' glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) level returns to
      normal in two (2) months after the treatment. However, some
      patients show recurring symptoms of hepatitis after the treatment
      is discontinued.<br>
      <br>
      Umbellate pore fungus (Polyporus umbellata) injection solution has
      functions of improving immune function, inhibiting tumor, lowering
      level of transaminase, and inhibiting replication of hepatitis
      virus. After treating patients with chronic viral hepatitis with
      umbellate pore fungus injection solution, 35.6% of the patients
      return to normal serum GPT (SGPT) level, 76.61% of the patients
      show some lowering effects on transaminase level, 38.6% of the
      patients show HBV E antigen turning negative, and 13.1% of the
      patients show surface antigen turning negative.<br>
      <br>
      Qidun fruit acid tablet has a total effective rate of 94.4% in
      patients with acute jaundice-type hepatitis. The total recovery
      rate is 64.8%. Qidun fruit acid tablet also shows an effective
      rate of 69.8% in chronic active hepatitis, in which 43.7% of the
      patients show a significant effect. The rate for HBsAg positive
      turning negative is 16.8%.<br>
      <br>
      Gandezhi (Liver-curing) capsule has Wuren alcohol, scutellarin,
      mulberry fruit-spike (Fructus Mori Albae), salvia root (Radix
      Salviae Miltiorrhizae), and licorice (Radix Glycyrrhizae
      Uralensis) and is useful for lowering transaminase level. It has
      an effective rate of 80.0% for treating prolonged hepatitis and
      chronic hepatitis, according to studies reported by Guangzhou
      Zhongshan Medical College Hospital in China. There has been no
      report which shows that Gandzhi has effect on HBV Antigen turning
      negative.<br>
      <br>
      Danggui (Chinese angelica root) pill is made of Chinese angelica
      root (Radix Angelicae Sinensis) and licorice (Radix Glycyrrhizae
      Uralensis). In a study conducted by Beijing Medical College in
      China, Danggui pill is effective for treating prolonged hepatitis
      (with an effective rate of 84.4%), chronic hepatitis (with an
      effective rate of 79.1%), and cirrhosis resulted from hepatitis
      (with an effective rate of 73.6%).<br>
      <br>
      Hugang (liver-protecting) tablet is made from schisandra fruit
      (Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis) alcohol extractant,
      liver-protecting extractant (including Junchen, Zihu, and woad
      root (isatis root, Radix Isatidis seu Baphicacanthi)), and biliary
      powder, etc. It has an effective rate of 95.08% for treating
      chronic hepatitis (70% with significant effect), and 82.5% for
      treating cirrhosis (63% with significant effect).<br>

      Jigu ("chicken bone") grass pill is made of Jigu grass, billiary
      powder, and bovine bezoar (Calculus Bovis). As studied by Beijing
      Children's Hospital in China, Jigu grass pill has a total
      effective rate of 100% in patients with acute viral hepatitis,
      73.3% in patients with chronic active hepatitis, 70.4% in patients
      with chronic prolonged type hepatitis. However, Jigu grass pill
      does not appear to have any effect on other types of prolonged
      hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      Wuzi ("five ester") capsule is made from schisandra fruit (Fructus
      Schisandrae Chinensis) alcohol extractant. It shows function of
      lowering GPT level and is useful for treating chronic prolonged
      hepatitis. The total effective rate of wuzi capsule is 95.33%, in
      which 74.21% is significant.<br>
      <br>

      Miltiorrhizae), finger citron fruit (Fructus Citri Sarcodactylis),
      hawthorn fruit (Fructus Crataegi), Ganoderma Lucidum, Ophiopogon
      tuber (Tuber Ophiopogonis Japonici), and silkworm feces
      (Excrementum Bombycis Mori). The formulation has been used for
      treating infectious HBV, acute and chronic hepatitis, early-stage
      cirrhosis, swollen liver and spleen, etc. It has a total effective
      rate of 84.75% and an HBsAg turning negative rate of 41.35%, as
      shown in the study of 314 HBV patients at Xian Medical University
      Second Affiliated Hospital in China.<br>
      <br>
      Ganpikang ("liver-spleen" health) capsule contains fourteen (14)
      herbal components including bupleurum (Radix Bupleuri), San-qi,

      that 78% of the patients having HBeAg turned negative, 28-57% of
      the patients having HBsAg turned negative.<br>
      <br>
      However, despite the effectiveness of the above herbal medicinal
      compositions in treating hepatitis, none of these compositions
      demonstrates significant effects on HBV antigen turning negative.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a novel pharmaceutical composition
      for treating liver diseases, particularly for treating patients
      with viral hepatitis (e.g., HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV), alcoholic or
      fatty liver, and liver cancer. The compositions described in the

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Traditional Chinese medicine has been in existence for more than
      two thousand years. It has a proven record of success for curing
      many kinds of diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine utilizes a
      variety of herbs and natural substances. Each herb/natural
      substance has its unique characteristics. By combining and
      balancing the unique characteristics of herbs, a doctor can
      prescribe a formulation with enhanced medicinal activities and
      with less or no toxicity by synergizing the medicinal effects
      among various herbs, while in the meantime, cancelling out or
      neutralizing the toxic effects of the herbs. This, in Chinese
      herbal medicine, is regarded as to regulate between
      negative/hypoactive characteristics ("yin") and
      positive/hyperactive characteristics ("yang"),<br>
      <br>
      Under the definitions set forth in the traditional Chinese
      medicine, "yin" is defined as drugs which cure cold syndrome
      (which itself has hot or warm property), and "yang" is defined as
      drugs which cure heat syndrome (which itself has cold or cool
      property).<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical combination of the present invention comprises
      fifteen (15) ingredients, in which four (4) ingredients are the
      core ingredients which contribute to the primary efficacy and
      healing effect of the composition. They are: (1) diffuse
      hedyotis/spreading hedyotis (Pharmaceutical name: Herba Hedyotidis
      diffusae; Botanical name: Hedyotis diffusa Willd.); (2) bistort
      rhizome (Pharmaceutical name: Rhizoma Bistortae; Botanical name:
      Polygonum bistorta L.); (3) giant knotweed rhizome (Pharmaceutical
      name: Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidati; Botanical name: Polygonum
      cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc.), and (4) Chinese magnoliavine fruit
      (Pharmaceutical name: Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis; Botanical
      name: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., S. sphenanthera Rehd.
      et Wils.). The core ingredients are functioned in clearing heat
      and toxic substances while improving immune system and
      circulation, curing symptoms of jaundice, and having beneficial
      effect on internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      There are six (6) additional ingredients that are used to improve
      and balance the pharmaceutical effects activities produced by the
      above named core ingredients. These six ingredients also have
      toning effect and can improve blood circulation in the liver.
      These six ingredients are: (1) Asiatic moonseed rhizome
      (Pharmaceutical name: Rhizoma Menispermi; Botanical name:
      Menisermum dauricum DC); (2) baical skullcap root (Pharmaceutical
      name: Radix Scutellariae; Botanical name: Scutellaria baicalensis
      Georgi); (3) bovine biliary powder (Zoological name: Vesica Fellea
      Bovus); (4) tumeric root-tuber (Pharmaceutical name: Radix
      Curcumae; Botanical name: Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Lee et Cl Ling);
      (5) Hawthorn Fruit (Pharmaceutical name: Fructus Crataegi;
      Botanical name: Crataegus pinnatifida Bge.); and (6) sanqui
      (Pharmaceutical name: Radix Notoginseng; Botanical name: Panax
      notoginseng (Burk.)).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, there are additional five (5) ingredients which are used
      to primarily provide nutrients and energy sources for patients so
      as to expedite the recovery process. These ingredients include:

      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Efficacy of the YGK Herbal Composition on Treatment of
        Patients with Hepatitis B (HBV)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The clinical research was conducted in the Liberty Military
      Hospital 211 in China. The course of hepatitis B is determined by
      many factors, including immune response, host genetic factors, and
      HBV mutations. The chronic hepatitis distinguishes from the acute
      hepatitis. The acute hepatitis is the active and symptomatic
      infection of the liver. A patient with the acute hepatitis is
      contagious. Symptoms of acute HBV infection are non-specific, but
      may include malaise, anorexia or jaundice. A chronic hepatitis
      patient is asymptomatic. The HBV is present in the liver and
      blood, although there are usually no obvious physical symptoms.
      Specific blood tests will reveal the presence of the virus, and
      the patient is also contagious via blood, birth, sex, needles,
      etc. Cirrhosis is the pathological dysfunctional state of the
      liver, the hardening of the liver as the result of chronic
      hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) and chronic active
      hepatitis (CAH).<br>
      <br>
      A total of 948 patients with acute HBV, chronic HBV, and liver
      cirrhosis participated in a clinical comparative study. The
      patients were divided into two (2) groups. The study group had 642
      patients and the comparative group has 306 patients. The data on
      patients who participated in this study are listed in Table 3.<br>

      <br>
      The patients were treated according to the following regime:<br>
      <br>
      (1) The patients in the study group were each orally administered
      eight (8) YCK herbal composition containing the herbal composition
      of the present invention per day.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The patients in the comparative group were each orally
      administered four (4) Hugang ("liver protecting") tablets per day.
      A description of Hugang tablets has been provided in the
      "Background" section, supra.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment lasts for ninety (90) days.<br>
      <br>
      Table 4 shows the results of this clinical comparative study.<br>

      &nbsp; *Positive effect means that the hepatitis B envelope
      antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA of the patients turn negative after
      taking the YGK herbal composition for 90 days.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated in Table 4, approximately 71.03% of patients who took
      the YGK herbal composition for 90 days show positive responses to
      the herbal composition. This is contrary to the comparative group
      where the patients were given a popular "liver protecting" tablets
      which were available in the Chinese market. Patients who had taken
      the "liver protecting" tablets only have an effective rate of
      approximately 33.98% to show improvement in their liver diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of a surface and a core. The
      core contains a DNA polymerase and an e antigen. The DNA structure
      is double stranded and circular. HBV has four (4) genes encoding
      four (4) polypeptides: the S (surface), the C (core), the P
      (polymerase), and the X (transcriptional transactivating).<br>
      <br>
      The S gene consists of three (3) regions, the pre-S 1 region, the
      pre-S2 region, and the region that encodes the surface protein
      (HBsAg). Very rarely a mutation occurs in the S gene which aborts
      the production of HBsAg so that a person maybe HBsAg negative but
      still has the virus present as determined by HBV DNA. In addition,
      the HBsAg particles are antigenically complex and the antigenic
      determinants have been identified as one single common determinant
      designated a, and four (4) major subdeterminants designated as d,
      y, w, and r. Thus, the four (4) major determinants are adw, adr,
      ayw, and ayr.<br>
      <br>
      The C gene consists of two (2) regions, the pre-core region and
      the core region, which encodes for two different proteins, the
      core antigen (HBcAg), and the e antigen (HBeAg). A mutation in the
      pre-core region may stop the production of HBeAg, thus, a person
      maybe HBeAg negative, but HBsAg positive and HBV DNA positive.
      Another type of mutant in the core region is called HBV2. The
      patients that have HBV2 mutant are HBsAg positive but lack HBeAg
      and HBV DNA.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the complexity and the antigenic differences among the
      virus, there are a number of tests available for HBV including:<br>
      <br>
      (1) a test for HBsAg, which is an indicator of the presence of the
      HBV;<br>
      <br>
      (2) a test for HBeAg, which correlates with the viral replication
      and infectivity, it indicates a high amount of the virus in the
      blood, thus, is an indicator of the activity and infectivity of
      the HBV; and<br>
      <br>
      (3) a test for HBV DNA, which is an indication of the virus
      presence and activity.<br>
      <br>
      Tables 5-7 indicated the change of Hepatitis B envelope Antigen
      ("HBeAg"), Hepatitis B surface antigen ("HBsAg"), heptomegaly, and
      splenomegaly in the patients after the treatment.<br>

      EXAMPLE 3<br>
      Effects of the YGK Herbal Composition on Treatement of Patients
      with Chronic Hepatitis B (HBV)<br>
      <br>
      The clinical research was conducted in the Liberty Military 302
      Hospital, Ninth Section, China. The research was conducted on
      treatment effects of the herbal composition of the present
      invention on chronic hepatitis B patients.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic Hepatitis is an ongoing injury to the cells of the liver
      with inflammation which lasts for longer than six months. The
      causes of chronic hepatitis include: viruses, metabolic or
      immunologic abnormalities and medications. Symptoms resulted from
      the injury of hepatocytes, the inflammation or from the resulting
      scarring is called cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis may follow acute
      hepatitis B or C or may develop quietly without an acute illness.
      Liver biopsy is helpful in that it confirms the diagnosis, aids in
      establishing the cause (etiology) and can demonstrate the presence
      of cirrhosis. It is less helpful in judging the response to
      treatment. Approximately 25% patients with chronic hepatitis B
      will develop cirrhosis, causing permanent and serious liver
      damage. Chronic carriers of HBV are far more likely to develop
      hepatocellular carcinoma than non-carriers.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that chronic infections develop as the result of a
      weak T helper (Th) cell response to the virus, in particular to
      the HBsAg. The T cell response is responsible for clearing the
      infected cells in the host's system. When the clearance is
      inefficient and the infected cells persist in the body, a chronic
      infection develops. As the HBsAg titer increases, the patient
      moves into acute, symptomatic disease. When the titer of
      anti-HBsAg rises, the symptoms of HBV begin to decline and patient
      reaches the immune state.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic hepatitis has been divided into two categories based on
      histologic findings: chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) and
      chronic active hepatitis (CAH). Characteristically, specimens from
      liver biopsy identified as CPH show inflammation confined to the
      portal triad (does not penetrate the limiting plate). Specimens
      identified as CAH show inflammation that penetrates the limiting
      plate, extending to the surrounding individual hepatocyte and
      yielding piecemeal necrosis. Under this schema, CAH eventually
      reaches a point where lobular architecture is destroyed, and bands
      of necrosis (bridging necrosis) are replaced by scar tissue
      (bridging fibrosis), resulting in the characteristic features of
      cirrhosis.<br>

      <br>
      As indicated above, HBsAg can be detected in patients with acute
      infection as well as patients who are chronic HBV carriers. In the
      serological test, decreased titer of HBsAg indicates that the
      symptoms of HBV are lessened and the patient is approaching the
      immune state.<br>

      <br>
      As indicated in Table 9, the YGK herbal composition has
      significant effects on chronic hepatitis patients. Patients
      treated with the YGK herbal composition have Serum Glutamic
      Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT/ALT) recovery rate of 73.33%, HBeAg
      turning negative rate of 46.15%, HBV-DNA turning negative rate of
      60.00%, suggesting that the YGK herbal composition has significant
      effects on inhibition of HBV replication and presence and
      depletion of aminotransferase. In addition, there was no toxic
      adverse reaction on the patients treated with the YGK herbal
      composition, accodring to clinical obervation.<br>

      </b><b>Case Studies on Effects of the YGK Herbal Composition on
        Patients with Hepatitis B</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The clinical research was conducted in the Contagious Disease
      Department of People's Liberation Army Hospital Branch 113 in
      China. The research was conducted on treatment effects of the YGK
      herbal composition on hepatitis B patients.<br>
      <br>
      Each patient was tested for various markers. Serum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme appears in liver cells, with
      lesser amounts in the kidneys, heart, and skeletal muscles. When
      such damage occurs, ALT is released from the liver cells into the
      bloodstream, often before jaundice appears, resulting in
      abnormally high serum level of ALT that last for days or weeks.
      ALT is a relatively specific indicator of acute liver cell damage.
      Serum bilirubin (BIL) is also tested as an indication of liver
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Case #1 was a twenty-four years old male patient with chronic
      hepatitis B, with general weakness for more than one year. Table

      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Effects of the YGK Herbal Composition On Animals With Liver
        Diseases</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The animal study was conducted at Korean Central Research Center.<br>
      Experiment 5.1<br>
      Analysis of Effect on Alcoholic or Fatty Liver in White Rats<br>
      <br>
      Purpose<br>
      <br>
      The experiment was conducted to investigate effects of the herbal
      composition on alcohol metabolism in white rats, especially, the
      influence on the ability to transform alcohol to triglyceride and
      cholesterol. The experimental dosage was 1 g/kg.<br>
      <br>
      Method<br>
      <br>
      The experimental animal used was male SD white rat with weight of
      200 g. Blood sampling of the experimental animal was taken through
      orbital vein plexus. The animal was administered for the herbal
      composition of the present invention three (3) times a day for
      seven (7) days.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental animals were divided into the control group and
      the study group. The control group animals were administered
      alcohol for one week. The study group animanls were administered
      alcohol and concomitantly with 1 g/kg of the YGK herbal
      composition for one week. The rats' livers were tested for
      triglyceride and cholesterol level, lipid hyperoxidation, and
      glutathione peptide.<br>
      <br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      After one (1) week of alcohol administration, triglyceride and
      cholesterol levels in the rats' liver were increased; lipid
      hyperoxidation and diminished glutathione peptide occurred in the
      control group. In contrast, in the study group, the fatty
      metamorphosis of the liver was inhibited. Also, the processes of
      lipid hyperoxidation and diminished glutathione peptide were
      inhibited in the study group animals.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion<br>
      <br>
      The YGH herbal composition prevents accumulation of triglyceride
      and cholesterol levels in the liver which follows alcohol
      consumption, thus providing beneficiary effects on the liver
      functions.<br>

      Purpose<br>
      <br>
      The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the YGK
      herbal compositions on protein synthesis in white rats with liver
      cirrhosis.<br>
      <br>
      Method<br>
      <br>
      The experimental animal used was male SD white rat with weight of
      200 g. Blood sampling of the experimental animal was taken through
      orbital vein plexus. The animal was administered for the herbal
      composition of the present invention three (3) times a day for
      seven (7) days.<br>
      <br>
      1. Induction of Liver Cirrhosis in the Rats<br>
      <br>
      The rats were injected subcutaneously on the back with 1 ml/200 g
      50% chloroform (CCl4) diluted in olive oil, for three (3) times a
      week for four (4) weeks. Liver biopsy was conducted through
      midline laparotomy. Most animals needed six (6) weeks of injection
      to induce liver cirrhosis. The injection dosage was adjusted each
      week in accordance to the weight of the rats.<br>
      <br>
      Due to liver cirrhosis and partial liver resection, the serum
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) significantly increased in the rats.<br>
      <br>
      2. Treating Rats with the YGK Herbal Composition<br>
      <br>
      The rats in the study group were subdivided into three (3) groups
      which were respectively administered the YGK herbal composition of
      the present invention for 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, or 2000 mg/kg.<br>
      <br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      1. ALT and AST Levels: after the treatment with the YGK herbal
      composition, the serum ALT and AST levels decreased in all three
      (3) different dosage treatment groups. The liver cirrhosis process
      was inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      2. Hepatocyte Regeneration: after the administration of the herbal
      composition in three (3) different doses, the rates of liver
      regeneration in the rats were 19%, 30%, and 47%, respectively,
      higher than the rats with liver cirrhosis and partially resected
      livers which were not treated with the herbal composition, and the
      rates of liver regeneration in the treated rats were also 51%,
      70%, and 92%, respectively, higher than the partially liver
      resected rats with normal liver functions.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion<br>
      <br>
      The YGK herbal composition was effective in liver regeneration and
      had effectively inhibited the liver cirrhosis process.<br>

      </b><br>
      Purpose<br>
      <br>
      The following experiment was conducted in the Military Medical
      Research Institute in China to examine the effectiveness of the
      YGK herbal composition of the present invention in the form of
      intravenous product against HIV.<br>
      <br>
      Methods<br>
      <br>
      MT4 cells were cultured in HIV-1 suspension liquid of 100 TCID50
      in a 96-hole culture plate. The culture condition was set at a
      temperature of 37[deg.] C. and under 5% CO2. The culture time was
      seven (7) days.<br>
      <br>
      The YGK herbal composition of the present invention were added
      into the wells at various concentrations. The morphology of the
      MT4 cells were observed by conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      No pathological changes of MT4 cells were observed in wells where
      the YGK herbal composition was added to in adequate
      concentrations. The inhibition of the pathological changes of MT4
      cells indicated that the YGK herbal composition had inhibitory
      effect on pathological changes of the cultured cells caused by

      </b><br>
      Purpose<br>
      <br>
      The following clinical trial was conducted in the Infectious
      Disease Hospital in Shanghai, China to test the effectiveness of
      the herbal composition of the present invention in treating an
      HIV-infected patient.<br>
      <br>
      Methods<br>
      <br>
      A fifty-year Chinese male patient diagnosed with HIV infection
      complicated by herpes zoster was treated with anti-virus regimens
      by the combination of western medicine and the herbal composition
      of the present invention during hospital stay.<br>
      <br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      The patient was confirmed of HIV-infection by Rapid Agglutinin
      Assay. At the time of the initial diagnosis in August 1996, the
      patient showed no symptoms. Starting Jun. 1, 1997, the patient
      quickly developed an herpetiform rash over the front of the left
      side of the check extending over the nick, the shoulder, and the
      upper left arm. The patient was then admitted into the Hospital in
      Jun. 24, 1997.<br>
      <br>
      At the hospital, the result of the physical examination was normal
      except the skin rash. The pathology tests confirmed normal renal
      function. The functional tests of the liver showed a slightly
      increased levels of serum [gamma] glutamyl transpeptidase and
      acetyl glucuronidase. Hepatitis viral tests showed negative for
      Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus (HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA).
      However, Hepatitis G viral test showed positive for HGV-RNA. The
      immunological studies showed that the [beta]-2 microglobulin level
      was 2.4-2.5 mg/ml.<br>
      <br>
      During the hospital stay, haemoglobin and erythrocytes levels of
      the patient were slightly decreased, while the levels of the
      leukocyte and platelet were normal. Peripheral blood lymphocytes
      counts showed that T4 cells were decreased to 2.76*10/L (32.9%)
      and the ratio of T4/T8 cell was 1.16. Thus, the diagnosis is that
      the patient was with HIV infection complicated by herpes zoster.<br>
      <br>
      During hospital stay, the patient had diarrhea and dry cough for a
      few days and was cured. In September, 1997, the patient showed HIV
      antibody positive by ELISA, and his T4 cells further decreased to
      25.4% and the ratio of T4/T8 cells was inverted to 0.94. Then, T4
      cells and the ratio of T4/T8 gradually increased after treatment
      with the YGK herbal composition and as tested in November 1997,
      his T4 cells were 40.7%, and the ratio of T4/T8 1.45. The skin
      rash gradually disappeared and completely recovered by the end of
      November.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion<br>
      <br>
      The YGK herbal composition was effective in reducing symptoms of
      the HIV-infected patient in a treatment regime together with
      western medicine.<br>
