      <p align="center"><i>Inventor's design consumes no fuel, emits no
          fumes</i> </p>
      <p>Devices that have truly improved the human condition - such as
        electricity, the telephone and the airplane - were created by
        people who passionately believe their inventions would make the
        world a better place to live. Troy Reed of Tulsa, Oklahoma is
        such a person. </p>
      <p>Reed has invented and patented a motor that consumes no fuel
        and emits no fumes. It is powerful enough to turn a 7,000-watt
        generator, which is enough electricity to run an average home.
        Production of the Reed Magnetic Motor for use by the general
        public may begin by year's end. </p>
      <p>Reed, 57, has also invented an automobile called "Surge" that
        employs his new technology. Unlike a battery-powered car, Reed's
        Surge does not have to be plugged in to be recharged. The car
        recharges itself as it rolls down the highway at speeds of up to
        85 miles an hour. Reed and actor Dennis Weaver, a cousin and
        inventor in the project, plan to make the first highway test-run
        of the car this summer. </p>
      <p>Reed said he has been contacted about coverage of the test run
        by, among others, 20/20, 60 Minutes, Larry King Live, Primetime
        Live and CNN. A representative of CNN, Reed said, has already
        seen the car and might broadcast daily updates during the
        journey. </p>
      <p>The idea for this technology came to Reed in a number of dreams
        and visions over the past 35 years. He said he got the first in
        1959 while employed as a machinist making 70 cents an hour.
        Thirty years later, in 1989, he put those dreams to the test,
        turning a hand crank that put the first Reed Magnetic Motor in
        motion. That prototype was seven feet tall, weighed more than
        500 pounds, had four moving parts and powered a 500-watt
        generator. His latest motor takes two car batteries to start
        (they are re-charged by the generator), is 20 inches high,
        weighs less than 200 pounds, has one moving part and runs a
        7000-watt generator. </p>
      <p>If Reed's motor works as well as he says it does, it would be a
        rather amazing technological breakthrough. After all, it would
        mean a person could live anywhere one wanted with all the
        comforts and never have to pay an electric bill. One would also
        be able to drive to work, or anywhere else, without consuming
        fuel. And best of all, one could do these things without
        polluting the environment. </p>
      <p>Although most people have never heard of the Reed Magnetic
        Motor, it is well known in the science world. Since 1989 Reed
        and his motor have been featured at numerous international
        scientific conferences - the most recent on in Denver in March.
        Reed also has been written up in scientific journals and is
        included in the latest edition of Monuments of Mars, a book of
        inventors written by former NASA science writer Richard
        Hoagland. </p>
      <p>If Reed has his way, his motor soon will no longer be a
        scientific curiosity. Currently he is in the final stages of
        granting a license to produce the motor to an American company
        and a company in India. Reed would not give the names of the
        companies because he said he is still "negotiating." </p>
      <p>"I've been approached by lots of companies from all over the
        world," Reed said. "I wanted the company that builds this motor
        to be doing it for the same reason I developed it - to help
        mother earth." </p>
      <p>Reed did say that the companies granted licenses would start
        producing the motors for the consumer almost immediately. "The
        technology is already there, it is just a matter of putting all
        together the right way to make it work," Reed said. </p>
      <p>The 1989 prototype uses a horizontal shaft with several magnets
        on it. Above the shaft are four vertical spring-loaded pistons
        with a magnet on the end closest to the shaft. Turning the hand
        crank spins the horizontal shaft and the magnetic spring-loaded
        pistons move up and down to trigger the motion of the shaft and
        the magnetic force field. Once the shaft is put into motion, it
        continues to spin until a brake is applied. </p>
      <p>Instead of moveable pistons, the latest model of the motor uses
        and electronic system and stationary magnets to start and
        control the motion of the shaft. Consequently, the only moving
        part in the motor is the horizontal shaft. In the current model,
        the shaft turns in bearings, but Reed said the mass-produced
        model will not have the bearings. Instead, the shaft will be
        magnetically suspended inside the motor casing. Suspending the
        shaft means there will be nothing to wear out, or make noise,
        Reed said. </p>
      <p>Reed is aware inventions such as his often end up being shelved
        away from the consumer by a large oil company. So Reed said he
        has proceeded with caution. "Just like the companies that are
        going to produce these motors, I made sure that my investors
        were motivated for the right reasons," Reed said. "If they are
        only in it for the money, then I turned them away. On the other
        hand, if they share my desire to see this technology in the
        marketplace to help save the environment, then we made a deal."
      </p>
      <p>Reed said he also has been careful in how he financed the
        development of his motor. He said he talked with other would-be
        world-saving inventors who were put out of business by the
        government for violating interstate security exchange laws.
        "They needed capital to develop their ideas, so they sold their
        investors stock," Reed said. "It always takes longer to develop
        something like this than you think it will. So when it came time
        to make good on that stock, they couldn't do it." </p>
      <p>When Reed needed capital, instead of issuing stock he gave his
        investors promissory notes that were contingent on his invention
        eventually making it to market. Once the motors are available to
        the public, Reed said he will offer his investors the option of
        "holding the promissory notes or exchanging them for stock." </p>
      <p>However, the federal government is aware of what is going on at
        Reed Technologies. In fact, Reed said NASA has volunteered to
        test the motor. </p>
      <p>Reed estimated it will cost about $3,500 per motor to mass
        produce his invention. </p>
      <p>Bud Kenny of Hot Springs is scheduled to begin a 15-year
        world-walking tour on June 5 (see related story page 23). Kenny
        will live in a small house on wheels, which will be pulled by
        two mules. Electricity for the house will be provided by
        alternative electrical generating systems such as solar panels
        and a pedal generator that will store power from the rotation of
        Dylan's wheels. Kenny's first stop on his world tour will be
        around the first of August in Tulsa, where Reed will help Kenny
        develop the electrical system for the home. </p>

      <p>The problem that happened is that Troy (Dad) and Evelyn his
        wife at the time and VP of the company got an device while
        dealing with a company to manufacture the base product. <br>
        Of coarse egos got in the way along with financial problems. </p>
      <p>Some of the technology did make it into the EZGO golf cart. A
        lot of other issue between Reed Technology’s and other company
        that where in negotiations. </p>
      <p>Now for an update Reed Technology is Evelyn and she I think has
        moved to Costa Rica. </p>
      <p>Dad has been working on some other project that may someday
        come out. As for me I had to go back to work to make a living
        but in the back of my mind I still want to built the second
        generation of the magnetic motor that was named the Mach II
        which I still have the original plans I drew up so 10 years ago.
        The Mach II was designed to have around 400 HP at 1500 RPMs. I
        am listed as the co inventor of this motor and maybe some day I
        can get back to it. Many people in the “Free energy” groups like
        Richard has seen the base plans for this next generation motor.
      </p>
      <p>But with the issue that happened who know when this project
        will continue. </p>
      <p>Sorry to all of you that was involved and where let down. </p>

      <p>A new free energy magnet motor is coming on the scene. Troy
        Reed of Tulsa, OK has developed a permanent magnet device that
        produces free energy. It has two sets of stationary magnets and
        two sets of magnets mounted on freely turning disks. Spring-type
        injector pins are used to keep the motor turning at a constant
        RPM (about 500) as well as to overcome magnetic attraction. The
        device is started using a normal starter motor and then runs
        freely and continues to produce energy. For more information

      <p>The Reed (1991) Magnetic Motor is an electromechanical device
        that Troy Reed says runs on magnetic power. The author has
        developed a small prototype and a larger unit that have both
        undergone several demonstrations and testing programs. He has
        also filed for a Patent with the Patent Office and the Foreign
        PTO/EPO. In his design, eight permanent magnets are placed on
        each of four disks. Two outer disks remain stationary while the

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>An apparatus and method for generating
        heat, in particular for heating a fluid. The apparatus includes
        a frame, with at least one permanent magnet fixedly mounted to
        the frame. An electrically conductive member is disposed
        proximate the permanent magnets. The magnetic field of the
        magnets upon the conductive member is made to vary cyclically.
        Typically either the permanent magnets, the conductive member,
        or both are movable with respect to one another. Relative motion
        of the conductive member and the magnets causes the magnetic
        field experienced by the conductive member to vary, which causes
        it to become hot. The total heat energy generated in the
        conductive member may exceed the total energy applied to the
        apparatus to produce the varying magnetic field. The apparatus
        may include a fluid path proximate the conductive member. Fluid
        in the fluid path receives heat from the conductive member. The
        apparatus may also include a mounting member for mounting the
        conductive member, a drive mechanism for moving the conductive
        member, and a fluid driver for driving fluid within the fluid
        path. The method includes the steps of either an electrically
        conductive member, a permanent magnet proximate the conductive
        member, or both so as to heat the conductive member. The method
        may include the step of passing a fluid through a fluid path
        proximate the conductive member such that the fluid absorbs heat
        from the conductive member. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0001] The claimed invention relates to an apparatus and method
        for generating heat using magnets. More particularly, the
        claimed invention relates to an apparatus and method for
        generating heat using magnets, in particular permanent magnets,
        and transferring the heat to a working fluid. </p>
      <p>[0002] A variety of methods and devices for heating fluids are
        known. Most conventional methods for heating fluids involve
        either combustion or resistive heating. However, neither of
        these approaches is entirely satisfactory. </p>
      <p>[0003] Heating fluids by combustion has been known since
        antiquity. Essentially, a flame is produced, and is placed
        proximate the fluid to be heated. In some applications, the
        flame is applied directly to the fluid, for example when air is
        blown across a flame in a conventional gas furnace. In other
        applications, the flame is applied to a heat sink or heat
        conductor, for example when a metal tank is heated over a flame
        in a conventional water heater. </p>
      <p>[0004] Many variations of this basic approach are known.
        However, they share several common disadvantages. First, flame
        is inherently dangerous. Flammable materials must be kept away
        from the flames in order to prevent the flame from spreading.
        Generally, this means any flame heating device must be made of
        non-flammable materials, and must be built in such a way as to
        prevent the entry of any flammable materials into the vicinity
        of the flame. </p>
      <p>[0005] In addition, any flame source requires a steady flow of
        fuel. This requires fuel lines, tanks, or similar structures,
        which can prove inconvenient in certain applications. In
        addition, fuel lines and tanks may present a fire or explosion
        hazard. </p>
      <p>[0006] Similarly, flames require a steady flow of oxygen.
        Commonly oxygen is furnished via a blower that provides a flow
        of air to the flame. However, for certain applications, for
        example heating liquids, it is difficult or inconvenient to
        provide a reliable source of air. </p>
      <p>[0007] Furthermore, flames produce various combustion products,
        many of which present a nuisance or a hazard. Soot build-up is
        common in conventional flame-based heating systems, and as a
        result such systems require regular cleaning. More seriously,
        flames are notorious for producing potentially toxic gases, such
        as carbon monoxide. Care must be taken in the design of
        flame-based heating systems to avoid the production of such
        gases, or to vent them away from areas used by people and
        animals. </p>
      <p>[0008] In addition, many combustion byproducts are
        environmentally destructive. This is especially true when
        combustion is chemically incomplete, for reasons such as poor
        fuel mixing, low burn temperature, etc. In such cases, a variety
        of environmentally hazardous compounds may be produced.
        Furthermore, nearly all fuels produce so-called "greenhouse
        gases" during combustion, most notably carbon dioxide, even when
        combustion is relatively "clean". Although carbon dioxide and
        other greenhouse gases are not necessarily directly harmful to
        people in small quantities, production of such gases is
        generally considered a disadvantage, in that they are widely
        believed to contribute to global climate change. </p>
      <p>[0009] Also, many conventional flame-based heating systems
        operate by generating one or more extremely high-temperature
        point-sources of heat. That is, the active components of the
        systems become extremely hot, in many cases hot enough to cause
        injury or damage materials not specially designed for high heat
        tolerance. Thus people, as well as plastics, wood, paper, etc.
        must be kept away from the active components of a flame-based
        heating system in order to avoid a risk of injury or damage. </p>
      <p>[0010] In addition, conventional flame-based heating systems
        generally require numerous components such as valves, tubing,
        flame nozzles, etc. that are either in or near the fluid to be
        heated. For generally non-reactive fluids, such as air, this is
        of limited concern. However, if corrosive or otherwise hazardous
        fluids are to be heated, it is typically necessary to either
        design the system specifically to avoid direct contact with the
        fluid to be heated, or to use components and materials that are
        resistant to the fluid in question. For complicated parts, such
        as valves and nozzles, this can present manufacturing and
        maintenance difficulties. </p>
      <p>[0011] Resistive heating of fluids is also well-known.
        Conventional systems operate by passing an electrical current
        through a heating element with a high electrical resistance. The
        current flow generates heat within the heating element, and the
        heat is then transferred directly or indirectly to a fluid. </p>
      <p>[0012] Although resistive heating avoids certain difficulties
        inherent in flame-based systems, it also suffers from several
        disadvantages. Though resistive heating systems do not require
        either fuel or oxygen, they do require that electricity be
        provided to the heating elements. Like fuel lines and air fans,
        electrical wiring may be difficult or inconvenient for certain
        applications. </p>
      <p>[0013] Similarly, many conventional resistive heating systems
        operate by generating one or more extremely high-temperature
        point-sources of heat. Typically, the operating current is
        passed through one or more relatively small heating elements.
        The elements thus become extremely hot. In many cases the
        heating elements are heated to the point of incandescence, and
        may reach several thousand degrees Fahrenheit. People, plastics,
        wood, paper, even some types of metal and glass must be kept
        away from the active components of a resistive heating system in
        order to avoid a risk of injury or damage. </p>
      <p>[0014] Furthermore, such temperatures exceed the ignition
        temperatures of certain flammable gasses and vapors, so such
        substances must also be kept away from the heating elements and
        other active components of a resistive heating system. If the
        presence of combustible gasses and vapors cannot be avoided, the
        active components must be sealed in a gas-tight enclosure to
        prevent fire or explosion. </p>
      <p>[0015] In addition, resistive heating, depending as it does on
        transmission of a substantial electric current, poses an
        inherent danger of electric shock. Arcing and sparking to and
        from electrically energized components is a significant risk. In
        addition, applications that involve potentially conductive
        fluids, in particular water, are of special concern with
        resistive heating devices. The presence of such conductive
        fluids in or near current paths can cause short-circuits that
        may damage the device or harm persons or property nearby. </p>
      <p>[0016] Furthermore, resistive heating systems are perhaps even
        more susceptible to corrosive or otherwise degrading fluids than
        flame-based systems. This is particularly the case with the
        heating elements. Heating elements are typically small, and are
        thus especially susceptible to corrosion by virtue of a high
        ratio of exposed area to their total volume. Heating elements
        are also commonly directly exposed to or directly immersed in
        the fluid to be heated. Furthermore, the difficulties in making
        heating elements corrosion resistant are increased because
        heating elements must also survive extremely high temperatures,
        and thus the materials, structures, and construction methods
        that may be used are limited. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0017] It is the purpose of the claimed invention to overcome
        these difficulties, thereby providing an improved apparatus and
        method for generating heat. </p>
      <p>[0018] It is more particularly the purpose of the claimed
        invention to provide an apparatus and method for heating a fluid
        that does not require fuel, oxygen, or electrical current
        delivered to the active heating components, and that does not
        pose dangers from localized high temperatures, fire, electric
        shock, or toxic byproducts. </p>
      <p>[0019] The present invention relates to a <b><i>magnetic
            heater</i></b> mechanism for generating heat. It includes at
        least one electrically conductive member and at least one magnet
        disposed proximate to one another. The magnetic field exerted by
        the magnet upon the conductive member is made to vary
        cyclically. This causes the conductive member to become hot. One
        way of accomplishing this is to move at least one of the
        conductive member and the magnet cyclically relative to the
        other. The magnetic field exerted upon the conductive member by
        the magnet thus varies cyclically. </p>
      <p>[0020] More particularly, the magnetic field at a given point
        on the conductive member changes, such that that point on the
        conductive member becomes heated. In some embodiments most or
        all of the conductive member will become heated in this fashion.
        However, it is only necessary that a single point of the
        conductive member be so heated. </p>
      <p>[0021] The present invention also relates to a <b><i>magnetic
            heater with such a magnetic heater</i></b> mechanism
        therein. An embodiment of <b><i>magnetic heater</i></b> in
        accordance with the principles of the claimed invention includes
        at least one magnet and at least one electrically conductive
        member disposed proximate the at least one magnet, but not in
        direct contact therewith. In certain embodiments, the magnet may
        be conveniently mounted on a frame. At least one of the
        conductor and the magnet is cyclically movable in relation to
        the other. </p>
      <p>[0022] In a preferred embodiment, the at least one magnet is a
        permanent magnet. </p>
      <p>[0023] A fluid path is disposed in thermal communication with
        the conductive member. </p>
      <p>[0024] The relative motions of the conductive member and the
        magnet may vary considerably. In certain embodiments, the
        conductive member and/or the magnet may rotate in relation to
        one another. In other embodiments, one or both of the conductive
        member and the magnet may oscillate with respect to one another.
        The type of cyclical motion is not critical. </p>
      <p>[0025] When the conductive member and/or the magnet are
        cyclically moved, the magnetic field applied to the conductive
        member by the magnet varies cyclically at at least one point on
        the conductive member, which causes at least that point of the
        conductive member to become hot. The heating depends on the
        electrical conductivity of the conductive member, not the
        magnetic or physical properties. Thus it is not necessary that
        the conductive member be ferromagnetic, or that it have any
        particular magnetic properties. Likewise, it is not necessary
        that the conductive member be a particular shape or size. </p>
      <p>[0026] Fluid flowing through the fluid path absorbs heat from
        the conductive member. </p>
      <p>[0027] In certain embodiments, the amount of heat energy
        generated within the conductive member exceeds the total energy
        applied to produce the cyclically varying magnetic field. </p>
      <p>[0028] It is noted that the physical process(es) responsible
        for heat generation within the claimed invention have not been
        definitively determined as of filing of this application. It is
        believed that inductive heating may be at least partially
        responsible. Although inductive heating is known per se, the
        efficiency of the claimed invention in producing heat, which may
        exceed 100% as normally measured, is both surprising and
        unknown. </p>
      <p>[0029] In addition, a device according to the principles of the
        claimed invention may include a drive shaft on which to mount
        the conductive member or the magnet for convenient cyclical
        motion. It may also contain a motor or other drive mechanism for
        driving the shaft. It may further contain a fluid driving
        mechanism such as a pump or blower for forcing fluid through the
        fluid path so as to heat the fluid efficiently. </p>
      <p>[0030] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention does not require that fuel, oxygen, or
        electrical power be provided directly to or used within the
        heater mechanism itself. The risks inherent in such provisions
        are thus avoided. </p>
      <p>[0031] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention is not prone to electrical arcing or sparking,
        as there is no need to apply external electrical power directly
        to the conductive member or the magnet in order to generate
        heat. </p>
      <p>[0032] As pointed out above, one possible source for the heat
        generated in the conductive member is magnetic induction. It is
        noted that magnetic induction involves the production and
        dissipation of electrical eddy currents. However, eddy currents
        within conductors generally present negligible risks of arcing
        and sparking, as they are not flowing from one component to
        another or across a substantial distance, but rather are moving
        only within a local area of the conductor itself. Furthermore,
        eddy currents, like other electrical currents, tend to follow
        the lowest resistance current path, which is typically within
        the conductor rather than through the surrounding environment.
        Thus, short circuits, arcing, and sparking are naturally
        inhibited. Even fluids considered to be relatively conductive,
        such as salt water, are normally much less conductive than
        typical conductive solids such as metals. Thus, sparking dangers
        may be avoided even if such conductive fluids are to be heated.
      </p>
      <p>[0033] Likewise, an apparatus in accordance with the principles
        of the claimed invention does not require either a flame or a
        hot filament to generate heat, and does not require high
        voltages or currents in exposed components. </p>
      <p>[0034] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention, having very few parts, may be readily
        constructed of materials that are resistant to extreme
        temperatures, corrosive environments, etc. As a result, an
        apparatus in accordance with the principles of the claimed
        invention lends itself to applications wherein such conditions
        are found. </p>
      <p>[0035] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention furthermore does not require that any
        component thereof be heated to an extreme temperature in order
        to operate. The conductive member may be heated to a moderate
        temperature similar to the desired temperature of the fluid,
        without a loss of efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0036] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention, not being subject to many of the risks
        associated with known flame-based heaters and resistive heaters,
        is particularly well suited for commercial and home
        applications, such as furnaces, space heaters, and water
        heaters. However, it will be appreciated that these applications
        are exemplary only, and that the claimed invention is not
        limited thereto. </p>
      <p>[0037] Furthermore, an apparatus in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention does not produce waste gas,
        or indeed waste products of any sort, and in particular does not
        produce greenhouse gases or other environmentally dangerous
        substances. Likewise, it does not produce solid waste or
        particulates such as ash, soot, etc., and does not produce
        noxious or corrosive liquids or gases, i.e. sulfur dioxide,
        nitrogen oxides, sulfuric acid, etc. Therefore, its operation
        does not present an environmental hazard. </p>
      <p>[0038] A method in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention includes the steps of rotating at least one
        conductive member proximate at least one magnet so as to heat
        the conductive member. A fluid may then be disposed proximate
        the conductive member, so as to absorb heat from the conductive
        member. </p>
      <p>[0039] As noted, it is believed that magnetic induction may be
        at least partially responsible for the heat generated in a
        device in accordance with the claimed invention. It is noted
        that conventional inductive heating devices typically rely on
        electromagnets to generate magnetic fields. In a preferred
        embodiment of the claimed invention, permanent magnets are used
        instead. </p>
      <p>[0040] However, alternate embodiments of the invention might
        include electromagnets. Although electromagnets have many of the
        same drawbacks as resistive heaters, in that they require an
        electrical current to be delivered directly to the heating
        element, and in that a device that uses electromagnets thus
        requires wiring and must be designed with consideration given to
        a risk of electrical shock, for certain embodiments it may be
        desirable to utilize electromagnets. </p>
      <p>[0041] Permanent magnets are extremely simple in structure, and
        do not have moving parts, current paths, or other internal
        components. As a result, they are extremely reliable, and are
        physically, chemically, and thermally sturdy. </p>
      <p>[0042] In addition, the use of permanent magnets in the claimed
        invention, combined with the lack of any other unavoidable need
        for electrical power, gas lines, waste disposal, etc. enables
        embodiments of the claimed invention to be utilized with little
        or no supporting infrastructure. </p>
      <p>[0043] In addition, known devices utilizing magnetic inductive
        heating are substantially less efficient in generating heat than
        an apparatus in accordance with the principles of the claimed
        invention. For this reason, it is believed that some phenomenon
        other than or in addition to magnetic induction heating may be
        responsible for the heat generated in the claimed invention. </p>
      <p>[0044] Thus, it is emphasized that the heating effect is not
        necessarily restricted to magnetic inductive heating. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>[0066] Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an apparatus for
        magnetically generating heat 10 in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention includes a frame 20. The
        frame need not be electrically conductive or ferromagnetic,
        although it may be either or both. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the
        frame 20 is a circular, essentially solid plate. However, it
        will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art that this
        is exemplary only, and that other shapes, including but not
        limited to rectangles or open arrangements of struts, may be
        equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0067] In addition, the frame is itself exemplary only. It
        provides a convenient structure on which magnets 30 may be
        mounted. </p>
      <p>[0068] Returning to FIG. 1, the apparatus includes at least one
        magnet 30 fixedly connected to the frame 20. As noted, in a
        preferred embodiment the at least one magnet 30 is a permanent
        magnet. A wide variety of magnets 30, permanent and otherwise,
        may be suitable. </p>
      <p>[0069] In embodiments where permanent magnets are used, those
        embodiments are to some degree limited in their operation by the
        maximum effective operating temperature of the particular
        permanent magnets 30 that are used, i.e. if the magnets 30
        overheat their magnetic field may decay. In a preferred
        embodiment using permanent magnets, the magnets 30 are
        high-temperature permanent magnets, such that they retain their
        magnetic fields at elevated temperatures. In a more preferred
        embodiment, the magnets 30 have an effective operating
        temperature of at least the boiling point of water. In a still
        more preferred embodiment, the magnets 30 have an effective
        operating temperature of at least 350.degree. F. </p>
      <p>[0070] Rare earth magnets are known to be suitable for the
        purposes of the claimed invention. Samarium Cobalt magnets are
        known to be particularly suitable for purposes of the claimed
        invention. However, the use of both Samarium Cobalt magnets and
        rare earth magnets in general is exemplary only, and other
        permanent magnets may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0071] The "effective operating temperature", as the term is
        used in the art, is the point beyond which the magnetic field
        produced by a permanent magnet begins to degrade significantly.
        Some minor degradation in field strength may be measurable below
        this point. Likewise, the magnetic field may maintain at least
        some integrity above the effective operating temperature. </p>
      <p>[0072] It is noted that the effective operating temperatures
        described herein are exemplary only. Permanent magnets with
        different effective operating temperatures may be equally
        suitable. In particular, it is noted that permanent magnets with
        higher effective operating temperatures may be available, or may
        become available, and that they may be equally suitable for use
        with the claimed invention. </p>
      <p>[0073] In addition, it is emphasized that the device as a whole
        is not strictly limited to the operating temperatures of the
        magnets 30. In certain embodiments, other portions of the
        apparatus such as the conductive member 40 (see below) may reach
        higher temperatures than are experienced by the magnets 30,
        temperatures which may be well in excess of the maximum
        operating temperature of the magnets 30 themselves. </p>
      <p>[0074] Furthermore, the magnets 30 may be protected from excess
        heat, as well as other potential hazards. For example, as
        illustrated in FIG. 14, which shows a cross-section of a magnet
        30 and a portion of a frame 20 similar to that of FIG. 3 in
        cross-section and in greater detail, the magnet 30 may include a
        protective layer 31. Such a protective layer 31 can provide
        thermal protection, and/or structural and chemical protection. A
        variety of materials may be suitable for use as a protective
        layer 31, so long as they do not significantly reduce the
        propagation of the magnetic field of the magnet 30. </p>
      <p>[0075] For certain embodiments, aluminum may be provide a
        suitable protective layer 31. It is noted that aluminum has a
        high reflectivity, thus inhibiting the absorption of heat by the
        magnet 30, and a high infrared emissivity, thus facilitating the
        rapid re-radiation of heat from the magnet 30. These factors
        combine to provide passive cooling for the magnet 30. In
        addition, aluminum is relatively durable, and so a protective
        layer 31 of aluminum serve to protect the magnet 30 physically.
        Likewise, aluminum is relatively impermeable, and thus may
        effectively seal the magnet 30 against any potential corrosive
        effects due to moisture, oxygen, fluid flowing through the fluid
        path 50 (see below), etc. </p>
      <p>[0076] However, the use of aluminum is exemplary only, and a
        variety of other materials may be equally suitable. In
        particular, it is noted that multiple layers of material, rather
        than a single layer (i.e. of aluminum), may also be suitable.
        Likewise, the presence of a protective layer 31 is also
        exemplary only. </p>
      <p>[0077] In addition, for certain embodiments, the apparatus may
        include an additional active or passive cooling mechanism 32 for
        the magnets 30. A wide variety of cooling mechanisms 32 may be
        suitable. For example, passive cooling mechanisms 32 may
        include, but are not limited to, heat sinks and radiator fins.
        Active cooling mechanisms 32 may include, but are not limited
        to, coolant loops and refrigeration units. </p>
      <p>[0078] It is noted that the fluid flow path 50, as described
        below, may be configured to act as a cooling mechanism 32. Since
        in certain embodiments of the claimed invention it provides a
        mechanism for absorbing heat from the conductive member 40, it
        may be well suited for absorbing heat from the magnets 30 as
        well. </p>
      <p>[0079] However, these particular cooling mechanisms 32, as well
        as the presence of a cooling mechanism at all, are exemplary
        only. </p>
      <p>[0080] In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes a
        plurality of magnets 30. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3, the
        apparatus has eight magnets 30, distributed symmetrically about
        the periphery of the frame 20. However, it will be appreciated
        by those knowledgeable in the art that this is exemplary only. A
        wide variety of sizes, shapes, numbers, and arrangements of
        magnets 30 may be equally suitable. In particular, asymmetrical
        arrangements of magnets 30 and arrangements of magnets 30
        elsewhere than the periphery of the frame 20 may be suitable.
        For example, FIG. 6 shows an arrangement of magnets 30 in two
        straight rows. FIG. 7 shows an arrangement of magnets 30 with
        three in one arc near the center of the frame 20, and five in a
        larger arc near the periphery of the frame 20. </p>
      <p>[0081] In addition, although the magnets 30 are illustrated as
        disk-shaped, this is exemplary only. Magnets in other shapes,
        including but not limited to rectangular, may be equally
        suitable. Furthermore, the magnets 30 need not all have the same
        shape. </p>
      <p>[0082] Moreover, although an arrangement of small magnets 30 is
        convenient for certain applications, this is also exemplary
        only. Magnets 30 of sizes other than those shown may be equally
        suitable. Furthermore, in embodiments having more than one
        magnet 30, the magnets 30 need not be of the same size. </p>
      <p>[0083] Furthermore, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the magnets 30
        are fixed to a surface of the frame 20. However, this
        arrangement is exemplary only. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the
        magnets 30 may be recessed into the frame 20. The magnets 30 may
        be fully recessed as illustrated, such that the surfaces of the
        magnets 30 are flush with the surface of the frame 20, or the
        magnets 30 may be partially recessed into the frame 20.
        Alternatively, the magnets 30 may be fully enclosed within the
        frame 20, as illustrated in FIG. 4. A wide variety of
        arrangements of magnets 30 may be suitable, so long as the
        magnetic fields generated by the magnets 30 extend beyond the
        surface of the frame 20. </p>
      <p>[0084] The magnets may be oriented in various manners. In a
        preferred embodiment, all of the magnets will be oriented with
        alternating polarity. That is, as shown in FIG. 8, some have
        their north poles N facing out of the paper, while those on
        either side have their south poles S facing out of the paper
        (and their north poles N facing into the paper). Such an
        arrangement is advantageous, for at least the reason that it
        produces a greater change in magnetic field intensity than would
        be the case if all of the magnets 30 were aligned in the same
        direction. </p>
      <p>[0085] It is noted that such an arrangement may be equivalently
        described as having the north pole N of some of the magnets 30
        point directly towards the conductive member 40, while having
        the north pole N of alternating magnets 30 point directly away
        from the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0086] However, such an arrangement is exemplary only. Other
        arrangements may be equally suitable. For example, it would also
        be possible to arrange the magnets 30 with alternating polarity
        such that the north pole of each magnet 30 is arranged opposite
        or nearly opposite that of its neighbors. FIG. 12 shows an
        example of such an arrangement. As shown therein, some of the
        magnets 30 have their north poles N pointing inward towards the
        center of the frame 20, while the magnets 30 on each side of
        them have their north poles N pointing outward. </p>
      <p>[0087] Furthermore, it may also be advantageous to arrange
        magnets 30 with their north poles aligned in the same or nearly
        the same direction, or in some fashion other than the
        alternating fashions described above. In particular, it is
        emphasized that the alignment of the poles of the magnets 30 is
        not limited to either directly parallel with or directly
        perpendicular to the plane (if any) of the frame 20. The magnets
        30 may be oriented in essentially any fashion, so long as a
        varying magnetic field results. </p>
      <p>[0088] At least one electrically conductive member 40 is
        disposed proximate the magnets 30. </p>
      <p>[0089] The magnets 30 and the conductive member 40 are arranged
        so that at least a portion of the conductive member 40
        experiences a cyclically varying magnetic field from the magnets
        30. </p>
      <p>[0090] One way of producing the cyclically varying magnetic
        field is for at least one of the electrically conductive member
        40 and the permanent magnets 30 are to be cyclically movable
        with respect to the other. Thus, as either the magnets 30 or the
        conductive member 40 or both move, the magnetic field
        experienced at different parts of the conductive member 40 will
        vary. </p>
      <p>[0091] A variety of motions may be possible, so long as a
        cyclical variation in the magnetic field experienced by the
        conductive member 40 is produced. </p>
      <p>[0092] As one suitable form of motion, the magnets 30 may be
        rotated with respect to the conductive member 40. Alternatively,
        the conductive member 40 may be rotated with respect to the
        magnets 30. Additionally, both the magnets 30 and the conductive
        member 40 may be rotated in different directions, or at least at
        different speeds, so as to produce relative motion between the
        two. </p>
      <p>[0093] In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the magnets 30
        are mounted to the frame 20 in a generally planar arrangement.
        Likewise in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the conductive
        member 40 is planar. The frame 20 is disposed with the plane 33
        of the magnets 30 generally parallel to and proximate the plane
        43 of the conductive member 40. Such an arrangement is
        advantageous, in that it is compact and convenient to operate,
        and also in that it allows for rapid, regular cyclical motion by
        rotating the frame 20 or the conductive member 40. However, it
        is exemplary only. Other arrangements, including but not limited
        to those described below, may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0094] It is noted that FIG. 1, as illustrated, is inclusive of
        all of the above embodiments. That is, as illustrated, the frame
        20 with the magnets 30 thereon may rotate, or the conductive
        member 40 may rotate, or both. The structure, appearance, and
        function of the apparatus will be similar regardless of which
        elements rotate. </p>
      <p>[0095] As noted above, other cyclical motions and other
        arrangements of components may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0096] For example, oscillating motions may be suitable. </p>
      <p>[0097] More particularly, linear oscillating motions may be
        suitable for certain embodiments. As illustrated in FIG. 9, a
        planar frame 20 with magnets 30 thereon may be placed proximate
        a planar conductive member 40. Either or both of the frame 20
        and the conductive member 40 may be moved cyclically in a
        non-rotational direction, i.e. side-to-side. Alternatively, one
        or both of the frame 20 and the conductive member 40 may be
        moved towards and away from each other. </p>
      <p>[0098] Alternatively, in some embodiments the oscillating
        motion of a pendulum may be equally suitable. As illustrated in
        FIG. 10, a curved frame 20 with magnets 30 thereon may be placed
        proximate a conductive member 40 having a matching curve. The
        frame 20 may be set into motion as a pendulum, so as to produce
        cyclical variations in the magnetic field experienced by the
        conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0099] A wide variety of other arrangements and motions may
        also be suitable, including but not limited to a cylinder or
        torus rotating inside a larger torus, a cylinder rotating
        proximate a flat plate, or a piston moving back and forth within
        a cylinder. In each case, either the magnets 30, the conductive
        member 40, or both may move. </p>
      <p>[0100] It is noted that the term "cyclical variation", as used
        herein with regard to magnetic fields, refers broadly to any
        generally repetitive motion, wherein the magnetic field changes
        according to some cycle. For example, the magnetic field may
        rise and fall in intensity. As another example, the rise and
        fall of the magnetic field may change in field direction, i.e.
        change the angle of magnetic north, or even completely reverse
        polarity from north to south. Furthermore, the variations in the
        magnetic field may include a combination of changes in both
        field direction and intensity. The pattern of repetition may be
        simple or complex, and need not be precisely repeated with each
        cycle. That is, the frequency, amplitude, etc. of the variation
        may change from cycle to cycle. In addition, in embodiments
        wherein both the intensity and the direction of the field
        changes, it is not necessary for the intensity and the direction
        to change synchronously, or according to the same cycle. </p>
      <p>[0101] The term "cyclical variation" as used herein with regard
        to physical motion, by extension, refers broadly to the physical
        motion used to produced the cyclical variation of the magnetic
        field. Likewise, it may have a pattern of repetition that is
        simple or complex, and that varies from cycle to cycle </p>
      <p>[0102] It is also noted that the total magnetic force or field
        strength on the conductive member 40 need not change (although
        it may in certain embodiments). Rather, the local field at a
        given point on the conductive member 40 must change, in order
        for that point to be actively heated. </p>
      <p>[0103] For example, if, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG.
        1, the frame 20 rotates, the magnets do not approach or recede
        from the conductive member 40, since they are moving about an
        axis perpendicular to the plane 33 of the magnets 30 and the
        plane 43 of the conductive member 40. Thus, the total field
        strength does not change. However, the field at any given point
        on the conductive member 40 is constantly changing as the frame
        20 rotates, i.e. as individual magnets approach and recede from
        that point. </p>
      <p>[0104] Furthermore, it is emphasized that although many of the
        embodiments described herein utilize physical motion to produce
        a cyclically varying magnetic field, this is exemplary only.
        Arrangements for producing a cyclically varying magnetic field
        without physical motion, including but not limited to the use of
        variable electromagnets, may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0105] The cyclical change in the magnetic field causes the
        conductive member 40 to become hot. In terms of physical
        motions, with regard to FIG. 1, when the conductive member 40 is
        rotated with respect to the magnets 30, (or vice versa) the
        conductive member 40 becomes hot, because the magnetic field
        experienced by the conductive member 40 is varying. </p>
      <p>[0106] It is emphasized that the conductive member 40 is
        electrically conductive; although it is heated by interacting
        with magnets 30, the conductive member 40 is not required to be
        ferromagnetic, or to have any other particular magnetic
        properties. Although it may be ferromagnetic, it is the
        electrical properties of the conductive member 40, not any
        magnetic properties, that are important. </p>
      <p>[0107] In a preferred embodiment, the conductive member 40 is
        made of a durable, heat-tolerant, highly conductive material. In
        a more preferred embodiment, the conductive member 40 is made of
        metal. In a still more preferred embodiment, the conductive
        member 40 is made of copper, or a copper alloy. This is
        advantageous, as copper and many of its alloys are physically
        durable, highly conductive, and resistant to high temperatures.
        However, this is exemplary only, and other materials may be
        equally suitable for use in the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0108] As noted, a wide variety of embodiments may be possible
        in accordance with the principles of the claimed invention.
        However, from the point of view of operating efficiency (about
        which more is said later), the preferred embodiment is that
        illustrated in FIG. 15. </p>
      <p>[0109] Therein, the conductive member 40 is configured with a
        first side 43 and a second side 45. A first frame 20 with a
        plurality of first magnets 30 thereon is disposed a first
        distance 12 away from the first side 43 of the conductive member
        40. Similarly, a second frame 25 with a plurality of second
        magnets 35 thereon is disposed a second distance 14 away from
        the second side 45 of the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0110] It is preferred that the frames 20 and 25 are arranged
        such that the magnets 30 and 35 are aligned with one another to
        form pairs on each side of the conductive member 40. Likewise,
        it is preferred that, for embodiments wherein the frames 20 and
        25 are movable, they are movable together so as to maintain the
        arrangement and keep the magnets 30 and 35 in pairs. </p>
      <p>[0111] As shown in FIG. 16, it is furthermore preferred that
        for any pair of magnets 30 and 35, their polarities face in the
        same direction. Most preferably, the magnets 30 and 35 are
        aligned such that one magnet in the pair has its north pole
        facing directly towards the conductive member 40, and one magnet
        in the pair has its north pole facing directly away from the
        conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0112] Such an arrangement has been found to produce a high
        level of heating. It is believed that this is due to the steep
        gradient in the magnetic field that is produced when the
        conductive member 40 is disposed between two magnets 30 and 35
        oriented in this fashion. </p>
      <p>[0113] As shown in FIG. 16, both magnets 30 and 35 have their
        north poles pointing directly to the left. However, it would be
        equally suitable, and in accordance with this most preferred
        arrangement, for both magnets 30 and 35 to have their north
        poles pointing directly to the right. </p>
      <p>[0114] Furthermore, as noted above, it may be suitable for
        adjacent magnets to have opposing polarities. That is, if one
        pair of magnets 30 and 35 have their poles arranged as shown in
        FIG. 16 (north to the left), the magnet pairs adjacent to that
        pair may have their poles arranged in the direction opposite
        that shown in FIG. 16 (north to the right). </p>
      <p>[0115] As with the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the embodiment
        of FIG. 15 may be conveniently expanded by the use of additional
        conductive members 40 and magnets 30. An arrangement with three
        conductive members 40 and four sets of magnets 30 is shown in
        FIG. 17. It is noted that the number of conductive members 40
        and magnets 30 is exemplary only, and that other numbers and
        arrangements may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0116] In addition, it is noted that this preferred arrangement
        is exemplary only, and that other arrangements may be equally
        suitable. </p>
      <p>[0117] The heat generated varies inversely with the distance 12
        between the conductive member 40 and the magnets 30. Thus, in a
        preferred embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention, the conductive member 40 is
        spaced a distance 12 of no more than 0.35 inches from the
        magnets 30. In a more preferred embodiment, the conductive
        member 40 is a distance 12 of no more than 0.060". However, this
        arrangement is exemplary only. </p>
      <p>[0118] In addition, although in certain embodiments the
        distance between the magnets 30 and the conductive member 40 may
        be fixed, this is exemplary only. It may be equally suitable to
        vary the distance between the magnets 30 and the conductive
        member 40, either during the operation of the apparatus or as an
        adjustment while the apparatus is not operating. </p>
      <p>[0119] In particular, it is noted that it is possible to vary
        the magnetic field at the conductive member by varying the
        distance between the magnets 30 and the conductive member 40. A
        wide variety of embodiments may be suitable for doing so. For
        example, referring to FIG. 1, varying the distance 12, i.e. by
        moving the conductive member 40 or the frame 20 with the magnets
        30 thereon from side to side, would change the magnetic field
        experienced by the conductive member 40. If the distance 12 were
        varied cyclically, this would generate heat in the conductive
        member 40 regardless of whether the conductive member 40 or the
        magnets 30 were rotated. </p>
      <p>[0120] Another embodiment taking advantage of this feature is
        illustrated in FIG. 13. Therein, the single magnet 30 and the
        conductive member 40 are arranged such that when the frame 20
        rotates, the distance 12 varies cyclically as the magnet 30
        approaches and recedes from the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0121] It is furthermore noted that the variation in distance,
        whether during operation or not, may be accomplished by moving
        either the magnets 30, the conductive member 40, or both. </p>
      <p>[0122] Alternatively, rather than adjusting the distance
        between the magnets 30 and the conductive member 40, for certain
        embodiments it may be advantageous to move the magnets 30 and/or
        the conductive member 40 in and out of the apparatus 10. </p>
      <p>[0123] For example, referring to FIG. 15, either or both of the
        frames 20 and 25 and/or the conductive member 40 could be slid
        into or out of the apparatus 10 as a whole. That is, rather than
        (for example) moving the frames 20 and 25 apart so as to widen
        the distances 12 and 14, the frames 20 and 25 could be moved
        downwards, so as to partially or fully remove one or both from
        the apparatus 10. </p>
      <p>[0124] If both frames 20 and 25 are fully removed, the heat
        generation in the apparatus 10 is essentially zero, as the
        conductive member 40 are not exposed to a cyclically varying
        magnetic field. If only one is removed, or if one or both are
        partially removed, the heat generation of the apparatus 10 at a
        given speed of operation would decrease, but not to zero. </p>
      <p>[0125] Thus, this provides an additional way to control heat
        production. Such motions may be considered structurally
        analogous to the insertion and removal of fuel rods in a nuclear
        reactor. </p>
      <p>[0126] Such an arrangement is shown in FIG. 20, with the
        conductive member 40 partially withdrawn from the apparatus 10.
      </p>
      <p>[0127] As with the variations of the distances 12 and 14,
        depending on the embodiment it may be advantageous for the
        frames 20 and 25 to be removable while the apparatus 10 is not
        operating, while it is operating, or both. </p>
      <p>[0128] As noted above, in certain embodiments, the magnets 30
        may be disposed in a planar arrangement, such that a surface of
        the magnets 30 defines a plane 33. Likewise, the conductive
        member 40 may have a planar shape, so as to generally conform to
        a plane 43. This is a convenient arrangement for certain
        embodiments, in that it allows for rapid motion (and hence rapid
        variation in the magnetic field) without any relative
        translation between the conductive member 40 and the magnets 30.
        Thus, the conductive member 40 and the magnets 30 may be
        disposed very close to one another without risking a collision.
      </p>
      <p>[0129] However, as also noted previously, such an arrangement
        is exemplary only. It is not necessary for the magnets 30 to be
        arranged in a plane 33, or (as noted above) for the distance 12
        between the magnets 30 and the conductive member 40 to be the
        same for all magnets 30. </p>
      <p>[0130] As heat is produced entirely by means of physical
        motion, no source of electrical power, fuel, or oxygen is
        necessary. </p>
      <p>[0131] The description herein is primarily directed towards
        rotary motion about an axis. This is convenient, in that rotary
        motion about an axis may be easily and reliably produced by a
        variety of means. In particular, rotary motion about an axis may
        be produced by a variety of means that require only minimal
        equipment and infrastructure are suitable, including but not
        limited to windmills and water wheels. Likewise, internal
        combustion engines, human or animal power, wave action, gravity,
        connection with the rolling wheel of a vehicle, and other
        sources of motive power may be equally suitable. Additionally,
        rotary motion about an axis may also be produced using an
        electric motor, such as a conventional AC or DC motor, or by
        other artificial means. </p>
      <p>[0132] In the case of an electric motor, it is noted that it is
        possible to operate the claimed invention therewith by powering
        the electric motor from a local source, such as a solar cell,
        battery, or other short-range or self-contained source, rather
        than by a connection to a large power grid. In embodiments with
        electromagnets, the electromagnets similarly may be powered
        without relying on a central electric grid. Thus, the invention
        may be made portable, and used without substantial supporting
        infrastructure. For example, embodiments may be constructed
        without electrical lines. </p>
      <p>[0133] Likewise, gas lines, exhaust lines, waste disposal
        provisions, etc. may be dispensed with. </p>
      <p>[0134] As a result, embodiments of the invention may be of use
        even when connection with a standard electrical grid, gas
        distribution system, etc. is inconvenient or impossible (i.e.,
        in places where no such infrastructure is available such as
        remote wilderness sites and undeveloped areas). </p>
      <p>[0135] However, it is again emphasized that other forms of
        motion other than rotary motion about an axis, including but not
        limited to linear oscillation and pendular motion, may be
        equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0136] One possible physical phenomenon that may be at least
        partially responsible for heating the conductive member is
        magnetic induction. Although magnetic induction is a known
        phenomenon, a brief explanation as it may apply to the claimed
        invention may be enlightening. In the following discussion, it
        is assumed for the sake of clarity that magnetic induction is
        responsible for heating the claimed invention. However, it is
        noted that magnetic induction may not be the sole source of
        heating, or even a source of heating, in the claimed invention.
      </p>
      <p>[0137] In addition, for the sake of clarity, the following is
        written specifically with respect to a single embodiment as
        shown in FIG. 1, wherein the conductive member rotates, and the
        magnets are fixed in place. However, it is noted that this
        explanation, in so far as it may be applicable at all, is
        generally applicable to any embodiment of the claimed invention.
      </p>
      <p>[0138] It is well known that varying magnetic fields generate
        electrical currents. Even if the magnets 30 generate a magnetic
        field that is essentially constant in strength and polarity, as
        is the case with permanent magnets as well as with
        fixed-strength electromagnets, as the conductive member 40
        rotates, different portions of the conductive member 40 approach
        and recede from the permanent magnets 30. Thus, for any
        arbitrary point of the conductive member 40, the magnetic field
        experienced at that point varies, even if the magnetic fields
        produced by the permanent magnets 30 remain constant. </p>
      <p>[0139] Such a variation in magnetic field exerted at a given
        point of the conductive member 40 could also be obtained by the
        use of variable-strength magnets. For example, it is known to
        vary the strength of the field emitted by an electromagnet by
        changing the amount of current applied to the electromagnet.
        Likewise, the polarity of an electromagnet may be changed by
        reversing the direction of the current applied thereto. Such
        variations may also be suitable for producing a cyclically
        varying magnetic field at the conductive member 40, with or
        without any actual physical motion. </p>
      <p>[0140] The variation in magnetic field strength at each point
        of the conductive member 40 generates localized eddy currents
        within the conductive member 40. The eddy currents, like other
        types of electrical current, dissipate energy in the form of
        heat as they flow within the conductive member 40, due to the
        electrical resistance of the conductive member 40. Thus, as the
        conductive member 40 rotates in proximity to the permanent
        magnets 30, the conductive member is heated. </p>
      <p>[0141] Alternatively, some or all of the heating of the
        conductive member 40 may be produced by the generation of
        vibrations in the molecular structure of the conductive member
        40 due to the varying magnetic field strength at each point,
        which in turn causes internal stresses and/or friction between
        molecules. </p>
      <p>[0142] As a further alternative, stresses and/or variations in
        the crystal structure of the conductive member 40 may be
        produced by the varying magnetic field. </p>
      <p>[0143] Although the forgoing description identifies physical
        phenomena that may be involved in the production of heat in the
        claimed invention, an apparatus in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention is not limited to the
        production of heat via those phenomena. Additional and/or
        alternative phenomena may be involved. </p>
      <p>[0144] In a preferred embodiment of a device according to the
        principles of the claimed invention, the conductive member 40 is
        disk-shaped. This is convenient, in that a disk-shape lends
        itself to uniform rotation and heating. However, this shape is
        exemplary only, and a wide variety of other shapes may be
        equally suitable, including but not limited to square or
        rectangular plates, curved components, cylinders, toroids, etc.
      </p>
      <p>[0145] Also, in a preferred embodiment of a device according to
        the principles of the claimed invention, the conductive member
        40 is a single, integral piece of conductive material. However,
        this configuration is exemplary only. A wide variety of other
        configurations may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0146] For example, the conductive member 40 need not consist
        entirely of electrically conductive material, so long as at
        least a portion of it is electrically conductive. As illustrated
        in FIG. 4, the conductive member 40 may consist of multiple
        layers, with at least one electrically conductive layer 42 and
        at least one non-conductive layer 44. In such a case, each
        electrically conductive layer 42 is heated independently. </p>
      <p>[0147] Furthermore, the conductive member 40 need not consist
        of a closed loop or integral piece of conductive material. As
        illustrated in FIG. 5, the conductive member 40 may consist of
        two or more separate conductors 46 that are separated from one
        another by non-conductive material 48. In such a case, each
        conductor 46 is heated independently. </p>
      <p>[0148] Likewise, the conductive member 40, even if a single
        contiguous piece of conductive material, might be shaped with
        apertures, or be constructed of wires, beams, rods, etc. with
        empty space therebetween. </p>
      <p>[0149] The rate of heat generation depends on the magnitude of
        the variation in magnetic field experienced by the conductive
        member 40. This in turn depends on the placement and field
        strength of the magnets, on the speed of relative motion between
        the conductive member 40 and the permanent magnets 30, the
        placement of the conductive member 40 with respect to the
        permanent magnets 30, and on the shape, size, and electrical
        conductivity of the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0150] Likewise, the rate of heat generation currents depends
        on the shape, size, and electrical conductivity of the
        conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0151] Therefore, for a given embodiment, the heat generated
        may be controlled by varying the speed of relative motion
        between the conductive member 40 and the magnets 30. Thus, the
        heat generated by an apparatus in accordance with the principles
        of the claimed invention may be controlled with a high degree of
        precision. Because of the forgoing, the apparatus may be made to
        operate at essentially any speed, so as to produce a wide range
        of heat outputs. The apparatus is thus continuously variable in
        heat output, up to the maximum temperature limits of the
        materials used in its construction. </p>
      <p>[0152] In a preferred application of an apparatus in accordance
        with the principles of the claimed invention, the speed of
        motion may be set such that the temperature of the conductive
        member 40 does not exceed 120.degree. F., so as to enable
        generation of heat without posing a burn hazard to persons
        nearby. </p>
      <p>[0153] In an alternative preferred embodiment of an apparatus
        in accordance with the principles of the claimed invention, the
        relative motion between the conductive member 40 and the magnets
        30 may be set to a speed such that the conductive member 40 is
        heated to at least the boiling point of water, so as to enable
        generation of steam. </p>
      <p>[0154] In yet another preferred embodiment of an apparatus in
        accordance with the principles of the claimed invention, the
        relative motion between the conductive member 40 and the magnets
        30 may be set to a speed such that the conductive member 40 is
        heated to at least 350.degree. F., so as to enable convenient
        cooking or the release of large quantities of heat in a short
        time. </p>
      <p>[0155] It will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art
        that the precise speed of motion that is necessary to achieve
        the aforementioned temperatures depends on the geometry of the
        particular embodiment. For example, for rotary motion, speeds of
        less than 1 rpm or of greater than 5000 rpm may be suitable for
        particular applications. Motions other than rotary likewise may
        vary substantially. Furthermore, a variable speed may be equally
        suitable, so as to generate variable temperatures and variable
        quantities of heat. </p>
      <p>[0156] A preferred embodiment of an apparatus in accordance
        with the principles of the claimed invention also includes at
        least one fluid path 50 proximate the conductive member 40. When
        the conductive member 40 is heated, fluid in the fluid path 50
        receives heat from conductive member 40. Heat transfer from the
        conductive member 40 to fluid in the fluid path 50 may occur via
        one or more of conduction, convection, and radiation. </p>
      <p>[0157] However, although the presence of a fluid flow path 50
        may be advantageous for certain applications, a fluid flow path
        and fluid flowing therein are exemplary only. In other preferred
        embodiments of an apparatus in accordance with the principles of
        the claimed invention, heat may be generated for use via direct
        conduction, or by radiation from the conductive member. For
        example, heat could be transferred from the conductive member 40
        to a solid heat conductor, heat sink, or heat storage device,
        i.e. a mass of ceramic, brick, stone, etc. </p>
      <p>[0158] It is noted that the term "fluid" is used herein in a
        broad mechanical sense, so as to mean essentially any substance
        that may be made to flow. Thus, fluids may include, but are not
        limited to, sand, sugar, or other granular solids; regular
        dimensional solids such as beads, beans, or pellets; or
        irregular dimensional solids such as metal filings or crushed
        stone. Likewise, materials that are essentially solid but that
        are also sufficiently deformable so as to flow may also
        suitable. Such materials include but are not limited to
        paraffin, metallic sodium, certain plastics, etc. Fluids
        suitable for use with the claimed invention are therefore not
        limited to liquids or gases, although liquids and gases are not
        excluded from or inappropriate for use with the claimed
        invention. Furthermore, suitable fluids may likewise comprise
        mixtures of different physical or chemical compounds, such as
        pellets in a suspension of liquid, solids wholly or partially
        dissolved in solvents, and emolliated mixtures of incompatible
        fluids such as oil and water. </p>
      <p>[0159] As illustrated in FIGS. 1, 3, and 4, the fluid path 50
        is an open path that brings fluid into direct contact with the
        conductive member 40. This is advantageous, in that it is simple
        to construct. However, this configuration is exemplary only, and
        a wide variety of other fluid paths 50, including but not
        limited to enclosed ducts, pipes, and reservoirs may be equally
        suitable. </p>
      <p>[0160] In particular, it is noted that the fluid flow path 50
        may be disposed partially or completely within other elements of
        the apparatus. For example, the conductive member 40 may be
        formed so that the fluid flow path 50 passes therethrough. As a
        more concrete example, the conductive member 40 might include
        one or more pipes or tubes made of conductive material. The
        pipes could be adapted to accept the flow of fluid therethrough,
        so as to form the fluid flow path 50 within the conductive
        member 40 itself. Fluid flowing through the fluid flow path 50,
        which in this exemplary embodiment is actually a part of the
        conductive member 40, would then absorb heat as it passed
        through the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0161] The apparatus may include a support member 60, with one
        or both of the conductive member 40 and the frame 20 with the
        magnets 30 thereon engaged therewith. As illustrated, the
        support member 60 is a shaft mounted such that the conductive
        member 40 or the frame 20 may rotate therewith. This provides a
        simple and mechanically durable mechanism for rotating the
        conductive member 40 or the magnets 30. However, this mechanism
        is exemplary only, and a variety of other support members 60 may
        be equally suitable for rotatably mounting the conductive member
        40. Suitable support members 60 include, but are not limited to,
        bushings, bearings, belts, chains, and gears. </p>
      <p>[0162] As illustrated, the support member 60 extends through an
        opening 41 in the conductive member 40. Similarly, as
        illustrated, the support member 60 extends through an opening 21
        in the frame 20. </p>
      <p>[0163] In a configuration adapted to rotate the conductive
        member 40, the opening 41 is configured to secure the conductive
        member 40 to the support member 60 so as to rotate therewith,
        while the opening 21 in the frame 20 is configured so that the
        support member 60 freely rotates therein. Conversely, the
        opening 41 may be configured so that the support member 60
        rotates freely therein and the opening 21 may be configured so
        that the frame 20 moves with the support member 60, so that the
        magnets 30 may be rotated while the conductive member 40 remains
        fixed. </p>
      <p>[0164] Such an arrangement is convenient for rotary motion.
        However, this arrangement is exemplary only, and a variety of
        alternative arrangements may be equally suitable, both for
        rotary and for non-rotary motion. </p>
      <p>[0165] The apparatus may include a drive mechanism 70 engaged
        with either the conductive member 40, the magnets 30 (i.e., via
        the frame 20), or both. As illustrated, the drive mechanism 70
        is engaged with the support member 60 such that the drive
        mechanism 70 drives the support member 60, which as described
        above may be used to drive either the conductive member 40 or
        the frame 20. However, this arrangement is exemplary only, and a
        variety alternative arrangements may be equally suitable. For
        example, two separate drive mechanisms 70 may be used, one to
        drive each of the conductive member 40 and the frame 20. Other
        drive mechanisms 70 may be used to drive other configurations,
        both rotary and non-rotary. </p>
      <p>[0166] Likewise, a wide variety of drive mechanisms 70 may be
        suitable, as noted above, including but not limited to electric
        motors and windmill blades. Drive mechanisms are well known, and
        are not described further herein. </p>
      <p>[0167] The apparatus may include a fluid driver 80 adapted to
        drive fluid through the fluid path 50. As illustrated, the fluid
        driver 80 is a fan adapted for blowing a gas, such as air,
        through the fluid path 50. However, this arrangement is
        exemplary only, and a variety alternative arrangements may be
        equally suitable. Likewise, a wide variety of fluid drivers 80
        may be suitable, including but not limited to pumps for driving
        liquid. Fluid drivers are well known, and are not described
        further herein. </p>
      <p>[0168] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention may include more than one conductive member
        40. Furthermore, any additional conductive members 40 may be
        disposed proximate more than one arrangement of permanent
        magnets 30, for example as illustrated in FIG. 3. As
        illustrated, the several conductive members 40 are all mounted
        to a single shaft 60, with fluid paths 50 proximate each
        conductive member 40 Also as illustrated, the frames 20 are
        connected with struts 90, so as to hold them fixed and rigid
        with respect to one another while the conductive members 40
        rotate. This arrangement is exemplary only, and a variety of
        other arrangements may be equally suitable. </p>
      <p>[0169] An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the
        claimed invention may be configured so as to produce extremely
        high efficiencies, in terms of the amount of heat generated
        compared to the energy input required. The following description
        is provided as an exemplary case. </p>
      <p>[0170] In an embodiment of the claimed invention similar to
        that illustrated in FIG. 1, the drive mechanism 70 comprises an
        electric motor, supplied with 95 amperes of current at 220
        volts. As is well-known, power may be calculated according to
        the relation: </p>
      <p>P=I.times.V Equation 1: </p>
      <p>[0171] wherein: </p>
      <p>[0172] P is the power in watts; </p>
      <p>[0173] I is the current in amperes; and </p>
      <p>[0174] V is the electrical potential in volts. </p>
      <p>[0175] In accordance with Equation 1, the power supplied to the
        electric motor is 20,900 watts. </p>
      <p>[0176] In the exemplary embodiment, the fluid driver 80
        comprises an electric fan, supplied with 8 amperes of power at
        220 volts. According to Equation 1, the power supplied to the
        fan is thus 1,760 watts. </p>
      <p>[0177] Thus, the total power input into the system is 22,660
        watts. For the sake of convenience, the input power may be
        converted to BTU/hr. 1 watt is equivalent to approximately 3.415
        BTU/hr. Thus, the total power input into the exemplary
        embodiment is equivalent to 77,179 BTU/hr. </p>
      <p>[0178] Total power output in the exemplary embodiment may be
        conveniently determined from the change in thermal energy of
        fluid as it passes through the system. In the exemplary
        embodiment, air is used as a fluid. The heat output of the
        system may be determined according to the known relation: </p>
      <p>Q=q.times..rho..times.C.sub.p.times.(T.sub.O-T.sub.I) Equation
        2: </p>
      <p>[0179] wherein: </p>
      <p>[0180] Q is the total heat output </p>
      <p>[0181] q is the flow rate of air through the system </p>
      <p>[0182] .rho. is the density of air </p>
      <p>[0183] C.sub.p is the heat capacity of air </p>
      <p>[0184] T.sub.O is the outlet temperature of the air </p>
      <p>[0185] T.sub.I is the inlet temperature of the air </p>
      <p>[0186] In the exemplary embodiment, the air flowing through the
        device is heated by 80.degree. F. Thus, the difference between
        the outlet and inlet temperatures of the air (T.sub.O-T.sub.I)
        is 80.degree. F. </p>
      <p>[0187] The flow rate of air through the system in the exemplary
        embodiment is measured to be 3200 ft.sup.3/min. This may also be
        expressed as 192,000 ft.sup.3/hr. </p>
      <p>[0188] The remaining values are known to reasonable accuracy.
        The density of air .rho. at standard temperature and pressure is
        known to be approximately 0.075 lbs/ft.sup.3. The heat capacity
        of air C.sub.p is known to be 0.24 BTU/lb-.degree. F. </p>
      <p>[0189] Thus, according to Equation 2, the heat output of the
        exemplary embodiment is 276,480 BTU/hr. </p>
      <p>[0190] The efficiency of an apparatus is commonly expressed in
        terms of the output divided by the input. The efficiency of the
        exemplary embodiment in generating heat may thus be expressed as
        (276,480 BTU/hr)/(77,179 BTU/hr), which reduces to a value of
        approximately 3.58, or 358% efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0191] It is noted that the preceding is exemplary only. An
        apparatus in accordance with the principles of the claimed
        invention is not limited to the particular devices, materials,
        or power inputs and outputs described in the preceding
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0192] Furthermore, 358% efficiency is in particular exemplary
        only, and is not to be considered to be a maximum value, a
        minimum value, or even a preferred value. Apparatuses in
        accordance with the principles of the claimed invention may be
        constructed with a variety of operating efficiencies. </p>
      <p>[0193] Thus, the total heat energy generated within the
        conductive member 40 exceeds the total energy applied to the
        apparatus 10. In the case described above, the ratio of heat
        generated to energy applied is 3.58 to one, i.e. an efficiency
        of 358%. </p>
      <p>[0194] Several comments on theoretical energy efficiency
        calculation may be in order at this point. </p>
      <p>[0195] Although in the above description, as in practice, the
        total energy calculations are determined by measuring the heat
        change in the fluid (and therefore include the energy applied to
        drive the fluid), as a theoretical matter it might be more clear
        to consider the efficiency in terms of the energy applied to the
        conductive member 40 and/or the magnets 30 so as to produce the
        cyclically varying magnetic field (energy in), as compared to
        the heat energy produced in the conductive member 40 thereby
        (energy out). </p>
      <p>[0196] For embodiments wherein the cyclical variations in the
        magnetic field are produced by physical motion of the conductive
        member 40 and/or the magnets 30, the actual input energy is
        kinetic in nature. </p>
      <p>[0197] When considering kinetic energy applied, the kinetic
        energy applied to any supporting structures, such as a frame 20
        that supports the magnets (and moves therewith) must of course
        be included. Thus, the kinetic energy in question is the kinetic
        energy applied to produce the cyclical motion between the
        conductive member 40 and the magnets 30, not simply the kinetic
        energy of the magnets 30 or the conductive member 40 alone. This
        is true regardless of precisely what the motion is, or of how
        much additional mass (if any) is moved as well. </p>
      <p>[0198] Likewise, for embodiments wherein the cyclical
        variations in the magnetic field are produced by variations in
        the field strength of electromagnets, the actual input energy is
        electrical in nature. </p>
      <p>[0199] For embodiments that use both physical motion and
        variable-power electromagnets, the input energy will be the sum
        of the applied kinetic and electrical energy. </p>
      <p>[0200] Thus, regardless of the original source of the applied
        energy, i.e. whether by wind, water, an electric motor, a
        battery, a human or animal-operated mechanism, etc., the actual
        energy input for the invention for heat production is kinetic
        and/or electrical in nature. </p>
      <p>[0201] Likewise, regardless of the use of the energy produced,
        be it the production of steam, the generation of electric power,
        or the deliberate heating of an object or area, the actual
        energy output of the invention is the heat generated within the
        conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0202] However, it is noted that in actual applications and
        test conditions, it is often more convenient to measure the heat
        output, rather than measure the heat production directly.
        Likewise, it is often more convenient to measure the total
        energy applied to the system, rather than measure kinetic and
        electrical energy applied directly to the conductive member 40
        and/or the magnets 30. </p>
      <p>[0203] Such measurements may introduce small deviations into
        test data. For example, ancillary devices such as fluid drivers
        80 consume energy, and produce some quantity of heat. The energy
        applied to such devices is not used directly by the <b><i>magnetic




            heater</i></b> portion of the apparatus, i.e. it does not
        act to vary the magnetic field experienced by the conductive
        member 40. Consequently, it does not generate heat in the
        conductive member 40. Neither the energy provided to such
        devices nor the heat produced by them is properly considered
        when calculating the efficiency of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0204] However, in practice such deviations are of little or no
        consequence. First, the energy input and heat output of fluid
        drivers 80 and similar devices is generally very small compared
        to that of the heater apparatus 10 as a whole. Thus, any effect
        on the calculated efficiency is likewise small. </p>
      <p>[0205] Second, because the efficiency of such known devices in
        transforming electricity and other energy inputs into heat is
        much less than 100%, this will result in test data showing
        efficiency that is actually lower than the true efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0206] For these reasons, it has been considered acceptable in
        calculating efficiency as in the example above, wherein the
        total energy applied is summed and compared to the total change
        in heat energy of the fluid. </p>
      <p>[0207] However, it is noted that, at least for theoretical
        purposes, efficiency may be properly regarded and referred to as
        the thermal energy produced in the conductive member 40 divided
        by the kinetic and electrical energy applied to the conductive
        member and/or the magnets in order to produce cyclical
        variations in the magnetic field. In its most basic terms, the
        heat production efficiency of the invention is its efficiency in
        converting this applied kinetic and electrical energy to thermal
        energy in the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0208] In a preferred embodiment, the heat production
        efficiency is at least 100%. </p>
      <p>[0209] In a more preferred embodiment, the heat production
        efficiency is at least 150%. </p>
      <p>[0210] In a still more preferred embodiment, the heat
        production efficiency is at least 200%. </p>
      <p>[0211] In a yet more preferred embodiment, the heat production
        efficiency is at least 250%. </p>
      <p>[0212] In an even more preferred embodiment, the heat
        production efficiency is at least 300%. </p>
      <p>[0213] In a most preferred embodiment, the heat production
        efficiency is at least 350%. </p>
      <p>[0214] Heat production efficiency is not necessarily limited to
        about 350%; higher efficiencies may be equally suitable. In
        addition, it may be suitable to produce heat with an efficiency
        of less than 100% in certain embodiments. </p>
      <p>[0215] It is noted that efficiency at levels such as those
        described above, as measured during development of the
        invention, are unprecedented in conventional devices. It is
        acknowledged that levels of efficiency in excess of 100% would
        seem to defy conventional understandings with regard to
        thermodynamics. The reason for such high levels of efficiency,
        and the physical basis underlying them, is not fully understood
        at the time this application is filed. However, it is emphasized
        that the above efficiency calculations are based upon practical
        data, and are believed to accurately reflect the performance of
        the claimed invention. </p>
      <p>[0216] A wide variety of possible configurations, beyond those
        illustrated and described in detail, are possible. Essentially
        any arrangement wherein a conductive member 40 is moved
        proximate at least one magnet 30 or vice versa may be suitable.
      </p>
      <p>[0217] For example, for certain applications it may be
        advantageous to form the conductive member 40 or the frame 20
        (or even the magnets 30) into a shape that drives fluid within
        or through the fluid path 50. For example, the conductive member
        40 or the frame 20 may be configured to include vanes, blades,
        etc. That is, the fluid driver 80 may be integral with the
        conductive member 40 or the frame 20, depending on which is
        moving. Such an arrangement is illustrated in FIG. 11. </p>
      <p>[0218] Furthermore, the conductive member 40 may be of
        essentially any shape and size. Although the precise quantity of
        heat produced depends in part on the geometry of the apparatus,
        significant amounts of heat may be produced by a device of
        substantially any size. At one extreme, an apparatus in
        accordance with the principles of the claimed invention may be
        made to be of microscopic or submicroscopic size. Such a device
        could be utilized for example in nanotechnology applications. </p>
      <p>[0219] Conversely, an apparatus in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention may be constructed so as to
        be extraordinarily large, so as to be suitable for large-scale
        commercial or industrial applications. </p>
      <p>[0220] The fluid flow path 50 likewise may be of various
        configurations. For example, one or more fluid flow paths 50 may
        be disposed within the conductive member 40. In one possible
        embodiment, a pipe might carry fluid into spaces within the
        conductive member 40, wherein the fluid would absorb heat from
        the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0221] Alternatively, fluid flow paths 50 could be connected to
        the conductive member 40. For example, tubing or the like could
        be secured to the conductive member 40, such that fluid flowing
        therethrough absorbs heat from the conductive member 40. </p>
      <p>[0222] In addition, the magnets 30 themselves may have a
        variety of different forms. For example, a magnet 30 in the
        shape of a cylindrical shell may be used, with a conductive
        member 40 in the form of a hollow tube being rotated therein. </p>
      <p>[0223] In addition, although the preceding discussion is
        directed primarily towards the generation of heat, the claimed
        invention may be utilized for cooling purposes as well. In such
        an arrangement, a fluid with a suitable boiling point and heat
        of vaporization, including but not limited to water or freon,
        would be utilized. </p>
      <p>[0224] Fluid in the vicinity of the conducting member 40 is
        kept under pressure. Once the fluid absorbs heat from the
        conductive member 40 such that its temperature exceeds its
        boiling point at ambient pressure, it directed away from the
        conductive member 40, whereupon the pressure is released, and
        the fluid is allowed to expand from a liquid state into vapor.
        The expansion draws heat energy equal to its heat of
        vaporization from whatever may be in the vicinity of the
        expansion. The object or area thus loses that quantity of heat,
        and is cooled. This effect may be made to occur even when the
        fluid responsible for the cooling effect is warmer than the
        object or area that is being cooled. Thus, counter-intuitively,
        a hot fluid may be used for cooling. </p>
      <p>[0225] It is also noted that heat produced by the invention,
        and fluids heated by the invention, may be put to a wide variety
        of uses. Suitable applications include, but are not limited to,
        as a convection furnace, as a space heater, as a cooking stove
        or oven, for water purification or desalinization, clothes
        drying, heating livestock trailers or quarters, as a hair dryer
        or heat gun, for humidification by evaporation, as a water
        heater, for air conditioning, as a swimming pool heater, for
        smelting or processing of ores, metals, or alloys, for food
        dehydration, for steam sterilization, as a Sterling engine heat
        source, for heat sterilization, for steam generation, for
        thermoelectric generation, and for the production of infrared,
        visible, and ultraviolet light waves via incandescent heating. </p>
      <p>[0226] Other applications include the roasting of grains,
        peanuts, coffee, etc, use as a submersible heater for stock
        ponds, fish farms, wildlife sanctuaries, water troughs for
        livestock, etc, and the humidification, dehumidification, and
        purification of air. </p>
      <p>[0227] It is emphasized that although many of the uses
        described herein are small-scale residential or commercial
        applications, the claimed invention is not limited to small
        scale applications only. The size of the device, and its heat
        output, may be scaled up or down as materials and space permit
        to fulfill a wide variety of roles. In particular, large scale
        agricultural and commodities processing, and industrial heating,
        cooling, refrigeration, and freezing may be suitable
        applications for certain embodiments of the claimed invention. </p>
      <p>[0228] In addition, it is noted that an apparatus in accordance
        with the principles of the claimed invention may be made in a
        very simple fashion, without complex mechanisms and with very
        few moving parts. </p>
      <p>[0229] As a result, embodiments may be constructed so as to be
        extremely durable, both in actual use and in terms of "shelf
        life". </p>
      <p>[0230] Furthermore, because of the relatively simple
        construction of the claimed invention, the limited number of
        moving parts, and the lack of a need for a substantial
        supporting infrastructure (i.e. fuel lines, waste gas venting,
        etc.), embodiments of an apparatus in accordance with the
        principles of the claimed invention may be suitable for
        extremely harsh or demanding environments. For example, it may
        be suitable for applications wherein high gee-forces and other
        stresses are common, such as rockets and other high-energy
        launch vehicles and devices, spacecraft, military vehicles, and
        even certain types of munitions. Likewise, it may be suitable
        for use in vacuum and zero-gravity or micro-gravity
        environments, such as in spacecraft. As a further matter, it is
        noted that certain embodiments may be adapted to utilize solar
        wind to provide rotational energy, so as to generate the
        cyclically varying magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>[0231] Ultimately, the claimed invention may be useful for any
        application wherein heat generation, the transfer of heat from
        one location to another, or a product or process that may be
        produced or operated with heat or heat transfer (such as steam,
        electricity) is desired. </p>
      <p>[0232] In order to more fully describe possible applications
        for embodiments of the claimed invention, FIGS. 18 and 19 show
        two exemplary devices. </p>
      <p>[0233] The exemplary heater 11 shown in FIG. 18 includes a
        heater mechanism similar to that shown in FIG. 15, comprising a
        conductive member 40, frames 20 and 25 with magnets 30 and 35
        thereon, the magnets being disposed at distances 12 and 14 from
        the conductive member 40. A fluid driver 80 is arranged therein
        to drive fluid through the fluid flow path 50. A support member
        60 extends through the conductive member 40 and the frames 20
        and 25, and is connected to a drive mechanism 70. </p>
      <p>[0234] As previously noted with regard to other described
        embodiments, many of the components noted above and illustrated
        in FIG. 18 are exemplary only, and may be modified or omitted. </p>
      <p>[0235] As illustrated, the above components are contained
        within a housing 12. The housing 12 provides protection for the
        components, and also protects persons and objects nearby from
        coming into contact with the hot conductive member 40, and any
        moving parts (such as, in certain embodiments, the magnets,
        frames, or conductive member). </p>
      <p>[0236] Housings are well known, and are not described further
        herein. </p>
      <p>[0237] In addition, as illustrated, the heater 11 may include a
        temperature control mechanism 13. The temperature control
        mechanism 13 provides a convenient way of controlling the heat
        output of the heater 11. As shown, the temperature control
        mechanism 13 is in communication with the drive mechanism 70.
        With such an arrangement, the speed of motion of moving frames
        20 and 25 or conductive member 40 could be controlled thereby.
        However, this is exemplary only. It would also be possible, for
        example, to control the heat output by controlling the distances
        12 and 14, or by moving the magnets 30 and 35 and/or the
        conductive member 40 into or out of proximity with one another.
      </p>
      <p>[0238] Suitable temperature control mechanisms 13 include, but
        are not limited to, thermostats and fixed-level output controls
        (such as numbered dials or sliders). Temperature control
        mechanisms 13 are well known, and are not described further
        herein. </p>
      <p>[0239] It is noted that, depending on the scale and the precise
        configuration, the heater 11 shown in FIG. 18 might be suitable
        for a variety of roles, ranging from a small hot air blower or
        space heater, to a water heater or home furnace, to a large
        industrial heating device. </p>
      <p>[0240] Turning to FIG. 19, the exemplary heat driven apparatus
        14 shown therein also includes a heater mechanism similar to
        that shown in FIG. 15. As illustrated, it comprises a conductive
        member 40, frames 20 and 25 with magnets 30 and 35 thereon, the
        magnets being disposed at distances 12 and 14 from the
        conductive member 40. A fluid driver 80 is arranged therein to
        drive fluid through the fluid flow path 50. A support member 60
        extends through the conductive member 40 and the frames 20 and
        25, and is connected to a drive mechanism 70. Again, many of
        these components are exemplary only, and may be modified or
        omitted. </p>
      <p>[0241] In addition to the heater mechanism, the heat driven
        apparatus 14 also includes a heat operated mechanism 15. The
        heat operated mechanism 15 is in communication with the heater
        mechanism, so as to receive heat therefrom. </p>
      <p>[0242] In FIG. 19, this is illustrated by the positioning of
        the heat operated mechanism 15 on the far side of the conductive
        member 40 from the fluid driver 80, such that the heat operated
        mechanism 15 would receive heated fluid therefrom. However, this
        is exemplary only. Other arrangements may be equally suitable,
        including but not limited to direct contact between the
        conductive member 40 and the heat operated mechanism 15, and
        heat transfer via direct fluid loops, secondary fluid loops,
        heat exchangers, radiation, etc. </p>
      <p>[0243] The precise manner in which the heat operated mechanism
        15 is in communication (i.e., the manner in which heat is
        provided to the heat operated mechanism 15) may vary from
        embodiment to embodiment, and in particular may vary depending
        upon the nature and function of the particular heat operated
        mechanism 15. So long as the heat operated mechanism 15 is in
        communication with the heater mechanism, and thus so long as
        heat is transferred to the heat operated mechanism 15, the
        precise manner by which this occurs is incidental. </p>
      <p>[0244] A wide variety of heat operated mechanisms 15 may be
        suitable for use with the heat driven apparatus 14. Suitable
        heat operated mechanisms 15 include, but are not limited to, a
        furnace, a space heater, an electrical generator, a steam
        generator, an air conditioner, and a cooking mechanism. Other
        suitable heat operated mechanisms may include mechanisms for
        performing any of the applications described elsewhere herein. </p>
      <p>[0245] Because the heat operated mechanism 15 may vary
        considerably, it is illustrated in FIG. 19 in schematic form
        only, as a "black box" device. However, in practice, the heat
        operated mechanism 15 may have structure, may have various
        outputs, and may utilize or require inputs in addition to the
        heat from the heater mechanism. The schematic form used to show
        the heat operated mechanism 15 should not be interpreted as
        excluding such structure, inputs, and outputs. </p>
      <p>[0246] In particular, it is noted that although the apparatus
        14 is referred to as being heat driven, this should not be
        interpreted as implying that other inputs or power sources are
        necessarily excluded. For example, in embodiments where they are
        present the drive mechanism 70 or fluid driver 80 may draw
        electrical power, or may be operated by the force of fluid flow,
        the turning action of a windmill, etc. The term "heat driven
        apparatus" as used herein refers to the fact that a source of
        heat is utilized by the apparatus 14 in performing its intended
        function, not that heat is the sole requirement or input for
        performing that function. </p>
      <p>[0247] The above specification, examples and data provide a
        complete description of the manufacture and use of the
        composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the
        invention can be made without departing from the spirit and
        scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims
        hereinafter appended. </p>

        This invention is directed to an improved direct current (d.c.)
        motor. In particular, it is directed to an improved commutator
        system for a d.c. motor.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        A typical d.c. motor comprises a cylindrical stator, a rotor
        journaled on a shaft for rotation within the stator with a
        uniform gap between the rotor and stator as the rotor rotates.
        Armature windings are inserted in slots in a cylindrical surface
        on one of the stator and rotor and being divided into similar
        coils mutually spaced around the shaft axis. Magnetic field
        generating means are located on the other of said stator and
        rotor for forming poles mutually spaced around the shaft axis.
        D.C. motors require commutation, i.e., the process of reversing
        the current in each armature coil. This is carried out when the
        commutator segments to which the coil is connected are
        short-circuited by a brush connected to the d.c. supply voltage.
        The commutator is made up of a plurality of insulated, separate
        segments formed in a cylindrical surface with each surface
        electrically connected to an armature coil. The stator may
        comprise a ring of permanent or d.c.-field magnets which are
        attached to the inside of a housing or frame surrounding the
        rotor.<br>
        <br>
        Structurally, a typical commutator consists of a plurality of
        wedge-shaped copper bars that are built up to form a complete
        circular cylindrical contact surface with each segment separated
        and electrically insulated from one another by thin strips of
        mica. Means are provided to permit attachment of the ends of
        each rotor coil winding to separate spaced commutator bars.
        Stationary brushes of carbon blocks or copper gauze, which are
        electrically connected to a d.c. source, ride upon the
        commutator contact surface which make contact with the
        commutator segments. The d.c. current which is supplied to the
        brushes flows in the appropriate direction to the rotor coils
        only when they are opposite the appropriate field pole (North or
        South). The appropriate direction means that for all coils, the
        force produced will be in the same direction at all speeds and
        loads for the ring of segments and the brushes provide automatic
        switching to insure that this is so. A d.c. commutator motor has
        advantages over induction and synchronous motors in the ability
        to provide efficient speed variation over a wide range without a
        variable supply frequency. D.C. motors are typically classified
        as "shunt", "series", "compound" (sometimes classed as a varying
        speed motor), or "compensated compound" motors depending upon
        the application. Motors used in golf carts are inclusive of this
        invention. D.C. motors are particularly favored where high speed
        or variable speed electric drive is required.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        It is an object of this invention to provide an improved
        commutator for a d.c. electric motor which will provide improved
        horse power and torque for a given volt/amperage input as
        compared to a conventional d.c. motor.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with this invention, there is provided a d.c.
        motor comprising a cylindrical stator that includes permanent or
        d.c. fed coil type magnets. A rotor is journalled on a shaft for
        rotation within the stator with a uniform gap between the rotor
        and the stator as the rotor rotates. There are insulated
        armature windings, or coils, which are inserted in slots in a
        cylindrical surface on the rotor being divided into similar
        coils mutually spaced around the shaft axis. Magnetic field
        generating means are located on the other of the stator and the
        rotor for forming magnetic poles mutually spaced around the
        shaft axis. A switching means occurs utilizing commutator
        segments which are adapted to connect the armature coils to a
        d.c. source in timed synchronism with a rotation of the rotor.
        The d.c. electric source flows through brushes which may be
        carbon blocks or copper gauze. The switching means connects the
        armature coils to the d.c. source and in timed synchronism with
        the rotation of the rotor such that switching of the d.c. to
        each armature coil occurs when a magnetic pole generated by that
        coil is substantially in alignment with a rotor (or stator) pole
        of opposite polarity and thereby drawing it toward each other to
        create the rotary motion. In other aspects like polarity is
        created to exert a repelling force on the rotor poles to
        maintain the rotation. Instead of the field generating means,
        the stator may comprise a permanent magnet which can include the
        motor casing that supports the stator.<br>
        <br>
        A primary object of this invention is to provide a d.c. motor
        with an improved commutator, wherein the brush contact surface
        of each commutators segment includes at least one gap or slot
        that is angular to, or transverse to, the direction of rotation
        of the commutator.<br>
        <br>
        These and other objects of the invention will become more
        apparent upon further reading of the specification, claims and
        drawings herewith.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
          PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        While the invention has been described with a certain degree of
        particularity, it is manifest that many changes may be made in
        the details of construction and the arrangement of components
        without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
        It is understood that the invention is not limited to the
        embodiment set forth herein for purposes of exemplification, but
        is to be limited only by the scope of the attached claim or
        claims, including the full range of equivalency to which each
        element thereof is entitled.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to FIG. 1, 2, and 3, the commutator of this
        invention is generally designated by the numeral 10 and is
        comprised of a plurality of individual insulated segments 12,.
        The commutator is attached to the rotor shaft 14 and includes a
        hub 16 to which the segments 12 are insulatively attached. Each
        segment includes a means such as a slot or other form of
        electrical wiring connection 18 which connects with the
        appropriate portions of the armature coils which are formed
        within the rotor. A plurality of brushes 20 and 22 are used to
        make rubbing electrical contact with contact surface 24 of each
        segment. The brushes are appropriately connected to a d.c.
        source, i.e., a battery or the like, as is well known to those
        skilled in the art. The number and size of segments 12 and
        number of brushes 20 and 22 may vary and depend upon the
        performance characteristics of each d.c. motor design. Each
        commutator segment 12 is insulatively separated at 13 usually
        with mica.<br>
        <br>
        The invention herein comprises at least one or a plurality of
        air gaps or slots 30, as best shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, in the
        brush contact surface 24 of each segment 12. The air gaps or
        slots are cut into the cylindrical contact surface 24 preferably
        radially and transverse to the direction of rotation of the
        commutator. The gaps are typically slots of width ranging in
        width between 0.010" (0.25 mm) and 0.032" (0.81 mm). This range
        is not limiting, as the size of the slots will vary as to the
        width of the contact surface of the commutator and the number of
        slots therein. The slots could be angularly directed relative to
        the direction of rotation of the commutator, as shown in FIG. 8.
        As shown in FIG. 7 each segment 25 includes slots 27 of partial
        depth or, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the full depth of the
        contact surface of the commutator segment and may be open or
        filled with an inert material, e.g., mica or other electrically
        insulative material.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 4 is submitted to show schematically the various exemplary
        forms of d.c. motors to which this invention is applicable.<br>
        <br>
        Although the slots are shown as radial and transverse to the
        direction of rotation of the rotor and rotor shaft, the
        invention includes slots which are angularly directed to the
        direction of rotation.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 4 represents wiring schematics of various forms of d.c.
        motors to which this invention is applicable, although not
        limited thereto.<br>

        <br>
        A test was conducted comparing a standard series wound 8
        horsepower at 3400 rpm, d.c. motor, type 7544D, sold under the
        name VERSATILE as manufactured by the Baldor Electric Company of
        St. Louis, Mo. with the same motor having a commutator modified
        in accordance with this invention. The motor used d.c. enhanced
        magnet wire coils, four(4) in the stator and two (2) in the
        armature. The standard motor commutator had 72 segments with
        effectively 4 brushes. The test results were as follows:<br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A magnetic motor is driven by the repelling
        forces of fixed and rotating magnets. The rotating magnets (22,
        32) are mounted equally spaced about the perimeter of a disk
        (20) which rotates as the flywheel of the motor. Stationary
        magnets (18, 28) are supported adjacent the rotating magnets
        (22, 32). There are four injector pins (76A, 76B, 76C, 76D),
        much like the common injector pins on ball point pens, which are
        set and released by an injector pad (48A, 48B, 48C, 48D) driven
        by the crankshaft (14) of the engine. The crankshaft (14) and
        flywheel are driven by the repulsive forces created by the fixed
        and rotary magnets (22, 32) with the injector pin system (34,
        36, 38, 40) operating to kick the crankshaft (14) and the
        flywheel over center.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a magnetic motor for converting
        magnetic force into rotary motion. Reciprocating devices are
        well known in which a piston is slidably disposed within a
        similar chamber. A driving force is periodically generated in
        the cylinder chamber to drive the piston to reciprocating
        motion. Electromagnetic force has been utilized to provide the
        driving force in reciprocating engines or devices. In some such
        devices, a plurality of electrical coils surroundingthe engine
        cylinder chambers are provided. Electrical coils are actuated by
        electrical current so that electromangetic forces developed in
        the chamber could drive the piston to reciprocating motion.
        Normally, electromagnetic reciprocating devices are very complex
        in structure and very elaborate control means must be
        incorporated in the structure to operate the device in a
        controlled and useful manner. Furthermore, in most prior
        magnetic motors a constant supply of electrical current must be
        fed to the coils in order to develop a useful reciprocating
        motion.In US Patent 3,811,058 to Kiniski the patentee states
        that he has discovered that the magnetic energy stored in
        permanent magnetic material such as permanent magnets may be
        utilized to provide the driving force necessary for
        reciprocating device.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        This is a magnetic motor having a crankshaft mounted between two
        disk-like stationary magnetic holders. Preferably eight
        permanent magnets are positioned equally distanced about the
        periphery of each disk. Fixed on the end of each shaft is a
        rotatable magnetic support wheel which has a similar number of
        magnets equally spaced about its periphery. The magnets on one
        such wheel are 22-1/2 degrees out of alignment <br>
        &nbsp;with the magnets on the other rotating wheel. Injector
        pins are mounted on a case above the crankshaft. Each such
        injector system has an injection drive pin which has
        intermittent contact with an injector pad drivrn up and down in
        the injector pin housing by rotation of the crankshaft. The pin
        injecting drive system includes the mechanism similar to that
        which is used to push out and retract the ball tip out of ink
        writing pens. The magnets on each magnetic holder are 45 degrees
        apart and the magnet on one fixed disk or stationary disk is in
        alignment with the permanent magnets of the permanet disk on the
        other end of the crankshaft. When the magnetic support wheelmis
        rotated from the stop position the magnets will either attract
        or push and in the preferred embodiment they will push or be
        repulsive, that is the magnets on the permanent disk will have
        the same polarity as the polarity of the rotating magnets which
        come in close proximity to each other. Injectors are used to
        kick the crankshaft and the flywheel or the rotating magnetic
        support wheelsmover center so that the next propulsion force is
        created by the fixed rotary magnets will continue the rotational
        movement. <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description of the
          Invention</span><br>
        <br>
        Attention is first directed to Figures 1, 2 and 3. In Figure 1
        there is shown a case block 10 with cavity 12 in which is
        mounted a crankshaft 14 supported from block 10 by bearings or
        bushings 15. On the right side is a stationary base magnet
        holder 16 on which is permanently fixed magnets 18. As can
        clearly be seen in Figure 2 there are 8 such permanent magnets
        18. A magnet support wheel 20 is fixed to adn supported by and
        rotated with crankshaft 14. The magnetic support wheel 20
        support eight rotating magnets 22 equally spaced. Gear 24 is
        secured to crankshaft 14 to serve as a power takeoff means.<br>
        <br>
        On the left hand side of the device in Figure 1 is a stationary
        base magnet holder 26 having eight stationary magnets 28 whihc
        are aligned with magnets 18. There is also a rotating magnetic
        field support wheel 30 having eight equally spaced rotating
        magnets 32 fixed thereto. The rotatin&nbsp; magnets on one wheel
        are 22-1/2 degrees out of alignment with those on the other
        rotating wheel.<br>
        <br>
        As shown in Figure 1 there are four pin injector assemblies 34,
        36, 38 and 40 which are mounted on top of case 10. As shown in
        the cutaway view of pin injector system 40 there is injector
        driver pin 42 which in the position shown for injector pin
        system 40 extends down belowhousing 44 into enlarged housing 46.
        Spaced within housing 46 is an injector pad 48 which is slidably
        mounted in that housing. The injector pad is connected by a
        connecting rod 50 to knuckle joint 52 which has a second
        connecting arm 54 whihc is pivotally connected to a parallel
        crank arms 56 and 60 which are connected to the shaft 14. A
        pivot pin 58 connects the connecting rod 54 to the crank arms 56
        adn 60. The other three pin injector assemblies 34, 36 and 38
        are similarly connected to the crankshaft 14, however, they are
        so positioned on the shaft that only one is in its top dead
        position at a time. They reach their top dead position 90
        degrees apart for each rotation of the crankshaft 14.<br>
        <br>
        Attention is now directed especially to Figures 2 and 3.&nbsp;
        It can be seen that they are similar but have a different
        orientation. Each side has magnet support wheel with eight
        magnets thereon which rotates with the wheel and eight magnets
        mounted on the stationary magnet holder. These magnets are all
        equally radially spaced and any two adjacent magnets are 45
        degrees apart. It can be seen from Figures 2 and 3 that the
        orientation of the magnets 28 in the permanent or stationary
        magnetic holder 26 are oriented or aligned directly withe the
        magnets 18 of the stationary based magnetic holder 16. However,
        the rotating magnets 32 on rotating disk or wheel 30 are not
        oriented with the rotating magnets 22 of the rotating wheel 20.
        Rather, they are the orientation of rotatins shafts 22 with
        resepct to the axis of shaft 14. In other words, when a rotating
        magnet 32 is directly nder magnet 28 and lin injector assembly
        34 as shown in Figure 3, then the rotating magnets 22 one each
        be halfway between tow permanent magnets 18 in Figure 2. it is
        noted that the interior edge of magnets 18 and 28 are curved.
        This is to provide clearance for the inner rotating magnets. The
        injector pin system 40 is very similar in construction and
        operation to the pin on millions of ball point pens in which one
        push on the pin on top of the ballpoint pen will psh the writing
        ball out and a second push on it will cause the ballppoinbt to
        retract. Figures 6 through 14 illustrate the main componetns of
        such an injector pin.<br>
        <br>
        Attention is next directed to Figure 6 which shows an injector
        housing 62 screwed into a cylinder head 64. Housing 62 is hollow
        with an internal passage 66 having the shoulder 68 toward the
        lower end. The upper end of the housing is enclosed by cap 70.
        The reduced diameter passage portion 72 of passage 66 has a
        lowered tapered shoulder 74. Shown in Figure 8 is the injector
        pin 76. The part 76 shown in Figure 8 corresponds to the push
        pin or rod on top of the aforementioned ballpoint pen. The
        injector pin 78 has an injector head 78 which has a passage 80
        therein. A tooth spring holder head 82 shown in Figure 9 fits
        into the space 80 as shown in Figure 6. The upper end of
        injector head 78 has locking teeth 83 which can mesh with
        locking teeth 84 of tooth spring holder head 82. The top of
        tooth spring holder head 82 has a spring recieing shoulder 86
        for holding spring 88 as shown in Figure 6. Spring holding head
        90 has four major interlocking gears 92 and four minor
        interlocking gears 94 equally spaced between the interlock gears
        92 which have a smaller diameter than the lock gears 92 as
        clearly shown in Figure 7.<br>
        <br>
        The interior wall of housing 62 has a series of locking pads 96
        with smaller shoulder 98 as clearly shown in Figure 7 and 12
        with channel 100 therebetween. Figure 10 is a view on the line
        10-10 of Figure 9 and shows the interlock gears 19 which are
        spaced at 90 degrees and the interlock teeth 104 which are
        between the interlock gear 92. Figure 12 is helpful in
        understanding the internal view of the interior of the injector
        wall unrolled showing the pattern of the locking pads 96 and
        locking shoulder 98. Attention is briefly directed back to
        Figure 4 which shows the injector pin 76 mounted above injector
        pad 108. It will be understood that as crankshaft 14 rotates
        that injector pad 108 moves up and down within housing 52. In
        FIgure 11 the injector pad 108 has been oved upwardly by the
        rotation of the crankshaft where it contacts the injector pin 76
        which causes it to move upwardly and in the position shown in
        Figure 11 the injector sleeve head 82 is free to rotate due to
        the action between teh sloped teeth 84 of head 82 and by the
        upwardly facing sloped teeth 83 of the sleeve injector head 78
        and causes the holder head 82 to rotate by continued upward
        force until it reaches the position shown in Figure 13 which
        injector pin is in its cocked position. At the next contact of
        the pin 76 by pad 108 the holder head 82 will rotate and be free
        to fall with the force of the spring 82 driving it downwardly.
        this downward force is transmitted to the pad 108 which force is
        tehn transmitted to the form of rotational force to the
        crankshaft causing it to be driven in a rotating position. Thus,
        one rotating position of the crankshaft will cause the pad 108
        to drived the injector pin 76 upwardly till it is cocked and the
        next rotation of thecrankshaft will cause the upeard movement of
        the pin 76 (which fell to its lower position) and the upward
        movement will cause the holder head 82 to rotate to an unlocked
        posoiton whereby the spring 88 will drive it and the pin 76
        upwardly.<br>
        <br>
        Attention is next directed toward the operation of this magnetic
        motor. Attention is first directed to Figures 19A and 19B. It
        will be noted that Figures 19A, 20A, 21A and 22A represent the
        left hand magnet orientation of those orientations shown in
        Figure 3 whereas Figures 20B, 21B and 22B are right hand magnet
        orientations or the orientations of those magnets as shown in
        Figure 2. When in this position as shown in Figure 19A, magnets
        28 and 32 are nearly aligned but there is a magnetic force in
        the direction of the solid line arrow. The dashed arrows show
        the direction of rotation of the rotating wheel. Figure 19B as
        indicated the north pole of the magnet 28 is adjacent the north
        pole of magnet 32 so that there is a repulsive action. This is
        true pof all the other pairs of magnets of both the left hand
        magnet orientation and the right hand magnets. In Figure 19B the
        rotating magnet 22 is being rapidly propelled from a position
        adjacent magnet 18 by the force&nbsp; represented by the solid
        line arrow and in the direction indicated. Attention is now
        directed to Figure 15 to visualize the position of the
        crankshaft and the injector pads 48. In injector pin assembly 44
        the pad 48A has pushed the injector drive pin 76A upwardly into
        the housing 34 much like indicated in Figure 11. One revolution
        of the crankshaft cocks the injector pin assmebly, and in the
        next revolution crankshaft 14 injector pad fires the injector
        pin. The position of the crankshaft adn injector pad 48B, 48C
        and 48 are also indicated. Continued rotation of the crankshaft
        will cause the injector pin assemblies to take the position
        shown in Figure 16 whereas the injector pin assembly 36 is in
        its top dead center position. The rotation of the rotating wheel
        20 adn 30 are indicated by the broken line arrows. When the
        injector pin assembly is in the kick mode, it operates to kick
        the crankshaft and the flywheel over center once the rotational
        motion has been instigated. As can be seen the pin and spring
        which when the crank arm strikes the injector pin will force the
        crank arm and rotaing magnetic wheel over center. The output for
        the motor is then drected through gear 24 for appropriate power
        takeoff connections. Once it is kicked off center the propulsion
        force causes the wheel to rotate.<br>
        <br>
        Figures 20A and 20B show the position of the magnets when pin
        injector assembly 36 is at its top dead center as indicated in
        Figure 16. Figures 21A and 21B show the position when pin
        injector assembly 3 is at top dead position as indicated in
        Figure 17. Figure 18 shows the pin injector assembly 40 at its
        top dead center position when the magnets are in the position
        shown in Figures 22A and 22B.<br>
        <br>
        This motor is designed to obtain power by push and pull motion
        of the magnets. The magnets shown have a tendency to push
        inasmuch as they are like poles coming into proximity with each
        other. The magnets can be reversed s that the magnets will have
        a tendency to attract each other. The engine as described has
        four cylinders with 32 magnets, 16 magnets to each end. On each
        end there are 8 rotating magnets and 8 stationary magnets. This
        magnetic motor has injectors that push on the crankshaft to
        drive the motor over the point of magnetic pull. The particular
        motor which I have built is a small engine made out of aluminum,
        brass and stainless steel with no steel parts. <br>
        <br>
        There is no limit to the size of the motor which I can build
        with the dimensions to the magnetic motor depending upon what
        size magnets that you use. The magnets can be molded into a
        plastic with a shaped top across the magnet and the crankshaft
        can be made out of ceramics. The body could also be made of
        plastic.<br>
        <br>
        While the invention has been described with a certain degree of
        particularity, it is manifest that many changes may be made in
        the details of construction and the arrangement of components
        without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
        it is understood that the invention os not limited to the
        embodiments set forth herein for pusposes of exemplification,
        but is to be limited only by the scope of the attached claims,
        including the full range of equivalency to which each element
        thereof is entitled.<br>
