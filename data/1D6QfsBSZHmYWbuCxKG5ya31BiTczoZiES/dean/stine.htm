      <p>In common with many other people, I once carried on a prolific
        correspondence with the late John W Campbell, former Editor of
        Analog. We discussed lots of things, and it was stimulating
        because we were usually thousands of miles apart. Even today as
        I reread the letters, it is high intellectual adventure. If
        anyone thought Campbell’s Editorials were controversial, he
        would have considered the Campbell correspondence outrageous,
        because JWC often tried out Editorial ideas first in
        correspondence with friends and readers. </p>
      <p>However, John’s single-page letter of August 21, 1959 ---
        highly unusual because his letters normally ran to a minimum of
        4 or 5 pages, sometimes more, rarely less --- was to change my
        life and that of several other people beyond our wildest
        imaginings. </p>
      <p>To quote the letter directly: ‘If you recall, some while back I
        said I believed we wouldn’t sue rockets to reach the planets…
        This week, I saw photographs of a working model of a space drive
        engine. It makes a monkey’s uncle out of the law of conservation
        of momentum as we know it. The working model demonstrated the
        principle but was, understandably, not very successful as a
        flying machine. The inventor couldn’t afford the auto-pilot
        system to stabilize it in mid-air… The device was powered by a
        standard 1/4 inch electric drill… a non-flying model resting on
        a tabletop, on ball-bearing wheels giving effectively zero
        friction, exerted a push of about 85 pounds --- also 1/4 inch
        drill-motor powered. Set on end on a standard weighing machine,
        it weighed 135 lb. With the motor activated, the weight dropped
        to 50 lb. </p>
      <p>‘Engineering calculations --- made by an outside firm of
        professional consulting engineers --- show that a 3000 lb
        machine could rise with an acceleration of 37 ft/sec^2 --- 5
        ft/sec^2 over G --- when driven by a 25-hp engine at 2800 rpm.
        With a 150 hp engine at about 4000 rpm, it would have a gross
        vertical acceleration of 2 G, net of 1 G. </p>
      <p>‘The device is purely mechanical. It depends on an elegant
        application of principles of centrifugal force in orbiting
        masses when the center of orbits is changed in a precisely
        phased manner. The actual result is that momentum apparently
        appears at the expense of energy. </p>
      <p>‘I am getting detailed information as rapidly as I can’. </p>
      <p>Naturally, I was excited. My return letter asked all sorts of
        questions. But it became a secondary thing in my life because I
        had just lost my pioneer model rocket company. I was starting
        work as an engineer at Stanley Aviation Corporation in Denver,
        and we had a new baby on the way. Looking back on that letter
        today, I realized that I had since learned that John Campbell
        was an excellent editor, fantastic writer, outstanding
        scientific dilettante, and somewhat confused physicist when it
        came to the Dean Drive… which has confused a lot of physicists.
      </p>
      <p>My work at Stanley was not totally unconnected with what later
        happened. We were developing the crew escape capsules for the
        supersonic B-58 Hustler bomber. As the escape capsules were
        blasted out of the plane, they were dynamically stabilized by
        yokes with fins that snapped up. This was necessary to keep the
        rotation rates and acceleration within the stiff USAF criteria
        for human factors established by Col. J. P. Stapp on his rocket
        sleds. </p>
      <p>Well, that was the way it was supposed to work, but we couldn’t
        keep the damned yokes from breaking off. </p>
      <p>All calculations by the stress group proved that the cables and
        booms were more than strong enough to absorb the expected loads.
        But when they were catapulted out of the rocket sled at
        Hurricane Mesa, Utah, the yokes left the capsules at the booms
        and cables snapped. When I ventured meekly to point out to the
        stress engineers that there might be additional forces involved
        because of the rapidity with which the loads were applied, the
        reaction was, ‘You mean to tell us that stress isn’t
        proportional to strain?’ </p>
      <p>I got more deeply involved when we decided to challenge the
        USAF human factors limits which were based on a maximum of 15 Gs
        with a rate of 1500 G/second rate of onset. It seemed to us that
        ordinary athletes exceeded those limits regularly. So we put
        accelerometers on the shoulder pads of two burly University of
        Colorado football linemen and recorded what happened when they
        tackled each other. The data revealed that they had sustained
        accelerations of over 45 Gs at rates of onset of 5000 G/sec.
        This was written up in Time magazine, and we got the USAF to
        relax their human factors specs so that we could build a capsule
        that would stay together. </p>
      <p>But before the Stanley capsule was qualified, I went to an
        American Rocket Society meeting in Los Angeles and met an old
        friend, Dr William O Davis, retired Colonel in the USAF, former
        director of the AF Office of Scientific Research, and mentor of
        Project Farside. He had just taken a position as Director of
        Research for a small, obscure company on the east Coast named
        Huyck Corporation. He asked me to join him in New York City as
        his Assistant Director of Research. I did so, moving to
        Connecticut and commuting to NYC for the first time in July
        1960. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, John Campbell set the SF world on its ear
        again --- it was still recovering from Dianetics and psionics
        --- with an Editorial in the December 1959 issue of Astounding
        Science Fiction, as Analog was called then. In brief, he
        revealed to the readers what he had told me in his August 1959
        letter. </p>
      <p>The science-fact article in the June 1960 issue was written by
        Campbell with photographs that he had taken. It concerned this
        wonderful machine which he dubbed the Dean Drive. </p>
      <p>The inventor of the device was Norman L Dean, a civil service
        employee residing in Washington DC. He had no formal training as
        an engineer or scientists; he was a typical amateur tinkerer and
        inventor. In common with most inventors, he didn’t know that it
        couldn’t be done, so he went ahead and tried. </p>
      <p>Dean obtained US Patent # 2,886,976 on his device, but it will
        not tell you much about how to build a Dean Drive. </p>
      <p>Basically, the Dean Drive consisted of a pair of
        eccentrically-mounted, counter-rotating masses driven by an
        electric motor through a pair of slipper-type universal joints
        and a slip or sleeve joint. The rotation of these masses
        produced an oscillating motion commonly known as simple harmonic
        motion. The use of rotating masses to produce oscillatory or
        vibrating motion is widely used in industrial practice and is
        commonly called a Buehler Drive. However, in the Dean Drive this
        oscillating carriage was not permitted to oscillate freely. At
        one point in its cycle, the oscillating frame was hard-coupled
        to the main frame of the machine or to the force rod coming out
        of the side of the frame. During the remainder of the cycle, the
        mechanical oscillator was free and unclutched. </p>
      <p>The operation of the Dean Drive is very complex and is not
        amenable to quick-and-dirty analysis. It is a dynamic system. </p>
      <p>Although Campbell’s article dwelt mainly on the fact that no
        government agency, especially NASA or DoD, had ever bothered to
        take a look at the Dean Drive, Campbell stated in his article:
        ‘I think Dean’s device is a true space drive; that it does work…
        Again, I emphasize, it is not important whether Dean is right or
        wrong; what is important is that the (government) agencies did
        not find out’. However, Campbell stated that he did believe that
        the Dean Drive was not a practical device, but a ‘proof of
        principle’ machine. He also stated that he really didn’t fully
        understand why the Dean Drive seemed to work and that he really
        didn’t believe Dean’s own mathematical analysis or operating
        theory. This is an important change in attitude on Campbell’s
        part between his August 1959 letter to me and the June 1960 ASF
        article. Perhaps the difference can be laid to the fact that in
        his letter he was writing privately to a fellow space nut while
        his article was written for ASF readers. </p>
      <p>Because our responsibility in Corporation Research was to
        investigate for Huyck Corporation any promising area of science
        or technology that might lead to the development of new
        industrial products for the company, Dr Davis and I drove to
        Washington DC on September 27, 1960. On the morning of September
        28, we drove to Dean’s apartment on Wisconsin Avenue. </p>
      <p>I quote now from the laboratory notebook of Dr William Davis,
        dated September 30, 1960, and signed by me as a witness,
        indicating that it amounted to a joint report: </p>
      <p>‘Visited Mr Norman Dean in Washington on September 28 at the
        suggestion of John Campbell to see the Dean Drive in action. The
        device he showed us did not levitate, but applied a lateral
        force to a mass. Harry Stine accompanied me, and both of us
        approached this unlikely device with skepticism. The mechanism
        was constructed of metal and Lucite in such a way that the
        moving parts were clearly visible. We checked for the usual
        gimmicks of air hoses and the like but found nothing. The model
        rested on the waxed floor of Dean’s apartment. Hidden magnets
        seemed unlikely and in any event could not account for the
        magnitude of the forces displayed, particularly since there
        appeared to be very little ferritic material in the device. </p>
      <p>‘The drive was arranged so as to apply its output to a push-rod
        which was fastened to a reaction mass (also open) which appeared
        to weigh approximately three times as much as the drive unit. We
        inspected both the drive and the reaction mass before and after
        the demonstration and are convinced that both were free to move
        on the polished surface of the floor. There was no observable
        tilt to the floor. Both masses rested on flange type feet and no
        scratches were observed on the floor when either was slid. </p>
      <p>‘When the drive was brought up to speed and the clutch
        mechanism activated, the drive was observed to produce a force
        such that the reaction mass was moved several millimeters in a
        gradual, steady manner while the drive unit did not move at all
        when observed closely with the naked eye from a distance of only
        a few inches. </p>
      <p>‘A second experiment was performed where the reaction mass was
        replaced by each of our hands in turn. When the drive operated,
        a definite force was felt which increased with pressure and
        produced motion of the hand against the pressure. With the drive
        turned off, this same pressure easily moved the drive unit
        several inches’. </p>
      <p>(Yes, the Dean Drive did push against my right hand as
        described. After all these years, I can still recall it
        vividly.) </p>
      <p>‘It was the conclusion of both Harry Stine and myself that we
        had witnessed a real anomaly and that the possibility of fraud
        in the demonstration was slim. When this is combined with the
        testimony of other competent witnesses, some of whom have
        witnessed the weight reduction experiment, it seems increasingly
        likely that Dean has produced a genuine new phenomenon. His
        explanation, as given in his papers on the subject, does not
        strike me as valid, but whether or not his theory is correct we
        have seen something new which I do not believe can be accounted
        for with classical Newtonian analyses. For this reason, I have
        decided to undertake a theoretical study of dynamic systems to
        see if a concept can be evolved which will describe a world in
        which Dean’s Drive can exist and yet where other known facts are
        not contradicted’. </p>
      <p>I have taken the liberty of quoting extensively from written
        notes made within a day or so of witnessing the phenomenon of
        the Dean Drive in operation because they more accurately express
        our joint observations of the time and do not exhibit the
        ravages of time on the memory. They serve to key other
        significant memories as well. </p>
      <p>On the way back to Connecticut that night, I can still vividly
        recall Bill Davis blurting out, ‘I wonder if there is a force
        proportional to the rate of change of acceleration?’ </p>
      <p>His question led him right back to basic Newtonian mechanics
        where he added a fourth term, a third derivative, to the general
        equation of motion. By October 14, 1960, Davis had worked out
        the basic mathematical equation that he later published in his
        May 1962 Analog article, ‘The Fourth Law of Motion’. </p>
      <p>His notebook entry for October 21, 1960 contains an important
        note: </p>
      <p>‘One point suddenly occurs to me. One consequence of the
        foregoing analysis, if it later proves to be correct, is that
        the operation of the Dean Drive does not depend upon the
        rotating weights, but only on the motion of the axle, however
        induced. In other words, if a simple harmonic driving force is
        applied to a point with suitable cyclic parameters, then an
        unbalanced force should result. Obviously, this driving force
        might be applied by other mechanical means, or by means of
        magnetic and/or electric fields. Thus it becomes possible to
        design an entirely new kind of inertial drive which does not
        incorporate the principles of Dean’s machine as outlined in his
        patent claims!’ </p>
      <p>This was an important theoretical breakthrough because Davis
        had had no success at all in attempting to deal with Norman
        Dean. Most inventors want a million dollars and Dean was no
        exception to the rule. We could not get our hands on a Dean
        Drive with which to experiment. Nor could we legally attempt to
        construct one from the patent data, John Campbell’s excellent
        photos, and our own memories. </p>
      <p>Although Davis had worked out a theoretical universe in which a
        machine like the Dean Drive would be possible, we both knew that
        mathematics will lead you only to the logical conclusions of
        your basic assumptions. The theory had to be backed up with
        experimental evidence, and we didn’t have the Dean Drive to work
        with. Bill Davis and I spent months searching for an elegant
        experiment that would either prove or disprove Davis mechanics
        --- Robert Heinlein hung that sobriquet on the work in Chapter 9
        of Podkayne of Mars, so I guess it’s official. Professor Serge
        Korff of the physics department of NY University, a top cosmic
        ray researcher, and later president of the NY Academy of Science
        s and the Explorers Club, was retained as a consultant by Huyck
        Corporation at Bill Davis’ request to ‘keep us honest’
        academically; as a top flight physicist, Professor Korff’s duty
        was to shoot us out of the saddle if the logic was faulty, the
        math bad, or the experimental program trivial. John Campbell was
        also retained as a consultant with the responsibility of
        assuming his classical role of a hair shirt; he kept us honest
        in a different way. We were soon joined by a young Iranian
        mathematician, E.L. Victory, a graduate of MIT who was working
        for Huyck at the company’s paper machine felt plant in
        Renssalaer, NY. Vic had just been given the problem of analyzing
        why the wringer-like press section of a paper machine wouldn’t
        squeeze water out of paper and the Huyck felts at high machine
        speeds. Vic had come to the tentative conclusion that the rate
        of onset of force between the press rolls didn’t give water time
        to get out of the paper or the felt, creating a situation akin
        to the tire hydroplaning that was later described by the
        British. </p>
      <p>The basis of Davis mechanics rests on the hypothesis that the
        energy of a system cannot be changed in zero time. In other
        words, there is a ‘critical action time’ during which the system
        cannot behave in a Newtonian fashion and during which the system
        as a whole cannot accept the energy. In the case of an applied
        force in one dimension, Davis mechanics revives the classical
        Newtonian equation to the following form: </p>
      <p>F = kx + V dx / dt <br>
        + m d^2x / dt^2 <br>
        + Dm d^3x / dt^3 </p>
      <p>This is the basic Newtonian equation of motion with the
        exception of the third derivative term where k = Hook’s Law
        spring constant, V = viscous damping coefficient, m = mass, and
        D = the elusive critical action time. </p>
      <p>Once a month, a meeting was held in the Huyck offices in New
        York City in which the theoretical and experimental programs
        were reviewed. Always in attendance were Bill Davis, Vic
        Victory, myself, Serge Korff, and John Campbell. Because the
        initials of ‘critical reaction time’ are CAT, we became the ‘CAT
        Pack’. These were wild meeting because Davis and Victory were
        making real progress on the theoretical mathematical background
        of Davis mechanics, and the work was making logical sense. One
        meeting really sticks in my mind; in late 1961, I sat astounded
        and watched Professor Korff derive Planck’s Constant and the
        quantum condition from Newtonian mechanics using the hypothesis
        of Davis mechanics. </p>
      <p>But the experimental program didn’t run so well. In late 1960,
        I set up a small experimental area at the Huyck Equipment
        Company building, an old WW2 barracks located on Factory Lane in
        Milford CT. With the help of an excellent experimental machine
        shop downstairs and Wendell Stickney, Huyck’s very practical,
        brilliant development engineer, I built a series of devices
        capable of generating simple harmonic motion. We were looking
        for some indication of the CAT, the elusive D in the Davis
        equations. </p>
      <p>Obviously, these devices were known as D-testers, or simply
        Detesters. </p>
      <p>One by one, these experimental rigs were rejected because we
        could not account for all of the forces and therefore could not
        isolate D. </p>
      <p>Finally, in May 1961, we decided to take a very close look at
        precisely the harmonic drive mechanism that was used in the Dean
        Drive. This is a device known as a Buehler Drive and it is
        commonly used throughout industry to generate vibration or
        oscillatory motion. It consists of two counter-rotating
        eccentric masses. I designed the device and had it built in the
        little machine shop. I still have the original drawings; I could
        build another one just like it today, and I might do it
        sometime. It was accurately described in a letter from E.L.
        Victory and me that appeared in the Brass Tacks department of
        the September 1963 Analog: </p>
      <p>‘Mass of the rotating weights was 1607.3 grams, and the ration
        of the mass of the weights to the mass of the carriage was
        0.9333. The test device was driven by a 1/4 inch electric drill
        motor, which was equipped with a 6-inch diameter 10-pound
        flywheel to insure constant rate of angular rotation, thence
        through a universal joint, a slip joint, and another universal
        joint. A protractor-type dial was affixed to the front of the
        device with a pointer the shaft of the upper mass to indicate
        angular position of the weights.&nbsp; A cursor line and scale
        were used to determine position of the carriage in the lateral
        direction.&nbsp; Operation was observed with the aid of a
        General Radio 'Strobotac', and photographs of the operating
        device were made. A Variac adjustable autotransformer was used
        to control the rotational speed of the motor." </p>
      <p>What were we looking for?&nbsp; In our meeting on September 28,
        1960, Normal L. Dean claimed that the classical situation of a
        simple harmonic motion drive was incorrect.&nbsp; Classically,
        when the masses are displaced to their maximum extent to the
        right, for example, the carriage will be at its maximum
        displacement to the left.&nbsp; Thus the device operates with a
        180-degree phase angle between weights and carriage. </p>
      <p>Dean claimed that the motion of the carriage led the motion of
        the weights by 225 degrees, creating a "phase angle" of 45
        degrees. </p>
      <p>When simple harmonic motion is considered as the driving force
        in Davis mechanics, this phase angle does indeed appear . . .
        but not to the extent claimed by Dean. </p>
      <p>With our oscillating device, we were looking for a phase
        angle.&nbsp; Hence the device was called the "Phaser Mark I",
        with due apologies to Gene Roddenberry because we were first. </p>
      <p>Phaser Mark I Mod 0 was driven with a light 1/4-inch drill rod
        shaft, two light-duty Boston Gear universal joints which are
        also called "slipper joints", and a light-duty sleeve-type slip
        joint.&nbsp; I ran the device from 150 rpm to 1,500 rpm.&nbsp; I
        looked hard for a phase angle, so did Davis, Victory, Korff, and
        Campbell.&nbsp; We never saw the phase angle claimed by Dean
        using similar equipment.&nbsp; What I did succeed in doing was
        to tear hell out of those 1/4-inch slipper joints to the point
        where there was at least 15 degrees of slop in them, a disparity
        that would have rendered any observed phase angle meaningless. </p>
      <p>So I created Phaser Mark I Mod 1 with a beefed-up drive train
        using 1/2-inch slipper joints, half-inch drill rod shaft, and
        really beefy sleeve joint. </p>
      <p>At 1,500 rpm, just at the point where the Phaser was about to
        ear itself to pieces and scatter parts all over the room, I saw
        a three-degree phase angle. </p>
      <p>Although this wasn't the magnitude of phase angle reported by
        Norman Dean, it cast serious doubt on classical theory which
        says that there should be no phase angle whatsoever! </p>
      <p>I saw the three-degree phase angle several times.&nbsp; So did
        Bill Davis and E.L. Victory.&nbsp; To eliminate any source of
        error. I measured the total slack in the entire drive train; it
        was less than a half-degree. </p>
      <p>To prove that this phase angle, which was real, was not a
        cconsequence of the rotating masses, I re-designed the Phaser to
        Mark II configuration.&nbsp; This used an oscillating mass, a
        single weight that vibrated horizontally back and forth driven
        by a small eccentric.&nbsp; The magnitude of its displacement
        was the same as that of the counter-rotating masses, and I
        maintained the same oscillatory mass and the same mass ratio as
        in Phaser Mark I. </p>
      <p>With the oscillating weight of the Phaser Mark II vibrating
        back and forth at 1,500 cycles, the operation was a lot
        smoother, and I saw the good old three-degree phase angle just
        as before.&nbsp; It was highly repeatable.&nbsp; It was
        witnessed by Davis, Victory, and others. </p>
      <p>The motion of the carriage led the motion of the driving force
        of the oscillating mass(es). </p>
      <p>Looking back on this series of experiments with the Phasers, I
        now realize that it was probably the elegant experimental proof
        we were searching for. Victory's calculations said that our
        Phasers had a critical action time of a half millisecond.&nbsp;
        We should have built one with twice the dimensions to see if it
        had a CAT of a full millisecond, or at least a larger critical
        action time.&nbsp; If we had been able to predict the CAT, we
        would have had proof. </p>
      <p>I believe our big problem was the fact that we had gained a
        large measure of respect--nay, downright fear--of the
        Phasers.&nbsp; The sight of that seven-pound Phaser shaking back
        and forth on a lab bench at 1,500 cycles was more than
        impressive.&nbsp; It shook the whole building when it went into
        resonance with the structure.&nbsp; And it kept trying to tear
        itself to pieces.&nbsp; I kept beefing it up.&nbsp; I can
        guarantee that when I got through with that drive train, it was
        strong.&nbsp; Although we should have taken the "American"
        approach of making it bigger, we abandoned the Phaser
        experiments.&nbsp; We figured that it would be easier to make
        measurements on a linear system instead. </p>
      <p>So I designed a rocket-powered ballistic pendulum. </p>
      <p>It consisted of two five-pound cylindrical masses separated by
        a 36-inch length of hardened 1/4-inch drill rod.&nbsp; The
        device was hung as a ballistic pendulum, initially eight feet
        long.&nbsp; On the rear mass, I mounted an Estes Type B14 solid
        propellant rocket motor that would produce a peak thrust of nine
        pounds 150 milliseconds after ignition and had a duration of 300
        milliseconds.&nbsp; The mass of the rocket propellant used was
        less than one percent of the total mass of the pendulum.&nbsp; A
        Dynisco bonded strain gage load cell was mounted on the rear
        mass to measure the intantaneous throust of the rocket motor on
        the pendulum.&nbsp; This was read out on a high-speed Visicorder
        light-0beam oscillograph.&nbsp; A light trough was placed below
        the pendulum with a 300-watt spot light at one end of the
        trough.&nbsp; In each&nbsp; pendulum bob, a cadmium sulfide
        photocell looked straight down into the light trough, detecting
        the light gradient as the pendulum swung. The outputs of both
        photocells were fed into separate channels in the Visicorder. We
        calibrated this and discovered that it was a very sensitive
        pendulum position indicator. </p>
      <p>When the rocket motor was electrically ignited, it pushed the
        pendulum horizontally. The thrust-time curve of the rocket motor
        was recorded along with the photocell output that was
        proportional to the pendulum position. </p>
      <p>Theoretical calculations predicted that there should be a time
        delay between the instant that thrust was applied to the
        pendulum and the instant it started to move. Davis mechanics
        also predicted that there would be a discrepancy between how far
        the pendulum swung --- based on the total impulse imparted to it
        by the rocket motor --- in reality and how far it should have
        swung according to classical mechanics. </p>
      <p>We chased bugs in that rocket pendulum for over two years.
        First, we moved it to a new lab at Stamford, CT, where it was
        re-hung from 16-foot lines. When we moved the lab again in
        Stamford, we again re-hung it as a 16-foot ballistic pendulum
        and developed an even more accurate capacitance position
        measurement system for it. </p>
      <p>In all the hundreds of tests with the pendulum, we never
        detected what we were looking for. I know now that it was
        because the system was too small and that the rate-of-change of
        force imparted by the rocket motor was too low. We should have
        hit it with a 16-pound sledge instead. We didn’t because I hit
        it with a one-pound hammer once, and broke a $150 load cell. In
        March 1965 when we finally made highly accurate position
        measurements with the capacitive position system, we learned
        that the pendulum vibrated in four degrees of freedom when the
        rocket thrust hit it. We had no way of accounting for all the
        energy that was leaving the system by means other than linear
        displacement. So the experiment was abandoned. </p>
      <p>However, the rocket pendulum did put us wise at last to the
        critical test for all One-Way machines, Space Drive,
        Anti-gravity Devices, and their like. When the word got out that
        Huyck Research Center would listen to inventors and look at
        their machines, the fun began. I think that I have seen every
        sort of shaking, spinning, whirling, vibrating, buzzing,
        snarling, grinding space drive that the fertile imagination of
        inventors can dream up. I have seen ones that would climb a
        slight gradient because of the stick-slip frictional phenomenon.
        I’ve seen them scoot across the floor. I have seen them do all
        sorts of wonderful things except when we put them to the
        critical pendulum test. </p>
      <p>For the benefit of any of you who may some day be confronted
        with a unidirectional drive, here is the Critical pendulum Test:
      </p>
      <p>Suspend the unit freely as a ballistic pendulum shown in the
        drawing. The longer the pendulum, the more sensitive it will be
        to any unidirectional force. When the drive is turned on, it
        must displace itself from the vertical rest position.
        Furthermore, it must not vibrate back and forth about the rest
        position. It must displace its center of mass from the vertical
        and stay there as long as it is turned on. </p>
      <p>Every space drive that we tested would not pass this test. The
        inventors were usually very embarrassed. ‘Gee, it just started
        to work there when it came apart. I guess we’re lucky that
        nobody was hurt when it blew up’. They all left, promising to
        fix the invention and return with it. Nobody ever did. </p>
      <p>There is one highly unfortunate aspect to this. Because of the
        total recalcitrance of Norman Dean, we were never able to
        subject the Dean Drive itself to the critical pendulum test at
        Huyck Research Center. </p>
      <p>It was once claimed that the Dean Drive did pass this test.
        John Campbell made a comment to a letter in bras Tacks in the
        November 1960 ASF as follows: ‘Suspended from a flexible wire,
        the model will push itself away from the vertical and hang at an
        angle’. But I never saw it do that. I am very positive that
        Campbell never saw it, either, and that he was merely reporting
        what Norman Dean told him. Otherwise, Campbell would have made
        some very pertinent remarks during the many pendulum tests we
        ran not only with the rocket pendulum, but also with several
        One-Way Machines. </p>
      <p>While I was involved in this frenzied, exciting, frustrating,
        enjoyable, disgusting, delightful and maddening experimental
        program, the CAT Pack wrote a scientific paper. Entitled ‘Some
        Aspects of Certain Transient Mechanical Systems’, Davis
        delivered it on April 23, 1962, at the Washington DC meeting of
        the American Physical Society. There were no comments. Why
        didn’t anybody hear this paper? Why wasn’t it published? I don’t
        know, but the APS and Physical Review turned it down for
        publication. I was given to understand that it was nearly
        impossible to get anything published that contradicted Einstein
        in the slightest degree, even in philosophical background. </p>
      <p>Then as now, there were few avenues for published speculation
        in science and technology. Analog happens to be one of the few
        places where a person can toss a new idea to the wolves to see
        what happens. We knew this, so Davis wrote ‘The Fourth aw of
        Motion’ that was published in the may 1962 issue of Analog.
        Strangely, the article didn’t draw the sort of comment that we
        had expected; perhaps it was because it contained a couple of
        partial differential equations. </p>
      <p>However, the 1962 publication efforts did finally bring us into
        contact with an independent investigator. </p>
      <p>On July 1, 1963, Hermann von Schelling at the Advanced
        Technology Laboratories of the General Electric Company in
        Schenectady, NY, published a paper entitled, ‘Stochastic
        Approach to the Laws of motion’. He arrived at the same
        conclusions as the CAT Pack, but he did it by the statistical or
        stochastic method rather than by the Davis deterministic method.
        Von Schelling even went further to postulate a quantum of time,
        a time interval during which even the smallest subnuclear
        particle could not respond to a change in its energy. By von
        Schelling’s method, this time quantum was calculated as 6.27 x
        10^-24 seconds. When calculated by Davis mechanics, the same
        number came out. Furthermore, this led to the conclusion that
        the smallest unit of length in the universe was the distance
        that light could travel in that smallest unit of time, and
        worked out to 1.88 x 10^13 centimeters. </p>
      <p>This number agrees with the estimate made in 1955-56 by Werner
        Heisenberg. </p>
      <p>In late 1962, the CAT pack was joined by a most formidable
        international scientist, Dr Henri Coanda, inventor of the first
        jet airplane (1910) and father of the field of fluidics (the
        Coanda Effect). Using Davis mechanics, Coanda developed a
        rationale for both Reynolds Number and Mach Number. </p>
      <p>In May 1963, Campbell published a letter from Norman Dean
        wherein the inventor explained in details his ‘phasing’
        hypothesis and gave explicit instructions on how to build and
        conduct an experiment so that his data could be confirmed by
        anyone who wished to try it. The Dean experimental device
        described in that Brass Tacks letter was identical to the Phaser
        mark I. So, just to be on the safe side, I dug out the Phaser
        Mark I and had out two best lab technicians read Dean’s letter,
        set up the Phaser, and re-run the previous Phaser Tests. Both C.
        Philip Morse and Maclane Tilton, our chief economic tech and
        chief mechanical tech respectively, conducted these tests
        without any supervision from Davis, Victory, or myself. I stood
        by in the background and just watched. Dean claimed they could
        see a 45-degree phase angle. They saw the 3-degree phase angle
        that I had seen. </p>
      <p>E.L. Victory and I reported this in a letter to Brass Tacks
        that appeared in the September 1963 issue along with a photo of
        our Phaser Mark I. Norman Dean must have considered this as a
        personal attack on him, because he fired back a vitriolic letter
        to Campbell that was published in the January 1964 Analog. Dean
        accused us of all sots of things, including violation of his
        patent rights. This immediately brought in the Huyck general
        counsel and patent attorneys. I really wanted to go see Dean and
        get it straightened out. But, acting on the advice of the Huyck
        attorneys, Davis instructed me not to do so. </p>
      <p>Since that time, I have carefully studied all of the Dean
        materials that have been published. What did Dean do to get his
        claimed 45-degree phase angle, and why couldn’t we get it, too?
        Was he using a heavy carriage with centering springs? Was his
        light quarter-inch drive shaft twisting? We had both used common
        universal joints, otherwise known as slipper joints, that are
        known to possess lobes of unequal torque and rate of angular
        rotation when deflected; did this have a significant effect? I
        wanted to build Phaser Mark III with constant-torque Rezeppa
        Joints, the sort they use in the front-wheel drive of Jeeps. Was
        my flywheel smoothing out something (Dean did not use a
        flywheel)? </p>
      <p>We really don’t know, but I strongly suspect that Dean’s
        light-duty drive train had something to do with it. </p>
      <p>We did a lot of theorizing about what a true space drive might
        be like and came to some interesting conclusions. First of all,
        if Davis mechanics has a shred of truth to it, the phase angle
        of Dean’s device should have been dependent upon the rotational
        speed or cyclic rate, but the drive efficiency should increase
        as well. This meant that really good efficiencies could not be
        obtained with any device operating down in mechanical cyclic
        rates. It meant that a drive should be operated at megacycle or
        gigacycle rates. </p>
      <p>We further came to the conclusion that the Dean Drive --- or
        any machine capable of producing a unidirectional force under
        the hypothesis of Davis mechanics --- would have to consist of a
        device that was one system during part of a cycle, and another
        system during the rest of the cycle. Or a device in which the
        initial system was deliberately destroyed during one part of the
        cycle and reassembled during the rest of the cycle. </p>
      <p>There is only one thing that will really do this at megacycle
        rates and above: electromagnetic devices, gadgets based on
        plasmas and electromagnetic fields. </p>
      <p>We thought about how to do this and how to build it. By April
        1965, we were just about ready to start putting some
        experimental hardware together. </p>
      <p>Then the nation’s economy stumbled a little bit. An economy
        wave rolled over Huyck Corporation. And in any corporate economy
        drive, two things get cut back right away: advertising and
        research. When we came in the door of the lab on Monday, April
        2, 1965, Bill Davis informed us that the research budget was no
        more, that the lab was closed, and all equipment was to be
        disposed of at once. All of us were given severance pay, letters
        of commendation, and the usual regrets. </p>
      <p>Thus ended the only serious research program that I know of
        that was devoted to an analysis of the Dean Drive and an attempt
        to construct a theoretical foundation for such devices. </p>
      <p>And it is a totally unsatisfactory ending because nothing ---
        nothing --- has been resolved. The work raised all sorts of
        questions. It brought together a lot of hitherto inexplicable
        facts and gave them some sort of rational foundation. It tied
        everything up in a neat bundle and just left it sitting there. </p>
      <p>Item: The human body responds to rate-of-onset of acceleration,
        a third derivative force. USAF specs are still based on this. </p>
      <p>Item: Stress is not proportional to strain. The classic law
        holds only under steady-state conditions in testing machines.
        Under conditions of high-rate loading, the stress-strain curves
        behave quite differently. Cables snap. Yokes break. The noses of
        armor-piercing shells hammer their way through armor while the
        back end of the same shells proceeds inexorably forward, not
        knowing that the front end is hammering away. </p>
      <p>Item: The mundane industrial operation of squeezing water out
        of paper and felt is totally dependent upon the rate of onset of
        the force in the press roll nip; the application of the
        principles of Davis mechanics to paper mechanics permits the
        system to be changed so that the machine can run faster. </p>
      <p>Item: Newton didn’t have the instruments to measure high-rate
        phenomena. Newtonian mechanics is steady-state mechanics. Even
        at that, any engineer will tell you all about the Finagle
        Factors… </p>
      <p>Item: Newtonian mechanics is true only if the energy of a
        system can be changed in either zero time (which is not a
        reasonable assumption) or in a time interval long enough for the
        entire system to react as a whole. Davis mechanics would merely
        elaborate upon Newtonian mechanics to include the starting
        transient, the high-rate case, the situation in which the system
        is so great that part of the system does something while the
        other is doing quite something else. </p>
      <p>Item: The harder they hit the atomic nucleus with particles in
        high-energy accelerators, the greater the rate of change of
        energy… and the greater the number of wild, wonderful, and
        unsuspected particles that are generated. It is really difficult
        to account for all of these new particles… except in Davis
        mechanics where they would be viewed as a consequence of
        rate-of-change: the energy that the particle system cannot
        absorb and must then leave the system. </p>
      <p>Item: With several very, very intelligent and respected
        scientists involved in the program, we never once ran up
        against&nbsp; a flaw in the logic, a trivial consequence, an
        irrational conclusion, or any result that did not appear to jibe
        with the real world. </p>
      <p>Item: Nobody has yet designed and conducted the elegant
        experiment to either prove or disprove the hypotheses of Davis
        mechanics. </p>
      <p>Item: Nobody has ever conducted a series of critical, objective
        tests on the Dean Drive. The Dean Drive has never been subjected
        to the pendulum test described herein except as reported by John
        Campbell and never verified. </p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, there is unfinished business here that
        gets worse every day. Norman Dean passed away in the late 1960s.
        John Campbell died on July 11, 1971. Dr Henri Coanda died in
        November 25, 1972. And Dr William O Davis died on may 10, 1974.
        Korff, Victory, and myself appear to be the only ones left who
        participated in this most exciting work. </p>
      <p>I saw the Dean Drive work, and I think I know how and why it
        worked. I don’t know if it would pass the pendulum test, but the
        test must be made before anyone has the right to sit back and be
        smug --- on either side of the fence. </p>
      <p>Until the basic hypotheses of Davis mechanics are either proven
        or disproven, the nagging specter of the space drive will haunt
        our scientific community. Will it or won’t it? Is a space drive
        possible or not? </p>
      <p>If it is impossible, what pushed against my hand? </p>
      <p>If it is impossible, what was the 3-degree phase angle that I
        saw with the phaser Mark I and mark II? </p>
      <p>I am not talking about Dianetics, Psionics, or ESP. This is
        physics and engineering and technology. It would take so little
        time and so little money to find out whether we have nothing…
        or… </p>
      <p>There is an unpublished series of papers written by Davis and
        the rest of the CAT Pack. They hypothesize a theory of inertia
        and gravitation that embrace both Newton and Einstein. Based on
        very preliminary calculations, the theory based on Davis
        mechanics indicates that the speed of gravitational propagation
        is at least 30,000 times the speed of light. </p>
      <p>The end of this article remains to be written. </p>
