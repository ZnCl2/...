        <p><b><font size="+1">System for Converting Rotary Motion into
              Unidirectional Motion</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>19 May 1959</b> <br>
          <b>( Cl. 74-112 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to driving systems for producing
        unidirectional motion and it has for its primary object to
        provide a propulsion system in which a rotational movement
        produced by a prime mover is converted into a continuous or
        intermittent unidirectional movement of a load carrier which may
        or note be the carrier of the rotational elements of the system.
      </p>
      <p>Devices using freely suspended rotating eccentric inertia
        masses are known which produce an oscillatory movement of the
        carrier of the rotating inertia masses. This oscillating
        movement is obtained by limiting the degrees of freedom of the
        freely suspended eccentric rotating inertia mass or masses to
        such an extent that movement can only occur in substantial
        parallelism to one plane. Such a limitation of the degrees of
        freedom of movement of the freely suspended rotary inertia mass
        or masses may be produced in several different ways. </p>
      <p>One of the methods of limiting the degrees of freedom of such a
        system consists in providing a pair or pairs of eccentric
        rotating inertia masses, rotating in opposite direction about
        parallel linear axes which are rigidly connected. This rigid
        connection between the shafts rotating the eccentric inertia
        masses, the axes of which form the axis of rotation of the
        masses, and the rotation of the said eccentric masses in
        opposite directions produce a cancellation of the forces and
        reactions engendered in all directions except in the direction
        parallel to a plane at right angles to the axes of rotation of
        the rotating masses. The result of this cancellation is an
        oscillation of the system at right angles to the axes of
        rotation produced by the resultant forces which represent the
        sum of the components of all the forces acting in this
        direction, engendered by the rotation of the masses. It will be
        clear that a freely suspended oscillating system of this type is
        not subjected to any other reaction or force. </p>
      <p>Devices of this type have been constructed for imparting
        oscillatory movement to some member or load device either for
        testing purposes or for the purpose of producing a regular
        vibration. </p>
      <p>My invention essentially consists in providing a system of the
        type above described in which an oscillatory movement of a
        freely suspended inertia mass or of a plurality of such masses
        is produced by the rotation of a mass or masses around an axis
        or axes and by limiting the degrees of freedom of movement of
        said freely suspended mass or masses, and in which the
        oscillatory movement of the system produces a continuous series
        of unidirectional impulses which may be transmitted to a
        suitable load device or which may act on the carrier of the
        system itself, without however reacting on or otherwise
        influencing the frequency or amplitude of the said oscillatory
        movement. </p>
      <p>The system is thus distinguished from a system of transmission
        of energy of motion to an exterior mechanism or system which
        produces a reaction between the said systems or mechanisms, by
        damping the oscillations. </p>
      <p>While preferably pairs of eccentric inertia masses rotating
        about parallel axes in opposite directions are used in such a
        system it will be clear that the oscillatory movement of the
        system may also be produced by other means, for instance by
        guides or guide channels limiting the movement of a freely
        suspended shaft which rotates an eccentric inertia mass at high
        speed. </p>
      <p>The principle of the invention may be best understood by
        referring to the oscillatory movement produced by a freely
        suspended eccentric inertia mass guided along a linear guide
        channel or by pairs of such freely suspended eccentric inertia
        masses of identical weight rotating about parallel linear axes
        in opposite directions. Any point of the system located in the
        plane of symmetry passing through the guide channel or located
        in a plane of symmetry passing between the axes of rotation of
        the freely suspended weights will oscillate within this plane in
        a direction which is parallel to the guide channel or which is
        at right angles to the plane passing through the parallel axes
        of rotation. This oscillation occurs around a central position.
        If a load is imposed during the oscillation of the system in the
        central position in such a manner that only movement in one
        direction will act on and move the load, for instance if the
        oscillation takes place in a vertical plane and if a weight is
        so placed that the oscillating system comes into contact with
        the said weight in the central position, it will be clear that
        the weight will be lifted during the upwardly directed stroke
        and that this lifting of the weight will shorten the normal
        elongation of the system. </p>
      <p>However, on account of the free suspension of the rotating
        masses&nbsp; and their shafts the amplitude of the oscillation
        during the back swing of the system is not affected or changed
        thereby as the centrifugal and other forces which cause the
        oscillation of the system remain unchanged. All points of the
        system thus will swing back first to a new central position and
        from there to a position corresponding to a full normal
        amplitude of the oscillation and the elongation with respect to
        the new central position of the back swing will be the same as
        it would have been if the weight had not been applied. The
        system thus reaches a new position at the end of the back swing
        in which its distance from the position of the weight
        (originally applied in the central position) is again equal to
        the full amplitude. </p>
      <p>The following vertical upswing therefore would only move the
        system to such an extent that it would just come into contact
        with the weight applied in its extreme position, but this
        upwardly directed swing would not move the weight which has been
        applied anymore. </p>
      <p>To produce a lifting of the weight it is therefore necessary to
        displace or shift the system by suitable means so as to bring it
        back into its original position. This movement must be performed
        by means of external forces acting on the system, but these
        external forces need not overcome a high resistance if the
        proper moment is chosen for this movement. When the shifting of
        the system is performed at the time when the resultant of the
        forces producing the oscillation is either zero or points in the
        direction in which the system is moved, only the inertia of the
        carrier and shafts has to be overcome which, if these members
        are sufficiently light in weight, is practically insignificant.
      </p>
      <p>By moving the system in this way by the external forces towards
        a load, the load may be lifted intermittently but continually.
        Instead of moving a load directly, a coupling may be applied to
        an element coupling the system at the proper moment to an
        exterior member while uncoupling the system during its back
        swing and during the shifting. In this way a series of
        unidirectional impulses may be transmitted to the said member. </p>
      <p>It will also be clear that the system may be moved along a
        fixed member. </p>
      <p>The principle of the invention thus consists in converting the
        energy of an oscillatory movement of a system, consisting either
        of a freely suspended, rotary eccentric, inertia mass guided
        along a linear guide, or of pairs of freely suspended rotary
        eccentric inertia masses rotating in opposite directions around
        parallel axes of rotation, into unidirectional impulses applied
        to a load, preferably by a cyclical coupling of the system with
        a load accompanied by cyclic coupling of the system with a load
        accompanied by cyclic shifting of the system. This principle is
        preferably applied by producing a coupling of the system with
        the load device during that phase of the oscillation during
        which the latter and the forces producing it have a direction
        which coincides with the desired direction of movement or of
        application of the impulses, and by producing the shifting of
        the system at the time at which the said forces are
        approximately zero so that a minimum resistance will be offered
        to such shifting. </p>
      <p>The main object of the invention therefore consists in
        providing a driving system including a freely suspended rotary
        inertia mass which by suitably limiting the degrees of freedom
        of its movement produces an oscillatory movement of the system
        of a definite frequency and amplitude, which driving system
        periodically transmits unidirectional impulses to a load device
        without producing a reaction on the frequency and amplitude of
        the oscillation of the system. </p>
      <p>A further main object of the invention consists in providing an
        oscillating system, the oscillation of which is maintained at a
        definite frequency and amplitude by means of pairs of freely
        suspended inertia masses, rotating at the same speed but in
        opposite direction about parallel axes with respect to which
        they are eccentrically mounted, said system supplying energy to
        a load system cyclically and unidirectionally during one phase
        of each oscillation, while said system is cyclically shifted by
        external forces after each impulse during a predetermined phase
        of the oscillation of the system. </p>
      <p>A further main object of the invention consists in providing an
        oscillating system, the oscillation of which is maintained at a
        definite frequency and amplitude by means of pairs of freely
        suspended inertia masses, rotating at the same speed but in
        opposite directions about parallel axes with respect to which
        they are eccentrically mounted, said system supplying energy to
        a load system cyclically and unidirectionally during one phase
        of each oscillation, while said system is cyclically shifted by
        external forces after each impulse during a predetermined phase
        of the oscillation during which the resistance of the system
        against displacement is at a minimum. </p>
      <p>The further objects of the invention will be more clearly
        understood when referring to the following specification. </p>
      <p>The invention is illustrated diagrammatically in the
        accompanying drawings by way of example. The diagrams illustrate
        only the principle of the invention and one mode of applying
        said principle. It is however to be understood that the purely
        diagrammatic showing does not offer a survey of possible
        constructions and a departure from the constructional features
        diagrammatically illustrated does not necessarily imply a
        departure from the principle of the invention. </p>

      <p>The principle on which the invention is based will be best
        understood by referring to Figures 1 to 4. A rotating mass or
        weight W with center of gravity C which is eccentric with
        respect to the axis of rotation A and which is rotated by a
        shaft a is freely suspended, for instance, between suspension
        springs f. A rotation of the weight W around a shaft a will
        produce a gyratory movement of the system, the axis of rotation
        A describing a circle. If this movement as shown in Figure 1 is
        restrained so that the shaft a may only move between the two
        fixed guides g the movement of the freely suspended shaft a
        becomes an oscillatory movement within the guide channel g in a
        plane which is parallel to the said guides. This oscillation
        takes place around the center 0 through which the axis of
        rotation A passes during the oscillation. </p>
      <p>As explained below in connection with Figure 4, the guides g my
        be replaced by an arrangement comprising two shafts a, b
        carrying two identical eccentrically mounted weights W, W1 and
        rotating in opposite directions around their respective axes of
        rotation A and A1. If these shafts a, b are held for rotation
        within members rigidly connecting them, these member will take
        up the forces and reactions engendered between them and as, on
        account of the opposite direction of rotation of the eccentric
        weights, these forces and reactions are opposed to each other
        and neutralize each other, this will produce exactly the same
        effect as that produced by the guides g and only forces or
        reactions at right angles to the plane passing through the axis
        of rotation can manifest themselves. </p>
      <p>Oscillating arrangements of this type are known and have been
        used for producing an oscillatory movement in one plane. The
        special problem dealt with by my invention, however, consists in
        transforming this arrangement into a source of unidirectional
        power, producing unidirectional impulses which may be
        transmitted to any lifting or propelling device and which thus
        may be used for the lifting or propelling of a load or the
        lifting or propelling of a load or the lifting or propelling
        device and which thus may be used for the lifting or propelling
        of the lifting of a load or the lifting or propelling of the
        unit on which the system is mounted. </p>
      <p>Referring now to the diagrams Figures 2 and 3 in which a pair
        of rotating weights is again replaced by a single rotating mass
        W guided between fixed straight guides g and in which the free
        suspension of the shaft a is again indicated by means of springs
        f, it will be seen that, upon rotation of the eccentric mass W
        the shafts a, if freely suspended, will oscillate between the
        positions 1 and 2. During these oscillations the weight W and
        the arms r will occupy the positions indicated at I, II, III and
        IV. If now a load L is imposed on the shaft a whenever it
        reaches the central position 0 of the oscillation the load will
        be moved during that phase of the oscillation during which the
        sum of the resultants of the driving couples and centrifugal
        forces and of their reactions have components in the desired
        direction which is hereinafter termed the positive direction. It
        will be clear that this occurs during the positive portion of
        the cycle. </p>
      <p>In the diagram Figure 3 it is now assumed that the load L is
        not moved but that merely pressure is exercised by the shaft a
        on the load during the positive portion of the cycle. A
        continuous series of impulses can, however, not be maintained
        with this arrangement when left to itself. While, as long as the
        weight W remains on the positive portion of the cycle (between
        positions Ia and IIIa) in which the resultant of the forces is
        directed toward said load L, an impulse can be produced which is
        upwardly directed in the diagram, the negative phase of the
        cycle (positions IIIa, IV, I) which now starts from point ) will
        produce a back swing covering the full amplitude so that the
        shaft a at the point of maximum elongation will be in position
        3. The center 0 the oscillation is thus shifted to the position
        2 and the next positive cycle, starting at position 3 would
        bring the shaft a just back to the load L but would not produce
        any further impulse on the load L. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as indicated in the diagram Figure 3, a system for
        producing continually impulses in one direction on the load L
        must include means for shifting the system, and especially the
        shaft a, towards the load. This additional shifting is
        preferably performed when the rotating weight W has reached
        position I which is a zero position in which the resultant of
        all forces and reactions is approximately zero. Shifting may
        also occur in a position in the vicinity of position I in which
        the resultant of the forces and the reactions start to point in
        the positive direction which is also the direction of the shift.
      </p>
      <p>The resistance of the system against shifting will then be
        small and will not include the inertia of W but solely the mass
        of the shaft and frame which parts should be made as light as
        possible, a requirement which is also to be considered as being
        of advantage from many other viewpoints. The shaft and frame
        being as light as possible relatively to the weight W will also
        reduce the reaction of the system formed by the weight W the arm
        r, and the shaft a, developing in the center of rotation A. </p>
      <p>The shifting of the shaft a will bring the system back into the
        original position relatively ro the load L and therefore the
        second cycle now starting after the shift will again produce an
        impulse on the load L in the selected direction. </p>
      <p>The shifting movement may be produced by means of a solenoid or
        by a set of solenoids indicated at 40 in Figure 5 which
        solenoids will be energized at a predetermined p[oint (position
        I in Figure 3) which movement produced by the solenoid brings
        the system into the position Ia with shaft a in the point 0. </p>
      <p>It has been assumed, for the purpose of explanation, that a
        series of impulses has to be applied to a stationary load.
        However, in the majority of practical applications a continuous
        though intermittent advance of the load in a given direction has
        to be produced by the impulses delivered by the system.
        Therefore, the system, after shifting, is coupled with the load
        and has to be released or uncoupled when the impulses have been
        delivered for a free back swing. A gravitational load held
        against back movement may be advanced without such a coupling if
        the system acts in a vertical direction as indicated in Figures
        1 to 3. However, in most cases a coupling of the system,
        delivering the impulses to the load device, will be necessary
        which coupling may be produced either by a mechanical coupling
        or clutch, for instance a clutch with eccentric jaws and
        gripping automatically a member such as a tape, cord or cable
        attached to the load whenever the system is moved in one
        direction, while releasing this grip when the system is moved in
        the opposite direction, or by means of a magnetic clutch
        operating by means of electromagnets. The electromagnets may
        operate the jaws of a clutch or may directly cooperate with the
        steel tape. </p>
      <p>The electromagnets of the clutch are energized during that
        portion of the cycle during which the load is imposed on the
        system and the impulses are delivered to it. When this phase has
        passed the electromagnets are de-energized thus uncoupling the
        impulse delivering system from the load device. Obviously the
        load supporting means or steel tape must be held by a mechanical
        or magnetic locking device during the period during which the
        impulse delivering system is uncoupled. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the shifting of the impulse delivering
        system and the coupling of said system with the load device
        directly succeed each other, they both occur in succession at
        the start of the positive phase of the cycle. </p>
      <p>Further, it maybe noted that while the impulse delivering
        system and the coupling of said system with the load device
        directly succeed each other, they both occur in succession at
        the start of the positive phase of the cycle. </p>
      <p>Further, it may be noted that while the impulse delivering
        system does not have a fixed position in space with respect to a
        reference system, the movement shifting the system may be
        utilized to bring it always back to the fixed position with
        respect to a predetermined reference system R-R as indicated
        diagrammatically in Figure 9. </p>
      <p>Referring now to the diagram shown in Figure 5 in order to
        explain the basic construction and operation of the device
        according to the invention it will be seen that two rotatable
        shafts 10, 12 are journaled within a freely suspended movable
        framework 15. On each shaft a weight 14, 16 is secured
        eccentrically and is rotated by the shaft at high speed. Each
        shaft may carry a gear wheel 18, 19. the two gear wheels may
        mesh and one of the shafts 12 may be provided with an extension
        20 which by means of a universal joint 21 connecting it with an
        intermediate shaft 22 may be driven by means of a drive motor.
        The two eccentric weights 14 and 16 rotate at the same speed in
        opposite directions. The intermediate shaft 22 may be joined to
        the shaft of the drive motor by means of a second universal
        joint shown in Figure 8 to provide free movement and
        adjustability and the said intermediate shaft in addition may
        consist of two splined portions which two shaft portions may
        therefore move relatively to each other in a longitudinal
        direction. </p>
      <p>The frame 15 consists of two side plates 17 which may be joined
        by a transverse bridge member 23 carrying the magnetic clutch 25
        which, in the example illustrated, acts on a steel tape 30
        passing centrally through the said bridge piece, slots 27 being
        provided wit rollers, wheels or balls 33 running on tracks fixed
        in the outer frame 31 to permit an oscillatory movement of the
        inner frame wit the smallest possible friction. </p>
      <p>To produce the shifting movement of the frame 15 which has been
        explained above two solenoids 40 are arranged which are mounted
        on the outer frame 31, the retractable cores of which may be
        provided with extensions forming lifting rods 42 attached to the
        transverse or bridge piece 23 of the movable framework 15. When
        the solenoids are energized, the frame 15 after having made its
        back swing is thus lifted and is brought into the desired
        position relatively to the outer frame and the load. </p>
      <p>As above explained the energization of the solenoids 40 as well
        as the energization of the clutch electromagnets 25 must be
        exactly times in order to produce a smooth functioning of the
        device. The clutch electromagnet 25 must be energized during
        that phase of the cycle during which the resultant of the
        centrifugal forces and reactions produce suitably directed or
        positive resultants, for instance an upwardly directed resultant
        in Figure 5, while the solenoids 40 must be operated during the
        start of the positive phase of movement following the greatest
        negative elongation. </p>
      <p>To produce this precisely timed operation suitable control
        means are provided for controlling the energization of the
        electromagnetic devices. These means are illustrated especially
        in the diagrams in Figure 6 and 7. </p>
      <p>In the example shown in Figure 5 each of these means consists
        of a rotating commutator or contact device cooperating with
        suitable brushes or contact springs and in sliding contact
        devices such as illustrated in Figure 6 by way of example. </p>
      <p>Rotating commutators 45, 46 associated with the shafts 10 and
        12 are provided in order to produce an operation which is in
        exact conformity with the position of the weights 14, 16 and
        with the forces generated thereby. </p>
      <p>The slide contacts, on the other hand, are provided in order to
        produce energization of the said magnets only in predetermined
        spatial positions of the movable framework 15 relatively to a
        point or plane of reference which may be fixed on the frame and
        also to produce the successive timing of the energization. </p>
      <p>As seen in Figure 3 the solenoid must be energized in a
        position of the shaft a in which the back swing of the
        oscillation has been performed and in which the system starts
        again to move in the direction towards the load. This phase of
        the movement is reached when the weights W on the shaft a reach
        the position marked I in Figure 3. </p>
      <p>The clutch magnets 25, however, are operated when, after
        shifting of the position of the framework by means of the
        solenoid 40 the weights start to move in the positive cycle. The
        clutch magnets therefore remain energized as long as the weights
        move through this portion of the cycle. </p>
      <p>In Figure 6, illustrating the control and contact device
        diagrammatically, the commutators which usually consist of a
        drum with conducting and non-conducting surfaces cooperating
        with a brush, are shown for the sake of better illustration in
        the shape of cams pressing contact springs, which springs
        control the circuits of the solenoids and of the clutch
        electromagnets. The commutators, as will be clear, make and
        break the circuit in exact conformity with the position of the
        weights 15, 16, the contact springs 44 being closed by cam 49
        the moment in which the weights 14, 16 reach approximately the
        zero position (position indicated by dots and dashes at z-z in
        Figures 1 and 2) and the commutator segments or cam surfaces are
        arranged correspondingly. </p>
      <p>A commutator 48, 47 controlling the solenoids is likewise
        operated in a definite position of the weights 14, 16 close to
        position I in Figure 2 and the cams 47 and contact springs 48
        are arranged accordingly. </p>
      <p>The commutator devices are preferably finely adjustable as they
        determine the starting point of the cycle and also the duration
        of the impulses. Energization and de-energization of the
        solenoids, in addition to being timed relatively to the cyclical
        position of the weights must also occur in a certain
        well-defined position of the frame 15 relatively to a reference
        system. This is of special importance as a part of a movement of
        the framework 15 is an oscillation which is only opposed by
        springs. As small differences of elongation and a high number of
        revolutions may lead to quite substantial deviations if not
        corrected, a reference contact device, formed by a slide
        contact, controlling the position of the frame, is arranged
        correcting the deviations and bringing the framework always
        precisely into a fixed spatial position relatively to the fixed
        frame and its reference system. </p>
      <p>For this purpose the framework is provided with a slide contact
        50 cooperating with a fixed contact 51 arranged on or near the
        fixed frame. The energizing circuit of the solenoids includes
        these contacts so that energizing and de-energizing will only
        occur if the correct succession of the energization of this
        magnet and of the solenoids in a definite position of the
        framework. This slide contact device is indicated at 56 and 57
        in Figure 6. </p>
      <p>Figure 7 shows the circuit connection of the device illustrated
        in Figure 6. As seen in this figure the circuit of the solenoids
        includes the source of current indicated at 52 and an adjustable
        resistance 53, as well as the contact springs 44 controlled by
        cam 49 on shaft 10, the slide contact 50 carried by the frame 15
        and the fixed slide contact 51. </p>
      <p>The circuit of the coupling magnet 25 includes the same source
        of current 52, the adjustable resistance 54, the contact springs
        48 controlled by the cam 47 on shaft 12, the slide contact 56 on
        the frame and the fixed side contact 57. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the position of the weights by means of
        the cams control the two circuits. In addition the slide
        contacts 56, 57 and 50, 51 permit energization of the solenoid
        40 and coupling magnets only in sequence, as slide contact 50
        leaves slide contact 51. Moreover energization of the solenoid
        does not occur of during the oscillation of the frame, the
        contact 50 should overrun contact 51, but occurs only when both
        weight position and position of the frame relatively ro the
        fixed frame permits shifting to the desired point. </p>
      <p>Likewise, the energization of the coupling magnet 25 can occur
        only after the shifting, this sequence being enforce by the
        position of the contact device indicated at 50, 51 relatively to
        the contact device indicated at 56 and 57 in figure 6. </p>
      <p>A deice constructed in accordance with the invention is shown
        in a very simplified form in Figures 8 to 10. This device
        advances a steel tape 100 continuously in one direction. The
        load (not shown) is attached to said steel tape. </p>
      <p>The device as illustrated in Figures 8 to 10 comprises an
        exterior fixed frame 60 provided with tracks 61 extending
        longitudinally along the frame. A carriage 62 reciprocates on
        the tracks. The movable carriage which is the equivalent of the
        frame 15 in Figures 1 to 6 may consist of sided plates 66 joined
        by transverse plates 67 and it may be provided with balls or
        rollers 63 running on the track 61. The arrangement shown in
        Figures 8-10 produces a movement of the carriage in a horizontal
        direction, but it will be clear that the position of the frame
        and carriage in space is, in fact, immaterial. </p>
      <p>The carriage 62 is provided with shafts 70 and 71, each shaft
        carrying a weight 74,75, respectively, which is eccentrically
        mounted thereon, the center of gravity of the weights being at a
        distance from the axis of the shaft. </p>
      <p>It may be noted in this connection that the weights 74, 75
        should embody as high a percentage of the total weight of the
        carriage as is constructively possible and conversely the
        carriage and the shafts should be as light as possible. This may
        be obtained by making the carriage of a light material such as
        light metal or a plastic or a light alloy, while making the
        weights of steel or of heavy metal alloys. </p>
      <p>The shafts may be driven by any motor, for instance, by an
        electric motor which may be mounted on the carriage itself.
        However, in order to reduce the weight of the carriage the
        construction illustrated shows a motor which is mounted on the
        fixed frame and which transmits power to the shafts 70 and 71 by
        means of an intermediate shaft 78 joined to an extension 76 of
        one of the shafts 70 by means of a universal joint. </p>
      <p>If the carriage moves in a transverse direction it is
        preferable to insert an intermediate shaft 78 between the motor
        and the shaft extension which either consists of two telescopic
        members or which consists of two parts one of which is splined
        on the other so as to permit longitudinal motion to a limited
        extent. The motor shaft is thus enabled to drive the shaft
        extension 76 notwithstanding its transverse linear motion. </p>
      <p>A torsion coupling 80 is preferably inserted between the
        intermediate shaft and the shaft extension or if the extension
        is split as illustrated in Figure 8 the torsion coupling is
        inserted between the two parts 76, 76a of the extension. This
        torsion coupling is indicated in the figures as a torsion spring
        80 connecting the two separate parts of the shaft extension 76
        and 76a. The torsion coupling permits a relative angular
        movement between the drive portion of the shaft 76a and the
        driven portion 76. Such angular motion occurs on account of
        speed variations in the rotational speed of the weights which
        are driven by a motor of constant speed; such variations further
        occur during the shifting of the carriage at the end of an
        outwardly directed oscillation which has been described above.
        The shifting movement essentially moves the shafts without
        moving the weights thus producing a retrograde movement of the
        shafts. Further the shifting movement is not instantaneous and
        especially in the event of a high rotational speed of the
        weights the latter will perform an angular movement around the
        shaft of a sizable magnitude during the shifting operation. This
        angular movement is dependent on the speed of rotation and on
        the impedance of the solenoid which usually cannot be decreased
        below a certain value. A shifting of the carriage by the
        solenoids thus amounts to a retardation of the rotational speed
        which is equivalent to a rotation of the shaft 70 or 71 in a
        direction opposite to the direction of rotation which movement
        must be taken up by the torsional coupling 80. </p>
      <p>The weights 74, 75 must be strictly equal and must rotate at
        the same speed in an opposite direction. It is preferable to
        drive the shaft 71 by means of a gear wheel transmission from
        the shaft 70. These gear wheels are illustrated at 81 and 82,
        the two gear wheels 81, 82 meshing with each other. </p>
      <p>The carriage 62 is freely suspended between springs 84, 85
        which are attached to the frame and which are so dimensioned
        that they tend to bring the carriage 62 back into a central
        position whenever it has been moved to one side. The spring
        tension must be finely adjustable, as they must assist in
        stabilizing the operation and in maintaining the frame
        oscillation in the desired spot and in securing the correct
        sequence of operational phases. They are provided with special
        but well-known tension adjustment devices indicated at 89 in the
        figures. In fact, the carriage is always brought back to the
        fixed reference position R-R (Figure 9) not only by means of the
        solenoids 86 and 88 but also under active assistance of the
        springs. </p>
      <p>The solenoids 86 and 88 are shown in the example illustrated as
        being mounted on a side plate 92 of the fixed frame but it will
        be understood that this is not essential. Each of the solenoids
        is provided with a movable core 91, 93 attached to a rod 94, 95
        which is joined to a transverse plate 67 to which also the
        springs 85 may be attached. </p>
      <p>In the modification illustrated in Figures 8 to 10 an
        electromagnetic clutch device is used. The electromagnetic
        clutching device consists of the clutch electromagnets 101 which
        are mounted on an extension 105 of the side plate 67 which
        magnets, in the example illustrated, drip the tape 100 carrying
        the load. The clutch electromagnets 101 preferably cooperate
        with an armature 103 which may face the two electromagnets and
        may close the magnetic field circuit upon energization of the
        said electromagnets, the tape being firmly gripped between said
        armature and the magnet poles and being thus moved with the
        carriage during such energization. Upon de-energization of the
        clutch electromagnets the tape is released and the carriage may
        start on its return movement without in any way affecting the
        tape. </p>
      <p>In Figure 12 an electromagnetically operated mechanical clutch
        is illustrated. The tape or belt 150 is gripped by jaws 121,
        133, each of which is linked to parallel pivoted levers 124,
        126. the two jaws 121, 122 may be coupled by a transverse link
        136. The jaws which are only displaced for a very small distance
        in order to lose their grip on the tape are operated by a
        solenoid 125 the core of which carries a rod 127 which is linked
        to one of the levers 124. </p>
      <p>The mechanical coupling is preferably used to move heavier
        loads. </p>
      <p>To obtain an accurate timing of the operation of the clutch
        electromagnets dependent on the completion of the movement of
        the carriage under the influence of the solenoids bringing the
        carriage into its correct position relatively to a reference
        system the energization of the clutch electromagnets is made
        dependent not only on the position of the weights but also on
        the completion of the shifting movement produced by the
        solenoids. This is obtained by controlling the energizing
        circuit of the electromagnets by a commutator device and by the
        slide contacts. </p>
      <p>The commutator device in this case is replaced by a cam acting
        on the contact springs 114 and 115. The cam is mounted on one of
        the two shafts 71 and the cam surface is so adjusted that the
        closing of the clutch electromagnet circuits starts
        approximately in the zero position of the weights. To prevent,
        however, an operation of the clutch electromagnets before the
        solenoid has shifted the carriage 62 into the correct position
        corresponding to the position of reference R-R, the circuit
        contains also the contact spring 116 which comes into contact
        with the spring 120 only after the solenoid circuits have been
        closed for such a time that the solenoids have been capable of
        moving the carriage into the position in which the axis of the
        shaft 70, 71 have reached the correct reference position R-R. </p>
      <p>This position R-R is the reference position to which the
        carriage has been moved by the solenoids and in this position
        only the slide spring 116 reaches the spring 120, thus closing
        the circuit of the clutch electromagnets. These clutch
        electromagnets thus move the tape only during that phase of the
        cycle during which the carriage is supposed to move the load.
        These electromagnets are de-energized when the cam 118 does no
        longer press on the contact spring 114, 115 such de-energization
        occurring when the carriage starts its back swing. During this
        back swing the tape to which the load is attached and which may
        be of any type or kind, must be prevented from sliding back when
        the grip of the clutch electromagnet is released. Any device
        gripping or holding the tape when attempting to move in an
        undesired direction, such as a sprocket wheel with a ratchet
        device attached to it may be used in connection with the tape.
        In Figure 8, a simple clamping device 122 cooperating with a
        fixed jaw 123 has been shown the movable jaw of the clamping
        device being mounted eccentrically and being under spring
        tension. </p>
      <p>The control of the solenoid circuit is conformity with the
        position of the weights and with the position of the carriage
        relatively to the reference position R-R is exercised by means
        of the cam 110 operating the contact springs 111 and 112 and by
        means of the slide contacts 125 sliding on the fixed contact
        126. the cams, contact springs and slide contacts are similar to
        those already described in connection with the clutch
        electromagnets. </p>
      <p>The operation of the device will be clear from the following
        description. </p>
      <p>The weights 74, 75 rotate rapidly with as high a speed as
        possible. The forces and reactions due to this movement of the
        weights in the direction of the line joining the axis of the
        shafts 71 and 70 are completely neutralized and only those
        forces which are at right angles thereto act on the system.
        Therefore, an oscillation of the carriage 62 in this direction
        will start, with the carriage moving back and forth on the
        tracks around a middle position R-R. </p>
      <p>If it is assumed that during such oscillation the carriage 62
        has reached its extreme position at the left in Figure 9 and
        weights 74 and 75 now reached approximately the zero position
        Z-Z (Figure 2) the cam 110 will close the contact springs 111
        and 112, and, as their return journey in the direction of the
        arrows starts, the springs 125 and 126 also come into contact.
        Both control contacts of the energizing circuit of the solenoids
        being closed said solenoids are energized and pull the carriage
        forward in the direction of the arrow until the line joining the
        shafts 70 and 71 has reached the desired reference position R-R.
        In this position the device is now ready for applying a load.
        Cam 118 has already closed springs 114 and 115, as soon as the
        zero position of the weights 74, 75 was reached. In the position
        into which the carriage has now been brought the springs 116
        also engage the spring 120 thus closing the circuit of the
        clutch electromagnets. The clutch electromagnets grip the tape
        and during the further carriage advance the tape is moved with
        the carriage. </p>
      <p>When the resultant of the forces engendered by the rotational
        movement of the weights decreases to such an extent that the
        load can be longer be moved, the clutch electromagnets are
        de-energized by the cam moved by the weights. As soon as the
        carriage has reached its end position toward the right in Figure
        9 it starts to move back, but the load cannot move back because
        the tape 100 is gripped by the clamping device 122, 123 and the
        carriage is therefore free to start its back swing. When the
        back swing of the carriage has been performed the weights have
        again moved into the zero position and the above described cycle
        will repeat itself and the tape will thus be advanced
        intermittently. </p>
      <p>Obviously, the system may also be advanced along a fixed tape
        if so desired. </p>
      <p>If a substantially continuous advance of the load in one
        direction is desired a plurality of devices such as described
        may cooperate. Figure 11 shows such an arrangement in which six
        devices of the same type cooperate with a single tape. By
        adjusting the phase differences between the devices and by
        distributing the gripping phases evenly by means of the
        commutators it is possible to move the tape in the desired
        direction continuously. These various phases may also overlap so
        that a practically continuous pull of the tape results. The
        devices may thus produce a practically continuous lift. </p>
      <p>It will be clear that the system according to the invention may
        be used in many different ways and presents inherent advantages
        due to the fact that it is independent of reactions produced by
        external systems. The system, therefore, will be especially of
        advantage where such reactions have to be avoided. </p>
      <p>Further, it will be clear that the embodiment of the invention
        which has been described may be changed in many ways, some of
        them have been indicated and such changes do not affect the
        essence of the invention as described in the annexed claims. </p>
      <p>What is claimed as new is as follows: [ Claims not included
        here ] </p>
