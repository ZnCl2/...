      <p>[ <i>Author Biography</i>: --- Dr. William O. Davis is
        Director of Research of the Huyck Corporation of New York
        City.&nbsp; He was born in Buffalo, New York on November 11,
        1919.&nbsp; He received his A.B. degree from New York University
        in 1939, with study at Cambridge University, England, on a
        Carnegie Scholarship from 1937 to 1938. He received his Ph.D. in
        physics from New York University in 1950. </p>
      <p>In 1940 Dr. Davis joined what was then the Army Air Corps as a
        flying Cadet. At the close of World War II he was commanding the
        824th Bombardment Squadron (B-24s) of the Fifteenth Air Force. </p>
      <p>After completion of his graduate training in 1950 he became a
        member of the staff of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory as
        an Air Force Officer, where he worked on nuclear weapons
        development.&nbsp; From 1953 to 1957 he was Chief of Scientific
        Research, Headquarters, Air Research and Development Command and
        from 1955 to 1957 Deputy Commander of the Air Force Office of
        Scientific Research.&nbsp; It while in this post that Col. Davis
        initiated the Project Farside program discussed in the article
        "Pie in the Sky" in the August, 1961 ANALOG, the first U.S.
        Spaceprobe program to get instruments out into the van Allen
        radiation belt.&nbsp; And the one U.S. Space program to get
        there ahead of the Russians. </p>
      <p>His last assignment in the Air Force, from 1957 to 1958, as
        Assistant to the Director of Laboratories, Wright Air
        Development Center.&nbsp; He resigned as Colonel from the Air
        Force in 1958. </p>
      <p>In 1958-59 he was Vice President for Research, Executive Vice
        President and President, in succession, of the Turbo Dynamics
        Corporation.&nbsp; His research activities have covered the
        fields of cosmic ray neutrons, special weapons development, and
        the management of government and industrial research programs. ]

      <p>Fundamentally, science must be a series of successive
        approximations to reality. It simply is not possible to arrive
        at absolute truth with a finite number of investigations.
        Physics at the Freshman level is a very straightforward subject.
        Facts are well known, relationships are stated in forthright
        terms without equivocation, and there is little room for doubt.
        It takes three years or more of graduate school before it
        finally dawns on a budding scientist that the whole structure of
        science, so monumental when viewed from a distance, is a cracked
        and sagging edifice held together with masking tape and resting
        on the shifting sands of constantly changing theory. Nothing is
        known with any real certainty.&nbsp; Some things are merely more
        probable than others. Well-known theories and even laws turn out
        to be only partially confirmed hypotheses, waiting to be
        replaced with somewhat better partially confirmed
        hypotheses.&nbsp; If there is one thing we know about every
        theory in modern physics, it is that it is wrong, or at least
        incomplete. Sooner or later somebody will come along with a more
        general theory of which the old theory is seen to be a special
        case. </p>
      <p>This is not a criticism of science, but merely a description of
        the scientific method.&nbsp; Like democratic processes in
        general--for science is necessarily a democratic process -- this
        method may seem a bit sloppy, and even bog down from time to
        time with authoritarian red tape, but it's the only method we
        know at the moment, and its results have been spectacular. </p>
      <p>Progress tends to take place by a more or less random series of
        spurts in different fields at different times.&nbsp; The Laws in
        a given field of science will appear adequate for many years and
        little attention will be paid.&nbsp; The glamour is all in
        another field.&nbsp; Then little anomalies start showing up in
        engineering or scientific applications of the Laws which are
        accounted for by engineers through "Finagle Factors" and
        explained by scientists as "second-order effects."&nbsp;
        Usually, it takes a really major anomaly to generate the
        necessary speculation to derive a new and improved theory. </p>
      <p>The field of Mechanics is a case in point.&nbsp; Euler,
        Lagrange, Hamilton, and Newton did such a beautiful job of
        synthesizing a workable theory that no further attention was
        paid to Mechanics for many years.&nbsp; Certain anomalies in
        astronomical data led Einstein to the Theory of Relativity, and
        the study of atomic physics led to the development of Quantum
        Theory, but the mechanics of simple everyday systems is still
        founded squarely on the cornerstone of the three Laws of Motion
        of Newton. </p>
      <p>These Laws are usually stated in the elementary textbooks as: </p>
      <p>First Law:&nbsp; Every body tends to remain at rest or in
        uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by an
        outside force. </p>
      <p>Second Law:&nbsp; An unbalanced force acting on a body causes
        the body to accelerate in the direction of the force, and the
        acceleration is directly proportional to the unbalanced force
        and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. </p>
      <p>Third Law:&nbsp; For every action, there is an equal and
        opposite reaction. </p>
      <p>By and large, the Laws of Motion have stood the test of time
        remarkably well.&nbsp; In spite of the newer concepts of
        Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, the basic meaning of the Laws
        has merely been interpreted, not challenged.&nbsp; Even then,
        interpretation has only been required in the case of very small
        or very large systems and in everyday life Newton still reigns
        supreme, much the distress of a host of would-be inventors. </p>
      <p>There have been anomalies from time to time, of course, but it
        has normally been possible to attribute these to lack of
        sufficient information or understanding. </p>
      <p>For a number of years, the author has been intrigued with a
        group of anomalies having to do essentially with rate of strain
        in materials and mechanical systems.&nbsp; It is well known, for
        example, that the strength of many materials is a function of
        the rate of strain.&nbsp; Some materials such as silicone putty,
        display this characteristic to a marked extent.&nbsp; The field
        of terminal ballistics is replete with odd rate of strain
        effects such as the tendency of long projectiles to penetrate
        targets by means of a series of hammer blows. There are many
        other examples which come to mind from almost every field of
        science and engineering.&nbsp; Generally speaking, it is very
        difficult to explain such effects in terms of Newtonian physics,
        although it has been done. </p>
      <p>Several years ago, the importance of rate-of-onset effects in
        general was highlighted for the author by studies of the
        dynamics of the high speed pressing of paper and textiles in the
        laboratories of Huyck Corporation based on a theoretical study
        by E.L. Victory. The need to solve certain problems relating to
        very high speed paper machines led to the creation of a small
        research program involving both theory and experiment. </p>
      <p>Interest in this field was further heightened by the
        discussions of the Dean Drive started by John W. Campbell in
        these pages in 1960. Our earlier investigations led the author
        to the hypotheses that the Drive, if it worked, might be
        explained in some way by rate-of-onset effects. </p>
      <p>This article is a preliminary report on findings of general
        interest which have resulted from this research program. It is
        not primarily designed to explain ‘reactionless’ drives, but
        certain conclusions will certainly have a bearing on the
        evaluation of those devices. Because this is a preliminary
        report, there will be no attempt to offer proof of assertions as
        such, although it is believed that existing data will tend to
        confirm theoretical predictions in the areas that have been
        investigated after the analysis has been completed. </p>
      <p>A speculative theory will be proposed which has been logically
        and mathematically explored to some extent and checked against
        known data in various areas of science and engineering. No claim
        is made that this theory has been ‘proven’ any more than any
        theory is ‘proven’. We do believe that this approach will shed
        some light on certain problems. </p>
      <p>Let us take a moment to review the meaning of the terms
        describing a body in motion. First of all, a body has a
        position, described in terms of its distance and direction from
        some arbitrary point or origin. To this distance we assign the
        letter, s. If the body is in motion it will move a very small
        distance, ds, in a very short time, dt, so that its
        instantaneous velocity will be given by v = ds /dt . </p>
      <p>Note that the body might move in such a way that its distance
        from the origin remained constant and only the angle or
        direction changed; it might move directly away from the origin
        in a straight line so that only its distance changed; or it
        might move in some intermediate way so that both its distance
        and direction change at the same time. Thus, in general v must
        represent a rate of change of position in any of these ways. It
        represents not only a speed, but a speed in a certain direction,
        and therefore, like the displacement, it is called a ‘vector’. </p>
      <p>If now, we make a small change in the velocity, dv, in a small
        period of time, dt, the body will have an instantaneous
        acceleration vector given by: </p>
      <p>a = dv/dt&nbsp; (1) </p>
      <p>But, v = ds/dt, so that we can also say a = d(ds)/dt(dt), which
        is normally written: </p>
      <p>a = d²s/dt²&nbsp; (2) </p>
      <p>An expression like ds/dt or dv/dt is called a "derivative," and
        therefore v is called the "first derivative" of the displacement
        with respect to time. Since the derivative must be taken twice
        to get it, we say that a is the "second derivative" of the
        displacement.&nbsp; Thus, Newton's Second Law could be written
        (and frequently is), </p>
      <p>F = Md²s/dt²&nbsp; (3) </p>
      <p>Let us now go one step further and assume that the acceleration
        is not constant.&nbsp; In other words, if we make a small change
        in acceleration, da, in a <br>
        short time, dt, the body will have an instantaneous "surge"
        given by: </p>
      <p>å = da/dt = d²v/dt² = d^3s/dt^3&nbsp; (4) </p>
      <p>Surge is thus the "third derivative" of displacement.&nbsp;
        This quantity has previously been referred to as "rate of
        onset," "jerk," "kick," and a number of other terms.&nbsp; We
        use "surge" because it seems more appropriate to describe an
        action that may be repetitive or even continuous in some
        systems.&nbsp; We use the symbol å because it is conventionally
        used an an abbreviation for da/dt. </p>
      <p>It is possible to continue indefinitely to define fourth,
        fifth, and higher derivatives of displacement with respect to
        time.&nbsp; In some cases, such as very high speed impact, this
        may prove later to be worthwhile.&nbsp; In most cases, higher
        derivatives will probably shed little light on the problem and
        in the case of cyclic or oscillating motion, it can be shown
        that a dynamic system can be completely described with not more
        than three derivatives.&nbsp; Higher orders may be present, but
        can always be expressed in terms of combinations of the first
        three. </p>
      <p>The class of anomalous behavior which we wish to study involves
        in every case the presence of surge as we have just defined
        it.&nbsp; Under conditions of constant or zero acceleration
        mechanical bodies or systems of bodies obey Newton's Laws
        reasonably well.&nbsp; It is under conditions of changing
        acceleration that difficulties arise. </p>
      <p>The key word in our analysis of dynamic systems will be
        "simultaneity." The Laws of Motion presuppose exact simultaneity
        of action and reaction.&nbsp; In other words, if the force
        exerted by Mass #1 on Mass #2 is suddenly changed, the force
        exerted by Mass #2 on Mass #1 must change in the same instant to
        satisfy Newton's image of the universe.&nbsp; Einstein
        recognized that this condition would not be met in the case of
        bodies separated by astronomical distances since the change in
        gravitational field would have to be propagated at some finite
        velocity, presumably that of light, but he did not carry his
        investigations into the simpler field of everyday mechanics. </p>
      <p>If it is true that two stars cannot act as a Newtonian system
        in less time than it takes gravity to propagate from one to the
        other and back, it is equally true that any real body or system
        of bodies suffers to a greater or lesser extent from the same
        problem.&nbsp; Newton's Laws, strictly speaking, apply only to
        mathematically infinitesimal particles or perfectly rigid
        bodies, neither of which exists in the real world. </p>
      <p>Consider, for example, a simple steel rod one meter long which
        I wish to move by applying a force to one end.&nbsp; The instant
        I start to apply the force a message leaves the end of the rod
        as a plastic or elastic compressive wave which travels at a
        speed of approximately 5,000 meters/second.&nbsp; The
        compressive wave travels to the far end of the rod where it is
        reflected as a rarefaction and returns to the point of
        application of force at the same speed. </p>
      <p>Until the wave returns, 4/10,000 of a second later &lt;i&gt;the
        rod as a whole cannot move according to the Second Law! No
        matter how much force is applied, the center of gravity of the
        rod cannot obey F = Ma in less than this time.&nbsp; It would be
        oversimplifying to say that the rod acts as though it had
        infinite mass during this time, since the center of gravity will
        be moved somewhat by compression, but for all practical
        purposes, the rod acts as though it had a much larger mass than
        it actually has. </p>
      <p>This phenomenon is observed with all real mechanical systems to
        a greater or lesser extent and is normally described in the
        engineering textbooks as the "starting transient."&nbsp;
        Although engineers must concern themselves with starting
        transients in such matters as determining peak power
        requirements for motors, science has devoted relatively little
        attention to study of this phenomena, preferring, in general, to
        consider steady-state conditions where the Laws of Motion and
        the Laws of Thermodynamics may be more comfortably
        applied.&nbsp; Therefore, it is precisely with the starting
        transient that we will begin our investigation of the dynamic
        behavior of real bodies. </p>
      <p>We have concluded that all real bodies or systems of bodies
        experience a starting transient when a force is applied.&nbsp;
        The particular behavior of a given system will depend on: (a)
        how rapidly the force is applied and, (b) the built-in delay
        time, or "critical action time" of the system.&nbsp; More
        exactly, we have found that the behavior depends upon how
        rapidly one attempts to <i>change the acceleration</i> applied
        to the body.&nbsp; The ultimate acceleration of the body, the
        "a" of F = Ma, is not what is critical; it is the <i>rate of
          onset</i> or "surge" of the acceleration which is vital. </p>
      <p>Colonel John Paul Stapp, the USAF Flight Surgeon who subjected
        himself to crushing accelerations to investigate the hazards of
        seat ejection and airplane crashes, observed that the extent of
        damage to personnel and equipment depended in an important way
        on surge as well as the acceleration itself. In fact, today the
        USAF specifies limiting rates of onset as well as limiting
        accelerations for men and equipment. On one case, Col. Stapp
        estimated that the effect of a given acceleration on his body
        was over twice as great if applied at very high rate, than would
        be predicted by F = Ma ! </p>
      <p>Thus, it is not wholly illogical to attempt to solve the puzzle
        of high rate-of-onset anomalies by postulating that there is a
        force proportional to the rate of change of acceleration as well
        as Newton’s force proportional to acceleration itself. There is
        no conflict here with Newton, for Newton considered only systems
        where either velocity or acceleration were constant. Since his
        data inputs were from astronomy and since he had no instruments
        capable of investigating effects of changing acceleration ---
        effects that may occupy milliseconds or less --- this is not
        particularly surprising. </p>
      <p>What form should the Equation of Motion now take if we assume a
        force proportional to the surge as well as a force proportional
        to acceleration? The simplest assumption, and one which seems to
        be supported by preliminary data, is that the new force is
        additive, in the same way that forces due to viscous drag and
        displacement are additive. In other words, we now write the
        equation of Motion: </p>
      <p>F = Ma + Aa(superdot)&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) </p>
      <p>Where A is a new term which we have labeled ‘intractance’ and
        which has units of mass-seconds. Because the solutions of the
        equation in some cases yield the ratio A/M as the critical
        action time (CAT) of the system, we have in those cases assumed
        that the intractance is the product of the mass and the CAT: </p>
      <p>A = DM&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) </p>
      <p>Let us now see how this equation of motion can be used to
        analyze and predict the anomalous behavior of a simple system.
        Starting transients normally are considered only in connection
        with the beginning or the end of a motion and hence are accorded
        no particular attention. However, there are certain types of
        cyclic motion where the transient behavior is continuous, or
        repetitive and we will see later that even certain single
        transients may have critical importance in understanding natural
        events. </p>
      <p>First consider the simple case of a real body subjected to
        harmonic oscillation. To make matters easier, we will assume
        that there is no restoring force proportional to displacement
        present and no viscous damping in the system. If the applied
        force is simple harmonic in nature it may be expressed in the
        form: </p>
      <p><img src="form7.jpg" height="45" width="324">&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) </p>
      <p>where <i>f</i> is the frequency of the vibration in cycles per
        second, and <i>t</i> is the time in seconds after the beginning
        of the motion. The Newtonian equation for vibration in one
        dimension would be: </p>
      <p><img src="form8.jpg" height="74" width="385">&nbsp; (8) </p>
      <p>and the displacement of the driven body would be: </p>
      <p><img src="form9.jpg" height="96" width="330">&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) </p>
      <p>In other words, the displacement will obey Newton’s Second Law
        and will be exactly opposite in phase to the driving force, thus
        also satisfying the Third law. </p>
      <p>However, if the body to be oscillated is real, it will not
        respond instantaneously, so that the rate of onset must be
        considered. The equation of motion then assumes the form: </p>
      <p><img src="form10.jpg" height="146" width="420">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (10) </p>
      <p>where D is the delay time, or CAT of the body and da / dt is
        the surge. D is assumed to be constant. </p>
      <p>This equation has the solution: </p>
      <p><img src="form11.jpg" height="36" width="367">&nbsp;&nbsp; (11)
      </p>
      <p>where </p>
      <p><img src="form12.jpg" height="41" width="368">&nbsp;&nbsp; (12)
      </p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p><img src="form13.jpg" height="72" width="306">&nbsp;&nbsp; (13)
      </p>
      <p>where Z is a sort of complex impedance and </p>
      <p><img src="form14.jpg" height="39" width="343">&nbsp;&nbsp; (14)
      </p>
      <p>The important feature to note in this solution is that the
        amplitude of the oscillation is less than predicted by the
        Newtonian equation and even more important, there is a phase
        angle between the driving force and the displacement, even in
        the absence of viscous damping. This solution demonstrates the
        most significant characteristic of real bodies, to wit: not only
        is displacement somewhat less than Newton would predict for a
        given force, leading to an increased apparent mass, but reaction
        is no longer exactly opposite to the applied force: there is a
        phase angle which will be larger the longer the CAT of the
        system! Action and reaction are not simultaneous! </p>
      <p>A technical paper will be published in the near future which
        will present a more general discussion of solutions to the
        equations of motion. The solution presented here will serve only
        to show the effect of CAT in a system under the simplest
        situation. The disastrous effect on the theory of mechanics of
        the existence of CAT in real bodies may be realized at once when
        we consider a system so arranged that the CAT is not the same in
        all directions. </p>
      <p>If, for example, we build a mechanical oscillator such that the
        CAT is short compared to the period of oscillation in one
        direction, the mass will appear to be approximately Newtonian
        and the phase angle of reaction will be negligible when the
        oscillator is moving in that direction, If we now change the
        system to make the CAT much longer during the time the
        oscillator is moving in the opposite direction, the mass will
        appear to be greater and the phase angle larger, even though the
        total applied force is exactly the same I the two directions.
        Thus there will be a net unidirectional acceleration of the
        driven mass in the direction of the least apparent mass even
        though the applied force is balanced! </p>
      <p>This conclusion is merely a logical consequence of the
        existence of a force proportional to the third derivative. We
        have not yet, of course, considered how such a behavior could be
        possible in terms of physical reality. </p>
      <p>In recent years a number of ‘reactionless’ drives have been
        proposed and some demonstrated, including the controversial Dean
        Drive. To the extent that any of these devices have produced
        useful thrust, they presumably have embodied this principle. It
        is not the purpose of this article to attempt to explain the
        operation of these systems as such, nor to claim that any of
        them are practical devices. However, an analysis of the possible
        compatibility of some form of mechanically reactionless drive
        with the body of known data from the past may help shed some
        light on deficiencies in present theory and, hopefully, lead to
        some useful applications. </p>
      <p>If a device of this kind operates, what has happened to the
        Laws of Conservation of Momentum and Energy? Actually, the
        situation is no worse than it once was in the field of
        electricity. It was sincerely believed a century or so ago that
        it would be impossible to do work with alternating current
        without violating the Conservation of momentum, since the
        average current was zero. Although the current in one direction
        is balanced by an equal flow in the opposite direction, the
        flows are not equal and opposite simultaneously and thus work
        can be done. Furthermore, when all else failed, radiation was
        invoked to preserve the Conservation of Momentum. </p>
      <p>We are going to try the same approach. Let us again consider
        the case of a real body, having mass M and constant CAT D,
        moving in one dimension, and let us calculate the kinetic energy
        of the body. If the force is applied over the distance between
        two positions X<sub>0</sub> and Z<sub>1</sub>, during a
        corresponding time interval, t<sub>0</sub> to t<sub>1</sub>,
        then it can be shown that: </p>
      <p><img src="form15.jpg" height="160" width="1018">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (15) </p>
      <p>where v is the velocity and a the acceleration in the
        x-direction. </p>
      <p>It will not be necessary to go into the calculus involved. The
        important point is that only the first term on the right-hand
        side is Newtonian. The second two terms represent the portion of
        the energy that has not been converted to kinetic energy because
        of third derivative effects. This portion of the energy, in
        keeping with the terminology applied in modern nuclear physics
        to particles which exist in the nucleus for too short a time to
        violate the law of the Conservation of Energy, we have called
        the ‘virtual energy’. Thus this equation expresses an amendment
        to the Energy Conservation Law by a new ‘Principle of Virtual
        Energy’. If a force proportional to surge exists, then a logical
        consequence is the existence of such ‘virtual energy. We will
        continue to explore the question of whether this makes sense in
        terms of the real world. </p>
      <p>Let us see what the presence of virtual energy in a system
        implies. First of all, if the acceleration is constant the sum
        of the virtual energy terms is zero and the equation becomes
        Newtonian. The equation is not readily soluble for an arbitrary
        variation of acceleration with time but a simple example will
        demonstrate the principle. Let us assume a constant surge as
        such that the acceleration varies according to: </p>
      <p><img src="form16.jpg" height="32" width="268">&nbsp;&nbsp; (16)
      </p>
      <p>For the sake of simplicity let us assume that we are describing
        a rocket during takeoff so that the initial displacement,
        velocity, and acceleration are all zero and <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>
        = 0. We will also ignore the presence of the earth’s
        gravitational field, since the conclusions will not be affected.
        One can then find the solution that at time <i>t</i>, the
        virtual energy is given by: </p>
      <p><img src="form17.jpg" height="66" width="311">&nbsp;&nbsp; (17)
      </p>
      <p>This means that the kinetic energy at t1 will be too small by
        this amount. The rocket will have acted as though it were
        heavier than its true weight! What has happened to the energy
        that has been lost? </p>
      <p>Now it is necessary to go back and make some postulates. A
        moving electrical charge creates a magnetic field. Einstein, in
        his general Field Equations assumes that a moving gravitational
        ‘charge’ or mass will also produce a field. The predicted
        strength of such a field is extremely small for any reasonable
        velocity, smaller in general than the gravitational field due to
        the mass alone. Any radiation resulting from the interaction of
        the gravitational and ‘inertial’ field --- in the same way that
        electromagnetic radiation results from the interaction of the
        electric and magnetic fields --- is thus so small as to be
        negligible in any practical system. </p>
      <p>Although all of the reasons cannot be developed here, I believe
        it is more reasonable to postulate an ‘inertial’ field due to
        acceleration of a mass rather than simply due to its velocity.
        It is as though the fundamental ‘charge’ were momentum, Mc,
        instead of simply the mass, M. </p>
      <p>It is possible in this light to point immediately to the
        gyroscope as a well-known example of an inertial field.
        Mathematically, the ‘angular momentum’ of a gyroscope is
        calculated from the motion of the mass in the wheel in exactly
        the same way as the magnetic field of a solenoid is calculated
        from the flow of current. Mathematically, then, ‘angular
        momentum’ may be said to be identical with ‘inertial field’ in
        this case, and we will prefer the latter terminology. Anyone who
        has felt the resistance of a gyroscope to precession will know
        that this type of ‘inertial field’, if that is what it turns out
        to be, is far from negligible. The forces involved may be very
        large with a heavy wheel rotating at high speeds. Since there
        exists a constant centrifugal acceleration in a gyroscope
        running at constant speed, any attempt to precess the device
        must automatically result in a ‘third derivative’ reaction
        force, since the acceleration is being changed. </p>
      <p>Based on this example it can now be seen that the coefficient
        of the third derivative or surge term in the Equation of Motion
        must represent the resistance of the system to a change of
        inertial field, in the same sense that self-inductance
        represents the resistance of a coil to a change of magnetic
        field. We have discussed a case where we assumed that this
        coefficient was the product of the mass and the CAT of the
        system. This is not necessarily true of all systems, so that we
        choose to define this coefficient more generally in relation to
        the inertial field as ‘interactance’ of a system. Thus the force
        due to rate of onset may be defined as the product of the
        intractance and the surge. </p>
      <p>The well-known concept of a limiting velocity of propagation
        for energy in any form established by Einstein is a direct
        embodiment of the intractance of real systems. In fact, viewed
        from another point of view, it is precisely the intractance of a
        system which requires that propagation velocity be limited. If
        energy could propagate at infinite speed, then it would be
        possible to change the energy of a system in zero time. </p>
      <p>Now it is possible to visualize a completely new type of
        radiation resulting from the existence of this type of inertial
        field. If an electron radiates electromagnetic radiation when it
        is accelerated, then clearly we will now expect a mass having
        intractance to radiate gravitational-inertial radiation when it
        is subjected to surge. It is in fact my postulate that the flux
        of such radiation from a system is proportional to the rate of
        change of virtual energy. Based on this assumption, the energy
        which has failed to appear as kinetic energy or potential energy
        in the example of the rocket we discussed, has left the
        mechanical system in the form of gravitational-inertial
        radiation, as we have defined it. </p>
      <p>For obvious reasons it will not be practical to go into the
        mathematical steps taken to arrive at this conclusion, but once
        again we have followed a logical course starting from the
        assumption of a third derivative force. It is interesting to
        note that the new radiation, if it exists, will have radically
        different characteristics than electromagnetic radiation, at
        least as it is now described. First of all, it is not dipole
        radiation, but more like the radiation from an ‘end-fire’
        antenna. Secondly, each period of changing acceleration produces
        a ‘quantum’ of radiation equal to the change of virtual energy,
        so that the emission is not continuous. </p>
      <p>The consequences of this behavior will have to be explored in
        more detail in the future. It is even possible that this
        approach may shed some light on the quantum nature of
        electromagnetic radiation. For example, we have considered the
        hydrogen atom in an excited state. By writing the equations of
        motion for an orbiting body with intractance, it can be shown
        that when third derivative effects are considered the angular
        momentum is not initially constant! In fact the equations show
        that a body first placed in orbit contains a significant
        transient term in the expression for its angular momentum which
        ultimately decays to a constant with time. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the energy lost during this decay disappears
        entirely from the mechanical system and can only be accounted
        for by some form of radiation! Thus if the electron of a
        hydrogen atom were excited with additional kinetic energy, out
        theory would predict the radiation of a quantum of energy during
        this decay time. It is therefore possible that the quantum
        condition is a perfectly logical consequence of thee existence
        of intractance in real systems, and that thus quantum theory can
        be derived from Newtonian physics! </p>
      <p>During this brief discussion of the application of our theory
        of real dynamic systems to nuclear physics some reference should
        be made to the upwards of 40 new nuclear particles which have
        been postulated in recent years. Since many of these particles
        have been postulated to explain an apparent violation of the
        Conservation of Momentum during some very brief time period ---
        brief even by nuclear standards&nbsp; --- it is possible that
        the Principle of Virtual Energy may offer an alternative
        explanation in many cases. </p>
      <p>Quite apart from the possibility of inertial radiation, several
        conclusions may now be drawn, at least on a tentative basis.
        When computed including intractance, the solutions to the
        equation of motion indicate that very large systems should tend
        to be unstable, unless the mass in the system is very large.
        This conclusion, for example, may have a bearing on the theory
        of the expanding universe. Furthermore, it suggests that the
        application of thermodynamic analysis to large systems should be
        re-examined. Thermodynamics relates to systems in equilibrium
        and simultaneity is obviously important. If gravitational waves
        propagate at the velocity of light, which is by no means certain
        yet, then the CAT of the observable universe is roughly 12
        billion years and simultaneity cannot be defined for the
        complete system in less than that time. Thus it should be
        perfectly possible to reverse entropy in a local area and not
        have to pay the piper for a very long time! </p>
      <p>We come now to a consideration of what must be the Fourth Law
        of Motion. There will obviously be several alternative
        expressions. Mathematically, what seems to be critical in
        systems with intractance is the rate of change of energy, so
        that the Law is perhaps best expressed in these terms: The
        energy of a given system can only be changed in some finite
        length of time depending n the system, and never in zero time. </p>
      <p>Similarly, one can suggest an expression for the Fourth law of
        Thermodynamics, to wit: Systems can only be considered to be
        thermodynamic in nature of time periods large in comparison to
        their CAT. In other words: You can violate the first three Laws,
        providing you don’t get caught while you’re doing it! </p>
      <p>At this point, it is proper to ask the question: Is there any
        real evidence for this theory, and if it is true, why haven’t
        these phenomena been obvious for some time? </p>
      <p>First of all, rate of onset effects per se are well-known and
        their existence is hardly controversial. The entire field of
        shock and vibration gives signs of supporting our conclusions.
        In general, mechanical systems do not possess the simple
        resonance characteristics that Newtonian theory would predict.
        The existence of intractance permits many more modes of
        resonance since there are now four terms of interaction in the
        equation of motion for a system restoring force instead of
        three. This permits a much greater number and variety of
        resonances to occur. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the existence of ‘virtual particles’ in the
        atomic nucleus, which appear to violate the Conservation of
        Energy, is an important addition to the list of anomalies which
        suggest the validity of the theory. Under the assumption that
        the theory is correct, it is possible to derive the quantum
        condition from the planetary model of the atom. In short,
        wherever the theory would predict certain behavior, there are
        indications that the behavior is present. Obviously, the mere
        fact that an equation gives correct results does not mean the
        theory is correct. The model must also make sense. </p>
      <p>Most obvious embodiments of third derivative theory are
        associated with high rates of onset, impact, or strong
        vibrations. Under these conditions, it is very hard to make
        measurements. It is hard to find accelerometers, for example,
        which have response times sufficiently short to permit proper
        observation. For another thing, a system running in a continuous
        or intermittent transient mode tends to create very large
        internal forces which are very destructive. It is hard to
        maintain a system at its proper operating point for a long
        enough time to make observation. It is highly probable that most
        data of this type of behavior consisted of observations of the
        type, ‘Then the machine broke down for no known reason’, or
        ‘Witnesses stated that the wing suddenly broke off the
        airplane’. </p>
      <p>Evidence for the existence of inertial radiation is not quite
        as plentiful. The concept of gravitational waves is not a new
        one, and in fact is implicit in the weak-field solutions of the
        Einstein General Field Equations, known for 40 years. On the
        other hand, the type of gravitational-inertial radiation
        predicted by our theory is quite new since it is presumed to be
        a consequence of surge rather than simple acceleration. The
        magnitude of the Einstein radiation is predicted to be so small
        as to defy detection, but the radiation described here should be
        clearly observable under the right conditions. </p>
      <p>For example, the success of one of the proposed ‘reactionless’
        drives would strongly tend to confirm the existence of the
        radiation. At the same time, if the radiation is generated it
        should be detectable, and sooner or later a ‘Hertzian’
        experiment will have to be performed. A number of experiments
        are now underway in our laboratories at Huyck Corporation which
        we hope will provide confirmation in the near future.
        Preliminary tests have produced favorable qualitative results,
        but data has not been sufficiently accurate to permit a proper
        statistical correlation. We hope to correct this situation with
        new instrumentation by the time this article appears. </p>
      <p>In addition to the author, a number of individuals have played
        key roles in the Huyck Dynamic Systems Project. The experimental
        work was performed at the Huyck Research Center at Milford, CT,
        under the direction of Mr G. Henry Stine who also contributed a
        number of concepts to the theory. Theoretical calculations and
        analytical studies were performed by Mr E.L. Victory. Certain
        specialized instrumentation and general consultation were
        provided by John W. Campbell, uder a consulting agreement, and
        overall professional review of the theoretical and experimental
        programs has been given by Prof. Serge A. Korff, of the Physics
        Department at New York University. We are also deeply indebted
        to Dr O.G. Haywood, Vice president of Huyck Corporation, for
        technical and moral support. </p>
      <p>Obviously, there are an almost unlimited number of fields where
        the consequences of this theory might be explored. Validation,
        if ever, will probably result from may experiments in many
        fields. We cannot perform them all. We intend to continue our
        own research program and will be interested to hear of the
        results produced by other groups. </p>
      <p>Science, as we said, is a series of successive approximations
        to reality. Here is another approach. Let’s find out if it’s a
        better approximation. </p>

      <p>Dear John [Campbell]: </p>
      <p>Dr Davis and I were finally able to settle our arguments over
        the equation that appears in Figure 4 of our article entitled
        ‘The Fourth Law of motion’ in the May issue of Analog only after
        I studied the equations --- which are incidentally the
        Lagrangian form of the third derivative Law and the differential
        equation of the angular motion of an orbiting body --- as they
        were recorded by the camera. </p>
      <p>After noticning the missing dot that was not on top of the O on
        the second term of the differential equation, we realized who
        was right. </p>
      <p>May I also correct equation 17 by squaring the term a(dot)o ---
