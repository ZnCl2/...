        <p><b><font size="+1">Norman L. Dean --- The Dean Drive</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Role of John W. Campbell</b> </p>
      <p>The Dean drive obtained a good deal of publicity in the 1950s
        and 1960s via the columns of John W. Campbell, the longtime
        editor of <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i> magazine. Campbell
        apparently believed that the device worked and claimed to have
        witnessed it operating on a bathroom scale. The weight reading
        on the scale appeared to decrease when the device was activated.
        He subsequently published photographs of the scale with the
        drive stopped and running. The June 1960 cover of <i>Astounding</i>
        magazine featured a painting of a United States submarine
        orbiting Mars, supposedly propelled there by a Dean drive. </p>
      <p>Dean, who was trying to find potential buyers for his
        technology, was secretive about the details of how it was
        supposed to work, but it was said to contain asymmetrical
        rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration. </p>
      <p>Dean and Campbell claimed that Newton’s laws of motion were
        only an approximation, and that Dean had discovered a fourth law
        of motion. This has been described as a nonlinear correction to
        one of Newton’s laws, which, if correct, would allegedly have
        rendered a reactionless drive feasible after all. </p>
      <p>Skeptics maintain that there are many possibilities for
        illusory effects, involving interactions of vibration, friction,
        resonance with the springs of the scale, instantaneous
        photographs of an oscillating scale reading, and so forth. Some
        even go so far as to attribute the reported demonstrations to
        outright deception, either by Dean or by witnesses. </p>
      <p><b>Further Developments</b> </p>
      <p>Purportedly, several groups (including Westinghouse and the
        U.S. military) became interested in buying the device, if it
        worked, for sums of half a million dollars or more. Dean’s
        paranoia and insistence upon cash before showing the device,
        kept interested parties from seeing the device, and Dean never
        did make any sales. </p>
      <p>In 1999, Dean’s son, Norman Robert “Bob” Dean, appeared at an
        anti-gravity conference by invitation of a group of patent
        holders who had created differing versions of the reactionless
        drives that referred to N.L. Dean in their patents. He gave a
        presentation about his father’s device. The original drive
        models, as well as Dean’s well-kept and detailed notes, are
        apparently in the possession of the Dean Family. </p>
      <p>The noted science-fiction writer and critic Damon Knight had
        this to say about the Dean drive in a chapter called “Campbell
        and His Decade” in his collection of essays about the
        science-fiction field In Search of Wonder: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, the Dean Machine, the Dean Machine, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You put it right in a submarine, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it flies so high that it can’t be seen— <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wonderful, wonderful Dean Machine! </p>
      <p><b>Conceptual Issues</b> </p>
      <p>One major problem with the Dean patent is that the device
        simply does not work as described. Some claim that this
        discrepancy is due to intentional omissions in the technical
        details of the patent disclosure documents --- a subtle effort
        to prevent intellectual property theft. Others deny any
        possibility that this is the case and maintain that the patented
        device simply doesn't work. </p>
      <p>One major argument against the possibility of physically
        realizing a reactionless drive like the Dean Drive is that such
        a device could not transfer momentum and thus violates Newtonian
        physics. New scientific theories such as stochastic
        electrodynamics might eventually provide an explanation for some
        mechanisms of momentum transfer not currently encompassed by
        Newtonian physics. </p>
