        </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">John W. Campbell</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The photographs on the preceding pages show some of Norman
        Dean’s original instrumentation for his research on the Dean
        drive system </p>
      <p>It is freely agreed by all concerned that bathroom scales are
        an inadequate form of instrumentation; it was never considered
        that they were proper scientific devices. The instrument setup
        shown is what Dean himself built and used in his research, a
        number of strain-gauge systems are incorporated into its
        structure, and associated strain-gauge amplifiers were used to
        produce the oscillogram shown. </p>
      <p>For the information of those who ‘explained away’ Dean’s
        results in terms of nonlinear response of bathroom scales ---
        the explanation doesn’t hold. Strain gauges show the effect. But
        strain gauge readings are meaningful only when you have,
        yourself, studied the precise method of installation, and have,
        yourself, calibrated them in situ. </p>
      <p>What Dean was seeking, and never succeeded in getting any
        government bureau to do, was to give his device a test on their
        strain gauge setups. The sole point of the bathroom scale was to
        give a rough indication that there was something there worth
        taking the trouble to test for properly. The glitter of
        yellowish particles with metallic luster in a piece of quartz
        rock doesn’t prove you’ve found a gold mine --- but it does
        suggest it would be worth your while to make a proper test. </p>
      <p>None of the government agencies, up to the time of the issuance
        of the patent, had even bothered to study Dean’s own strain
        gauge records. </p>
      <p>The quality of workmanship in Dean’s instrumentation suggests
        that his work of measurement was not sloppy or ill-considered. </p>
      <p>This instrument setup was designed and built solely as a test
        instrument, to explore the essential principle of the Dean
        System. </p>
      <p>There have been complaints that I did not adequately discuss
        the Dean device, but talked only about its rejection. There’s a
        reason --- a good one. The Dean gadget is, mechanically, a very
        simple contraption. But the theoretical structure underlying it
        is decidedly not simple; I was fully aware that it was
        completely impossible to discuss the thing at all adequately in
        anything less than a full-scale thesis, and therefore skipped
        the thing entirely. </p>
      <p>Put it this way; if I had stated, in 1935, that nuclear energy
        could be released very simply by just dissolving some uranium
        sulfate or nitrate in water, you can imagine the reception that
        statement would have gotten. Yet that statement is precisely and
        literally correct! That’s a literal description of the Los
        Alamos Water Boiler Reactor. It’s true that you need
        U-235-enriched uranium sulfate, and, or heavy water… but the
        statement is an exactly correct description of the simple way in
        which nuclear energy can be released. </p>
      <p>I could, also, have stated, ‘You need only pile up some blocks
        of graphite and lumps of ordinary uranium metal, or uranium
        oxide, and you will release atomic power’. That, too, is an
        exact and literal description of a true nuclear reactor --- the
        famous original Stagg Field reactor. </p>
      <p>Each of those devices was mechanically an extremely simple
        thing… but there was a tremendous background of highly
        sophisticated research and design underlying them. </p>
      <p>When I first hearth of the atomic pile, my reaction was, ‘Why…
        someone might have stumbled on that thing accidentally!’ </p>
      <p>No, no once would stumble on it accidentally. It’s true that
        naturally-occurring uranium can be used in the Fermi type
        moderated reactor… but only very, very specially hyper-purified
        uranium, and the graphite must be a very, very special
        hyper-purified graphite. It’d never happen that way by accident.
        Vanadium is one of the worst neutron-absorbing impurities,,, and
        vanadium is normally heavily laced into uranium ores. Most of
        the pre-WWII production of uranium in this country was the
        by-product of mining vanadium ores. In addition, graphite is
        commonly produced from petroleum residues… and vanadium is a
        common contaminant. </p>
      <p>Again, a transistor is an extremely simple device. It consists
        simply of a tiny wafer sliced from a lightly impure germanium or
        silicon crystal, with three wires soldered to it. </p>
      <p>Now let’s see you go home and make one! </p>
      <p>‘Why, if it could be done as simply as that, someone would have
        done it years ago!’ </p>
      <p>Oh, yeah? </p>
      <p>It is absolutely true that all you need to do to release atomic
        power is to dissolve a few pounds of uranium nitrate in water. </p>
      <p>Dean’s device is only mechanically simple. </p>
      <p>Since my last report on the progress of Dean’s gadget, one of
        the very large corporations that tackled the thing has made a
        complete theoretical analysis of the concepts. They find that
        Dean’s mathematical structure is perfectly valid; their
        math-physics department agrees, after giving it a full
        run-through on a large computer, that he definitely can get
        force and energy output as he states. The one problem they can’t
        nail down is how to show that he can feed force and energy into
        it; that problem arises because they have no satisfactory
        criteria for determining what frame of reference should be used
        in discussing the problem. </p>
      <p>I’ve seen a short --- and admittedly rough --- mathematical
        analysis of the problem done by an engineer friend that, in
        essence, comes up with this answer: The centrifugal force
        generated in one sector of the rotation in an upward direction
        comes out exactly equal and opposite to the force exerted, in
        the rest of the cycle, in the downward direction. This, in other
        words, complies in full with Newton’s equal-and-opposite law. If
        you break off the analysis at that point, you have a
        mathematical proof that Dean’s device does not produce a drive.
      </p>
      <p>The fault in the ‘proof’ is that while the two forces are equal
        and opposite, they do not have equal duration. The forces are
        equal and opposite…but the impulses are not. If that inequality
        is as small as one percent, then if you generate a centrifugal
        force of 100 G --- which is easy to do! --- you have a 10 G net.
      </p>
      <p>Of the oscillogram, Norman Dean says: ‘Please disregard the top
        light line caused by exterior interference. The top heavy line
        is zero force exerted by the oscillator in its free condition in
        each cycle. The next line down represents the cyclical
        re-setting force or reaction. The distance from the zero line to
        the bottom line is the amount of positive thrust exerted in each
        cycle. The two lower lines are of exactly the same time duration
        in each cycle, in this case 55 degrees of rotation. We therefore
        find that the net thrust in each cycle was the difference
        between the two lower lines. The picture is a time exposure of
        about ten cycles’. </p>
