      <p>The problem of Space ---- as any daily newspaper will clearly
        demonstrate --- is not simply a technical problem. It’s
        violently charged with emotional and political tensions. </p>
      <p>It may seem, at first thought, that the problem of a space
        drive is a purely technical problem. It seems clear enough that
        if we want a mechanism, or principle, by which a vehicle can be
        propelled in free space --- a device not a rocket, but something
        acting on the level of force fields, that does not have to carry
        reaction mass to throw away --- this is a pure, physical science
        problem. </p>
      <p>It isn’t. It’s a violent emotional problem, first, a red-hot
        political problem second, and only incidentally a technical
        problem. Basically, the technical problem is the easiest of the
        three. </p>
      <p>The reasoning behind that statement is quite simple; Nature
        invariably gives an exact and truthful answer to a properly
        phrased question, always without fear, prejudice, or dishonesty.
        The technical problem is simply that of asking Nature the right
        question. </p>
      <p>The other two aspects of the problem do not have the same
        clear-cut simplicity. Both involve human emotions --- which, as
        various philosophers have reported over the last six millennia
        of recorded history, are anything but clear-cut or simple. </p>
      <p>In the first palce, the most honorable and ethical of men can
        be a bald-faced liar, if he’s misinformed himself. Even a man so
        inhumanly honest as to be able to overcome completely any
        personal emotional bias can still be misinformed. </p>
      <p>If you think that there is no emotional problem entailed in the
        space-drive problem… please thing again, including more the
        relevant facts. Is it an unemotional problem to a man who has
        devoted 15 years to rocket-engine research and development? To
        an executive who has been responsible for authorizing the
        expenditure of hundreds of millions of the national wealth on
        the development of launch-pad facilities? Take a careful look at
        the ads in any this-year’s issues of such a magazine as
        Scientific American… with the thought in mind, ‘These men don’t
        know it yet, but a true space drive has already been developed.
        All this research, all these proposals, are meaningless now’. </p>
      <p>Please note carefully: it is not necessary that a space drive
        has been developed for you to try that little test. Just assume
        that you did know that one had; the point of that suggested test
        is to appreciate that the introduction of any true space drive
        is a red-hot emotional problem. </p>
      <p>The buggy-whip manufacturers didn’t believe, when the Model T
        Ford appeared, that their industry was finished. The fact dawned
        on them only slowly. But gradually they did come to realize that
        there was no possible improvement in buggy-whip design that
        could, by brilliant superiority, regain the dwindling market. It
        wasn’t a matter of competition with their product; it was the
        horse --- without which the buggy-whips had no meaning --- that
        was innately incompetent to compete. </p>
      <p>There is no possible brilliant improvement in rocket design
        that can make it competitive with a true space drive. The fact
        is perfectly, and unarguably clear to any rocket engineer.
        Unlike the buggy-whip manufacturer, who only slowly came to
        realize that his industry no longer existed, the rocket engineer
        can see at once that rockets are reduced to a very small-time,
        hobby or specialized business. If you want to drill a hole a few
        inches in diameter through 100 feet of hard rock, a rocket ---
        double-ended type --- is far and away the simplest, cheapest,
        most portable and quickest technique. </p>
      <p>But the space rockets are out completely, if a space drive of
        any kind is invented. </p>
      <p>Of course rocket engineers don’t constitute a very great
        faction in the population --- even in the population of Science.
        Now I have been told, many times, by many people, frequently
        with considerable heat, that there is no such thing as Science;
        there are only human scientists. I don’t entirely agree, but we
        can all agree that there are human scientists. With the specific
        recognition that there may be Martian scientists, Rigellian
        scientists, for all we know --- but the only kind of scientists
        so far encountered are human scientists. They start out as men,
        not computing machines, and they remain men with a scientific
        training. </p>
      <p>They, too, have emotional problems, biases, prejudices, and
        powerful desires. </p>
      <p>I was asked, recently, to talk to one session of a seminar
        series at one of the major technical schools. The series was
        held at night; it’s for professionally employed scientists and
        engineers who are working toward higher degrees. The group is
        made up largely of chemical engineers; the overall theme is an
        effort to study the technique of solving problems, rather than
        education in any specific field. </p>
      <p>I was to send in two question-problems for the men to work on;
        their answers were sent to me to be graded and returned the
        evening I participated. </p>
      <p>The second of the two questions was: </p>
      <p>An inventor has patented a device that converts rotary motion
        to unidirectional motion. And he means just that: unidirectional
        motion. If driven by a motor, this device produces one-way
        thrust. It is a bootstraps’ lifter. A sky hook with elevator
        attachment. It makes a monkey’s uncle out of Newton’s Law of
        action and reaction. </p>
      <p>Now: assume for discussion that the device actually does work
        (Laws of science have been overthrown before --- even old,
        established ones!). Many other fundamental principles of modern
        theory would necessarily change with the fall of the law of
        action and reaction. What other consequences to fundamental
        scientific theory would be implied? </p>
      <p>One of the answers came from a chemical engineer working in one
        of the major oil refineries in the New York Metropolitan area.
        His reaction was: </p>
      <p>‘The most bitter consequence, if this invention was possible
        and did work, is this would be a hell of a place to live. The
        basic laws of centrifugal and centripetal action would not hold.
        There would be no method of predicting the path of planets
        through the universe, or of a rocket ship. The laws of fluid
        flow or mechanical work would not hold. In essence, this is the
        reason why I do not read science fiction. Scientific curiosity
        and fantastic experimentation should be encouraged, but pure
        fiction… This statement was probably made about the work of
        Leonardo daVinci and Jules Verne, who were forward-looking men
        of high caliber, but they stayed within the limits of reason.
        This problem exceeds reason’. </p>
      <p>So far as he knew, the question was purely hypothetical; that I
        had in mind a specific invention he did not know. His reaction
        was, clearly, emotional, not technical. The emotion stems from
        the fact that the proposed device attacks on of the fundamental
        tenets of his world-picture. </p>
      <p>Who wants a true space drive, then? Not the rocket engineers!
        And not the scientists in general, not when it means the
        destruction of the foundations of their science. If one can’t
        rely on the eternal validity of Newton’s Laws of Motion… what
        stability is there in the world of Science? It’s not just a
        space drive; it’s a thing that casts doubt on the validity of
        the laws of fluid flow, the conservation of energy, the laws of
        thermodynamics, on everything! </p>
      <p>‘Better the Devil we know, than the Devil we know not of!’ </p>
      <p>The space drive is an emotional problem of the highest order,
        to anyone who has a major emotional investment in any field of
        science. </p>
      <p>Because to be a space drive --- not antigravity, which isn’t a
        drive, but simply something that takes off the parking brake, so
        to speak --- the device must, in some fashion, negate the
        Newtonian Laws of motion. It can’t drive in space without
        drastically rearranging the Law of Conservation of Momentum, and
        the law of action and reaction. And anything that leaks through
        the Law of Conservation of Momentum automatically challenges the
        Law of Conservation of Energy. The laws of thermodynamics are
        based solidly on those; invalidate, or even seriously challenge
        them, and thermodynamics is a structure without a foundation. </p>
      <p>Relativity is based solidly on the conservation of momentum,
        mass-energy, and electric charge. Any true space drive throws
        two of the three into doubt. </p>
      <p>This is something to make a scientist feel happy and contented?
      </p>
      <p>‘Look, who the hell wants that damn space drive, anyway?!’ </p>
      <p>The political aspects of the problem are more readily stated
        and accepted as realities. It’s not easy for the intellectual
        man, who believes very sincerely, that his life is entirely
        rational, to accept or appreciate that he remains a human
        scientists, and that his reactions are emotional. The politician
        is different; is business, like that of the dramatist, is
        largely emotional. He knows he has emotional problems and that
        only a part of those emotional problems are his own. It
        perfectly true that schools that flunk out the incompetent, and
        give special encouragement to the unusually able, are going to
        do a better job for the nation, but any politician knows the
        emotional dynamite lying inside that proposition. It isn’t his
        emotion, but it’s his to deal with, whether he likes it or not.
      </p>
      <p>A true space drive, just at this point in history, is
        international political dynamite. Several nations, now, have
        weapons too powerful for use on Earth; if one of those nations,
        and only one, also had a drive that gave them free, full,
        economically practical access to the entire Solar System, the
        concept of ‘massive retaliation’ would be invalidated. If nation
        Alpha has a true space drive, one that can move 10,000 ton
        space-liners from Earth to mars in three days --- five days if
        Mars is on the far side of the Sun, or reach the Asteroids in
        five days, while nation Beta can’t get so much as one
        man-carrying vehicle into orbit… Beta can’t talk about ‘massive
        retaliation’ as a deterrent any more. </p>
      <p>Do you think any sane politician would want a true space drive
        developed in the laboratories of his country? If the scientists
        if Alpha develop it, it’s practically certain that before a
        full-scale use of it could be begun, the intelligence agents of
        Beta would know about it, even if security were so tight that
        couldn’t know it. </p>
      <p>And quite clearly no sane politician would dare suggest that
        the Great Secret was too hot to keep a secret --- suggest that
        it be freely shared with Beta. </p>
      <p>‘Look, dammitall, who wants this space drive now, of all
        times?’ </p>
      <p>It’s fairly probable that, if Beta found that Alpha had a true
        space drive, the Betans would figure their only remaining hope
        was to force Alpha to her knees before the space drive was
        developed into use. </p>
      <p>Sometimes, somehow, a magnificent ineptitude can solve problems
        that no wisdom could touch. </p>
      <p>I believe the true space drive has been discovered, tested in
        models, and patented. It’s the most colossal breach of national
        security I can imagine, just offhand; a true space drive is the
        well-oiled key to the entire Solar System --- cheap, quick, and
        practical. If Fermi and Company had, in 1941, gotten a US patent
        detailing precisely how to purify U-235, how to manufacture
        Plutonium, and how to make an atomic bomb, it wouldn’t have been
        a security breach of the same order. After all, as the Air Force
        pointed out in 1946, the fire raids on Tokyo did more actual
        damage than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Nuclear power is
        still more expensive than coal. The atomic devices didn’t
        actually do anything we couldn’t achieve, although in a harder
        way, without them. </p>
      <p>A space drive does things we can’t achieve at all any other
        way. No rocket can carry enough reaction-mass to maintain a
        one-G acceleration all the way from here to Mars, or from here
        to Neptune. Lack of reaction-mass makes it effectively
        impossible for a rocket to do more than the minutest maneuvers
        in space. A rocket’s course is about as flexible as a glass rod;
        it can be bent a little, of course. </p>
      <p>Under the concept of national security, publication of the
        detailed mechanism of a true space drive constitutes an
        absolutely intolerable breach of secrecy. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, magnificent bumbling, combined with emotional
        rejection of the ideas, have led to the publication and open
        distribution of the principle. </p>
      <p>Frankly, I think that we are most incredibly fortunate; it
        would have been suicidal for anyone to suggest releasing such a
        discovery if it had ever gotten under Security --- and almost
        equally suicidal, I suspect, to try to keep it secret. </p>
      <p>Can you imagine anyone proposing to give away the Solar System
        --- a usable Solar System, when there is a true space drive? ---
        if it were clear that the invention was precisely that; the key
        to the full utilization, to the ownership-in-fee-simple, of the
        Solar System? </p>
      <p>Now, it’s happened by bumbling and resistance, of course, there
        can be screaming, wailing, and explosive accusations… but the
        critical danger point is passed; it isn’t a secret. </p>
      <p>It wasn’t, however, by wise intent that it was released; it was
        not high-order statesmanship that saved the situation. </p>
      <p>The story, in essence, is this: </p>
      <p>In the summer of 1956 --- over a year before Sputnik I took off
        --- Mr Norman L. Dean, of Washington DC, applied for a patent on
        a device for converting rotary motion to unidirectional motion.
      </p>
      <p>He tried, naturally enough, to interest various government
        agencies in his discovery. He was still trying in July, 1959,
        when the patent was finally granted, and the USGPO made it
        available to everyone for 25 cents and a desire to see it. Dean
        had also, naturally, applied for British and German patents by
        that time. </p>
      <p>To get from almost any Government building to Mr Dean’s
        residence is s 50 cent taxi ride. Mr Dean has a working
        demonstrator model at his home; it’s been there while various
        and sundry government agencies didn’t look at it. </p>
      <p>I drove down from the New York area to take a look; the
        accompanying photographs show what I saw. </p>
      <p>Please consider carefully the following point; it’s crucially
        important, and anyone seeking to evaluate the point of this
        article misses the thing entirely if he does not bear this in
        mind: </p>
      <p>(1) The foregoing statements about the emotional and political
        consequences of a space drive are valid, whether Dean’s device
        is such a drive or not. </p>
      <p>(2) The failure of any government agent, of any bureau, to
        inspect the working model, or allow a demonstration of the
        model, remains a violation of the fundamental doctrine of
        Science, whether the device works or not. </p>
      <p>It is my present belief that Norman Dean has made a major
        breakthrough discovery; that’s a personal opinion, based on
        observational data, which is more than the government scientists
        have to back their contrary opinion, but remains an opinion of
        one individual. </p>
      <p>But that no government agency either accepted a demonstration,
        or bothered to inspect the device, until after the patent was
        published, and it had been discussed in the December 1959
        editorial, is not opinion. It’s checkable fact. </p>
      <p>The thing Galileo fought for --- the thing for which Science
        has honored him, classified him as a martyr of Science --- was
        the fundamental proposition that demonstration must be accepted;
        that observational date must never be suppressed for the sake of
        Authority and Theory. </p>
      <p>The scientists of NASA specifically violated that fundamental
        for wich Galileo fought. They wouldn’t look. </p>
      <p>Neither would the Office of Naval Research. </p>
      <p>Neither did anyone from the Senate Space Commmittee. Which is
        perhaps more remarkable; a Senate Committee that rejected an
        opportunity to investigate something! </p>
      <p>Who is Norman Dean? </p>
      <p>Well, the really important thing is that he’s a Mr, not a Dr;
        he doesn’t even have a bachelor’s degree in science. Obviously
        incapable of doing any useful scientific thinking. No need to
        investigate his ideas. </p>
      <p>The fact is that he is, professionally, a major executive in
        the Federal Housing Administration, specializing in mortgage
        appraisal, indicates that he can, however, do some very cogent
        thinking indeed. </p>
      <p>But in his machine, he is a hobbyist at work --- an amateur.
        He’s so much an amateur that, unlike the professional, he could,
        and did, challenge the fundamental assumptions of physics. Being
        an amateur, he does not have any appreciable emotional
        investment in the validity of Newton’s Laws; he had no block
        against challenging them. </p>
      <p>His device --- the patent number is 2,886,976 --- will, when
        driven by a rotating shaft, produce a thrust without an equal
        and opposite reaction. </p>
      <p>His demonstration model is specifically designed to be just
        that --- a demonstration model. It’s not made for maximum
        efficiency, lightness, compactness, or beauty; it’s designed to
        be a completely open-work unit, in which every component and
        operation is clearly visible. </p>
      <p>It does not lift itself; it isn’t intended to. </p>
      <p>At this time, he has no operable models that do lift
        themselves; he has photographs of models that did. In measuring
        engineering performance factors, to get necessary engineering
        data, these models had to be tested to destruction --- and were.
      </p>
      <p>Mr Dean’s primary education and experience have been in
        business; he, with that orientation, is not particularly in the
        space drive feature. A device capable of producing force without
        reaction has several million workaday, down-to-Earth uses; the
        heavy-industry use of the Dean drive will be on Earth. Space
        applications will be, so far as the economics of the matter go,
        a minor sideline. </p>
      <p>X-rays, electronics, cyclotrons and electron microscopy all
        stemmed from Faraday’s development of the generator, the
        transformer, and the motor. They have been the great new-fields
        applications of electric power. </p>
      <p>Radio, television and radar --- these are new and wonderful
        things. But what keeps the powerhouse generators spinning is the
        heavy horsepower demands of industrial applications like
        electric heating, driving machine tools, and doing similar jobs
        that fire or steam power could do… but not as well or as
        conveniently. It’s not the new-and-glamorous that uses the
        megawatt hours; the biggest broadcasting station throws out only
        as much power as us used in a domestic electric system. 50 kw
        sounds big; my home draws 125 amperes at 230 volts on occasion,
        and that’s 28,750 watts. </p>
      <p>The heavy-duty use of the Dean drive, as Dean is businessman
        enough to recognize, is not in glamorous space-exploration ---
        however important that may be in human history --- but in the
        slugging, heavy, hard work of the world; simply lifting things
        that have to be moves; for industrial material-handling devices.
      </p>
      <p>The gadget that can drive a space-drive will be more often
        needed to lift a massive steel girder into place. With a Dean
        drive unit on the end of a fishpole-like control rod, a man
        could lead a 100-ton girder into place. </p>
      <p>If you’ve used an ordinary one-quarter inch drill at all, you
        have probably run into the problem that the drill was willing to
        work --- but you couldn’t, because of the location, put enough
        pressure on the bit to make it cut. It’s easy enough to make a
        motor and chuck capable of turning a 2-inch drill bit... but
        how, with a portable unit, can you apply the sort of pressure it
        takes to make such a device bite into a steel girder? </p>
      <p>The Dean drive is simply a device that generates a one-way
        force; it lifts if you point up, but it pushes in any desired
        direction, without need of something to take the reaction force.
        There isn’t any. </p>
      <p>Dean’s engineering data indicated that, neglecting friction
        losses --- which are simply a matter of design, not principle,
        and therefore highly variable --- a 150 hp engine could develop
        6000 pound thrust. </p>
      <p>My automobile has approximately 400 horsepower, and weighs
        approximately 5800 pounds. Allowing a 50 percent loss due to
        mechanical friction, that means that the car could be equipped
        with a Dean drive, and come up with an acceleration of one G.
        The passengers would not need seat belts. But rather a
        strapped-in cocoon. The one-G acceleration would mean going from
        rest to about 65 mph in 3 seconds flat… and it would, of course,
        mean braking action that would stop the car, on the slickest of
        glare ice, in the same 3 seconds, in a distance of about 150
        feet. If the passengers weren’t cocooned into palce, they’d need
        hospitalization, however. </p>
      <p>By comparison, the maximum possible acceleration with rubber
        tires on dry concrete is about 0.2 G; the maximum braking is
        about 0.4 G. That’s simply the coefficient of friction of rubber
        on concrete. </p>
      <p>Obviously, the device would also allow airplanes to leave their
        wings behind; a true hovering machine capable of mach 10 is
        perfectly feasible. </p>
      <p>These, not the space applications, will be the really major
        applications of the device. We’ve been needing a portable
        sky-hook for centuries; it looks like Dean has one. </p>
      <p>Dean’s demonstration model is intended to show the principle;
        that a pair of counter-rotating eccentric masses can, in his
        system, generate a non-reactive force. The simplest way of
        demonstrating it is to show that some of the weight of his
        machine goes… somewhere… when it’s turned on. The simplest
        device for showing that is an ordinary bathroom scale. There’s
        no pretense that this is an accurate measuring device; it’s
        intended to establish merely that some considerable force is
        being generated. </p>
      <p>The photographs show that what I saw was not an illusion. </p>
      <p>The principle of operation is, of course, what’s in dispute.
        Science holds the device to be a not-member of a non-existent
        class --- a non-existent class of devices that don’t conform to
        the Law of Conservation of Momentum. </p>
      <p>I do not understand Mr Dean’s theory very clearly; my personal
        impression is that he doesn’t understand the thing in a
        theoretical sense, himself. But then --- the Roman engineers
        never did understand the physical chemistry underlying the
        setting of mortar (and for that matter, modern physical
        chemistry doesn’t either!). Dean doesn’t have to understand it;
        he can make it work. As a businessman, he has every reason to
        sell an immensely useful, workable device, whether it’s
        understandable or not --- whether it’s rational, or not. That
        chemical engineering student may be right; perhaps it is beyond
        reason. A thing doesn’t have to be reasonable to be useful. </p>
      <p>I believe, however, that a very broad, general explanation of
        the direction to look for an explanation is possible. </p>
      <p>Essentially, the device consists of two counter-rotating
        masses, on shafts rotating in a light frame. Now such a gimmick
        has been used to generate a powerful oscillating force in one
        plane; the horizontal vectors of centrifugal force generated by
        the two eccentric masses will always be equal and opposite, so
        that there is no net horizontal force. But the vertical vectors
        add; with this mechanism alone, Dean would get a powerful
        up-and-down oscillation, the upward force being equal to the
        downward force at a later instant. Useful for driving shaker
        tables for vibration tables, but not for getting anywhere. </p>
      <p>Now the great trouble with efforts to make centrifugal force
        yield a net resultant is that it insists on adding up, through a
        full 360 degrees, to exactly zero. If you try accelerating the
        weights at some particular part of their rotation, thus changing
        the centrifugal force, the force used in accelerating and
        decelerating them then proves to balance out, very neatly if
        sadly, the added centrifugal force. </p>
      <p>Oh, the centrifugal force is great enough! Centrifugal force
        can, without any trouble at all, tear a high tensile steel wheel
        into shreds. In the super-centrifuges, they develop
        accelerations of 2 million G and more. </p>
      <p>The trouble is to make it not add up to zero. What we need is
        something like a rectifier for alternating electric current;
        ordinary AC adds up to exactly zero, too, through a full 360
        degrees --- but without a rectifier, you can’t get DC output. </p>
      <p>Dean’s device is quite simple; you simply cannot push those
        weights around to make the centrifugal force come out
        unbalanced, without using a force equal to and opposite from the
        added centrifugal force. </p>
      <p>But…what happens if, instead of moving the masses, you move the
        center of rotation? </p>
      <p>The center of rotation has no mass; it’s a geometrical concept,
        not a material entity. Pushing it around doesn’t require force.
      </p>
      <p>In the rotation of those counter-rotating masses, there is a
        particular phase angle such that the horizontal vectors are
        cancelled, and the vertical vector is upward, and exactly equal
        to the weight of the two masses. At that instant, the light
        framework can be moved upward without exerting any force on the
        masses. </p>
      <p>In the demonstration model, a small solenoid, activated by a
        commutator, moves the frame carrying the two masses, at the
        required instant. It does not have to exert any force whatever
        on the masses; it does not move them. It moves their centers of
        rotation. </p>
      <p>And what the effect of that is, no modern mathematical analysis
        is competent to determine. Reason: Dean’s converted the problem
        into a 3-body problem, and that’s one that mathematical
        techniques have never been able to handle. </p>
      <p>The two masses, in Dean’s machine, are forced to rotate about
        two different centers of rotation simultaneously. </p>
      <p>When Newton did his work, he had, buried in it all, an
        unstated, and unanalyzed assumption; that there was, of course,
        one, and only one possible frame of reference. </p>
      <p>The whole of Newtonian and Classical physics rests on that
        assumption; it worked fine until toward the end of the 19th
        century; in the beginning of the 20th century it was really in
        trouble. </p>
      <p>Einstein correctly spotted, and challenged the assumption, and
        showed how to handle many unresolvable problems, in terms of
        multiple frames-of-reference. But… with one underlying catch.
        Einstein had no mathematical tools competent to analyze more
        than one relationship at a time; therefore he was forced to
        simplify the problem of reality by saying ‘there is no
        simultaneity’. </p>
      <p>The three-body problem can’t be solved, because we have no
        techniques to handle the simultaneous interactions of A, B, and
        C. That’s why astronomers, trying to compute planetary orbits,
        have to do it by successive approximations. First figure the
        orbit of Venus as though only Venus and Sol existed. Then
        compute the effects of earth-Moon on that orbit. Then correct
        the assumed earth-Moon orbit for the effects of Venus on it, and
        then recorrect the orbit of Venus for the perturbed orbit of
        Earth. Then compute the effect of Mercury, and --- </p>
      <p>Our mathematics can handle any two bodies at a time --- any one
        double-ended relationship. </p>
      <p>But it cannot handle simultaneous multiple relationships. </p>
      <p>So Einstein said, ‘There aren’t any’. It was a simplifying
        assumption which made the problems manageable, and was justified
        by the great advantage gained thereby. </p>
      <p>But Einstein never did like statistical mechanics; the nuclear
        physicists did, however. In nucleonics, and in solid-state
        physics, you can’t consider one thing at a time; you are forced
        to consider multiple-simultaneous relationships, the general
        n-body problem. It can be done if the numbers are large enough,
        by handling it statistically. </p>
      <p>Two counter-rotating brass weights aren’t numerous enough for
        statistical analysis, however. </p>
      <p>Actually, our whole present system of physics is, without
        Dean’s help, rapidly approaching a situation where it must
        acknowledge gross defects. It has, to date, sort of sidled
        around them, without looking directly at them --- but the
        situation remains. </p>
      <p>It is impossible to express the horsepower output of any
        reaction engine, either rocket or jet, but let’s stick to the
        pure rocket. </p>
      <p>The trouble is, horsepower is defined as work per time-unit.
        Work, however, is defined as force-through-distance: W = FS. Now
        consider a rocket delivering a thrust of 1000 units, on a trip
        from Earth to mars. Its velocity is one mile per second relative
        to Earth, and ten miles per second relative to mars. What
        horsepower is the rocket delivering? </p>
      <p>Well, of course --- if you consider two different frames of
        reference, you’re bound to get different answers! Einstein
        showed that… </p>
      <p>Yes, but Einstein said you weren’t allowed to consider both
        simultaneously; the real-universe fact is that the rocket does
        have a relationship to both earth and mars at all times. Just
        because you don’t know enough to be able to comprehend the
        interaction doesn’t make that interaction cease to exist! </p>
      <p>Let’s go from the matter of horsepower --- which is, after all,
        a mice, simple, linear function to the matter of kinetic energy.
        Since kinetic energy is a quadratic function --- KE = 1/2 MV^2
        --- that Earth-Mars rocket has another peculiarity. For a given
        change in velocity, the kinetic energy changes by two very
        different amounts. If kinetic energy is energy, and energy is
        conserved… which kinetic energy do we have to be conservative
        about? </p>
      <p>Note that while the greater added kinetic energy appears with
        respect to the Mars frame of reference, no momentum or energy is
        being transferred between the ship and Mars at the time. The
        ship is reacting against its exhaust gases, not Mars. But, if
        that ship is going to land on Mars, that kinetic energy change
        must be accounted for at that time. </p>
      <p>Which kinetic energy value is conservative: the ship-Earth
        value, or the ship-Mars value? <br>
        Einstein’s entire theoretical structure breaks down if
        simultaneity is imposed as a requirement, just as Newton’s broke
        down under the requirement of more than one frame of reference.
      </p>
      <p>What happens to centrifugal force, when, in one cycle, a pair
        of brass weights is forced to rotate about two non-identical
        centers of rotation? What amount of force is required to
        displace a geometrical concept? </p>
      <p>When Mr Dean submitted his proposals, a physicist of NASA
        reported that his mathematics was unsound. </p>
      <p>You know, personally I’m inclined to agree with that physicist
        on one thing; I, too, think Dean’s mathematics is unsound. The
        point of disagreement is that I’m darned sure the physicist’s
        mathematics is incompetent; all mathematics is! I have lots of
        positive evidence that no one can solve a 3-body problem a bit
        better than Mr Dean. What Dean has done is present the
        physicists with a device that imposes a 3-body problem. Their
        mathematics is just as incompetent to handle it as Dean’s ---
        but Dean isn’t trying to solve it mathematically. He’s applying
        it engineeringly, which is somewhat different. His machine
        solves the problem perfectly --- and the answer is rectified
        centrifugal force. </p>
      <p>Understandably, the emotional impact of the concept that such a
        device actually exists is one that leads to powerful rejection
        on the part of any human being with a heavy emotional investment
        in ‘known laws of physics’. It always appears, when one first
        encounters such a thing, that all the old values have been
        crushed --- destroyed --- swept away. </p>
      <p>They haven’t, of course --- except for those who have pinned
        their entire value system to pure theory. Electronic engineers,
        computing transit time in ordinary vacuum tubes, don’t use
        Einsteinian concepts; Newtonian work fine, just as they always
        did, within their proper range. </p>
      <p>We’ve known for a century or more that our mathematics wasn’t
        able to solve the three-body problem; it’s perfectly obvious
        that sooner or later we’re going to have to develop a technique
        of analysis that can handle such problems. And equally clear,
        that that new technique will, applied to old problems, yield
        totally new and far more general understandings. </p>
      <p>It just happens that, apparently, an amateur experimenter has
        come up with a device that belongs in the set of devices that
        would be normal consequences of a
        multiple-simultaneous-relationship mathematics, before we
        achieved such an analytical technique. </p>
      <p>The theoretical physicists couldn’t solve the problems of
        neutron behavior in a thermal-energy-level moderated nuclear
        reactor mathematically. That is, obviously, a
        multiple-simultaneous-relationship problem. To handle the
        problem, they used what amounts to a rule-of-thumb
        engineering-style technique; they called it the ‘Monte Carlo
        System’. A roulette wheel proved to be a fine analog computer
        for the problem. </p>
      <p>I think Dean’s device is a true space drive; that it does work.
      </p>
      <p>But I know no modern physicist is competent to make a
        theoretical analysis of any system involving
        multiple-simultaneous interactions --- and that there are, in
        the universe, precisely such systems. The number of binary stars
        is very, very large; there are, also, many trinary star-systems.
        Can such systems have stable planetary systems? </p>
      <p>Since no serious effort has been made to crack the problem, we
        do not know, actually, whether the energy-interchange
        relationships in the Solar System are progressive, cyclic, or
        what. We simply cannot compute the positions of the Solar System
        either 10 million years ago, or 10 million years hence, by that
        laborious system of successive approximation. </p>
      <p>And even so --- they do those calculations on the assumption
        that momentum and energy must be conserved. But… which kinetic
        energy of that Earth-Mars rocket is to be conserved? </p>
      <p>The essence of the situation is --- whether modern orthodox
        physics likes it or not --- that our laws of Conservation of
        Energy and Momentum are, in fact, very special cases of much
        more general realities. Newton we already know was fundamentally
        in error; it is essential, in cosmological physics, to consider
        more than one frame of reference. Einstein demonstrated that. </p>
      <p>But since our laws of conservation stem from Newtonian concepts
        --- they are suspect anyway, and were before Dean’s device came
        along. </p>
      <p>It is already a known fact that our mathematics is incapable of
        handling the theee-body problem --- or, in general the problem
        of n simultaneous relationships, where n is greater than one. We
        can’t actually, handle true simultaneous equations; we can
        ‘solve’ simultaneous equations only for those points at which
        they are not simultaneous, but identical --- i.e., the points of
        intersection. </p>
      <p>While I was in Washington taking a careful look at Dean’s
        gadget, I went around to the Senate Space Committee, and to the
        Office of Naval Research. Both agencies had a file on Mr Dean
        and his efforts to get some attention paid to his device. </p>
      <p>Again I emphasize; it is not important whether Dean is right or
        wrong; what is important is that the agencies did not find out.
      </p>
      <p>The Space Committee’s file apparently shows that the idea was
        referred to a NASA scientist. His report was that Dean’s
        mathematics was unsound; in other words, Dean’s proposal was
        rejected on the grounds of pure theoretical consideration.
        That’s the same grounds on which the Church Fathers rejected
        Galileo’s proposals, and refused to look through his telescope.
      </p>
      <p>At the Office of naval Research, it was first suggested that I
        see the national Inventor’s Council. This is a government agency
        set up for the primary purpose of serving as an alley into which
        to divert screwballs, crackpots, and assorted nuisances. It’s
        very effective; psychologically speaking, it has the stopping
        power of warm tar. It’s too soft to break, and too viscous to
        move. Remember the famous La Brea tar pits stopped mammoths,
        saber-toothed tigers, and practically everything else that lived
        a the time, You can still find embalmed there to this day. </p>
      <p>Instead, I went to the ONR department dedicated to evaluation
        of proposed inventions. </p>
      <p>I ran an editorial here recently about an ONR research report,
        pointing out that the fundamental attitude of the ONR was that
        theoretical understanding is absolutely necessary before any
        invention can be made. On direct contact with the ONR inventions
        evaluations department I found that philosophy dominates their
        evaluations. If the device or principle cannot be explained in
        full, clear, acceptable theoretical terms, why, under that
        philosophy, it doesn’t exist as an invention. </p>
      <p>A dog can’t explain the theoretical enzyme chemistry of
        digestion; therefore, clearly, a dog can’t digest anything. </p>
      <p>From the ONR representative to whom I spoke, I gathered that Mr
        Dean, when he had been told --- by letter --- in a kind but firm
        manner that his device was mathematically impossible, and that
        his explanations were unsound, had reacted somewhat irritatedly.
        This, of course, immediately prejudiced the ONR scientists
        against him. Clearly, if you tell a man he is wrong, and explain
        carefully the theoretical facts that prove his invention can’t
        exist, and he gets annoyed --- he having the working model
        sitting beside him at the time --- this proves that he really is
        wrong. </p>
      <p>There is a widely believed legend --- however it got started
        I’m sure I don’t know --- that only crackpots and fanatics get
        angry when they’re told they are wrong. </p>
      <p>It might be helpful if all science students were required to
        study, as part of their college indoctrination, the papers of
        Galileo and the Church Fathers who were kindly, but firmly
        correcting him. Also some of the choicer bits of Newton’s and
        Hooke’s remarks concerning the mental competence of their
        opposers. </p>
      <p>As I say, no one from either NASA, or ONR, or the Senate Space
        Committee bothered to look at the device. It was explained to me
        that they were all much too busy. </p>
      <p>Perhaps it is, actually, fortunate; a true space drive, as a
        national monopoly, might have precipitated the nuclear war. But
        if dean is right, the ONR, NASA, and the Senate Space Committee
        just cooperated in giving away the key to the Solar System…If
        not to the stars (Einstein’s work accepted the laws of
        conservation; if they are not valid, then perhaps the
        speed-of-light limitation isn’t either). </p>
      <p>The important point right now is this: No government agency
        knows anything at all about whether Dean’s device works. They
        think they do, on the basis of theory --- but there is plenty of
        reason to suspect that theory is as airtight as a slice of Swiss
        cheese. That it fits Reality the way plane geometry fits the
        earth’s surface --- only in local areas. </p>
      <p>Washington is a fascinating state of mind; it operates purely
        on the pain-avoidance principle. Animals operate on two
        fundamental drives --- pain-avoidance and pleasure-seeking. Each
        tempers the other; it’s a sort of two-party system. Thus a lion
        will attack a water buffalo, seeking the pleasure of a full
        meal, despite the fact that the buffalo is an enormously
        powerful and dangerous animal. The pain-avoidance drive is, in
        that situation, overcome, or at least greatly modified, by the
        pleasure-seeking drive, so that the lion will take the risk. </p>
      <p>In Washington, there is only the pain-avoidance drive. A
        bureaucrat who does exactly what his directives specifically
        require, and absolutely nothing else --- neither more nor less
        --- avoids the pain of being fired. You can’t fire him for
        failure to accomplish what might have been done; you can fire
        him only for not doing what his orders require. </p>
      <p>Since nobody in any government agency, had specific
        instructions ‘Investigate and evaluate the Dean drive’, no one
        can be fired for not doing what he was not specifically told to
        do. That means not-investigating it fulfills, 100 percent, the
        requirement of pain-avoidance. </p>
      <p>It’s very rarely indeed that someone in government can stick
        his neck out, and achieve something over and above his
        assignment. The last notable instance was Admiral Rickover’s
        remarkable achievement of forcing the navy into nuclear
        propulsion. As is now well known, he very nearly had his career
        crushed by the high-brass opposition; Congress saves his bacon,
        not a ‘grateful’ Navy. </p>
      <p>The best-known previous instance, of course, is that of Billy
        Mitchell --- who was court-martialled for proving he was right,
        against the orders of his superior officers. That time, Congress
        didn’t act. </p>
      <p>Our government has the interesting characteristic of holding
        --- with great determination --- that monopoly is an evil, and,
        through the Federal Trade Commission, enforcing competitive
        situations. But, of course, this doesn’t apply to them;
        government bureaus mustn’t be subjected to competition! </p>
      <p>Of course, congress and the Senate do have competition; the
        two-party system is the only method that seems to work. Animal
        life, in the course of the last four billion years, has tried a
        lot of systems --- but the two-party technique, known as
        bisexual reproduction, has overwhelmingly won the race. Male and
        female constitute the ‘loyal opposition’; they are absolutely
        forced to cooperate, if they want to continue their genetic
        existence, and yet are so constituted that they cannot possibly
        fall into identical viewpoints. A man can’t think like a woman,
        nor a woman like a man, no matter how desperately each wants to;
        they have to work out a binocular viewpoint that integrates two
        inherently different understandings. </p>
      <p>That is the only known, practical technique for assuring that
        orthodoxy won’t set in and crystallize. </p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter, for this point, whether Dean is right or
        wrong. It’s quite obvious that anyone who did present a true
        breakthrough concept in terms of a working space drive would be
        rejected in precisely the manner Dean has been, for precisely
        the reasons Dean has. </p>
      <p>They are precisely the reasons Galileo was rejected. </p>
      <p>An Orthodoxy isn’t something religious; it ‘s something
        associated with a True Faith, whether that faith refers to a
        religious concept, or a True Belief in certain Laws of nature. </p>
      <p>Now Mr Dean is an excellent and successful businessman; he has
        achieved considerable success financially in his own right. He’s
        got the money it takes to build expensive, carefully machined
        test models --- and anyone who thinks that’s a small-time hobby
        has never hired a machine shop to do work for him. Models are
        expensive; just from looking at the photographs of Dean’s
        ex-models --- the ones that had to be tested to destruction to
        obtain engineering data, since no modern mathematical technique
        can handle the problem --- I’d make a wild guesstimate that they
        must have cost him in the neighborhood of $100,000. </p>
      <p>No, they’re not big. But a self-lifting job requires six
        rotor-pairs, with the associated driving gearing, commutators,
        etc. Try building a little six-cylinder gasoline engine by hand,
        and see what it costs --- say just duplicate the little Ford
        Falcon engine in a commercial machine shop. The complete Falcon
        costs about $2000; think you could hand-tool the engine alone
        for even twice that? </p>
      <p>Dean --- or anyone with a breakthrough idea --- will be stopped
        by the Orthodoxy effect.&nbsp; But someone like Dean, who is
        also a darned sight more successful businessman than top-notch
        physicists --- remember that Einstein had to have help in
        working out his income tax? --- has economic resources by which
        he could force a way through to test his ideas. (I’ve heard,
        since, from four other men who had ideas closely paralleling
        Dean’s but didn’t have the money to build and test models). As
        Dean said, ‘If they continue to refuse to pay attention, I can,
        and will, build a full-scale vehicle, and hover over Washington
        until they do’. </p>
      <p>(Side comment on that: he’ll probably be forced down, and
        arrested for violating a restricted air space, while his vehicle
        is impounded where no one can get at it. If he goes up to an
        altitude where they can’t see him, they won’t mind; who’ll see
        it 100 miles up? </p>
      <p>Now what Dean has, is not anti-gravity; it’s a drive. </p>
      <p>Anyone here want to make any large-size bets that the secret of
        anti-gravity hasn’t already been cracked by some backwoods
        unorthodox amateur --- who isn’t, as Dean is, a highly competent
        business man as well? How many individuals can afford $100,000
        worth of private test-model building? </p>
      <p>There are other fields of science where things are under even
        ‘better’ monopoly control; the physical scientists do not very
        frequently run onto a brilliant amateur with more money than
        they have. But the medical society has things sewed up even
        tighter; the brilliant amateur with money can be stopped legally
        from demonstrating his achievement. </p>
      <p>Russia has out-achieved the United States so far in the
        development of new techniques. Furiously as the
        intellectual-scientists despise the system whereby politicians
        can legislate for or against scientific beliefs --- the Lysenko
        controversy, for example --- the wry fact is that it has
        produced some results. It took action by Congress to get Admiral
        Rickover off the hook; the problem of whether or not nuclear
        propulsion should be used in the navy was a technical-scientific
        problem --- and it was resolved in favor of the United States
        only by legislative action. </p>
      <p>The probability that ONR or NASA will, at this late date,
        willingly accept the Dean device for actual test and study, is
        vanishingly small. If they do so, it will constitute an
        admission that it merits testing --- and, of course, it is then
        acknowledged that it should have been tested in the summer of
        1956. (NASA is off that hook, of course; they didn’t exist in
        1956. But they have been around for some time now --- and
        existed before the patent was publicly issued) </p>
      <p>Again, it’s going to take a legislative act, not a scientific
        act, to get the device tested. The scientific groups are forced
        to maintain ‘Testing is not, and never was, within the limits of
        our directive; you can’t say we’re responsible for trying it’. </p>
      <p>Because Russia’s scientific system is new --- effectively only
        about 20 years old --- it hasn’t had time to establish a solid
        orthodoxy. Therefore it gets nudged --- but good and solidly!
        --- every so often, and gets things done, however unhappily. </p>
      <p>We don’t. Our satellite program, for instance, the Vanguard
        Project, not only turned out to be a ‘Me Too’ project --- it
        never did succeed in doing what the Navy said they were going to
        do. Not one full-scale Vanguard satellite was put up in orbit
        during the International Geophysical year; they never did
        accomplish what they had loudly and publicly stated they would
        do. </p>
      <p>We got satellites up only after public and legislative --- not
        scientific! --- howls of anger at Russia’s success. </p>
      <p>But this time I think the Orthodox Science system has flopped
        so egregiously --- pulled so screaming a boner --- that
        something may be done. </p>
      <p>By sheer Orthodoxy refusal to consider the possibility that
        their theory might be inadequate --- they never found out about
        the Dean drive. </p>
      <p>Our cover shows what could have been done --- and still can be
        done, for that matter. </p>
      <p>A modern nuclear-powered submarine needs only relatively minor
        adaptations to make an ideal spaceship; it has everything it
        needs, save for the space drive. </p>
      <p>The Dean drive requires a rotary shaft drive; our nuclear
        submarines turn nuclear energy into heat, produce steam, drive a
        turbine, and generate electric power. Electric power is perfect
        for running the Dean drive. </p>
      <p>The modern submarines are --- we have learned from past sad
        experience --- equipped with lifting eyes so that, in event of
        accidental collision, quick salvage is possible. Pontoons can be
        towed in place, sunk beside the ship, and hitched to the
        built-in lifting eyes, and the ship refloated. The eyes are, of
        course, designed into the ship so that the structure can be
        lifted by those eyes without structural damage to the hull. </p>
      <p>Dean drive units could be attached directly to the existent
        eyes. </p>
      <p>The pressure hull of modern submarines is designed to resist at
        least 600 feet of water pressure; its actual thickness is a
        piece of classified data, of course, but we can guesstimate it
        must be at least 4 inches thick. After the second Bikini bomb
        test, the old submarine Skate was still in pretty fair
        condition; the light-metal streamlining hull looked like the
        remains of an airliner crash, but the pressure hull was
        perfectly intact. Stout stuff, a sub’s pressure hull. </p>
      <p>And very fine stuff indeed as protection against the average
        meteor; the light streamlining hull would stop the micrometeors,
        of course. </p>
      <p>Not even 4 feet of steel would stop primary cosmic rays, of
        course… but those inches of armor steel would have considerable
        damping effect on the Van Allen radiation belt effects. </p>
      <p>The nuclear subs have already been tested with full crews for
        30 continuous days out of contact with Earth’s atmosphere; their
        air-recycling equipment is already in place, and functions
        perfectly. What difference if the ‘out of contact’ situation
        involves submersion in water, instead of out in space? </p>
      <p>The modern nuclear submarine is, in fact, a fully competent
        space-vehicle, lacking only the Dean drive. </p>
      <p>With the Dean drive, the ship, if it can lift off the Earth at
        all, can generate a one-G vertical acceleration. Since that
        acceleration is being generated by engines capable of continuous
        operation for months --- if not years --- at a time, the
        acceleration can simply be maintained for the entire run; there
        would be no period of free-fall for the ship or crew. Therefore
        the present ship structure, equipment, and auxiliary designs
        would be entirely satisfactory. Also, a sub has various plumbing
        devices with built-in locks so the equipment can be used under
        conditions where the external pressure is widely different from
        the internal. </p>
      <p>In flight, the ship would simply lift out of the sea, rise
        vertically, maintaining a constant 1000 cm/sec drive. Halfway to
        Mars, it would loop its course, and decelerate the rest of the
        way at the same rate. To the passengers, and to the equipment on
        board, there would be no free-flight problems. </p>
      <p>There is one factor that has to be taken in to account,
        however; the exhaust steam from the turbine has to be
        recondensed and returned to the boiler. In the sea, seawater is
        used to cool the condenser; in space, the cold vacuum would do
        the job. </p>
      <p>The tough part would be the first 100 miles up from the Earth;
        ice could be used. </p>
      <p>As a crash program, this could have been done --- if work
        started when Dean first applied for his patent --- in 15 months.
        The application went in in July 1956; 15 months later would have
        been October 1957. </p>
      <p>Under the acceleration conditions described above, a ship can
        make the trip from Earth to mars, when Mars is closest, in less
        than three days. And even when Mars is at its farthest possible
        point, on the far side of the Sun, the trip would only take 5
        days. </p>
      <p>It would have been nice if, in response to Sputnik I, the US
        had been able to release full photographic evidence of Mars Base
        I. </p>
      <p>I do not insist that I am incontrovertibly right, but it is my
        opinion --- based on observational data that the US government
        has avoided acquiring --- that we actually had everything
        necessary to do just that. We certainly had the nuclear subs to
        use --- and I believe the Dean drive can do it. </p>
      <p>Even more important, now that we’ve given away the Solar
        System, is the fact that the fundamental principle underlying
        Dean’s device is fundamental. It’s not just the key to a space
        drive; the principle of simultaneous multiple relationships is
        enormously broader than that. </p>
      <p>The psychologists have complained that there was no
        mathematical technique for their work. Quite so; they too,
        obviously need a math capable of expressing multiple
        simultaneous relationships. </p>
      <p>No electronic device can recognize a pattern; that’s why no
        machine can be made to recognize words spoken by widely varying
        voices. A pattern exists where there is multiple simultaneous
        relationship. </p>
      <p>It is the inherent nature of any orthodoxy to freeze at the
        level it has achieved, developing only the ramifications and
        details of that level. The dinosaurs developed a million
        variations on the theme dinosaurism… but none of those
        variations was mammalianism. </p>
      <p>The question really is: How can orthodoxy in Science be ended?
        Of course, we can have acts of legislative bodies impose new
        ideas by fiat --- the system we’ve been using recently, and that
        the Soviets use. It isn’t good; it’s just better than none. </p>
      <p>Life forms solved it quite some megayears ago; they use the
        two-party system. We’ve found that works in political systems,
        and in religious systems. (Religion hasn’t been harmed by having
        Catholic and Protestant Christian churches, though it took some
        bloodshed and Violence to put over the idea) </p>
      <p>Perhaps we could make a lot better and faster progress if
        Science and Engineering were recognized and established as
        distinct, and --- by legislative fiat at first --- made two
        separate and distinct parties. Who can better criticize a
        Scientist’s theory, than an Engineer who tries to make the thing
        work? And who can better criticize an Engineer’s efficiency than
        a Scientist, who analyzes with exact precision what it is the
        Engineer is really doing --- and not what he thinks he’s doing?
      </p>
      <p>The scientists, in Edison’s day, had mathematical proof that
        the maximum possible efficiency of an electric generator was 50
        percent. They still had the mathematics after Edison started
        manufacturing 98 percent efficient generators. </p>
      <p>You know, there’s nothing like a good Republican to spot a
        Democratic grafter --- or a good Democrat to expose the
        incompetence of a Republican. And everybody benefits except the
        incompetent and dishonest individuals. </p>
      <p>Look, don’t we believe in the fundamental validity of two-party
        competition? Then what’s wrong with a two-party Science, to
        permanently terminate the freeze effect of orthodoxy? </p>
