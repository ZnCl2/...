          <p><b>11 May 1965</b> </p>
          <p><b>( Cl. 74-61 )</b> </p>
          <p><b><font size="+1">Variable Oscillator System</font></b></p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This invention relates to a method
          and an apparatus for producing harmonic motion or
          reciprocation, the amplitude and period of which may be
          cyclically varies for various purposes related to either
          particular output displacement requirements or variable output
          force requirements. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is therefore a primary object of
          the present invention, to provide a new and useful mechanical
          movement capable of producing an oscillatory or reciprocatory
          output from a rotary input at a constant angular speed, the
          output motion being cyclically controlled both as to amplitude
          and period so as to control the cyclical duration of
          transmitted forces for various purposes. The nature of the
          output motion and the manner in which it is achieved,
          therefore represents a novel departure from mechanical
          movements heretofore devised. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Another object of the present
          invention is to provide a system for producing controlled
          harmonic motion without the use of fixed motion constraining
          linkages that have heretofore rendered rotating mechanical
          systems of the type involved unable to efficiently utilize or
          control accelerating forces generated as a result of relative
          movement of the parts of the rotating system. Accordingly, the
          system of the present invention produces reciprocatory
          movement without relying upon the constant force transmitting
          linkages in which high accelerating forces are generated as a
          result of rotation imparted thereto by a rotatable input. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The system of the present invention
          therefore, involves rotation of an eccentrically weighted
          rotor that is mounted on a slide member so as to induce
          harmonic reciprocation of the slide member in response to
          rotation of the rotor without any fixed linkage connection
          between the slide member and the frame which constrains
          movement of the slide member to slidable movement in one
          plane. In order to control and cyclically maintain the
          harmonic reciprocation so induced, a rotor displacing cam is
          engagable with the rotor assembly for engaging a point thereon
          at which no linear acceleration occurs in the direction of
          translation under conditions of continuous harmonic motin as
          induced by rotation of the rotor. As a result thereof, the
          center of motion with respect to which harmonic
          reciprocation&nbsp; occurs, may be cyclically shifted in order
          to vary the locus of the slide translation. The mechanism also
          includes means to cyclically limit the amplitude of slide
          reciprocation for a predetermined period during each cycle of
          reciprocation. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">These together with other objects
          and advantages which will become subsequently apparent reside
          in the details of construction and operation as more fully
          hereinafter described and claimed, reference being has to the
          accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like
          numerals refer to like parts throughout, and in which: </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring to the drawings in
          detail, one form of mechanism generally referred to by
          reference numeral 10 is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The
          mechanism 10 includes a casing or frame 12 for the device
          which may include a lid portion 14 secured thereto for
          supporting certain of the parts. It will be appreciated,
          however, that any suitable frame construction may be utilized
          for housing the relatively moving parts and/or for proper
          support thereof in accordance with the principles of the
          present invention. Securely mounted within the frame casing 12
          by means of a plurality of fastener elements 16, is a slide
          supporting plate member 18. The slide supporting member
          therefore includes a slot 20 for receiving therewithin a slide
          assembly 22 thereby constrained to reciprocatory movement with
          respect to the frame 12. An output member 24 may therefore be
          secured to the slide assembly 22 for the purpose of
          transmitting reciprocatory movement of the slide assembly 22
          to some device to be driven externally of the frame 12.
          Accordingly suitable guides are provided in the frame for the
          output member 24. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Rotatably mounted on the slide
          assembly 22, is a rotor assembly generally referred to by
          reference numerals 26. the rotor assembly 26 includes an arm
          28 rotatably mounted about an axis affixed to the slide
          assembly 22 by means of a bearing assembly 30. Accordingly,
          the arm 28 is connected to a hub portion 32 which is connected
          to a shaft journalled in the bearing assembly 30 and by means
          of which rotation is imparted to the arm member 28. Connected
          to the radially outer end of the arm 28, is an eccentric mass
          or weight member 34 by virtue of which accelerating forces or
          centrifugal forces are developed in the rotor assembly 26 in
          response to rotation thereof, so as to induce harmonic motion
          in the slide assembly 22 mounting the rotor assembly. The
          harmonic motion so induced will therefore depend on the value
          of the eccentric mass 34, and its radial distance from the
          rotor axis passing through the bearing assembly 30 if no
          mechanical restraint is imposed upon the side assembly 22
          other than its guided mounting in the support plate 18. A
          retaining plate member 36 is secured is secured to the support
          plate member 18 in order to confine reciprocatory movement of
          the slide assembly 22 to a single plane with respect to the
          frame casing 12. Located between the rotational axis of the
          rotor assembly 26, and the center of mass thereof, will be an
          equilibrium point at which no linear acceleration in the
          direction of slide translation exists because of the
          simultaneous rotational movement of the arm 28 and
          reciprocatory movement of the slide assembly 22 mounting the
          rotating arm. At this point, a cam follower element or
          projection 38 is mounted for engagement by a displacing cam
          assembly 40. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The cam assembly 40 includes a hub
          portion 42 connected to a cam shaft 44 rotatably mounted by a
          bearing assembly 46 affixed to the frame by means of the
          housing lid 14. The cam surface 48 is profiled for engagement
          with the cam follower 38 a portion of an operative cycle so as
          to displace the rotating arm 28 and thereby the slide assembly
          22 in a predetermined phase relationship to the harmonic
          motion induced therein in order to shift the center of motion
          or the center of the reciprocatory stroke associated with said
          harmonic motion as will be hereinafter explained. The support
          member 18 also rotatably mounts a bearing assembly 50 so as to
          define a cam shaft axis with respect to the frame 12 about
          which the second cam shaft 52 is rotatable. Connected to the
          cam shaft 52 is the hub portion 54 of a segmental cam element
          56 which constitutes an amplitude control element limiting
          movement of the slide assembly 22 for a predetermined period
          during each cycle. Accordingly, an opening 58 is formed in the
          support member 18 for accommodating rotational movement of the
          segmental cam element 56 across one end of the guide slot 20
          into the path that may otherwise be assumed by the slide
          assembly 22 in the absence thereof. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring now to Figures 2 and 4 in
          particular, an input drive assembly generally referred to by
          reference numeral 60 is illustrated whereby the slide assembly
          40 and amplitude control device 56 are all drivingly
          interconnected for operation in proper phase relationship to
          each other. An input motor or prime mover 62 is therefore
          securely fastened to the frame by means of the support plate
          member 18 and suspended therebelow in any convenient manner.
          The prime mover 62 may take any suitable form and is capable
          of imparting a constant rotational speed to the drive shaft 64
          suitably journalled by bearing assemblies 66 and 68 supported
          below the support plate member 18. Affixed to the drive shaft
          64 are a pair of bevel gears 70 and 72 respectively meshing
          with bevel gears 74 and 76 to impart rotation to shaft 78 and
          52. The shaft 78 is drivingly connected by meshing gears 80
          and 82 to a shaft 84 which in turn is drivingly connected by
          gears 86 and 88 to the cam shaft 44 for imparting rotational
          movement to the cam assembly 40. Slidably mounted by means of
          splines 90 on the drive shaft 64, is a gear assembly 92 which
          meshes with a gear element 94 connected to the rotor assembly
          30 for slidable displacement with the slide assembly 22.
          Accordingly, the sliding gear assembly 92 is rotatably and
          slidably mounted on shaft 90 about an axis perpendicular to
          the axis of the shaft 96 by means of the bracket 98. the drive
          shaft 64 will therefore impart rotation to the rotor shaft 96
          at the same predetermined constant angular speed without
          imposing any restraint upon the slidable displacement of the
          slide assembly 22. the drive shaft 64 will also impart
          constant rotational speed to the displacing cam assembly 40
          and the amplitude control element 56 which are rotatably
          mounted about axes fixed to the frame 12. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring now to Figure 5, it will
          be observed that the slide assembly 22 and the rotor assembly
          mounted thereon are kinematically represented in some unknown
          phase position with the rotor arm rotating at its constant
          angular speed (<i>w</i>) in a clockwise direction as the slide
          assembly 22 is moving with harmonic motion in a leftward
          direction of translation along the path or slide axis
          represented by the X axis. Accordingly, the rotor axis of the
          slide assembly 22 represented by point S, is shown displaced
          from the center (O) of harmonic motion for the slide assembly
          by an amount x as the rotor arm 28 is angularly displaced from
          the X axis by an angle (<i>O</i>). As hereinbefore mentioned,
          the equilibrium point E on the rotor arm 28 will be that point
          at which no lionear acceleration exists in the direction of
          the X axis when the cam 40 is engaging the rotor arm 28
          because of the combined movement of the rotor arm with respect
          to the rotor axis and the displacement of the rotor axis with
          the slide assembly 22. Inasmuch as the point E is being
          rotated with respect to the point S at a constant speed (w),
          it will be accelerated radially inwardly with respect to the
          moving point S by an amount A<sub>r</sub> = ew<sup>2</sup>.
          The linear component A<sub>x</sub> of this radial accelration
          A<sub>1</sub> of point E along the X axis, will therefore be A<sub>x</sub>
          = ew<sup>2&nbsp; </sup>cos <i><strike>O</strike></i> .
          Accordingly an equal and opposite or deceleration
          (acceleration opposite in direction to movement) must be
          imposed upon the slide assembly 22 along the X axis at point S
          in view of the equilibrium conditions at point E
          aforementioned. This deceleration A<sub>x</sub> is always
          opposite to the direction of slide translation inasmuch as the
          velocity of the slide assembly or point S is reduced to zero
          as it approaches the end of the reciprocatory stroke of the
          slide assmebly. Since </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="3182form.jpg"
            height="555" width="314"></p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">in order to displace the center of
          harmonic motion of the slide assembly 22 without linear
          acceleration thereof along the slide axis so as to avoid
          disturbing the harmonic motion induced along said slide axis
          by rotation of the arm 28 at a constant angular speed (<i>w</i>).








          During each operative cycle when the rotor is at a phase
          position where <i>O</i> = 0, the cam 40 leaves contact with
          the rotor arm and the center of harmonic motion will be
          displaced from its initial location at O, to a location at O'
          as represented in Figure 5 equal to an amount </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">( - k / 2w ) </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">the negative sign indicating the
          displacement of the motion center in a forward direction for
          example opposite to the slide movement to point O'. The
          amplitude limiting cam 56 is then operative to engage the
          slide assembly 22 as the displacing cam 40 leaves contact
          occurring before the end of the slide stroke. The motion
          center for the slide assembly will therefore be shifted back
          to its original position O upon the frame so that its
          reciprocation stroke may be completed under inducement of the
          rotor movement. Also, when shifted back to the original
          position, contact of the rotor arm by the displacing cam 40
          may be reestablished in order to begin a new cycle of
          operation. The amplitude limiting cam may therefore be
          profiled and phased so as to constrain movement of the slide
          assembly, during a portion of its reciprocation cycle in one
          direction to thereby transfer to the frame those accelerating
          forces that would otherwise produce movement of the slide
          assembly during the latter portion of the reciprocatory cycle,
          and without disturbing the harmonic movement of the slide
          during the remainder of the cycle. It will therefore be
          apparent, that the rotating parts of the device may be
          designed in accordance with the foregoing principles and
          indicated relationships to achieve controlled harmonic
          movement modified by a cyclic shift in the motion center
          without the use of the usual motion constraining linkages so
          as to directly transfer additional predetermined forces to the
          frame during the poriton of the cycle predetermined by the cam
          56. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The amount of the shift of the
          center of harmonic motion and the stroke of the slide assembly
          with respect to the frame may be varied. This may be
          accomplished by varying the stroke and phasing of the
          displacing cam and amplitude limiting cam so as to shift the
          harmonic motion center within the restriction of the
          aforementioned formulae. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">From the foregoing description, it
          will be appreciated that the system will theoretically operate
          when the effect of dynamic unbalance on the frame is neglected
          as well as frictional forces that may modify the motion
          imparted to the slide assembly 22. To compensate for dynamic
          unbalance effects on the frame, the rotor assembly may be
          modified as illsutrated in Figures 6, 7, and 8, In the
          modified form of the device, the rotor assembly 100 is mounted
          on the slide assembly 102 by means of a laterally projecting
          member 104 affixed thereto and disposed perpendicular to the
          guide slot 106 constraining reciprocatory movement of the
          slide assembly 102 with respect to the frame 12. Adjacent
          opposite ends of the member 104, are mounted a pair of rotor
          shafts 108 carrying therewith eccentric mass elements 110. The
          eccentric elements are respectively connected to intermeshing
          gear elements 112 whereby the elements 110 rotate at the same
          speed but in opposite rotational directions. Accordingly, the
          dynamc unbalance effects of one rotor element will be
          counterbalanced by the effects of the other rotor element
          during each cycle of operation. Accordingly, each of the
          eccentric rotor elements 110 has a cam projection 114 affixed
          thereto and located at the point of equilibrium for
          cooperation with two separate displacing cam assemblies in a
          manner similar to that described with respect to Figures 1-4.
          Accordingly, an input drive assembly will also be provided
          similar to that described with respect to Figures 1-4. Also,
          an amplitude control device dimilar to the segmental cam
          eleement 56 will be provided in connection with this latter
          form of the device. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It will also be appreciated, that
          other but equivalent amplitude control devices may be utilized
          in place of the segmental cam element 56 such as controlled
          clutch or restricting devices operative to restrict movement
          of the slide assembly in one direction during a predetermined
          portion of the cycle while releasing it for movement in the
          other direction under the inducement of the rotor assembly and
          the displacing cam assembly. Such clutch or restricting
          devices may therefore be attached to the frame or the slide
          assembly. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">From the foregoing description,
          operation and utility of the variable oscillatory device will
          be apparent. It will be therefore appreciated that the system
          of the present invention involves the conversion of a constant
          rotational input into an oscillatory output movement wherein
          the output movement is produced with respect to a shifting
          center of motion. As a result thereof, the output movement may
          be controlled in accordance with special displacement and/or
          force requirements. It will also be appreciated, that the
          variable output motion is achieved in a novel manner without
          the constant linkage conenction and/or force transmission
          ordinarily associated with devices of this type. Accordingly,
          a novel and purposeful departure in the transmission of forces
          is achieved because of the described kinematic relationships
          which govern operation of the mechanical system. It will be
          appreciated of course, that the system while described in
          terms of specific but exemplary mechanical components, is not
          confined to such specific components or methods. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The foregoing is considered as
          illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further,
          since numerous modification and changes will readily occur to
          those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the
          invention to the exact construction and operation shown and
          described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and
          equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of
