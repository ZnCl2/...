      Mr. Bedini suggests these experiments:<br>
      <br>
      Purchase two identical music CDs. Listen to both to verify that
      they are identical. Now let the "scalar beam" play all over the
      surface of one of the CDs for about one minute. You may want to
      build a simple rotating platform to make this process more
      convenient. Now play the two CDs and compare them again. Hear any
      difference? (Note, this process is patent pending, so do not use
      it for any other purpose except to demonstrate the reality of the
      effect)<br>
      <br>
      Connect a small probe-coil to an oscilloscope, then move it around
      in the beam and observe the waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      Taste some wine, then put it in a small airtight container and
      place it against the magnet face for a few (minutes? hours?) Taste
      it again.&nbsp; Improvements?&nbsp;&nbsp; Try it with and without
      the power supply connected to verify that any changes are caused
      by the scalar beam and by just the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      FROM :&nbsp; Some tests I intend to try (but as yet have not!):<br>
      <br>
      Place various foodstuffs in the beam then compare flavor with
      untreated samples. <br>
      <br>
      Grow two collections of plants, water one with normal water, water
      the other with water that's been treated by several
      minutes??hours?? exposure to the beam.&nbsp; As a control, use
      water which was held nearby identical magnets but without the
      coil.<br>
      <br>
      Aim the beam directly at a plant for many days, compare it with
      another untreated plant as a control.&nbsp; (Shield the magnet, or
      place a similar magnet-block near the control plant.)<br>
      <br>
      Sprout two groups of seeds, one treated and one untreated, and
      look for differences in number, health, growth rate, etc., between
      the two groups.<br>
      <br>
      Measure the growth of the tip of a plant stem by using a tiny
      lever,&nbsp; mirror, and laser beam.&nbsp; Graph the growth rate,
      then treat the plant with the scalar beam and look for changes in
      the growth rate. (Note that this method can also be used to
      observe plants' realtime response to numerous stimuli both
      conventional and "weird."&nbsp; Fertilizer? Light? Music?
      Magnetism? Pyramids? Good/Bad thoughts?)<br>
      <br>
      Observe microscopic lifeforms in pond water, then expose them to
      the beam and see if their behavior changes while it is
      operating.&nbsp; Or, expose the water to the beam for several
      minutes??hours??, then compare the number and activity of
      lifeforms in the water with an untreated bottle. Or, compare the
      effects of adding treated or untreated water to the slide under
      the microscope.<br>
      <br>
      Use an opamp buffer and an audio amplifier to listen to the noise
      output of a capacitor which is shielded in a thick copper box, (or
      does a resistor or transistor work better?) then aim the beam at
      the box and listen for signals, or monitor changes to component
      values. See: http://amasci.com/freenrg/grav3.txt, Hodowanec's
      capacitor-based gravity detector, for more info.<br>

          electronic relaxation noise present information recording

        <b>US5487057</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method and apparatus is provided for reducing relaxation noise
      in a conducting medium. The device is fabricated by affixing two
      magnets at like, repelling poles; wrapping said magnets with a
      coil of wire in an orientation orthogonal to the interface between
      the joined magnets and the like poles of the magnets to form a
      magnetic unit; connecting said coil to a motor means, an
      electrical power supply means and a switch means; attaching a
      spindle to said motor means. The spindle receives said conducting
      medium. The apparatus can be in a housing. The conducting medium
      is placed on said spindle. By activating the device, a modulated
      magnetic electromagnetic field is created simultaneous to the
      spinning of the conducting medium. The information recording
      medium rotates through the modulated electromagnetic field,
      thereby reducing the relaxation noise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to the general field of playback of recorded
      conducting media or conductors, more specifically, an apparatus
      and method that reduces electronic relaxation noise, also known as
      "linger noise", that exists in information recording medium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of Related Art and Information</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The utility of the present invention is based on fundamental laws
      of nuclear and electronic physics at the electron level,
      particularly with respect to electron gas relaxation phenomena in
      conductors immediately preceding the initiation of normal current
      flow per ohms law.<br>
      <br>
      For current to flow through a medium conductor or a conducting
      plate (conductor) that involves electromagnetic (EM) effects in
      recording and playback, and in transmission of signals, and thus
      to provide signals through normal circuitry, conducting plates,
      etc., a finite time is required before the flow is established,
      and before stability, referred to as a "stable signal" or stable
      flow pattern, can be established. This time delay is referred to
      as electron gas relaxation time.<br>
      <br>
      The relaxation phenomenon involves at least three major stages,
      all of which must be substantially completed before the relaxation
      time is actually complete, and coherent signals or patterns are
      being transmitted in the conductor. Further, the relaxation time
      involves damped oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      The first stage in the relaxation time is the relaxation of the
      electrical charge density. Electrons initially distributed
      throughout the conductor are "excited" by taking on excess energy
      in the form of potential gradients across them. They are now
      substantially involved in working their way to the surface, since
      most of the current flow must occur on the surface of the
      conductor, not in its interior. If the total charge is not zero, a
      very highly non-linear first phase results, and the division
      between first and second stages is substantially blurred.<br>
      <br>
      A simplifying assumption is made, that the initial charge is zero,
      so that the compensated charge fluctuations may be described by
      linear equations. Then the relaxation of electrical charge density
      can be assumed to be mostly independent of the initial conditions
      and of the size and shape of the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      Treating the Drude electron gas model as applicable, and assuming
      each electron is independent of the rest, damped harmonic
      oscillator equations result for the relaxation. This yields a
      short relaxation time for stage 1. This erroneously short
      relaxation time basically results from assuming that the electrons
      move rather independently and are de-coupled. With coupling
      remaining as is almost always the case, a combination of stage 1
      and stage 2 actually applies immediately, and sometimes an extra
      combination of stage 3 as well Much "noise" known as small field
      perturbations in random directions, is present during phase 1.
      This is because of the random motion of the electrons in all
      directions, as the addition of the excess energy to them
      essentially results in an increase in the average electron's
      kinetic energy and increases the violence and frequency of their
      collisions with the lattice and with each other.<br>
      <br>
      The second stage is the expulsion of the electric and magnetic
      fields to the exterior of the conductor, and the expulsion of the
      excited electrons as axial currents (on the average) to the
      surface. This electron movement during the second stage is still
      immersed in the midst of a great collision/violence among the
      electrons in the electron gas in the conductor. Accordingly, there
      are erratic electric and magnetic fields from the erratically
      moving charges, whose violent movements are, in fact, expelling
      these fields from the conductor and in all directions in the
      conductor. Consequently, there is much noise, distortion and
      scattering going on in this stage.<br>
      <br>
      In the third stage, the electrons reach the skin of the conductor,
      resulting in a marked decrease in collision frequency and
      violence. The relaxation process terminates with the slower ohmic
      and radiative damping of the surface currents.<br>
      <br>
      As an end result of the three relaxation stages, a sinusoidal
      charge disturbance is formed and propagated in the conductor with
      a phase velocity Vp of roughly 1.times.10@8 cm/sec, or roughly
      10@6 meters per second. Further, this disturbance is extremely
      noisy. It is also moving far slower than the speed of light, hence
      "lingers" in a circuit after each and every stimulation, directly
      adding noise to slightly succeeding "signal stimuli." The "signal"
      moves down the conductor at nearly C, the velocity of light in
      space.<br>
      <br>
      The net result in a continual digital process is that the 3-stage
      relaxation phenomena continually generates lingering noise signals
      in a circuit. This noise is continually produced both when signals
      are initially recorded on a conductor, increasing the noise in the
      signal actually recorded, and again when the conducting medium is
      later optically re-stimulated to detect the recorded "signal and
      noise". Examples of conducting media are audio compact disc,
      CD-ROM (read only memory), video laser disc, photo-CD and
      photgraphic film. The net result is that continual relaxation
      noise is added to both the recording and playback stages of any
      recording process utilizing such a conducting medium. Relaxation
      noise is also added to any signal translated down or in a
      conductor and through circuits.<br>
      <br>
      In searching prior art that disclosed magnetic and/or modulated EM
      devices designed for processing or clarifying conducting media for
      the purpose of reducing relaxation noise, no references were
      located that either disclosed or anticipated the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      The device is a housed magnetic unit that, when electrically
      activated by a switch and motor means, creates a modulated EM beam
      or field that dampens and reduces electron relaxation or linger
      noise in a recorded conducting medium as the conducting medium
      passes through the EM field.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The method and apparatus or device of the present invention is
      discussed hereinafter in terms of 3-stage relaxation noise
      actually introduced to all signal conducting media by the
      recording process, and again introduced in the playback from such
      recorded conducting media.<br>
      <br>
      First, the sharp distinction between the first and second
      relaxation stages is removed. The moment the charges present in
      the electron gas in a conductor are excited with excess energy
      from the leading part of the incoming signal stimulus, excess
      fields exist on the electrons, directly combining with the E- and
      B-fields already in existence. Consequently, stages 1 and 2 are
      considered combined. In other words, even in stage one, a strong
      component of the excited fields is attempting to axially eject or
      expel electrons from the conductor, while other strong fields
      oriented within the conductor are affecting the entire electron
      gas, increasing its collision frequency and noise. Axially, there
      is less collision damping, so on the average an axial movement
      toward the surface results. Axial expulsion is a radial effect.<br>
      <br>
      Next is the effect of an additional magnetic field from an
      external magnetic pole, which is what the present invention
      provides. The magnetic pole, for example, may be fairly localized
      in the case of recording signals and replaying signals, or it may
      be distributed in a "cover" or "blanket" covering the outside
      surface of the conductor. In the case of flat conducting plates,
      the blanket may cover both sides.<br>
      <br>
      When any field element attempts to emerge from the conductor, or
      can be decomposed into longitudinal and axial components where the
      axial component attempts to emerge, it is directly coupled to one
      or more axially (on the average) moving electrons within the
      plate, which constitutes the source or sources of the fields. The
      source electrons are also attempting to move to the surface
      themselves. However, the strength of the electron-associated
      magnetic field will be altered, affected and resisted by the
      externally introduced modulated EM field of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The net effect of the magnetic field, as produced by the present
      invention, is to induce damping and "magnetic braking" of the
      electrons and damping of their fields. In addition, a moving
      electron in a magnetic field is forced to turn away from its path,
      again increasing damping. In the externally introduced modulated
      EM field of the present device, the axially (on the average)
      moving electron is forced to develop an electric field gradient at
      right angles to its (on the average) axial movement, and "back
      against" the "linger noise" stimulus. In short, the electron
      develops a "back EMF" from all of the other electrons in the gas,
      which resist its movement and damp it. This dampens the electron's
      axial component, consequently its movement and concomitant
      relaxation "stage 1" and "stage 2" noise, resulting in a
      materially reduced relaxation noise.<br>
      <br>
      The result of the use of the present invention, is that as the
      electrons continue to violently alter their directions due to
      collisions, they are continually damped by the modulated EM field
      created by the device. Consequently, the erratic movement of the
      electrons are constrained, their velocities are lowered, their
      collision frequency is diminished, and relaxation noise is
      reduced, compared to the situation where no external EM field is
      present. The net result is a reduction of relaxation or linger
      noise resulting in clarifying of audio and/or visual signals from
      the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      When the external modulated EM field of the present invention
      crosses the relaxation excitation E-fields of the conductor,
      longitudinal components on the electrons, in either direction, are
      produced which contribute to the overall damping. The fundamental
      principle is that, as the electrons increase their kinetic energy
      during stage 1 and stage 2 of the relaxation time, that increase
      is being resisted by a magnetic braking/damping effect, and the
      axial ejection and noise components that continually develop are
      damped by the introduced EM field.<br>
      <br>
      This results in a reduction in the production of both immediate
      and linger noise. It is the mirror symmetry of the "magnetic
      brake" effect. The excited electrons try to move faster, in effect
      creating "eddy currents" in the conductor. Moving in the fixed
      magnet's modulated EM field, these "eddy currents" exert a
      magnetic repulsion force upon the magnetic pole, which in turn
      exerts a braking effect back upon the "eddy currents" themselves.
      This latter effect constitutes noise reduction in the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      The end total result of the use of the device of the present
      device is:<br>
      <br>
      1. Reduction of the velocity and kinetic energy of the electrons
      during coupled phase 1 and phase 2;<br>
      <br>
      2. introduction of substantial additional damping upon the
      harmonic damped-oscillation relaxation noise that results in
      phases 1, 2 and 3,; and<br>
      <br>
      3. substantial reduction of the overall relaxation noise in the
      system, in the resulting conducting medium, and in the resulting
      playback from the conducting medium.<br>
      <br>
      The device directly reduces the relaxation noise in all conducting
      media which involve EM effects in recording and playback, and in
      transmission of signals. In any operating system, whether
      recording or playback as such is being performed or not, the
      present device directly reduces the continuously-forming
      "lingering relaxation noise" from signals that have previously
      occurred, and that are actually slower-moving charge disturbances
      constituting relaxation noise in the system's operation. The
      relaxation noise is also a power loss from the signal. Reduction
      of the signal power being lost in the system constitutes effective
      enhancement of the noise-free power transmitted by the system.<br>
      <br>
      Application of the device increases the signal-to-noise ratio by
      dramatically reducing the lingering relaxation noise that is
      continually produced in: 1) systems operation; 2) the conducting
      medium; and 3) detection, amplification, and playback from the
      conducting medium. Media conductors or conducting plates that the
      apparatus may be applied to are audio compact discs, CD-ROM discs,
      photographic compact discs, video laser discs, motion picture and
      still-camera film of all types, x-ray film, optical media, and
      other medium which involve EM effects in recording and playback
      and in the transmission of signals through normal circuitry and
      conducting plates. Video, audio and digital tapes also benefit
      from the present invention but conducting tape must be treated
      with the device before recorded upon.<br>
      <br>
      The systems may be any EM system such as electrical,
      electro-optical, magnetic, and magneto-optical systems. The
      continuously-formed lingering relaxation noise is a direct part of
      the so-called "standard noise" in the system.<br>
      <br>
      When the device is applied to a conductor, such as an audio
      compact disc (CD) that normally produces playback distortion as a
      result of relaxation noise, the distortion is reduced and there is
      an improvement in sound quality with improved clarity and
      sharpness of the music or other such sounds. When the apparatus is
      applied to a medium that has a visual expression, such as a
      CD-ROM, Photo-CD, video laser disc or photogaphic film, there is
      improved visual effects with greater clarity, sharpness and color
      to the resultant pictures and photographs.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the invention is a device comprised of a pair of
      permanent magnets in an orientation in which their like poles,
      i.e., north or south, are in a facing and repulsing relationship.
      A coil of wire is then wound around the pair of fixed magnets in
      an orientation orthogonal to both the interface between the facing
      magnets and their north and south poles.<br>
      <br>
      A motor means and electric supply means is provided for creating a
      pulsed current characterized by sharp voltage spikes to the coil
      of wire creating a modulated EM field while also producing a means
      for spinning the conducting medium when placed on a spindle that
      is driven by the motor means. A far greater effect is given by the
      brushes of the motor means when DC current is applied at a
      constant rate. At the same time, the motor means provides a more
      constant means of maintaining optimum rotation of the spindle thus
      exposing the conductor to the constant effect of the EM field.<br>
      <br>
      The molded spindle allows for improved centering and stability
      during rotation of the conducting medium. The conducting medium is
      oriented to the device so that its plane is parallel to a plane
      running through the north pole orientation of the magnets. As the
      conducting medium passes through the modulated EM field, the
      electrons of the conductor are effected by the field, thus
      reducing the relaxation noise.<br>
      <br>
      The device is housed in a container, such as a molded plastic
      housing, to maintain magnetic unit placement and to allow for
      greater penetration of the modulate magnetic field by the magnetic
      unit and with greater effect on the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      One application of the device of the present invention is in
      clarifying sounds emitting from an audio compact disc. Compact
      discs are comprised of an aluminum surface encased in a plastic
      coating. The disc itself is composed of a very thin piece of
      stamped aluminum, which is the conducting medium, encased in
      plastic. The thin aluminum layer is the active ingredient that
      contains the recorded data.<br>
      <br>
      A second application is in the clarification of compact discs such
      as video laser discs, photo-CDs and CD-ROMs. Processing of visual
      compact discs produces a clearer, sharper, brighter and more
      colorful image both on the computer screen and in a photo image.<br>
      <br>
      A third application is in the clarifying of photographic films of
      all types. Exposed film that has been clarified before developing
      the film produces a consistantly clearer image than film that is
      unclarified.<br>
      <br>
      Referring first to FIG. 1, 10 is a device comprised of a magnetic
      unit 12 which is further comprised of a pair of permanent magnets
      14 and 16 orientated with like poles in a facing, contacting and
      repelling relationship and fused with an adhesive means 18 forming
      a seam with joined magnets 14 and 16 producing a shaped magnetic
      field 22. Magnets 14 and 16 are oriented with their north poles in
      an abutting relationship, although the magnets may be abutted
      using their south poles.<br>

        controlling switch 7, either a 9 volt DC battery or a DC power
        supply 9 and connecting wire 11 to coil 20. DC motor 5 also
        provides a means for rotating spindle 33 seen in FIG. 2. In the
        alternative, electrical power may be provided by a 120 volt AC
        power supply 13 which is reduced to 9 volts by passing through a

      </b><b>EXAMPLE I</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An analysis of an audio compact disc was carried out with the test
      completed using a Schlumberger 1510 Audio Spectrum Analyzer to
      display real-time fast fourier transform (FFT) spectra of the
      sound, a Tektronix 465B dual-trace oscilloscope to display phase
      differences between left and right stereo channels as well as
      waveform shapes, and a Leader LMV-185A 2 channel AC Millivoltmeter
      to simultaneously read the amplitude of the left and right stereo
      channels. The spectrum analyzer has a frequency range of up to 25
      khz, a dynamic range of 70 db, and an absolute range of 100 db
      using attenuators, and an accuracy of 0.1 db and 1/256 of the
      frequency range selected. All measurements were made using the 25
      khz range. The oscilloscope has an upper frequency range of 100
      mhz. The test CD was played on the Denon DCD-1500 II compact disk
      player connected directly to the above instrumentation.<br>
      <br>
      The test CD, CDP 7 46446 2, DIDX 2249 Stereo, UK: CD-PCS 7078,
      manufactured by Capitol Records, otherwise known as the Beatles:
      Abbey Road album originally recorded in 1969 and digitally
      re-mastered in 1987 for CD, was subjected to the above equipment
      and technique. Spectral measurements at a 00:24 interval was made
      on track #7, a selection known as "Here Comes the Sun".<br>
      <br>
      Track #7, at a 24 second interval, is exhibited in Example I as a
      series of bar graphs in diagrams 1-8. The bar graphs
      simultaneously show the relative loudness in decibels "before" and
      "after" clarifying of the device. Each pair of bars represents the
      relative loudness of frequencies between 100 hertz and 25600 hertz
      of Track #7 time 24 seconds of the audio CD analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 1 shows the entire spectrum from 100 to 25600 hertz in 8
      frequency bands as labeled at the bottom of the diagram. It is
      noted that each frequency range except for 200 to 400 hertz is
      about 1 or 2 decibels louder after processing by the device.<br>
      <br>
      Diagrams 2-8 display the same data in more detail showing a larger
      number of smaller frequency ranges in intervals of only 100 hertz
      each. Because frequency ranges are smaller there are more
      variations in the data, however, the readings show the trend of
      being 1 to 2 decibels louder after processing.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that each of the spectral differences as well as the
      average spectrum difference follow a profile demonstrates the
      effect that clarifying by the instant device has on the CD.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE II</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An analysis of an audio compact disc was carried out by first
      recording "The Best of Mike Olfield--Elements", track "Portsmouth"
      without clarifying the CD, on a hard drive using a WAV file of
      Voyetra's WINDAT software with a sound card connected to a
      CD-ROM's audio output. The recording was in mono at a sample rate
      of 44100.<br>
      <br>
      Following the first recording, the CD was then clarified, using
      the device, by placing the CD in the modulated electormagnetic
      field of the present device for 10 seconds on each side followed
      by again recording the CD using the above technique.<br>
      <br>
      Using the WINDAT program, the "before" clarifying and "after"
      clarifying recordings were trimmed so that application of the
      device could be easily compared with non-application. Ten second
      and 0.25 second excerpts were used. The ten second excerpts were
      measured from the point where sound began to come off of the CD.
      The 0.25 second excerpts were taken from a consistent point within
      the body of the recording.<br>
      <br>
      The sound files were converted into graphics using two Shareware
      programs: Screen Thief and Blaster Master. The recordings were
      loaded into Blaster Master individually and the graphical
      representation of each recording was captured using Screen Thief.
      The graphics of the sound files were then laid down and compared
      using Deluxe Paint II Enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      The graphical representation of the sounds, in Diagrams 9-11, is
      based on amplitude and time. The left side of the graphic is the
      beginning of the recording, and right side is the end. The
      beginning of the graphic is defined as the point where sound began
      showing up on the graphic.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 9 illustrate a 10 second comparison of the unclarified
      with the clarified CD. The waveform represents amplitude. It is
      noted that waveform A, the unclarified sample, is taller than
      waveform B, the clarified sample.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 10 is of the same recording but compares exclusively
      unclarified, partial waveform C, unique to waveform A, and
      clarified partial waveform D, unique to waveform B. That is, all
      of the points in the unclarified graph, waveform A, that
      correspond to points in the clarified graph, waveform B, have been
      erased resulting in waveform C, and all of the points in the
      clarified graph, waveform B, corresponding to the unclarified
      graph, waveform A, have been erased, resulting in waveform D. This
      technique leaves a graph showing the data that is unique to the
      recording in question. Thus, in Diagram 10, the graph labelled
      "Exclusively Clarified", the visible lines show data that is
      unique to the clarified recording, and the "Exclusively
      Unclarified" graph shows sound or noise that was no longer present
      after clarification.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 11 illustrates a 0.25 second comparison of the unclarified
      CD, waveform E, with the clarified CD, waveform G. Waveform F is
      the exclusively clarified and shows what is unique to waveform G.
      A graphic of an exclusively unclarified waveform was eliminated
      because interest was in the clarified waveform and what is unique
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      Three criteria were used in analyzing the graphs of Diagrams 9-11:
      Response Time, Noise level and Density. Response Time refers to
      "when the sound starts", a key factor because the CD excerpt
      recorded was timed from the moment that sound began recording off
      of the CD. The position of the remaining material recorded is
      dependent on the accuracy of the starting point. In the ten second
      excerpt of Diagrams 9 and 10, there were no measurable time
      discrepancies, as the graphs matched up as represented in the
      Diagrams with the peaks in the sound occurring in the same places
      throughout the sample.<br>
      <br>
      The 0.25 second excerpts showed a lag time between unclarified
      waveform E with clarified waveform G. As many of the peaks of
      waveforms E and G as possible were matched-up and then compared to
      how much "extra" sound was left at the beginning. By comparing the
      length of the sound to the length of the whole sample, it was
      determined that the unclarified 0.25 second excerpt was lagging
      behind the clarified excerpt by about 0.01 second. A small
      discrepancy at the starting point would not be visible on the ten
      second scale, but on the 0.25 second scale is noticeable.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of Noise Level, the unclarified sample was "noisier" in
      both excerpts, ten second and 0.25. By noise level is meant, that
      overall, the unclarified sample consistently had several peaks
      where the volume line went further than the corresponding volume
      line in the clarified sample. This lower level in the clarified
      sample is the result of a reduction of "noise" level in the
      clarified sample. Extraneous noise makes the overall signal
      noisier and less clear. The clarified sample has an improved and
      smoothed out dynamic because of a reduction in noise level.<br>
      <br>
      Density is defined as the solidity of the volume or amplitude
      lines rather than the range of the lines. Comparison of the volume
      lines of waveform A, unclarified, with waveform B, clarified,
      shows waveform B to have a much more consistent volume level than
      waveform A. Increased Density gives greater consistency to the CD,
      producing a much fuller sound.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE III</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Example III, the identical technique used in Example II was
      duplicated. An analysis of the audio compact disc, "The Cross of
      Changes" by Enigma, track "Return to Innocence" was carried out by
      first recording, without clarifying the CD, on a hard drive using
      a WAV file of Voyetra's WINDAT software with a sound card
      connected to a CD-ROM's audio output. The recording was in mono at
      a sample rate of 44100. Following the first recording, the compact
      disc was then clarified, using the device, by allowing the CD to
      spin for 10 seconds on each side followed by again recording the
      CD using the above technique. The analysis technique as described
      in Example II was then completed.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 12 illustrates a ten second excerpt comparison of waveform
      A, unclarified, with waveform D, clarified. Waveform B is
      exclusively unclarified, and unique to waveform A. Waveform C is
      exclusively clarified and is what is unique to waveform D of the
      sound track. Waveform A, the unclarified sample, is significantly
      different than waveform D, the clarified sample.<br>
      <br>
      Diagram 13 illustrates a 0.25 second comparison of the same
      recording of unclarified waveform E with clarified waveform G of
      the CD. It also shows exclusively clarified waveform F,
      demonstrating the unique difference between waveforms E and G.<br>
      <br>
      Response Time, Loudness and Density were analyzed. In the 0.25
      graphic of Diagram 13, the Response Time of waveform G is slightly
      ahead of waveform E, indicating that sound from the recording
      began sooner than in waveform E. The amplitude lines of waveform G
      are slightly reduced overall in comparison with waveform E,
      resulting in a reduction of Noise Level. The Density of waveform G
      is much greater than in waveform E, especially in the last
      one-third segment of Diagram 13.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE IV</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A Photo-CD was analyzed both "before" and "after" passing the CD
      through the modulated eletromagnetic field of the device to
      determine specific changes in the retrievable data from the CD.
      The method and steps used to derive and quantify the effect that
      clarifying had on the conductor was determined using the following
      method and steps:<br>
      <br>
      1. A demonstration Photo-CD sampler, produced by Kodak, was down
      loaded to the hard drive of an Apple Centris 650, 25 HRZ, 6800040
      motherboard and a new file created and properly designated as
      "before". The photo-CD had not been clarified by the device.
      Images were transferred to a commercial graphics software program,
      PhotoShop, developed by Adobe Software.<br>
      <br>
      2. The Photo-CD was removed from the ROM and treated with the
      present device by spinning the CD on each side for 15 seconds. The
      CD was then down loaded to the hard drive and a second new file
      created and properly designated as "after". The images created
      were transferred to the PhotoShop graphics software program with
      file separation maintained at all times.<br>
      <br>
      3. Print number 3 of the Photo-CD list, contained in the "before"
      or unclarifyied, was brought to the screen and a text translator
      was used to convert the picture to post script computer language.
      Picture number 3 represented a photo image that measured
      21/2.times.13/4 inches, using 132 LPI, 72 DPI and utilized
      approximately 250K of memory. Following the text translation
      process to convert the small image to post script, it was then
      saved to a new file. Following the conversion, there were 360
      pages of post script computer language created to describe the
      image number 3.<br>
      <br>
      4. The identical process as described above was used to create a
      post script file for the image following use of the device on the
      photo-CD. The "after" or clarifying effect resulted in 348 pages
      of post script computer language.<br>
      <br>
      5. The first 16 pages of post script language was specific to
      language to program the printer. The balance of the pages in both
      cases was post script language to describe the specific image that
      was converted. The first 4 pages of both files were then converted
      into text files using Wordperfect 6.0. The process of converting
      the post script files to text files was for the specific purpose
      of utilizing a specialized software program that could compare the
      text language of both files. The process of converting the first 4
      pages of both post script files to text files took 25 minutes and
      resulted in the generation of 101 pages of new text language. The
      ratio of pages of text converted from post script is approximately
      1 to 25. If the entire post script files (354 pages average) were
      converted to text file using the same ratio, it would require
      approximately 8,850 pages of text file to fully describe a single
      21/2.times.13/4 inch colored image.<br>
      <br>
      6. The software used to simultaneously compare the text in the two
      files, DocuComp II, version 1.05, is a product of Advance
      software, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      7. The first 4 pages produced a total of 101 pages of text file.
      When placed into the DocuComp file, it resulted in the following
      summary of information changes: The 4 pages represent slightly
      more than 1% of the total data available from each image. If the
      entire 708 pages were converted and analyzed, it would take
      considerable memory capacity and about 37 hours (4 pages of each
      file takes 25 minutes) of computer running time to analyze 708
      pages of post script computer language.<br>
      <br>
      8. Four pages from each file generated a total of 56 material
      changes, on the average, resulting in over 5,000 changes for the
      entire image when "before" clarifying was compared to "after"
      clarifying.<br>
      <br>
      9. The "before" unclarified file, resulted in 53,336 bytes of
      information The "after" clarified file version, generated 50,521
      bytes of information. The comparison represents a difference in
      information retrieved equal to 5.7% less for the clarified file.<br>
      <br>
      Clarifying the Photo-CD with the device realigns the data into a
      tighter format by reducing superfluous data. Each Pixel has a
      "halo" or influence zone. Exposing the pixel to a modulated EM
      field reduces the halo by suppressing electron activity or
      relaxation noise thus causing the pixel to be sharper with
      improved clarity. The photo-CD manufacturing process can produce
      residual color around each individual pixel referred to as pixel
      residual or bleeding. When a pixel, represented by post script and
      text script, is sharper, it does not require as much information
      to accurately describe or define it. When a pixel halo or
      influence zone is reduced, it requires less information to
      describe the data. In Example IV, 5.7% less information was
      required following clarifying by the device, at the same time
      improving the image to describe the same segment of the picture.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis process of converting each image to post script and
      then to text is accurate. Changes created by treating a photo-CD
      with the present device can be demonstrated by a computer
      comparison of the information generated from both images.<br>

      differences between the "before" and "after" application of the
      device to the photo-CD.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE V</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Using the identical technique and steps as described in Example
      IV, steps 1-9, a second Photo-CD, Nature's Way, published by
      Gazelle Technologies and produced by Kodak, was tested "before"
      and "after" application of the present device. In this Example,
      the original bytes numbered 74,151 before clarifying with the
      device. After clarifying, the number of bytes were reduced to
      70,214 resulting in a 5.6% byte reduction.<br>
      <br>
