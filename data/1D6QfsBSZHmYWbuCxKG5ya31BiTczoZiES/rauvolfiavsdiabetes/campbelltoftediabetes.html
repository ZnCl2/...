          clinical study of the safety and anti-diabetic efficacy of the
          Rauvolfia-Citrus tea, as used in Nigerian Traditional Medicine</b><br>
        <b>Joan I.A.Campbell-Tofte, et al.</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      The aim of this randomized and double blinded pilot clinical trial
      was to investigate the anti-diabetic efficacy of the
      Rauvolfia-Citrus (RC) tea in humans. We have earlier shown that a
      combination of calorie-restriction and chronic administration of
      the RC tea to the genetic diabetic (BKS-db) mice resulted in the
      normalization of blood sugar, reduction in lipid accumulated in
      the mice eyes and prevention of the degeneration of the otherwise
      brittle BKS-db pancreas. The tea is made by boiling foliage of
      Rauvolfia vomitoria and fruits of Citrus aurantium and is used to
      treat diabetes in Nigerian folk medicine...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and methods</b><br>
      <br>
      The RC tea was produced using the Nigerian traditional recipe and
      tested in the traditional dosage on 23 Danish type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) patients. The participants were divided into two equivalent
      groups after stratification by sex, age and BMI, in a 4-month
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial.
      Most of the study subjects (19/23) were using oral anti-diabetic
      agents (OADs). Mean disease duration was 6 ± 4.6 years, mean age
      was 64 ± 7 years and mean BMI was 28.7 ± 3.8 kg/m2. Prior to
      starting the treatment, the participants received individual
      dietician consultations.<br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the 4-month treatment period, the treated group
      showed an 11% decrease in 2-h postprandial plasma glucose relative
      to the 3% increase in the placebo group (p = 0.004). The
      improvement in blood glucose clearance with RC tea treatment was
      reflected in a 6% reduction in HbA1c (p = 0.02) and in a 10%
      reduction in fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.02), when comparing the
      post 4-month treatment to pre-treatment baseline values. Though
      the basal levels of phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase enzyme
      in skeletal muscle were significantly reduced in the treated group
      (p = 0.04), as compared to the placebo, only the pattern of
      reductions in the tissue fatty acids (FAs) differed in the two
      groups. While all types of FAs were reduced in placebo, only
      saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) FAs were reduced with
      treatment. Interestingly, a modest increase in the polyunsaturated
      FAs fraction was observed in the RC treated group. In addition,
      the reduction in SFA and MUFA with RC tea treatment came solely
      from the triglyceride fractions, as there was an increase in the
      skeletal muscle phospholipids.<br>
      Conclusions<br>
      <br>
      Chronic administration of the RC tea to overweight T2D on OADs
      caused significant improvements in markers of glycaemic control
      and modifications to the fatty acid profile of skeletal muscle,
      without adverse effects or hypoglycaemia. Further exploration of
      the anti-diabetic effects of the RC tea is warranted...<br>

      </b><b>RAUVOLFIA VOMITORIA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>OTHER NAME(S)</b>: African Serpentwood, African Snakeroot,
      Akanta, Asofeyeje, Eto Mmong Eba Ebot In, Ira, Mmoneba, Poison
      Devil-pepper...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overview Information<br>
        <br>
      </b>Rauvolfia vomitoria is a shrub found mainly in West Africa.
      The roots, leaves, and stem are used in medicine.<br>
      <br>
      People use Rauvolfia vomitoria for convulsions, fever, weakness,
      inability to sleep, mental disorders, pain, arthritis, cancer,
      high blood pressure, diabetes, and health of the stomach,
      intestines, and liver. It is also used to promote sleepiness and
      vomiting.<br>
      <br>
      Rauvolfia vomitoria is applied to the skin for snake bites, skin
      infections, and swelling.<br>
      <br>
      It is placed in the rectum for worms in the intestine and for
      menstrual pains.<br>
      <br>
      In western countries such as the U.S. and Canada, Rauvolfia
      vomitoria is used in some workout supplements. Countries including
      Canada and others have banned supplements containing Rauvolfia
      vomitoria extract from the market. This is because some Rauvolfia
      vomitoria extracts contain high levels of chemicals that are
      prescription drugs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How does it work?<br>
        <br>
      </b>Rauvolfia vomitoria has been used as a traditional medicine in
      Western Africa. It contains chemicals that lower blood pressure,
      kill cancer cells and bacteria, and help with brain function. It
      is not completely clear which chemicals are the most important in
      Rauvolfia vomitoria or exactly how they might work together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uses &amp; Effectiveness?<br>
        <br>
      </b>Insufficient Evidence for:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diabetes. Early research shows that drinking a
      beverage made from the leaves and stems of Rauvolfia vomitoria and
      the fruit of bitter orange helps reduce levels of blood sugar
      following a meal in some people with diabetes. But it doesn't seem
      to improve fasting or average blood sugar.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychosis. Early research shows that taking
      Rauvolfia vomitoria root powder daily for 6 weeks improves
      symptoms of psychosis in some people. But it also seems to cause
      shakiness, jerky movements, or slower movements in some people.
      These side effects are similar to those of medications for mental
      conditions (antipsychotic drugs).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Side Effects &amp; Safety<br>
        <br>
      </b>Rauvolfia vomitoria is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth.
      Taking Rauvolfia vomitoria dried root powder can cause shakiness,
      jerky movements, or slower movements in some people. These effects
      are similar to side effects of medications for mental conditions
      (antipsychotic drugs). Rauvolfia vomitoria also contains chemicals
      that have been shown to affect the heart and blood vessels,
      causing low blood pressure and slow heart rate. Other possible
      side effects of these chemicals include stomach problems,
      drowsiness, dizziness, and other problems with the brain and
      nervous system.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Special Precautions &amp; Warnings<br>
        <br>
      </b>Pregnancy: It's POSSIBLY UNSAFE to use Rauvolfia vomitoria
      during pregnancy. Rauvolfia vomitoria contains chemicals that
      might cause birth defects.<br>
      <br>
      Breastfeeding: There is not enough reliable information about the
      safety of taking Rauvolfia vomitoria if you are breast feeding.
      Stay on the safe side and avoid use.<br>
      <br>
      Anxiety: Rauvolfia vomitoria contains a chemical that might make
      anxiety worse. Use Rauvolfia vomitoria with caution in people with
      anxiety.<br>
      <br>
      Depression: Rauvolfia vomitoria contains a chemical that might
      make depression worse. But some early research shows that
      Rauvolfia vomitoria does not cause or worsen depression. Until
      more is known, use Rauvolfia vomitoria with caution in people with
      depression.<br>
      <br>
      Diabetes: Rauvolfia vomitoria might lower blood sugar levels in
      people with diabetes. Watch for signs of low blood sugar
      (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have
      diabetes and use Rauvolfia vomitoria.<br>
      <br>
      Shock therapy (electroconvulsive therapy, ECT): Rauvolfia
      vomitoria should not be used by people who are receiving ECT. Stop
      taking Rauvolfia vomitoria at least one week before beginning ECT.<br>
      <br>
      Gall stones: Rauvolfia vomitoria might make gallbladder disease
      worse.<br>
      <br>
      Stomach ulcers, intestinal ulcers, or ulcerative colitis: Don't
      use Rauvolfia vomitoria if you have ever had one of these
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Allergy to reserpine or similar medicines known as rauwolfia
      alkaloids: Don't take Rauvolfia vomitoria if you are allergic to
      these medicines.<br>
      <br>
      Low blood pressure: Don't use Rauvolfia vomitoria if you have low
      blood pressure. Rauvolfia vomitoria might lower blood pressure
      even further and cause very low levels.<br>
      <br>
      A tumor in the adrenal glands that causes dangerously high blood
      pressure (pheochromocytoma): Don't use Rauvolfia vomitoria if you
      have this condition.<br>
      <br>
      Surgery: Rauvolfia vomitoria might affect blood sugar levels,
      making blood sugar control difficult during and after surgery.
      Stop using Rauvolfia vomitoria at least 2 weeks before a scheduled
      surgery. <br>

        Inventor: CAMPBELL-TOFTE JOAN</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      This invention provides a process for extracting a
      pharmaceutically active fraction from the foliage (leaves and
      stems) and/or roots of Rauvolfia vomitoria and the fruit of Citrus
      aurantium. In one aspect, the process requires extracting from a
      boiled tea of Rauvolfia vomitoria foliage and/or roots and Citrus
      aurantium fruit an active fraction made by filtering the boiled
      tea and concentrating the supernatant. In one embodiment, the
      fraction is concentrated by freeze drying the supernatant. The
      fraction is useful to treat a disorder associated with abnormally
      elevated glucose levels in a subject by administering to the
      subject a therapeutically effective amount of the extract or a
      pharmaceutical composition containing the extract. Such conditions
      include, but are not limited to the diabetes Type II, abnormal
      steraAroyl-CoA desaturase activity, hyperphagia, abnormal lipid
      mobilization, abnormal fatty acid profile from the eye of the
      subject, ulcers and a glucosuria.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is in the field of pharmaceuticals. In
      particular, it is related to the field of anti-diabetic
      pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, makes glucose
      available to cells in the human body for the purpose of obtaining
      energy. Diabetes mellitus is primarily a disturbance of the body's
      glucose or carbohydrate metabolism. In diabetes mellitus Type I,
      the pancreas produces little insulin or it does not produce it at
      all. Treatment requires daily insulin injections so that a
      diabetic can survive. In diabetes mellitus Type II, the pancreas
      produces insulin, but the quantity of insulin is insufficient or
      it is less effective due to the cellular resistance, or both. In
      each of these forms there are various abnormalities, but the basic
      defects to which these abnormalities can be attributed are: (1)
      the reduced entering of glucose into various “peripheral” tissues;
      and (2) the increased releasing of glucose from the liver into the
      bloodstream (increased liver glucogenesis).<br>
      <br>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 2 to 10 out
      of every 100 people will develop the condition during their
      lifetime and that 90% of these will be of the Type II, late onset
      non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Nathan (1993) New Eng. J.
      Med. 328:1676-1685. In Type II diabetes, the insulin stimulated
      glucose uptake and utilization in liver, skeletal muscle and
      adipose tissue is impaired. <br>
      <br>
      Zimmet (1982) Diabetologia 22:399-411. The defects can be improved
      by caloric restriction and exercise. In the later stages of the
      disease, the only recourse for patients is a life-long
      hypoglycemic therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Currently approved treatments for Type II diabetes include the
      administration of sulphonamides, biguanidines (Turner and Clapham
      (1998) Prog. Drug. Res. 51:33-94) and thiazolidinediones.
      Kohlroser et al. (2000) Am. J. Gast. 96:272-276. The drawbacks of
      the currently available drugs include harmful side effects and
      numerous counter indications (e.g. impossibility of application in
      pregnancy and during the suckling period), as well as their
      ineffectiveness in stemming the tissue complications that arise
      from long-term Type II diabetes. Therefore, new therapies are
      under investigation, e.g., the administration of herbal extracts.<br>
      <br>
      For example, U.S. Patent Publ. No. 20030206976 discloses an herbal
      extract from a composition which contains: Centaurii umbellatum,
      Gentianaceae (centaury plant), Teraxacum officinale, Asteraceae
      (dandelion root), Juniperi communis L, Cupresaceae (juniper
      berry), Urticae dioica L, Urticeae (nettle plant), Urticae dioica
      L, Urticaceae (nettle root), Cichorium intybus L, Cichoriaceae
      (chicory root), Morus nigra L, Moraceae, (mulberry leaf),
      Achilleae millefolium L, Asteraceae (yarrow flower), Vaccinium
      myrtillus L, Ericaceae (bilberry leaf), Phaseolus vulgaris L,
      Fabaceae (bean pods), Valeriana officinalis L, Valerlanaceae
      (Valerian root). The extract is used to treat diabetes mellitus
      Type II.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Patent Publ. No. 20030086985 discloses a process for
      isolating an extract from Argyrobium roseum that contains the
      flavonoid glycoside and which possesses hypoglycaemic activity.
      Compositions containing this extract are useful to treat various
      hyperglycaemic conditions including non-insulin dependent diabetes
      mellitus disease. U.S. Patent Publication 20020187201 discloses a
      process for the control of diabetes mellitus using natural
      products isolated from Perna viridis.<br>
      <br>
      However, a need still exists to find a composition and treatment
      with long-term effects. The invention described here satisfies
      this need and provides related advantages as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention provides a process for extracting a
      pharmaceutically active fraction from the foliage (leaves and
      stems) and/or roots of Rauvolfia vomitoria and the fruit of Citrus
      aurantium. In one aspect, the process requires extracting from a
      boiled tea of Rauvolfia vomitoria foliage and/or roots and Citrus
      aurantium fruit an active fraction made by filtering the boiled
      tea and concentrating the supernatant. In one embodiment, the
      fraction is concentrated by freeze drying the supernatant.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided by this invention is a method of treating a disorder
      associated with abnormally elevated glucose levels in a subject by
      administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of
      the extract or a pharmaceutical composition containing the
      extract. Such conditions include, but are not limited to the
      diabetes Type II, abnormal steraroyl-CoA desaturase activity,
      hyperphagia, abnormal lipid mobilization, abnormal fatty acid
      profile from the eye of the subject, ulcers and a glucosuria....<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Applicant has identified a process for extracting a
      pharmaceutically active fraction from the foliage (leaves and
      stems) and/or roots of Rauvolfia vomitoria and the fruit of Citrus
      aurantium. In one aspect, the process requires extracting from a
      boiled tea of Rauvolfia vomitoria foliage and/or roots and Citrus
      aurantium fruit an active fraction made by filtering the boiled
      tea and concentrating the supernatant. In one embodiment, the
      fraction is concentrated by freeze drying the supernatant.<br>
      <br>
      Rauvolfia vomitoria occurs widely in coastal and inland parts of
      tropical West Africa. The species is a well-known medicinal plant
      used by different peoples in Africa as the major or minor part of
      concoctions used for treating various ailments. Sofowora,
      Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine in Africa, Wiley and
      Sons, Chichester (1982); Burkill, The Useful Plants of Tropical
      West Africa, Vol. 1 (1985). <br>
      <br>
      Rauvolfia vomitoria was previously investigated for alkaloid
      content, especially for those with hypotensive and
      anti-inflammatory properties. Chatteijee &amp; Bandyopadhyay
      (1979) Ind. J. Chem. 28B: 87-88; Amer &amp; Court (1980)
      Phytochemistry 19: 1833-1836; Kweifio-Okai (1991) J. Ethno
      Pharmacology 33: 263-267. Citrus aurantium is reported as having a
      weight reduction effect when combined with a strict diet. Preuss
      et al. (2002) J. Med. 33:247-264. In addition, C. aurantium has
      been shown to be radioprotective because it is rich in flavonoids
      with anti-oxidative activity. Hosseinimehr et al. (2003) J. Rad.
      Res. (Tokyo) 44:237-241.<br>
      <br>
      This invention provides a biologically active composition
      consisting essentially of a liquid extract obtained from Rauvolfia
      vomitoria and Citrus aurantium. In one aspect, the extract is
      separated from the boiled leaves and stems of Rauvolfia vomitoria
      and the boiled fruit of Citrus aurantium. The extract can be
      combined with a carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier. Alternatively and/or additionally, an effective amount of
      an agent that lowers blood glucose levels can be added to the
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      This invention also provides a method of treating a disorder
      associated with abnormally elevated glucose levels in a subject by
      administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of
      the extract or a pharmaceutical composition containing the
      extract. As used in this context, to “treat” means to alleviate
      the symptoms associated with abnormally high levels of glucose.
      Such conditions include, but are not limited to the diabetes Type
      II, abnormal steraroyl-CoA desaturase activity, hyperphagia,
      abnormal lipid mobilization, abnormal fatty acid profile from the
      eye of the subject, ulcers and a glucosuria. One of skill in the
      art can note when the object of the method has been obtained by
      noting a reduction in glucose in the patient's blood or urine or
      an amelioration of symptoms such as normalization of blood
      pressure, disappearance of bulbous swellings around varicose
      veins, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Any mode of administration can be used to deliver the extract....<br>

      The invention discloses a method for extracting multiple alkaloids
      from rauvolfia vomitoria. The method comprises the following steps
      of: adding acid-containing ethanol aqueous solution into root
      powder of the rauvolfia vomitoria, stirring and filtering to
      obtain leach liquor; concentrating the leach liquor, adsorbing
      with non-polar macroporous adsorption resin, washing and eluting
      with 40 percent ethanol and 80 percent ethanol; collecting eluate
      respectively, concentrating and then adsorbing with weakly acidic
      cation exchange resin, washing and eluting with 50 percent
      ethanol; collecting eluate respectively, adjusting pH to be 3 by
      using concentrated acid, concentrating and then adsorbing with a
      C18 reversed phase chromatography medium and eluting with the
      ethanol aqueous solution with gradually increasing concentration;
      and collecting the eluate in stages respectively, combining the
      parts with higher single alkaloid purity in the eluate
      respectively, concentrating to obtain solid, adding an organic
      solvent to crystallize to obtain crystals of yohimbine, ajmaline,
      reserpoid, reserpine and rescinnamine. According to the method,
      five alkaloids can be extracted from a plant at most at one time;
      and the method has the advantages of few steps, less dosage of the
      used organic solvent, low pollution and simple required equipment.<br>

      </b>Rauvolfia vomitoria, the poison devil's-pepper,[3] is a plant
      species in the genus Rauvolfia. It is native to tropical Africa
      from Senegal east to Sudan + Tanzania, south to Angola; and
      naturalized in China, Bangladesh, and Puerto Rico.[4]<br>
      <br>
      2,6-Dimethoxybenzoquinone is a benzoquinone, a toxic chemical
      compound found in R. vomitoria.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Every part of the tree is toxic.[6] It has been identified as an
      invasive species in Hawai’i (O’ahu).[7] <br>
