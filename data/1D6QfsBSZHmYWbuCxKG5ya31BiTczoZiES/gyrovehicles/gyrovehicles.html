        <b>Including Details of the Tuscan Gyro-Stabilized, Half-Track,
          Trail Bike</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Several people have written to me in recent months about the
      Gyro-X project, adding their knowledge and observations, for which
      I am very grateful. I have edited their comments for presentation
      purposes, so that they can be shared with others who are
      interested in this subject. -- Stephen Cobb<br>

      <b>Tuscan -- Gyro-Stabilized, Half-Track, Trail Bike</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We learned about this fascinating off-shoot of the Gyro-X project
      from Richard R Fuller of Jacksonville, Florida. Richard's father
      was one of the founding associates with Gyro Transport Systems
      (GTS). His name was Richard H. Fuller and he was the purchasing
      analyst for them. The younger Richard Fuller contacted us while
      searching the web for material on GTS which until very recently he
      thought was called Tuscan something. He was only 14 when the
      company started in Salt Lake City, Utah. He reports that within
      two years the company was disolved, ending hopes of moving to
      Ponce, Puerto Rico to build the manufacturing plant.<br>
      <br>
      However, during that time, when the company was located in
      Northridge, he met Alex Tremulys, Tom Summers, Al Crane, and Ed
      Davis. When the company dissolved, Richard's father was offered a
      job at American Airlines and the family moved to Tulsa. But the
      younger Richard kept a lot of materials, including an 8x10 glossy
      of the Gyronaut X-1 signed by Alex Tremulus to his father, and the
      product brochure for the Tuscan. Richard kindly scanned the
      brochure for display on the web.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hellfire Connection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A considerable amount of very useful background information was
      supplied to me by Jerry Goldstein, who also filled in some details
      of the Gyro Hawk kit car. Here's what Jerry told me:<br>
      <br>
      "What happened to the Gyro-X was relayed to me by Tom Summers when
      I tracked him down in 1991, after realizing the need for a small,
      enclosed and stabilized motorcycle. An old timer had seen the
      Science &amp; Mechanics article and I researched it. I found Alex
      Tremulus just before he passed away and through his wife was able
      to get in touch with Tom Summers. I visited Tom and we talked
      about the article.<br>
      <br>
      "Tom had his own gyroscope company in the fifties, and contracted
      with the US Forest service to build several prototype mechanical
      mules for carrying ore from copper mines located on US forest
      preserves that were remote and inaccessible except by pack mules.
      The idea was to build a mono-trak vehicle that could access the
      mine through the wilderness without having to build roads through
      the prime forest. Tom developed several testbeds, generating
      considerable interest and attracting Alex Tremulus and a group of
      investors from the University of Utah who wanted to build a
      prototype passenger car using Toms designs.<br>
      <br>
      "An investment group was formed and a prototype built. The car was
      built in Los Angeles. The body design is by Alex Tremulus who also
      styled the Ford Thunderbird and the Ford Gyron (note: we plan to
      add more about the 2-wheeled Gyron soon).<br>
      <br>
      "The car prototype actually used the powerplant from one of the
      ore mules which belonged to the US government. Tom maintains that
      the investment group attempted to steal his patented designs and
      go ahead on the project without compensating him. He sued the
      group and effectively killed the project, but it left him ruined
      financially.<br>
      <br>
      "He was retired from Tally Corporation in 1988 when it was
      acquired by Hughes after old man Tally died. The new owners found
      Tom " wandering the halls" and put him out to pasture, not
      realizing he was the foremost inertial guidance engineer of the
      post WWII era. Toms design of the Hellfire missile guidance system
      is still in use today. Tom tried unsuccessfully to bring the
      gyrocar to reality several times over the period from 1968 until
      his patents expired some twenty odd years later."<br>
      <br>
      Jerry feels that Tom is something of a national treasure, and an
      unsung hero. "He invented the vertical sensing device that became
      the key to the success of the Norton bombsite in WWII. The Germans
      tried to entice him into sharing his information with them but the
      U.S. Gov't put Tom to better use here. Tom had his own gyroscope
      company in the '50s and was a pioneer in the field of inertial
      guidance. He held over 100 patents. Tom worked for Tally
      corporation in the '70s, perfecting the guidance system of the
      Hellfire missile for which Tally was a prime contractor. His
      effort to produce the gyro vehicle began with the ore carrying
      "mules" that provided the powerplant and gyro for the car that
      appeared in Science and Mechanic in 1968."<br>

      Several readers of this page have suggested that the Tuscan was
      not in fact gyro-stabiized. After considerable reflection I agree
      that it is unlikely the model pictured here used a gyro. However,
      we are told in the Science and Mechanics Gyro-X article that Gyro
      Transport Systems was working on a gyro-stabilied trail bike for
      the US Forest Service and I'm speculating that it was a modified
      version of the Tuscan. As always, I am happy to hear from anyone
      who can shed light on these machines. Email me as webbloke at cobb

      Lit Motors Inc. is a San Francisco-based company that designed
      conceptual two-wheeled vehicles, including a fully electric,
      gyroscopically stabilized vehicle.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Founded by Daniel K. Kim in 2010, Lit Motors designed concepts for
      two-wheeled vehicles with a focus on innovative technologies. They
      have released information about two projects: the AEV
      (auto-balancing electric vehicle) often referred to as the "C-1"
      and the Kubo cargo scooter. The inspiration for Lit Motors came to
      Kim in 2003, when he was nearly crushed by a chassis while
      manually assembling a bio-diesel Land Rover Defender 90.[2] Kim
      decided to "chop a car in half" to create what is now the C-1<br>

      <b>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_moment_gyroscope#Single-gimbal</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Single-gimbal -- The most effective CMGs include only a single
      gimbal. When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in
      direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that
      reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a
      spacecraft. Except for effects due to the motion of the
      spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no
      mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy). Single-gimbal CMGs
      exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little
      power, with the result that they can apply very large torques for
      minimal electrical input... <br>

      <br>
      ...In its current form, the two gyros each put out 266 pound-feet
      of torque as they spin, keeping the C1 upright no matter the speed
      or angle. In final production form, the combined force of the pair
      of gyros will max out at around 1,300 pound-feet, enough to keep
      the C1 vertical while stopped, at steady-state cruising and
      planted to the road at a maximum lean angle of 45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to simply pull the entire gyro setup from the chassis
      is a design decision that will make it to production, allowing the
      C1 to be serviced quickly and efficiently, much like the battery
      pack mounted to the floor of the Tesla Model S. It also helps when
      something goes awry during its maiden voyage in the eager hands of
      someone outside the Lit Motors studio...<br>

      Gyro stabilized remote controlled toy motorcycle having good
      stability and control without using ground contacting auxiliary
      wheels or the like. The motorcycle comprises a chassis supporting
      a fixed angle rear wheel drive and associated motor and a castered
      front wheel. A gyro wheel having an axis nominally parallel to the
      axis of the rear wheel is mounted in a gimbal with a vertical axis
      in the forward part of the chassis and connected to the front
      wheel fork and post to turn the front wheel responsive to the
      rotation of the gimbal relative to the chassis. The chassis
      further includes a radio receiver, battery power and a steering
      device, such as a motor and slip clutch for torquing the gyro
      wheel gimbal. To turn in a first direction the gyro gimbal is
      torqued in the opposite direction, initially causing the front
      wheel to also turn in the opposite direction. As the motorcycle
      and the gyro lean into the turn, a correcting torque is generated
      by the gyro and caster of the front wheel, overcoming the initial
      steering torque to maintain the proper steering angle and balance
      for the motorcycle. Various embodiments are disclosed.<br>

      The invention relates to the field of vehicle engineering, and
      more particularly to gyro-stabilized two-wheeled vehicles,
      primarily motorcycles. Essence of the invention: a gyro-stabilizer
      for a two-wheeled single-track vehicle, preferably a motorcycle,
      is configured in the form of a gyroscope in a gimbal mount, an
      outer ring of which is connected by a two-way axial pivot joint to
      the frame of a vehicle, wherein the axis of said joint is oriented
      along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle; an inner ring of the
      gimbal mount is connected by a two-way axial pivot joint to the
      outer ring; and a spin axis of the gyroscope is connected by a
      two-way axial pivot joint to the inner ring of the gimbal mount,
      wherein the axes of all three pivot joints are mutually
      perpendicular, and wherein the gyro-stabilizer has a means for
      locking rotation of the outer ring about the axis of the pivot
      joint between said outer ring and the frame of the vehicle.
      According to the invention, the gyro-stabilizer is disposed on the
      swingarm of the rear wheel and has a means for locking rotation of
      the inner ring about the axis of the pivot joint between said
      inner ring and the outer ring, wherein each locking means is in
      the form of a servomotor which allows the forced rotation of the
      corresponding ring in response to a command from a microcontroller
      controlling at least the speed and the permissible bank angles of
      the vehicle, and an additional weight is secured on the axis of
      the pivot joint between the inner ring and the spin axis.<br>

      fork of the front wheel (4), a first set of members
      (2,6,8,10,36,12,14,16,18) for inducing, as a result of a
      solicitation of the handlebar in the direction of the arrow (arrow
      1), towards the interior of the turn, a pivoting (arrow 3) towards
      the exterior of the turn called a counter-turn, of the front wheel
      around a pivot axis (20) of the fork. There is a second set of
      members (24,30,22,8,20,36,12,14,16,18) whose activation is
      dependent on the information of a gyroscope (24), to induce the
      motorcycle to lean towards the interior of the turn while the
      motorcycle encounters the turn. There is a third set of members
      (26,28,32) whose activation is dependent upon the speedometer (26)
      for adjusting the extent of the turning or counter-turning of the
      front wheel around the pivot axis (20) of the fork, as a function
      of the speed. Thus, the movement of the handlebar in the direction
      of the interior of the turn, induces a counter-turn followed by an
      automatic turning of the motorcycle, whose factors of execution
      varies as a function of the speed of the latter.<br>
