      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A novel fuel pretreater apparatus and
        method for pretreating an alternate fuel to render it usable as
        the fuel source for fuel burning equipment such as internal
        combustion engines, furnaces, boilers, and turbines, includes a
        volatilization chamber into which the alternate fuel is
        received. An exhaust plenum may enclose the volatilization
        chamber so that thermal energy supplied by exhaust from the fuel
        burning equipment can be used to help volatilize the alternate
        fuel. A bypass stream of exhaust may be diverted through the
        alternate fuel in the volatilization chamber to help in
        volatilizing the alternate fuel and help carry the volatilized
        fuel through a heated reactor prior to its being introduced into
        the fuel burning equipment. The reactor is preferably interposed
        in the exhaust conduit and is formed by a reactor tube having a
        reactor rod mounted coaxially therein in spaced relationship.
        The exhaust passing through the exhaust conduit provides thermal
        energy to the reactor to pretreat the alternate fuel.</p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A water circulation system of a marine
        engine improves the consistency of engine combustion by
        stabilizing the temperature of water flowing through the engine
        water jacket and by heating the intake manifold to a temperature
        within a desired temperature range. The desired temperature
        range is defined so as to optimize fuel vaporization without
        significantly affecting the volumetric efficiency of the engine.
        The water circulation system includes a control valve which
        directs water flow through the circulation system according to
        the water temperature exiting the engine water jacket. The valve
        recirculates water between the engine water jacket and a
        recirculation path until the water temperature reaches a
        predetermined lower temperature limit. The control valve then
        allows a portion of the water to flow through a heating jacket
        around the intake manifold to heat the intake manifold. If the
        temperature of the recirculating water reaches a predetermined
        upper temperature limit, the control valve directs all of the
        water through the heating jacket until the temperature of the
        water exiting the engine water jacket falls below the upper
        temperature limit. In this manner, the water circulation system
        generally stabilizes the water temperature in the engine water
        jacket and heats the intake manifold to a temperature generally
        within the upper and lower temperature limits. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> The ram tube of this invention
        basically consists of an intake bracket, inner tube, output
        bracket, outer tube, input port and output port. The intake and
        output brackets are attached to the ends of the inner tube for
        attaching the ram tube to the base of a carburetor and the
        intake to an intake manifold of an internal combustion engine.
        The outer tube is installed over and surrounds the inner tube to
        create a passage between the inner and outer tubes. Exhaust is
        directed from the exhaust manifold of the engine to an input
        port on the outer tube. The exhaust passes through the passage
        and exits through the output port. The exhaust heats the inner
        tube to in turn heat the air/fuel mixture passing through the
        inner tube. The fuel is completely vaporized and placed in a dry
        vapor condition as it passes through the heated inner tube. The
        fuel entering the combustion chamber in a dry vapor condition
        burns more completely, at a higher temperature and at a faster
        rate to provide a higher efficiency engine. Due to the high
        temperature achieved using the ram tube, water can be injected
        into the ram tube or air stream for use as a fuel supplement.
        The ram tube of this invention can also be used in conjunction
        with a heat exchanger for initial vaporization of fuel in cooler
        weather and/or a turbo charger, or other type of device which
        increases volume efficiency, for pressurizing the air/fuel
        mixture for additional engine performance. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> The present invention relates to the
        engine-building industry and can find application in the fuel
        feed system of internal combustion engines for preconditioning
        part of the flow of a rich fuel-air mixture fed to the main flow
        to decompose liquid fuel and convert it into a gas. A technical
        aim of the present invention consists in an increased fuel
        economy of the engine, reduced toxicity of exhaust gases, and
        use of a cheaper low-octane fuel. A method for preparing
        fuel-air mixture consists in that the flow of an overrich
        fuel-air mixture is additionally heated, before mixing it with
        the other flow of fuel-air mixture, by passing it through a
        promoter heated above the mixture ignition temperature, thus
        providing repeated contact of the flow with the promoter
        surface. A device comprises a heat-exchanger 1 communicating,
        via an intake piping 3, with the engine exhaust manifold, a
        proportioner 5 of the components of the fuel-air mixture being
        handled provided with an air piping 6, an exhaust gas piping 7,
        and a fuel piping 8. The proportioner 5 communicates, via a

        mixture-handling loop of the heat-exchanger 1. A promoter 12 is
        provided in the heat-exchanger outlet nozzle, arranged in a
        spaceless relation thereto and being in fact a heating element
        having a well-developed surface and may be variously embodied. </p>

        element for heating the injected fuel downstream of an injection
        nozzle in the intake channel in order to avoid formation of fuel

        resistance by the heating elements. The plate heating element
        can be integrated in a flush and heat-insulating manner in the

        which a plate-like heating element arranged obliquely in the

        hence impairing the efficiency of the engine and polluting the
        environment. In this invention, liquid fuel is vaporized and
        combined with air to form an explosive mixture before
        introduction into the engine. In this design, ultrasonic
        technology is employed to atomize the fuel in the form of fine
        fuel mist. This mist is then injected into a specially designed
        heat exchanger, in which hot engine exhaust gas is brought in to
        cause this subspension of fuel mist to vaporize. Subsequently,
        this vaporized fuel combines with the intake air to form an
        explosive mixture. In this process, microcomputer technology is
        employed to control the precise air to fuel ratio of the mixture
        according to the degree of fuel vaporization and the demand of
        the engine operation. The fuel in this mixture is in a vaporous
        state; therefore utilization of the fuel is maximized. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A mechanical process for significantly
        improving the octane rating performance of gasoline powered
        engines (either conventional carburetion or fuel injection). An
        auxiliary system fractionates a precise portion of the required
        fuel and combines the fraction thus formed with a conventionally
        produced air/fuel mixture in states and proportions which
        optimize the combustion process. Different means of implementing
        the process are described utilizing an additional fuel
        controller which is connected to a fuel supply through an
        existing fuel pump which delivers fuel to both the fuel
        controller and an existing carburetion of fuel-injection system.
        Air for both is drawn through a common air filter. A
        proportioning system determines the proper amount of air and
        fuel entering the controller where they are mixed. The vapor
        fraction is enhanced and stabilized by passing the mixture
        through a heat exchanger. This vapor-rich mixture is then
        combined with the air/fuel mixture supplied by the existing
        system, and introduced into the engine's manifold. Precise
        control of the vapor fraction permits highly efficient

        the inlet end of the fuel passage, and an outlet passage leads
        to the main carburetor of the automobile. The casing also
        defines an exhaust passage therethrough, transversely of the

        maintained at 250.degree. F. to 260.degree. F. An electric
        crystal is used for breaking down the heavy ends of the fuel.
        The rate of flow of air to the main carburetor is varied for

      <p><b><i>Abstract </i>~</b> The invention relates to a method and
        system for increasing the output in terms of miles per gallon
        attainable by a conventional internal combustion engine. The
        improvement in m.p.g. is the result of a fuel vaporizer unit
        which utilizes engine collant and exhaust gases in heat exchange
        relationship to vaporize raw fuel. The gas vapors are collected
        within the vaporizer unit and then directed to the carburetor
        wherein it is united with air prior to entering the intake
        manifold. It has been found that running an engine on a mixture
        of gas vapors and air produces significantly improved mileage
        over that otherwise attainable. An additional advantage of the
        vaporizer unit is the resulting reduction of the amount of
        pollutants released into the atmosphere due to the complete and
        total combustion of all the vapors entering the combustion
        chambers. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> An internal combustion engine (1)
        includes a supplemental fuel passage (26, 27) which connects the
        carburetor (9) to the exhaust chest cover (28). A supplemental
        air inlet having a metering orifice (36) and passage (35)
        connects to the supplemental fuel passage. The resultant
        air-fuel mixture is heated before entry into the combustion
        chamber by passing the mixture through a heating passage (32)
        directly in front of the exhaust ports (13). When the engine is
        at idle with a completely closed throttle valve (19), the entire
        air-fuel supply for the engine is provided through the
        supplemental fuel and air passages and is heated in the heating
        passage prior to combustion. At increasingly open throttle,
        air-fuel is increasingly provided from the conventional primary
        carburetor output, with the heated air-fuel mixture being
        supplied in gradually decreasing amounts. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A method and apparatus for operating
        an electric ignition, internal combustion engine that
        substantially improves the fuel efficiency by utilizing heat
        normally discharged to the ambient to condition and prepare the
        fuel mixture prior to entry into the combustion chambers. The
        apparatus comprises a fuel vaporizer that transfers heat from
        the engine coolant system to the fuel mixture as it leaves a
        fuel introducing device such as a carburetor; a fuel mixture
        heater for heating the mixture above the vaporization
        temperature of the liquid fuel; and, a mixture homogenizer for
        thoroughly stirring the fuel mixture that is located in the fuel
        mixture flow path intermediate the vaporizer and heater. The
        homogenizer is operative to compress the fuel mixture under
        certain engine operating conditions and the heater forms the
        intake manifold for the engine and includes branch flow paths
        and associated conduits that communicate directly with each
        combustion chamber through a valve controlled port. The fuel
        mixture flow path from the homogenizer is constructed to
        minimize energy losses to the ambient. </p>

        water or exhaust gases. In order to prevent the film of fuel
        from being broken up before it has been heated and evaporated,
        which tends to happen owing to turbulence in the air stream
        caused by the choke valve 10, an inner tube 11 is provided. The

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A fuel vaporizer carburetor provides a
        continuous mixture of vaporized fuel and combustion air for
        operation of an internal combustion engine to meet the
        requirements of a wide range of engine operating conditions.
        Fuel vapor and combustion air undergo turbulent intermixing in
        an elongated mixing chamber. The mixing chamber is enclosed by a
        tubular wick of fiber mesh material which is saturated with fuel
        vapors and fuel condensate. The fuel vapors are generated by
        heating fuel in a float bowl which underlies the wick.
        Combustion air is admitted through a plurality of angularly
        spaced openings and is conducted through the porous flow passage
        provided by the tubular wick prior to entry into the mixing
        chamber. This arrangement produces a cyclonic, whirling movement
        which promotes intermixing of the combustion air and fuel
        vapors. Turbulence is induced at an intermediate point in the
        mixing chamber by a tapered sidewall housing section. The flow
        rate of the combustion air is limited by spring-loaded closure
        plates mounted over the inlet openings. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~ </b>A vortex fuel air mixer is positioned
        between the air throttle and the intake manifold of an engine.
        Part of the expansion flow velocity past the air throttle flows
        tangentially into the vortex chamber of the mixer, providing
        angular momentum which drives the flow into a vortical pattern.
        The flow streamlines within the vortical flow form into a
        generally irrotational flow pattern which swirls from the
        outside wall of the vortex chamber inwardly to a central vortex
        chamber outlet. This outlet feeds the engine intake manifold.
        Centrifugal forces in the swirling flow fling fuel droplets to
        the outside wall of the vortex chamber (in the manner of a
        cyclone scrubber). This liquid fuel must evaporate in order to
        leave the vortex chamber. The interaction of the evaporation,
        flow structure and turbulence relations inside the vortex
        chamber produces an essentially homogeneous mixture at the
        vortex chamber outlet. Fuel evaporation time in the vortex
        chamber is quite short, so that the device exhibits excellent
        transient response. </p>

        chamber 3 which is surrounded by a tubular wall 2 and delimited
        at its ends by a throttle valve 4 and a choke 5. The wall 2 is
        double-skinned with a water heating chamber 10 between the
        skins. In order to heat the wall 2 and prevent the condensation
        of liquid fuel upon it, water from a cooling water circuit of
        the engine to which the carburettor is fitted is circulated
        through the chamber 10 under the control of a thermally operated
        valve 21. Since the cooling water will no heat the carburettor
        until the engine itself has become heated, the carburettor is
        also provided with electrical heating for cold starting
        purposes. The chamber 10 is raised so that when the engine
        cooling water pump is not operating the chamber 10 is empty and
        the inside skin 9 of the wall 2 is made of electric resistance
        heating material. The supply of electric power to heat the skin
        9 is switched on by closing the ignition switch of the engine
        and it is subsequently automatically switched off by a
        temperature-sensitive switch 15 when the cooling water of the
        engine reaches a sufficiently high temperature to take over the
        heating of the carburettor. </p>

        tube assembly inclined to the horizon, an auxiliary fuel tank
        assembly at the upper end of the evaporator tube assembly, a
        mixer tube assembly at the lower portion of the evaporator tube
        assembly and an auxiliary water tank connected by a small water
        pipe to the upper portion of the evaporator tube assembly. The
        vaporific carburetor differs from the vaporizer carburetor in
        four different aspects. The first difference is in the cut at
        the outlet of the high speed tube, and the position of the cut
        with respect to the venturi. In the vaporizer carburetor the
        said cut is perpendicular to the wall of the venturi while in
        the vaporific carburetor the said cut is parallel with the wall
        of the venturi. The second difference is in the connection of
        the inlet of the idling speed tube. In the vaporizer carburetor
        the inlet of the idling speed tube is connected to the
        evaporator tube at a point below the air holes of the evaporator
        tube. In the vaporific carburetor the joint of the inlet of the
        idling speed tube to the evaporator tube is above the air holes
        of the evaporator tube. The third difference is in the position
        of the discharging portions of the two siphon tubes. In the

        are inside the evaporator tube. In the vaporific carburetor the
        discharing end of the idling speed siphon tube is inside the
        evaporator tube while the discharging end of the high speed
        siphon tube is outside the evaporator tube. The fourth
        difference is that the inlet of the idling speed siphon tube in
        the vaporizer carburetor is made of pure metal while in the
        vaporific carburetor the inlet of the idling speed siphon tube
        is lined with plastic or leather. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> A fuel-air mixture heating device is
        described which is interposed between a carburetor and an intake
        manifold so that completely vaporized fuel may be injected into
        the cylinders of the engine without adversely affecting the
        charging efficiency. The fuel-air mixture flowing from the
        carburetor to the intake manifold is forced to pass through a
        heating means where even low-volatile components of the fuel may
        be heated and completely vaporized, then through a flow
        controlling means for restricting the flow of the low-volatile
        components of the fuel close to the axis of the intake manifold
        while forcing the high-volatile components to flow off the axis,
        and finally through cooling means for cooling the fuel-air
        mixture before it is injected into the cylinder. </p>

      <p><b><i>Abstract</i> ~</b> An emission control system for an
        internal combustion engine, including a dual induction system
        adapted to provide to said engine a relatively low power
        fuel-air mixture and accomplishing thereby a substantially
        emission free exhaust, as pertains to the fuel alone. The dual
        induction system allows the engine piston speed and its
        associated crank shaft speed to be increased to a point beyond
        the known mechanically allowable limits of piston reciprocating
        (sliding) speed, to recover the potential engine power lost to
        the use of only the relatively low power mixture. The engine
        includes also, a roller crosshead assembly enabling the engine
        to operate indefinitely at such power and speed increases, and
        as limited by sources other than the crosshead alone. The dual
        induction system includes a cold-air intake system adapted to
        supply to the engine, all of the unheated air inducted by said
        engine, and a hot intake system supplying all of the fuel in a
        highly heated state and a small percentage of the total inducted
        air, equally as highly heated. The roller crosshead assembly
        includes a roller mounted upon the connecting rod wrist pin and
        a pair of opposed roller guideways supported in the engine
        cylinders by a cup-shaped guide member. The roller rolls upon
        the guideways, eliminating lateral axial movement of the piston
        upon the cylinders during its inward and outward movement, and
        permitting thereby, indefinitely long operating periods at the
        increased engine crank shaft and piston speeds. The roller
        crosshead assembly enables the engine lubricating oil to be
        excluded from the combustion portion of the engine's cylinders
        and thereby eliminating the exhaust emission arising from
        combustion and/or partial combustion of the oil during
        combustion of the fuel. </p>
