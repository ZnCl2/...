        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Louis Boutard</span>
          (1880-1958) is one of the French geniuses that we studied and
          continue to appreciate. The good thing is that such genius
          makes it easier to understand the ideas of Schauberger, and
          vice versa. If you know only one of them, the ideas can be
          hard to understand, and disturbing compared to our little
          ideas of what the world is. </p>
        <p>But as soon as you get ten or thirty such genius, their work,
          their understanding, and when you see that everything fit in a
          global unifying view, with the same strong understanding,
          although with different names and in different matters, then
          you are helped in your understanding of each one of them. </p>
        <p>Boutard's principal discoveries are the origin of
          electricity, origin of magnetism. He was able to create life
          (not to transform it in a twisted and mischevious way, as
          genetic does). He created organic life (totally different from
          organic matter which is not living at all) from inorganic, by
          Aether conduction...</p>

          shape of bludgeon), moving like a torpedo, bisexual

          field of the microscope at 300 diameters, whose study was
          undertaken by third parties apart from Mr. Boutard. </p>
        <p>By the direct action of this herculean protozoon on alfalfa
          (Stipa tenacissima, L.), it assimilates the parenchymas to be
          nourished and reproduce, immersed in tanks. Mr. Boutard solved
          the problem, until there considered as insoluble of the
          integral insulation of cellular fibres (sclarenchymes) of this
          graminaceous. A tonnage of alfalfa was thus disintegrated and
          the oakum could be spun of it on industrial trades with jute
          without preliminary modifications. </p>

            that the cycle of work of Mr. Louis Boutard extends well

            Conservation of Energy and its mode of application to the
            steeping of vegetal in order to extracting their cellulose,</span><br>

        <div align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
            either like textile fibres or with paper, or in very other
            form, and for very other use.</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
        </div>
        <br>
        The present invention relates to a new form of conservation of
        energy with metamorphoses of the embryonic protein materials of
        vegetal (cryptogams thallophytes non-bacterial, ptéridophytes
        and muscinées, phanérogames angiospermes and gymnospermes) in
        bactéroïds and bactériacées, with application, and mode of
        application with general operational method, of their useful
        work with the retting of all the vegetables: alfalfa ( Stipa
        tenac.), sparte ( Lygeum spartum ) cereal straws, and all other,
        for the integral extraction of their cellulose to the state of
        textile fibers and paper, or in all other form and for all other
        use.<br>
        <br>
        If, for the purpose of retting a plant, one considered up to now
        to be unrettable, to extract intact all textile fibres from
        them, one puts this one in the normal water of a retting pit, in
        the same conditions as other textile plants such as flax, hemp
        or jute, and that it there is left, for example, six months, one
        realizes at the end of this time that all the alfalfa remained
        intact in the same state; if one leaves it a longer time there
        still, it is still the same.<br>
        <br>
        If at the bottom of the retting pit, and at the same time as the
        alfalfa, one plunges some portions&nbsp; of an unspecified plant
        of the 3rd section, chicoracées or liguliflorous, all lactescent
        and bitter (magnesian), of the family composed of Urospermum
        Dalechampi, for example, one can note the three following
        phases, as in any vegetal organic decomposition: <br>
        <br>
        1. release of air bubbles of the organic cells; <br>
        <br>
        2. release, during 4 to 5 days, of carbonic gas of fermentation,
        acid or alcoholic, of glucoses, glucosides and other soluble
        materials in the water and capable of this fermentation; <br>
        <br>
        3. then hydrogen carbide outburst coming of the organic
        decomposition of the insoluble matters.<br>
        <br>
        On the surface of the water of the retting pit, which becomes
        more and more black, a film is formed which thickens in skin,
        that one can collect and wash, and whose wash water spreads the
        odor especally in the rivers when water is low.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of approximately three weeks, the alfalfa, removed
        from the water, is washed and smoothly expressed between two
        wood rollers, lets free a portion of its chlorophyl, and its
        strands, if contracted and twisted on itself, as hardened more
        and more obstinately closed still, while allowing one to see
        however, by the pressure on the levelled , two limbs tending to
        separate: upper and outer, wide plate with ribboned fibres very
        coated on the back with an insoluble varnish (cutin, cutin),
        covering and locking up (because it is rolled up so hard on
        itself) a low limb and, fact, inner, composed of multiple beams,
        parallel in length, as encrusted between them, of cellular
        fabric and vascular fabric, not less bound.<br>
        <br>
        This time, the alfalfa is attacked, especially that having
        bathed more close to surface of the retting water.<br>
        <br>
        Or, if instead of immersing at the same time as the alfalfa
        broken s or seeds of Urospermum Delechampi Desf., they are
        prepared separately, under the conditions, conventional from
        aseptic, by eliminating the soluble materials, either before or
        after their fermentation, one obtains some, at the end of 4
        days, a colorless liquid (the chlorophyl remaining intact),
        somewhat disordered, one small quantity; enseminated in the
        water of the retting pit with the alfalfa, under the conditions
        of the preceding experiment, gives a result entirely identical.<br>
        <br>
        If one operates in the same way with the other ones chicoracées:<br>

        the result is same and the more convincing still.<br>
        <br>
        Now, if one prepares separately, as it has just been said, of
        the ruffled s, of intact seeds or roughly broken, but not ground

        <br>
        and that one sows of it of a small quantity the water of the
        retting pit where the alfalfa already treated like above is
        hardened, the same phenomena is reproduced, and at the end of a
        variable time (3 weeks, for example), following the nature of
        the alfalfa, the temperature of the air and water, and the state
        of the light, the alfalfa, removed from water, washed and
        immediately expressed, lets run out its chlorophyl; the two
        limbs of its levelled&nbsp; separate easily...<br>
        <br>
        Or, if instead of the ferment of aforesaid leguminous plants,
        one prepares and one is useful oneself of that of the leguminous
        plants whose characteristic is food in the sandy grounds , such
        as Anthyllis vulneraria (yellow clover of sands ), Lupinus
        luteus, and numerous others, producing the same phenomena of
        fermentation, that the alfalfa, thus reprocessed, gives up a
        portion of its silica, which is eliminated, giving under the
        friction of the fingers true impression of friable sandstone, of
        stone-pounce or emery.<br>
        <br>
        It is the same, with a higher degree, if one prepares and one is
        useful oneself, as he is said above, of the broken leaves or
        seeds of monocotyledons called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">hammophiles</span>",
of











        which biological power of resistance, as well with the aridity
        and the hardness of the ground more inorganic as vegetal as to
        the météorological and atmospheric influences, is at least equal
        with that of the alfalfa, such as, among the graminaceous ones:
        Saccharum cylindricum, Lam. ; Sporobolus arenarius, Gouan =
        Spor. pungens Kunth, Ammophila arenaria Link, Arundo
        arenaria,&nbsp; ( Sand Rose, oyat, Gourbet ); Arthratherum
        pungens P.B., Aristida pungens Desf., ( of the sand dunes of the
        Sahara desert ); Ampelodesmis tenax Link., <br>
        <br>
        Cypress: Carex halleriana, Asso. (milkwood), Maximum Carex
        maxima Scop, Cyperus effusus Rottb., ( found in the Sahara ),
        Scirpus maritimus; and, the Jonces: Juncus acutus, J. maritimus
        Lam.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Consequently, vegetables the
          most effective for the proposed end, will have to thus be
          those of leguminous plants joining together of the two
          conditions: </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. to join to the general
          specific biological character leguminous plants: high content
          in protein material containing living calcium, the particular
          biological characters which follow: </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        a) <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">concealment











          [ ? recel ]</span>. by combination, alliance or otherwise, of
        proteic material containing <span style="font-weight: bold;">living











          magnesium</span>, as in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bitter










          chicory</span> and lactescents, --<br>
        <br>
        b) concealment [ ? recel ] of proteic material containing <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">living silicon</span>, as in the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">graminaceous ones with glutinous
          flour</span>; <br>
        <br>
        2. To have a power of biological resistance to that of the
        alfalfa.<br>
        <br>
        This is what is produced effectively by the action of the
        prepared ferments with arborescent or shrubby leguminous plants,
        or perennial, with linear or rush-like foliage (<span
          style="font-weight: bold;">genistoïde</span>), and <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">evergreen</span>, of maritime sands
        or the Sahara on silicious, calcareous, or magnesian soil : Ulex
        africanus Webb. (African Ajonc ); Spartium junceum, Genista
        Saharae Coss., Retama sphaerocarpa Boiss, Retama Retam Webb.,
        Acanthyllis tragacanthoides Pomel, Coronilla juncea, Acacia
        albida Willd.<br>
        <br>
        Also their ferments push very far the organic disintegration
        from the alfalfa, from which they exhaust nitrogen, but not all
        silica or exactly the bodies having for integral organizing
        principle the proteic material containing silicon, - and, like
        consequence, without the alfalfa being really steeped, it is
        without all its organism being disorganized, leaving free only
        single cellulose to the fibre state, since its shoddy strands
        miss flexibility, and that its upper limb remains strawy and
        glazed.<br>
        <br>
        Any vegetal organism can thus be entirely extracted of nitrogen
        by nitrogenous or putrid fermentation, and not be disaggregated.<br>
        <br>
        It is thus that nitrogenous or putrid said fermentation is not
        enough to cause and explain the disorganization or vegetal
        organic decomposition, and that this vague term is completely
        unsuitable and vague; - that there is at least, consequently, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">silicic fermentation, calcic
          fermentation, and magnesic fermentation</span>.<br>
        <br>
        It must consequently be enough to make act on the alfalfa
        dislocated in strands frayed, whose silicic bodies, which are
        brittle and without flexibility, remain unattacked, of the
        silicic biological agents coming from vegetables, such as the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">conifers</span>, endowed with a
        power of higher biological resistance to that with this one. And
        however it is nothing! If one - puts, in effect, a fermentin
        plant nearby, for example, Juniper oxycedrus macrocarpa Sibth et
        Sm., from sea sand, in the presence of this alfalfa, it is
        without sensible action... But the experience is not negative,
        for it furnishes the nitrogen with the ferment by the artificial
        mean of an ammoniac compound, it starts to act to mix and to
        assimilate the silicic matter of alfalfa.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">All decomposition or
          disoranization of&nbsp; oranic vegetables is thus nitrogenous,
          i.e. it is done with the favour and using nitrogen, - but not
          with its expense. Because the experiments which precede
          demonstrate:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          3a. - That all decomposition is due to the action of a
          bacteria attacking</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">, in
          search of food, which requires nitrogen, but which cannot
          reproduce at the expense of the same proteic matter at&nbsp;
          the principle of mineral and solar enery which is the
          principle of life to the same; </span><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">b) That, consequently, any
          decomposition is a biological controlling between a body or
          material in dynamic movement and another body or material of
          comparable nature physical and chemical that itself, and being
          either with the static state, or in dynamic movement,
          controlling in which the agent bacteric attack a body of
          comparable nature, and not of another, whether it assimilates
          or eliminates, provided that its vibrative capacity or
          biological energy is more intense, if not, it remains inert or
          dies without development.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        In other words, ferment coming of these vegetal having the
        capacity to assimilate, for example, silicic material of the
        ground or its vegetables,&nbsp; if its power of biological
        resistance or vibrative capacity is more intense than that of
        the other vegetable. In the same way, for the ferment of certain
        vegetables is able to assimilate either the calcic material, or
        magnesic material of the ground where it vegetates; and so on
        for all the other ferments and inorganic; That <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">there is, consequently, a
          nitrogenous silicic fermentation, like it there with a
          nitrogenous calcic fermention, a nitrogenous magnesic
          fermentation, and so on for all the other ferments.</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        2. a) That the silicic bacterial agent attacking, with more
        intense vibrative capacity, has the capacity to live and to
        reproduce at the expense of the attacked silicic material with
        less intense vibrative capacity, and not of another, but always
        with the necessary assistance of nitrogen; thus in the express
        condition that the vegetable with the attacked silicic material
        still conceals nitrogen, since b) the silicic agent bacteric
        attacking, not having the property to fix nitrogen of the
        atmospheric air directly, is inactive due to less ammoniacal
        food...<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the preceding experiments show that any pectic
        material or pectose, having an active silicic principle
        concreted in an insoluble sandstone, covered with a crust of
        other vascular bodies with vegetable protein; it follows from
        there that it is thus necessary, doubly necessary, to start by
        desilicification by retting with a biological discharge
        comparable with that on the sandstone. After what, nothing can
        resist more; any obstacle is broken: <br>
        <br>
        1 -- dissolved stony concretion, other bodies containing other
        principles: calcic and magnesic, not being more with covered
        under this true living sandstone gangue, are reached and
        attacked, assimilated or eliminated, bringing the dissociation
        or total disintegration of the organism; <br>
        <br>
        2 -- when so same the agent bacteric silicic attacker would
        exhaust all the nitrogen of vegetal attacked, no disadvantage,
        since the agents bacteric, calcic at least, which will succeed
        it, will have the capacity, in the absence of nonvolatile
        nitrogen in the vegetal one to steep, to provide itself some
        with themselves in addition by fixing that of the atmospheric
        air directly, just as fixed calcium i.e., directly when it is
        superheated to be carburized, just as it is easily fixed
        directly in vitro under certain conditions physical and
        chemical, just as it it fixed directly, it it protein material
        state, in all vegetal, the especially leguminous ones, at least
        at the time of flowering, and immediately for seed (the analogy
        is thus complete), content of vegetal of nitrogen being probably
        proportional, in general rule, with their biological calcium
        content. - whereas the reciprocal one is not possible, and that
        it would be necessary, in this case of the exhaustion of
        nitrogen, to artificially feed from it the silicic agent
        bacteric, of which any vital action stops by fault whereas it
        remain silica in the vegetal one to steep which is presented to
        him, where the limit of its development is thus the nitrogen and
        not not the silicic material; while the limit of the development
        of the calcic agent bacteric is the exhaustion of calcium, and
        not that of nitrogen of vegetal to steep, so that it ceases
        acting only when this vegetal is exhausted of its calcic
        material and not not of its nitrogen.<br>
        <br>
        It is thus necessary, of an absolute need, to undertake
        inversely any treatment to steeping having for final purpose the
        complete disorganization of the vegetal organism in order to
        extract single fibres from it from cellulose.<br>
        <br>
        And, indeed, if one begins again contrary the aforesaid
        experiments, their results confirm the examples given. And
        perfect steeping includes the following phases:<br>
        <br>
        1. Silicic Decrustation : a) Sowing of the retting pit with
        bactéria, aerobic or not, coming of seeds or broken s of
        conifers of the tribe of cupressinées, prepared as indicated
        above: <br>
        <br>
        Cupressus sempervirens (Cypress); Tetraclinis articulata Vahl.
        (Thuya); Juniperus oxycedrus (Cedar), Jun. communis, Jun.
        phoenicea, Jun. Sabina (Genevier); or from all other
        phanerogamete gymnospermes, for example:<br>
        <br>
        1. Gentacea : Ephedra fragilis Desf. (Uvette), Eph. Alenda
        Desf.;<br>
        <br>
        2. Cycadees; <br>
        <br>
        3.&nbsp; Abietin Conifers : Pinus maritima Lam., P. larix
        (Meleze), Cedrus atlantica Man., Abies numidica de Lannoy; --
        Taxinees: Taxus baccata; , also for example, among the
        phanerogamete angiosperms, the tamarisks: Tamarix articulata
        vahlm the famous Tamarisk of Prele in the sands of the Sahara.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of 5 to 10 days, following alfalfa, as well as the
        conditions of heat and light, this silicic steeping is
        completed. However it is advantageous to sow, a few days front
        this term, with a little ferment provided by the Cistines
        (helioscopics, a yellow flower): Helianthemum sessiliflorum
        Pers. = Cistus sessiliflorum Desf., from teh region of the
        Sahara; Helianthemum eremophilum Pomel., Fumana glutinosa Boiss.
        = Helianthemum glutinosum Pers.; Cistos monspeliensis, C.
        salviaefolius, C. ladaniferus, or the legumes, as listed here,
        for the purpose of saving time, and to perfect, by the immediate
        action of the calcic and magnesic agents in the desilicated
        members, and as of the first traces of their desilication, the
        elastic crack of the levelled&nbsp; from now on dislocated,<br>
        <br>
        b) After retting is finished, the fibers are immediately pressed
        between two rollers ( of wood, stone or metal), then washed
        under a thin stream of water, to remove the debris and
        chlorophyll, and the silicates and bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        The upper limbs of the alfalfa still adhere to its low limb, but
        its two edges, remained cutting and hard with the process of the
        inverse experimental method, are softened; it is not notched, it
        is not torn; its insoluble varnish has itself disappeared; the
        beams of fibres of its lower limbs remain smooth and intact
        parallel, and are not torn off: not only one is not broken. All
        of the alfalfa becomes flexible and soft.<br>
        <br>
        These general descriptions are confirmed by the facts of
        experiment, that if one sows the alfalfa to be steeped, instead
        of the ferments of aforesaid conifers; of a little ferment
        produced from: 1* Pinis maritimus ( maritime pine); 2* Erica
        arborea (briar heather) ; Quercus suber ( cork oak ); all three
        having silicaceous characteristics, the result is satisfactory,
        then it is operated with 1* Pinus alepensis ( Alep pine ), 2*
        Erica multiflora ( multiflowered heather ) , 3* Quercus ilex (
        holm oak, yew ), not less characteristic of lime soil, retting
        water takes a color of milk-lime, with little result.<br>
        <br>
        These given generalities are still so exact that one can obtain
        a result not less satisfying when one puts in an egg a ferment
        coming from vegetables where fluorine, which silicas cannot
        resist, is an integral part, although sometimes chemically
        undetectable in the biological principles of vegetables; as is
        the case for all the "hammophile" plants, as in the case of the
        Ash-thorn-bush, Fraxinus dimorpha Coss., found on the Saharan
        Atlas.<br>
        <br>
        The alfalfa is then ready with being immediately soaked in new
        water, if possible, for the 2nd steeping with calcic and
        magnesic fermentation, including also: <br>
        <br>
        a) Sowing with bacteria, aerobic or not, coming from the leaves
        or broken seeds of leguminous plants, preferably those whose
        principles of vegetative life are materials with energies at the
        same time silicic, calcic and magnesic, to lead to perfect
        completion of preparation of cellulose fibres. And such as these
        have much higher amounts: Ulex africanus Webb., etc.<br>
        <br>
        One can join the ferments of the already cited monocotyledonous
        plants to it: among the graminae, saccharum cylindricum Lam.,
        etc., which will eliminate of the last traces of silicic
        materials. The experiment confirms, the ferments of leguminous
        plants can be replaced by those coming of vegetables whose
        active vegetative principles come mainly from biological
        calcium; such as:<br>
        <br>
        I. Asclépiades (like leguminous plants. - Soja hispida, Moench,
        Phaseolus and Dolichus -- milky, fibrous, and voluminous:
        heliotropics): Cyanchum acutum, Daemia cordata, Rob. Brown.,
        Calotropis procera Willd., etc.<br>
        <br>
        2. Euphorbiacées (with milky juice, and helioscopic). -
        Euphorbia helioscopia, E. Peplis, E. Guyoniana Boiss, E. luteola
        Coss., E. paralias, etc.<br>
        <br>
        3. Plantagos : Plantago ciliata Desf., P. ovata Forskall, P.
        albicans, P. macrorhiza Poir., P. serraria, P. maritima, P.
        psyllium, etc.<br>
        <br>
        4. The Frankeniaciae -- Frankenia laevis, F. corymbosa Desf., F.
        pallida Boiss, F. thymifolia Desf., etc.<br>
        <br>
        It is possible to add, at the end of fermentation, ferments of
        chicoracea already enumerated , to soften fibre.<br>
        <br>
        b) Upon removal from the retting pit, give the plants an
        immediate soft pressing, as indicated above. The fibres of the
        low limbs separate in fine and smooth oakum, and the upper limbs
        are disintegrated, delivering whole cellulose, with high
        percentage, without waste by rupture. <br>
        <br>
        c) Tow : the fibre is exposed to the light, with shelter from
        burning sun. <br>
        <br>
        d) Lattice : easier by the conventional means, leaving a whitish
        thread, long like the leaves of alfalfa ( 50 to 60 cm. on
        average), resistant although flexible, unrottable, not very
        flammable, and comparable with the most beautiful flax, the
        thread of alfalfa not being other than the celebrated "byssus" [
        ? ] of antiguity, as it will be shown later.<br>
        <br>
        Refining and combing: one can, if it is wished, and following
        the uses for which the fibre can be intended, after or without
        soft pressing above, to carry out its refining by putting its
        oakum in a bath with a little ferment coming from toxic plants,
        and being able to resist a toxin secreted by the alfalfa in
        oakum, such as:<br>
        <br>
        Renonculacea: Clematis cirrhosa ( Viorne ), Ranunculus
        macrophysllus Desf., R. bullatus, R. flabellatus Desf., Ficaria
        grandiflora Rob., Delphinium Ajacis, D. orientale Gay, D.
        staphysagrria;<br>
        <br>
        Caryophyles : Agrostema githago, Gerzeau;<br>
        <br>
        Meliacea : Melia Azedarach;<br>
        <br>
        Zygophylae : Peganum harmala ( indigenous to the Sahara );<br>
        <br>
        Cucurbitae : Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. (Coloquinte ); Bryona
        dioica Jacq.;<br>
        <br>
        Apocynea : Nerium oleander (Rose laurel; <br>
        <br>
        Convolvulacea : Calystegia sepium, R. Brown ( Hedge Bindweed ),
        C. soldanella R. Brown.;<br>
        <br>
        Borraginea : Heliotropum europeum;<br>
        <br>
        Solanacea : Hyoscyamus niger, H. Falezlex Coss., Mandragora
        automnalis Spr.;<br>
        <br>
        Thymelacea : Thymelaea virgata Endl., T. nitida Desf., Th.
        microphylla Coss, T. tartonraira Al., Daphne cnidium;<br>
        <br>
        Santalacea : Osyris alba (Rouvet );<br>
        <br>
        Euphorbiacea ( Acalypheae ) : Mercurialis annua;<br>
        <br>
        Graminae : Lolum temulentum, L. (Ryegrass);<br>
        <br>
        Liliaceae : Scilla maritima; Pancratium maritimum;<br>
        <br>
        Iridaea : Iris junca Poir., I. acorus, L. psudo-acorus, I.
        fetidissima, etc.<br>
        <br>
        One can in the same way carry out a true biological combing of
        the oakum by subjecting it to the action ferments coming the
        crassulacea : Sedum altissimum Poir., Umbilicus pendulinus DC,
        living on granitic rocks; or of saxifragea : Saxifraga atlantica
        Boiss., for example.<br>
        <br>
        One can finally destroy the possible future action of the last
        traces of bactéria used in retting, and reinforce the strength
        of fibre at the same time, by plunging it a certain time in the
        extracts of Ombelliferae, of Crucifers, and of Labiae.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">When bacterial sowing is
          successful, its sure index of vitality is a fine film,
          vitreous and translucent for conifers, more opaque for
          leguminous plants, which is on the surface of the
          mother-liquor at the expense nitrogen (and it is a sure
          indicator of the nitrogen remaining in the vegetables one to
          steep, when it is agitated with silicic ferment), which has a
          double role of high importance:</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. That of a prism dissociating
          the light which it filters, to leave active passage only to
          the rays of red with yellow, especially with the yellow rays,
          which are most eminently favourable with the bacteric life,
          while the full white light is less favourable; and, of the
          same fact, it moderates the temperature of the retting water,
          which must be as tepid as possible, since this portion of the
          solar radiation is caloric, whereas the other one, of blue to
          purple, is anti-caloric. In practice, one supports the
          bacterial action by filtering the light with yellow
          transparencies, and also by taking care that the inner walls
          of the retting pit are not bright white; </span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. It defends all its bacteric
          life against external dangers by filtering all the atmospheric
          air necessary with this life, purified of all sporadic aerial
          germs which could attack it,</span> by being then opposed to
        the devastations of the dipteres, of Psychoda palustris Meig.,
        or trifasciata Latr., or oscellaris latr., attracted to the the
        retting ponds, producing the larvae which devastates the
        bacteria...<br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Thus, the given geologies make it possible to suppose that by
        induction alfalfa, graminaceae grown under the hardest
        climateric conditions, in spite of cold of winter reaching 10*,
        and summer heat exceeding 60*, under deadly solar radiation,
        exclusively in a silicaceous soil, calcareous and magnesian, at
        a high altitude, six months without water, <br>
        <br>
        was to have as biological radioactive principles, in addition to
        the iron common to all the vegetal ones, as well as potassium
        and sodium, calcium and magnesium, with silicon; and the
        experiment of its decomposition using the same principles of
        biological radiation coming from the protein materials of other
        plants (in general, voluble plants: heliotropic and helioscopic,
        fibrous and lactescent, and with yellow flowers), based on this
        induction, this one confirmed integrally, since it was enough to
        make attack the alfalfa by these vegetable protein materials
        and&nbsp; bring about total decomposition. And as one can,
        moreover, show by experiment and synthesis: 1* that it is iron
        in vibrative motion which is the librogene [ ? ] , 2* magnesium
        the co-fibrogene coagulant, 3* calcium the co-lactogene
        butyric-casein. 4* and silicon the pectogenic glutinant, it thus
        follows from there that these are the bodies which integrate
        organizing portions of silicon, calcium and magnesium, which it
        is necessary to eliminate by making them assimilate by their
        homologues with more intense dynamic capacity, in all vegetables
        from which one wants to release whole cellulose.<br>
        <br>
        Such are the fundamental costs of any total retting, breaking
        any resistance, the single one which is perfect, without loss
        nor waste, based on the single one of the scientific methods
        that it is possible to follow, all other steepings, more or less
        empirical, being defective. It is that indeed if there is care
        to renew slowly and lightly by the bottom the warmed water of
        the retting pit, whose overflow runs out by surface, the ideal
        steeping current is thus created, without the inherent
        disadvantages with rivers, since one chooses scientifically a
        single possible disorganizing agent of the vegetable organism,
        rather than all others, whereas in the river a multitude of
        agents of any nature is driven, more or less favourable, never
        the single required ones, in the middle of a crowd other clearly
        adverse or harmful, such as Chara fetida, Braun. which makes
        fibers break. And shown here at the same time is why certain
        rivers, rightly famous in this respect, have perfect steeping
        water, whereas the other ones do not steep : the countries which
        the powerful steeping rivers cross are wooded with conifers:
        wild genévriers, fir trees and pines, or of ashes with winged
        seeds; the plains have thousand leguminous plants, slight seeds
        with spangled brushes, sown by the winds in soft and moving
        water; and their water like their banks, each season cleaned
        carefully for the barges and towing, is always cleared of reeds.<br>
        <br>
        This is the single preferred scientific treatment to follow, not
        only for alfalfa, Ampelodesmos tenax, Link., or Chamaerops
        humiis, L. (dwarf Palm tree), but for all vegetables from which
        one wishes to extract cellulose either like textile fibres or
        with paper, or in every other form: flax, hemp, jute and ramie,
        etc...<br>

        </span>The present patent concerns two genres of improvement:<br>
        <br>
        1. In the mode of procreation and education of the bacterial
        ferments; <br>
        <br>
        2. In the method to be followed for their applicalion to retting
        of alfalfa and other vegetables, in order to extract cellulose
        from fibres, as well as albuminoid, tannic and glazing matters.<br>
        <br>
        Alfalfa, Stipa tenacissima, is for example a fibrous plant most
        difficult to ret, presenting problems in its crushing: the
        upper, outer limbs roll up (constituting the defensive
        resistance of the leaves ); consequently all the science of the
        retter will have to destroy this defense. Study and experiment
        show that this is constituted thus :<br>
        <br>
        1. A skin made up of two layers dependent on each other: <br>
        <br>
        a) a translucent outer varnish; <br>
        <br>
        b) strongly resistant cornea layer; <br>
        <br>
        2. A skin made up of two layers dependent one of the other one,
        of which : <br>
        <br>
        a) a very thin layer of lacquer,&nbsp; unshakeable and
        insoluble, which becomes deep yellow-gold with alkali, mainly
        calcic ones, and the aluminous ones, under the influence of
        which it tends to be reformed unceasingly at the expense of the
        underlying layer... ; that it covers, of the seven indissolubly
        joint patches whose is formed the upper limb; <br>
        <br>
        b) An oily horny leather <br>
        <br>
        3. A Hypoderme made of : <br>
        <br>
        a) pale yellow varnish; <br>
        <br>
        b) On straw assemblage.<br>
        <br>
        All the science of retting thus consists of attacking and
        destroying these three skins as follows :<br>
        <br>
        I. a) Outer varnish of the skin : by means of ferments coming
        from vegetables whose power of attack and resistance seems to
        have to be allotted to <span style="font-weight: bold;">bismuth</span>
        in a biological state, such as: :<br>
        <br>

be











        always considered in these three states: nascent, young, adult):<br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nascent :</span> In chemically
        and biologically pure water and slightly sweetened ( hydromel
        with 1% e.g.) either with the ordinary honey, or with a mixture
        of glucose and levulose like date sugar or very ripe grapes,
        reduced juice by cooking out of unfermented wort, ret ruffled s
        of the one of vegetal known indicated. (In general, gathered
        preferably in full sap in spring, then carefully dried with the
        shelter of the sun) <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Theory :</span> The energetic
        materials which tended to form the future ovum, always with acid
        reaction, always located (centripetal forces) at the center of
        the flower, on the one hand, and those which tended to form
        future pollen, with always sugar reaction, always located
        (centrifugal forces) at the circumference of the flower, on the
        other hand, and which, separated in the leaf in insulated cells
        by tight partitions, passionately tend to meet to fertilize
        itself: it with what they can arrive only in the flower and at
        the single moment of flowering, these materials, thus carrying
        involved in a little sweetened water, being linked by friction,
        will be fertilized then just like they would have done it with
        the solar light at the time of flowering to the more perfect
        state of pollen and seeding. Note the fine translucent film
        whose network will cover the sweetened water with a subtle veil
        hymen. The ferment thus does not preexist very formed in the
        leaf. <br>
        <br>
        Young : After four to five days, add a little vegetal mucilage,
        coming from marshmallow root ( Althea officinalis), flaxseed (
        Linum usitatissimum), seeds of quince ( cydonia vulgaris,
        Pers.), etc. <br>
        <br>
        Adult : About five days later, add a kind of peptone made up of
        finely grated horn or hoof of a ruminant with forked feet like
        the gazelle (Capra dorcas),&nbsp; previously revivified, in a
        syrup of honey or fruit juice (dates, raisins, etc.), of
        vegetable mucilage and of finely grated roots of Aroidea: Arum
        maculatum ( calf-foot), A. italicum Mill, Collocasia antiquorum
        Schott, reduced to the state of slurry by honey.<br>
        <br>
        After approximately five days, bacterial ferment being thus
        formed, sow the retting pit for the first attack: varnish of its
        skin.<br>
        <br>
        After four to five days of bath at the temperature from 20 to
        22* C, dry the alfalfa with sunlight.<br>
        <br>
        Then sow in another basin to attack --<br>
        <br>
        I. b)&nbsp; corneal layer of the epidermis. <br>
        <br>
        Preparation of the ferment:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: In a little honey water, crumpled leaves of vegetables
        of the family of Rhamneae : Rhamnus catharticus, Rh. oleoides,
        Rh. lycioides, etc.<br>
        <br>
        Young : vegetale mucilage<br>
        <br>
        Adult: Alfalfa, under the attack, releases nitrogen in
        abundance, it is above all necessary that the ferment
        assimilates this nitrogen; for this gives rise to toxins such as
        hydrogen cyanide, which is reduced to nothingness by the
        bacteria. Or, if one associates with the ferment a plant
        material generating hydrogen cyanide, this one then acquires the
        singular property to assimilate nitrogen in abundance, as a
        consequence of being able to resist. Therefore, out of milk of
        apricot cores ( Prunus armeniaca) in a syrup of honey or sweet
        fruit juice, of vegetal mucilage and starch reduced the state of
        slurry in the honey.<br>
        <br>
        One could also put together in the honeywater the nascent state
        leaves of Rhamnea and seeds or leaves of the Amygdalea
        generators of hydrogen cyanide But these last plant materials
        can be replaced, very preferably, in the slurry with the honey
        above, by finely grated shoes or horns of a ruminant with forked
        feet, such as the antelope<br>
        <br>
        After four to five days, the cornea layer disappeared; the
        surface of the leaf appears wrinkled. Wring the tow dry with
        heating. Then sow in a new basin to attack:<br>
        <br>
        II. a) The well-minced exudate lacquer of the skin<br>
        <br>
        derme, whose material generator is of comparable nature to that
        from hairs of alfalfa. Or, if one puts this material of the
        glume, , prepared in presence of this thin enamel layer, it
        destroys and assimilates it. A little of it is used like
        ferment.<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent : bays or glumelles of alfalfa flowers in honey water,
        or leaves of Quercus coccifera ( kermes oak ).<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile: vegetal mucilage.<br>
        <br>
        Adult: slurry of honey or sweet fruit juice of vegetal mucilage
        and barley flour ground with the glumelle adherent with the
        caryopse of this cereal.<br>
        <br>
        The organizing material of enamelled alfalfa also is very
        similar to that of the peel and the membrane. Covering the
        internal cavity with the nut shell,&nbsp; peel and membrane,
        especially with fresh matter, can be advantageous in the
        preparation of ferments.<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: Fresh nut peel of Juglans regia L., var. macrocarpa
        (gauge-nut ) in honey water.<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile : vegetable mucilage.<br>
        <br>
        Adult:&nbsp; Milk of peach kernel (Amygdalus persica, L.) in an
        honey slurry or barley flour and vegetal mucilage, ground
        together with fruit juice.<br>
        <br>
        One can use simply of the leaves of walnut tree or gauge-nut,
        and also of those of hazel nut ( Corylus avellana ).<br>
        <br>
        One could also combine, in the honey water of the nascent state,
        leaves of Juglandea and cores or leaves of Amygdalea (peach)
        generating hydrogen cyanide.<br>
        <br>
        After four or five days of bath, grind or calender the alfalfa.<br>
        <br>
        The product of disassimilation is an albuminoid which can be
        precipitated and collected like caseins.<br>
        <br>
        Low limb: It is advantageous to intercalate here the phase of
        disintegration of the seven fibre beams of the low limb of the
        leaf of alfalfa, agglomerated between them by biological cement
        of such nature that the vegetable gum resin generators of the
        genre ladanum or sandarac will provide leavens capable of
        assimilating this vegetable cement.<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: in honey water, crumpled leaves of Cistus creticus,
        Cistus ladaniferus, C. monspeliensis, C. sessiliflorus Desf. =
        Helianthemum sessiliflorum Pers. ( Cistinea ), Tetraclinis
        articulata Vahl. (thuja ), Cupresses sempervirens (cypress) [
        Cupressinea of Conifers ].<br>
        <br>
        Young : Vegetable mucilage ( gum araganth )<br>
        <br>
        Adult: Peptone of horn of goat (Capra hircus ) finely chopped (
        hoofs or horns ) in a syrup of honey or sweet fruit juice,
        vegetabl e mucilage and starch reduced to the state of slurry to
        the honey. After four or five days of bath, strong pressing. Dry
        with heat.<br>
        <br>
        II. b) Oily horn leather : biological materials generating
        citric acid and tannins are susceptible to attack. Particularly
        these vegetables of the family Aurantiacéae (citrus fruits) for
        the citric acid:<br>
        <br>
        Citrus aurantium, subsp. amara = C. bigardia Duham (bigaradier);
        <br>
        Citrus medica, subsp. will bajoura, Bonavia (citron tree); <br>
        Citrus medicà, L., subsp. limonum ( lemon )<br>
        Citrus medica, L., var. acida, Brandis (limettier).<br>
        <br>
        2. Of the family of Gupulifèrea for tannins:<br>
        <br>
        Quercus coccifera, Q. tinctoria&nbsp; ( quercitron ) meet these
        two conditions ideally, just like Tamarix articulata Vahl. (
        Shara tamarisk )<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: In honey water, mixture of crumbled leaves of
        bigaradier and oak (Q. pseudo-coccifera Desf.), which is the
        true evergreen oak of old and the vulgar current one, well
        distinguished by Desfontaines for Q. coccifera, and having
        biological properties different from the last, and very
        different from Q. ilex, improperly called evergreen oak in the
        literature, and that it is necessary to reject carefully for the
        treatment of the alfalfa, because of its calcium, which, in the
        biological state, tends to make reappear in golden yellow crust
        which covers and protects the entire plant.<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile : Mucilage of tannins from Cytinus hypocistis, or of
        quinces, etc, with pulverized gall-nut of oaks or of articulated
        tamarisk ( from the Algerian Sahara, punctured by an
        undetermined insect).<br>
        <br>
        Adult: One can prepare a kind of milk of almonds ( Amygdalus
        communis) with the cores of apricot, but the bitter almond tree
        presents a serious disadvantage, by its biological calcium, of
        reviving the yellow enamelled layer of derme. (For this reason,
        avoid the use of limestones).<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, peptone of finely grated calf hooves or bull horn in
        a syrup of honey or sweet fruit juice, of mucilage with tannin
        from Cytinus hypocistis and ordinary sweet chestnuts, reduced to
        a slurry with honey.<br>
        <br>
        Give a soft pressing after four to five days in the bath.<br>
        <br>
        The upper limb of alfalfa, open and flattened, present then the
        aspect of a marquetry with seven strawy patches.<br>
        <br>
        III. a) Pale yellow varnish of the hypodermis: The producing
        vegetable varnish biological materials are capable to destroy
        it:<br>
        <br>
        Pistacia terebinthus, var. a) vulgaris (terebinth), var. b)
        atlantica ( from the Atlas Mountains ), Pistachia lentiscus,
        Rhus toxicodendron, etc. (Terebinthacea), with which one can
        associate, to destroy the generating materials of acids citric
        and malic, those of vegetables producing them especially:<br>
        <br>
        Rosa canina, L. , Rosa sempervirens, L. (wild roses); Rubus
        fruticosus, L. (brambles), [Rosacées];<br>
        <br>
        Smilax aspera ( sasparilla [Smilaceae];<br>
        <br>
        Berberis hispanica Boiss (pine-vine) [Berbéridées].<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: In honey water, a mixture of crumbled leaves of Atlas
        pistachio tree and wild rose.<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile: Vegetable mucilage with tannin.<br>
        <br>
        Adult: Peptone of horn of sheep or ram (Ovis aries, L.) finely
        grated in syrup of honey or fruit juice, of mucilage and starch
        with tannin, in a slurry with honey.<br>
        <br>
        After four to five days of bath, soft pressing to leaving the
        basin. Of the seven strawy patches of the marquetry which is the
        upper limb of the alfalfa, that of the medium is separate into
        two, and the leaf is slotted; the six other ones (three on each
        side) are still assembled by an insoluble sandstone.<br>
        <br>
        The product of disassimilation is a yellowish varnish which one
        could extract by evaporation from the water-mother, washing of
        the residue with the alcohol, which dissolves varnish.<br>
        <br>
        III. b) Strawy hypoderme: The generating materials of malic acid
        and suberose acid are able to disaggregate it. Are especially
        under these conditions, for the malic acid, the vegetables of
        the tribe of Pomacea (Rosaceae):<br>
        <br>
        Malus acerbus, Mer. (sour apple tree);<br>
        <br>
        M. communis Lam., var renetia Durham ( pippin, russet), which is
        excellent when used in the raw state.<br>
        <br>
        Pirus communis ( wild pear );<br>
        <br>
        P. longipes Cosson, Sorbus torminalis Crantz, S. domestica,
        Crataegus oxycantha (hawthorn);<br>
        <br>
        Crataegus azarollus ;<br>
        <br>
        Cotoneaster Fontanesi Spach, etc.; of the family Suma of
        Terebinthacea:<br>
        <br>
        Rhus oxycantha Cav. ( hawthorn );<br>
        <br>
        Rhus pentaphylla Desf, ( five-leaf sumac); of the family
        Ampelidea ; Vitisvinifera savignon vine, free-climbing wild tall
        trees); and, for the suberose acid, the vegetables of the family
        of&nbsp; Cupuliferae: Quercus suber, Q. afares Pomel, or their
        hybrids: Quercus numidica, Trabut, Q. kabylica Trabut, etc.<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent : In honey water, a mixture of crumbled leaves of the
        two series of the above vegetables.<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile : Vegetal mucilage.<br>
        <br>
        Adult: Peptone of horn of ram (Ovis aries) or of Ovis&nbsp;
        musimon, Bonap., finely grated in a syrup of honey, vegetal
        mucilage and starch, reduced to a slurry in the honey.<br>
        <br>
        After four or five days, remove from the retting pit and give a
        soft pressing. The whole leaf is dislocated. Wring and dry&nbsp;
        with heat.<br>
        <br>
        For the horn of ram can be substituted the carapace of the
        tortoise, Testudo mauritanica, Emys orbicularis, Chelone viridis
        Schu. (sea-tortoise), Chelone imbricata (caret), Thalassochelys
        caouana Daud, and replace in the syrup, the ordinary starch with
        the entire tubercular root of Cyclamen europaeum, or Cyclamen
        africanum Boiss (Primulacea)<br>
        <br>
        It remains to divide the stalks, of fibres thus disaggregated,
        by means of leavens coming of various Quercus:<br>
        <br>
        Quercus sessiflora Smith , Q. Mirbeckii Dur., etc.<br>
        <br>
        Preparation:<br>
        <br>
        Nascent: In honey water, crumbled leaves of the one of these
        oaks.<br>
        <br>
        Juvenile: Vegetable mucilage.<br>
        <br>
        Adult: Peptone of horn of goat (Capra hircus, L.) or of ibex
        (Capra ibex, L.) finely grated in a syrup of honey or fruit
        juice, gum of mistletoe, and starchy mucilage of the orchis.<br>
        <br>
        Then to redivide the fibres by means of ferments coming from
        Leguminous plants: Genista Saharae, Coss., Retamaretam, Webb.,
        Calycotome spinosa Lam., Cytisus triflorus L'Her., Spartium
        junceum, Galega officinalis (lavender), Psoralea bituminosa,
        etc.<br>
        <br>
        and to refine them with Ervum ervilia, Lathyrus sativus, L.
        cicera , Medicago divers (lucerne), Trigonella faenum graecum (
        fenugreek) [Leguminous plants];<br>
        <br>
        Various plantains [ Plantaginea ]; Carex, Cyperus, Scirpus (
        rush ) ( Cyperacea ).<br>
        <br>
        Preparation: As for the gum above. One can refine them further
        by means of leavens coming from vegetables like:<br>
        <br>
        Rhamnus alaternus; R. frangula [Rhamnées]; Viburnum opulus [
        Caprifoliacea ]; jasminum fruticans ( wild jasmine) [ Olleacea
        ]; Osyris alba [ Santalacea ].<br>
        <br>
        Preparation: As above.<br>
        <br>
        Remarks. - I. Wild stocks: It is important to employ only the
        vegetal living one with the very wild state, and not those
        softened (weakened) by culture, vegetal which, with the
        morphologic appearances, can appear very similar, but whose
        biological properties are entirely dissimilar.<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        II. Law of the lesser-effort: It is important to work in the
        same retting pit, with vegetables of the same soil, of the same
        age and same season of harvest; if not, the ferments, following
        the universal and general law of the lesser effort, will
        preferably attack those offering less resistance, and the work,
        being unequal, will remain imperfect. <br>
        <br>
        III. Putridity: All these fermentations are by no means putrid.
        Substantially they all are odourless or not malodorous. The fact
        of being putrid comes only from one defective fermentation,
        coming itself of several causes, of which between other and
        especially:<br>
        <br>
        1. The bacterial agent attacker imposes on the attacked, who
        react with violence, often with toxins, so that the attacker
        perishes: or by faulty food. The molecule is divided into dregs
        which settle, and in nitrogenous grease which floats. The putrid
        odor comes then from these corpses of bacteria so attacked, but
        it cannot assimilate all the disaggregated substances, which
        spread a putrid odor if they are nitrogenous, or become toxins
        poisoning the attacker.<br>
        <br>
        3. Agents bacteric of kinds and species different between attack
        mutually lower succumb and become putrescent.<br>

        The purpose of this memoir is to indicate two new kinds of
        improvement:<br>
        <br>
        1. In the genesis&nbsp; of bacterial ferments; <br>
        <br>
        2. In the method of application to retting alfalfa ( Stipa
        tenacissima ), of Lygeum spartum, of Ampelodesmos tenax link.,

        Alfalfa,&nbsp; genesis of the attacking ferment: <br>
        <br>
        1. Nascent: in chemically and biologically pure water, and
        honey, or with a mixture of glucose and levulose like date
        juice, grapes, or jujubes, reduced by cooking to a syrup&nbsp;
        not prone to alcoholic fermentation, put young leaves; or&nbsp;
        branchlets with burgeons of Berberis vulgaris ( pine-vine), or
